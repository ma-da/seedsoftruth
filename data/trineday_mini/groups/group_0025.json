(a) it's intact and (b) they had not yet figured out how to fly it since they \"believed\" it could fly. **They made it clear to Wilson that \"they didn't know where it was from,\" although they had ideas about that, but that \"it was technology that was not of this Earth - not made by man - not by human hands.\"** **They also indicated this project had been continuing for \"years and year\" with \"agonizingly slow\" progress with \"little or no success.\" There was a \"painful lack of collaboration\" with the outside world and a very small number of cleared individuals - somewhere between 400 and 800.** Wilson asked some specific questions relating to UFO history such as Roswell, MJ-12 and others but got no answer from them. Wilson said he would complain up the chain of command about this and they said, go ahead, do what you feel you need to. It clearly didn't bother them. **The meeting broke up at that time. Wilson did complain to the Special Access Program Oversight Committee (SAPOC). and was told sorry, they were siding with the contractor so he was out of luck. He was to drop the matter immediately and forget about it. Once again, he got angry. Then they threatened his career. If he didn't comply, he wouldn't get the promotion to DIA Director, he would get an early retirement, and would probably lose one or two stars along the way.** In January 1998 Wilson spoke to Jacques Gansler (who died in December 2018), and who had recently been put in charge of the acquisitions and technology division. Wilson said to Davis that Gansler had been briefed by someone, which apparently surprised him. Davis asked, what did he say? Wilson's answer here is interesting for sure. \"UFOs are real, so-called alien abductions are not.\" Gansler then said to drop the matter. There was going to be no more discussion about it. That was essentially all of the notes, other than Davis asking Wilson if he would meet with Hal Puthoff, or Dr. Kit Green, and Wilson seemed to indicate probably not. Those are the basics of what is in these notes, and they are available for anyone to read now and I am sure they will be analyzed by many. This is an extremely important leak of information. It indicates strongly what many researchers have been arguing for a long time. That there is a deeply classified program existing within the labryinthian structure of the U.S. defense department system, hidden away from any meaningful oversight, studying at least one alien UFO.

It's important to note that these notes do not mention the recovery of alien bodies. Apparently Wilson wasn't told one way or the other about this. Information about alien bodies has come out from quite a few excellent sources, and a few of them have come to me over the years. But what we have here is a snapshot of an incredibly important program to study alien technology. It's interesting that, in this scenario, progress in understanding the tech had been painfully slow. That would surely seem to call into question some of the more spectacular claims of secret black budget progress. Stories like the Alien Reproduction Vehicle, for instance, to say nothing of some more incredible claims made by people over the years. It's not that some of these other claims are therefore invalidated by the Wilson documents. Ditto with the statement that UFOs are real but not alien abductions. What we know is that this was told to Wilson by someone who had been briefed. What we don't know is how truthful or accurate it was. Was Wilson told that abductions don't happen because that was considered even more sensitive? Just speculation, but the thing is to keep all these possibilities in mind. **What we have ultimately is a very powerful statement of a small group of people - Eric Davis, Hal Puthoff, Kit Green, Edgar Mitchell, and a few others no doubt - quietly working hard to learn as much as they could about the deep nature of the UFO coverup, and truly hitting paydirt with Admiral Wilson.** There is no use in denying the reality of the meeting between Davis and Wilson, and no use in assuming anything other than that Wilson was being completely truthful with Davis. The notes speak for themselves. It will be interesting to see how all this plays out. There's the UFO research community and those who follow that community, which is fairly small. I can guarantee you that that community will be incorporating this document into its big picture from now on. The real question is how this will affect the broader culture. **Right now we are moving in a very well-defined direction toward some form of disclosure on UFOs.

It's a fiction - a convenient fiction and may be useful for getting the word out to the mainstream - but a fiction nonetheless. **But these notes blow all that apart. Here we see true runaway secrecy. No oversight. Angry, upset military and government officials who frankly had a right to be upset. This signifies the existence of a truly secret world.** I've been arguing for years that if we want a healthy society we need to get on top of this. We need to recognize there is an enormous discrepancy between the official truth and what's really true. We need to stop lying to ourselves, and to allow ourselves to be lied to. It's not that there are no genuine causes for having secrecy in this world. I don't know many people who are that naive. But secrecy, especially long term secrecy of information that is of great transformative power - that kind of secrecy is a cancer to our societal well-being. It forces the established powers to continue to lie, over and over again, and it makes us learn not to trust our own judgment, our own senses when we see or learn something, or else it trains us to distrust our very establishment because we know they are lying to us. it's a bad place to be. it's not healthy for any society and it needs to stop. Lies can dominate a society for a long time but ultimately lies are exposed. Every lie has a finite life. Ultimately truth will always win. Having access to the truth doesn't ensure that we will fix all of our problems. That's never easy. But not having access to truth ensures we will never solve them, because we will never have access to the information we need in order to solve them. I know that the people involved in this leak are unhappy that it's out. But I would simply want to remind them that posterity ultimately is going to benefit. This needed to come out.

During a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., seven former Air Force officers once stationed at nuclear bases around the country said that not only have UFOs visited Air Force bases, some have succeeded in disabling nuclear missiles stationed there. \"I want the government to acknowledge that this phenomenon exists,\" said [Robert Salas](http://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown), a former U.S. Air Force Nuclear Launch Officer. **Salas said he doesn't think the UFOs he claims to have encountered had any offensive intent, but he believes they wanted to leave an impression.** **\"They wanted to shine a light on our nuclear weapons and just send us a message,\" he said. \"My interpretation is the message is get rid of them because it's going to mean our destruction.\"** Other former officers recounted similar stories of unexplained moving lights and odd-shaped flying objects during their time in the service.

The prominent astronomer J. Allen Hynek ... was recruited as Blue Book's scientific consultant and was indeed initially committed to explaining away flying saucers as natural phenomena or mistaken identifications. **Hynek, the former U.F.O. skeptic, eventually concluded that they were a real phenomenon in dire need of scientific attention,** with hundreds of cases in the Blue Book files still unexplained. Even many of the \"closed\" cases were resolved with ridiculous, often infuriating explanations, sometimes by Hynek himself. Blue Book compiled reports of 12,618 sightings of unidentified flying objects, of which 701 remain unexplained to this day. The mystery of the elusive flying objects is still [far from solved](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufocover-up). In 1947. Lt. General Nathan Twining ... sent a [secret memo](https://www.project1947.com/fig/twinng47.htm) on \"Flying Discs\" to the commanding general of the Army Air Forces at the Pentagon. Twining stated that \"the phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.\" Documents show the C.I.A. then devised a plan for a \"national policy,\" as to \"what should be told the public regarding the phenomenon, in order to minimize risk of panic.\" **The C.I.A. issued a secret report recommending a broad educational program for all intelligence agencies, with the aim of \"training and debunking.\" When Blue Book closed in late 1969, the Air Force flatly lied to the American people. ** **Note:** Explore the excellent, reliable resources provided in our [UFO Information Center](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufoinformation). **UFO Existence \"Proven Beyond Reasonable Doubt,\" Says Former Head of Pentagon Alien Program** **2017-12-24, *Newsweek*** [http://www.newsweek.com/ufo-existence-proven-beyond-reasonable-doubt-says-for...](http://www.newsweek.com/ufo-existence-proven-beyond-reasonable-doubt-says-former-head-pentagon-alien-758293) **The existence of UFOs had been", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufo-news.txt:1:f33cd399e1c2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15031, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufo-news.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufo-news", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "in order to minimize risk of panic.\" **The C.I.A. issued a secret report recommending a broad educational program for all intelligence agencies, with the aim of \"training and debunking.\" When Blue Book closed in late 1969, the Air Force flatly lied to the American people. ** **Note:** Explore the excellent, reliable resources provided in our [UFO Information Center](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufoinformation). **UFO Existence \"Proven Beyond Reasonable Doubt,\" Says Former Head of Pentagon Alien Program** **2017-12-24, *Newsweek*** [http://www.newsweek.com/ufo-existence-proven-beyond-reasonable-doubt-says-for...](http://www.newsweek.com/ufo-existence-proven-beyond-reasonable-doubt-says-former-head-pentagon-alien-758293) **The existence of UFOs had been \"proved beyond reasonable doubt,\" according the head of the secret Pentagon program that analyzed the mysterious aircrafts**. Luis Elizondo [said] of the sightings, \"In my opinion, if this was a court of law, we have reached the point of 'beyond reasonable doubt.' I think it's pretty clear this is not us, and it's not anyone else, so no one has to ask questions where they're from.\" Elizondo led the U.S. Defense Department's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, investigating evidence of UFOs and alien life, from 2007 to 2012, when it was shuttered. Its existence was first [reported by*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html) last week. Elizondo [said] that there had been \"lots\" of UFO sightings and witnesses interviewed during the program's five years. Investigators pinpointed geographical \"hot spots\" that were sometimes near nuclear facilities and power plants. They also observed trends among the aircrafts, including lack of flight surfaces on the objects and extreme maneuverability. \"There was never any display of hostility, but ... they maneuvered in ways no one else in the world had,\" he said. Despite Pentagon funding running out in 2012, Elizondo oversaw UFO work for another five years before resigning in October 2017 out of frustration with the secrecy of the investigations. He had pushed for videos of the possible alien sightings to be made public so people could see the footage. In his resignation letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Elizondo asked, \"Why aren't we spending more time and effort on this issue?\" **Note:** Elizondo is one of [several former government officials](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-fmr-manager-dod-aerospace-threat-program-ufos-real) now employed by To the Stars Academy for Arts and Sciences, which claims it will \"advance research into unexplained phenomena and develop related technology.\" This may be part of a planned roll out so that the public becomes more comfortable with the existence of UFOs.

The recently released footage shows a 2004 encounter between an apparent object, roughly the size of a commercial plane, and two Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets. Commander David Fravor and Lieutenant Commander Jim Slaight were on a routine training mission 100 miles out into the Pacific when they were asked to investigate the object.

News last Friday, former U.S. Senator Mike Gravel (D-Alaska) said statements by U.S. Air Force nuclear missile launch officers - regarding mysterious aerial objects interfering with the functionality of American ICBMs - make clear that top government officials are lying to the public when they claim to have no knowledge of national security-related UFO incidents. Gravel first gained national recognition in 1971, by placing the still-classified Pentagon Papers - which documented U.S. government malfeasance during the Vietnam War - into the public record. **Gravel said the revelations by former/retired [Captains Robert Salas](http://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown), Bruce Fenstermacher, and David Schindele, as well as retired Security Policeman Sgt. David Scott, are \"the smoking gun of the whole issue\" of government secrecy on UFOs.** On September 27, 2010, Captain Salas co-hosted the \"UFOs and Nukes\" press conference with noted researcher Robert Hastings, during which seven USAF veterans revealed ongoing UFO activity at U.S. nuclear weapons sites during the Cold War era. That media event was extensively and favorably covered by hundreds of news organizations worldwide, including CNN, which streamed the proceedings live.

Reports of three-foot-tall aliens? Secret memos about suspicious objects recovered near Roswell, N.M.? They're all included in the thousands of declassified government documents posted to the FBI's new online \"Vault.\" Among the so-called \"X-files\" are once-classified reports dating back to the 1940s and 1950s detailing Air Force investigations into \"flying discs\" and the \"bodies of human shape\" discovered inside them. In one report from March 1950, Guy Hottel, a special agent with the FBI, said he received information from an Air Force investigator about flying saucers found in New Mexico.** \"They were described as being circular in shape with raised centers, approximately 50-feet in diameter,\" he wrote. \"Each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape but only 3 feet tall, dressed in a metallic cloth of a very fine texture. **Each body was bandaged in a manner very similar to the blackout suits used by speed flyers and test pilots.\" The informant, whose name is redacted in the file, said he thought the saucer was spotted in New Mexico because a high-powered government radar in the area interfered with the saucer's controlling mechanism. Other reports once marked \"restricted\" and \"confidential\" detail sightings of mysterious flashing lights and other \"unidentified aerial objects.\" **Note:** You can view the declassified memorandum described above on the FBI website at [this link](http://vault.fbi.gov/hottel_guy/Guy%20Hottel%20Part%201%20of%201/view).

The latest batch of UFO files released from the Ministry of Defence to the National Archives shows that, in 1957, the committee received reports detailing an average of one UFO sighting a week. The files also include an account of a wartime meeting attended by Winston Churchill in which, it is claimed, the prime minister was so concerned about a reported encounter between a UFO and RAF bombers, that he ordered it be kept secret for at least 50 years to prevent \"mass panic\". Nick Pope, who used to investigate UFO sightings for the MoD, said: \"The interesting thing is that most of the UFO files from that period have been destroyed. But what happened is that **a scientist whose grandfather was one of his [Churchill's] bodyguards, said look, Churchill and Eisenhower got together to cover up this phenomenal UFO sighting, that was witnessed by an RAF crew on their way back from a bombing raid.

He was at Malstrom Air Force Base in 1967, where there were claims that a UFO caused missiles to malfunction. SALAS: I was on duty as a missile launch officer. First, I get one call saying that they're seeing strange lights flying in the sky. About five minutes later ... the flight security controller calls down and says he's looking at a glowing red object, very large, hovering over the front gate. Within seconds of that call, my missiles start shutting down. I recall losing all 10 of them. KING: Bob Jamison you were there too, right? JAMISON: My job as a target officer was to bring them back up. KING: Is it possible they just malfunctioned? JAMISON: Very rarely does a missile malfunction. Much more rare would be two at the same time. But never ten. DR. BOB JACOBS: I was in charge of optical instrumentation at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Our job was to photograph ... every missile launch. [One day] we photographed an Atlas missile raising up out of the fog cover. The next day I was called into the office. Major Mansmann [turned on] the projector. I recognized it as the film that we had shot ... the previous day. Toward the end of the flight ... everything was flying along and suddenly ... at about 8,000 miles an hour, an object came into the frame, shot a beam of light at the warhead, flew up to the top, shot another beam of light at the warhead ... and then flew out the same way it came in. **Major Mansmann said ... were you guys screwing around up there? I said, no, sir. And he said then tell me what that was. And I said we got a UFO. And he said, lieutenant, you are never to speak of this again.

Several pilots offered dramatic accounts of witnessing UFOs - including a transparent flying disc and a triangular craft with mysterious markings.** \"We want the US government to stop perpetuating the myth that all UFOs can be explained away in down-to-earth, conventional terms,\" said [Fife Symington](http://www.wanttoknow.info/ufosnewsarticles-0-10000#article_1350), [a] former governor of Arizona and air force pilot who says he saw a UFO in 1997. \"Our country needs to reopen its official investigation that it shut down in 1969,\" Symington said. \"Nothing in my training prepared me for what we were witnessing,\" said [James Penniston](https://web.archive.org/web/20130307112123/http://www.therendleshamforestincident.com/Sgt_8ORX.html), a retired US Air Force pilot, as he described seeing and touching a UFO when he was stationed at a British air base in Woodbridge. He said he saw an inexplicable triangular craft in a clearing in the woods with \"blue and yellow lights swirling around the exterior\". The UFO was \"warm to the touch and felt like metal,\" Penniston said. One side of the craft had pictorial symbols. Then after 45 minutes, the light from the object \"began to intensify\" and it then \"shot off at an unbelievable speed\" before 80 Air Force personnel, he said. \"In my logbook, I wrote 'speed: impossible'.\" A former official with the Federal Aviation Administration, [John Callahan](http://www.wanttoknow.info/ufocover-up10pg#callahan), said government agencies discourage inquiries into UFOs. \"'Who believes in UFOs?' is the kind of attitude of the FAA all the time,\" he said. \"However, when I asked the CIA person: 'What do you think it was,' he responded 'a UFO'.\" When Callahan suggested the government tell Americans about [the] UFO, the CIA official allegedly told him: \"'No way, if we were to tell the American public there are UFOs they would panic.\"' **Note: **For an abundance of reliable, verifiable information and resources suggesting a UFO cover-up, [click here](http://www.wanttoknow.info/ufoinformation). **Now you see it, now you don't** **1978-10-01, U.S. National Security Agency Website** [http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/ufo/now_you_see.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20090307082804/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/ufo/now_you_see.pdf) It had been an entirely routine night watch for the Imperial Iranian Air Force's command post in the Tehran area [when] in quick succession, four calls arrived ... reporting a series of strange airborne objects.

A senior officer ... immediately scrambled an IIAF F-4 to investigate. The F-4 pilot reported that the brilliant object was easily visible 70 miles away. When approximately 25 NM [nautical miles] distant, the interceptor lost all instrumentation and UHF/Intercom communications. Upon breaking off the intercept and turning towards his home base, all systems returned to normal, as if the strange object no longer regarded the aircraft as a threat. A second F-4 was scrambled ten minutes after the first. Upon reaching the 25 NM point, the object began rapidly moving away to maintain a constant separation distance. Visually, it resembled flashing strobe lights arranged in a rectangular pattern and alternating blue, green, red, and orange. Their sequence was so fast that all colors could be seen at once. **As the F-4 continued pursuit south of Tehran, a second brightly-lit object (about one-half to one-third the size of the moon) detached from the original UFO and headed straight for the F-4 at a high rate of speed. The pilot attempted to fire an AIM-9 missile at the new object but was prevented by a sudden power loss in his weapons control panel.** UHF and internal communications were simultaneously lost. The pilot promptly initiated a turn and negative G dive to escape. Continuing the turn, the pilot observed the second object turn inside of him and then away, subsequently returning to the primary UFO for a perfect rendezvous. **Note:** This official report by U.S. Air Force Captain Henry Shields, taken from the NSA website at the link above, raises many questions.

Mitchell grew up in Roswell, New Mexico, which some UFO believers maintain was the site of a UFO crash in 1947. He said residents of his hometown \"had been hushed and told not to talk about their experience by military authorities. And being a local boy and having been to the moon, they considered me reliable enough to whisper in my ear their particular story.\" Roughly 10 years ago, Mitchell claimed, he was finally given an appointment at Pentagon to discuss what he had been told. **An unnamed admiral working for the Joint Chiefs of Staff promised to uncover the truth behind the Roswell story, Mitchell said. The stories of a UFO crash \"were confirmed,\" but the admiral was then denied access when he \"tried to get into the inner workings of that process.\" The same admiral, Mitchell claimed, now denies the story.** \"I urge those who are doubtful: Read the books, read the lore, start to understand what has really been going on. Because there really is no doubt we are being visited,\" he said. \"The universe that we live in is much more wondrous, exciting, complex and far-reaching than we were ever able to know up to this point in time.\" **Note:** Astronaut Mitchell has spoken openly of this in the media numerous times in the past.

What is it that you just saw? Note that the Sun is not known to have any clouds, so what are those cloud-looking objects? And what is the more solid-looking object that then appears out of the \"clouds\"? If you look at it without any mental filters, it looks like the edge of some sort of large, unidentified object which is creating a link to the Sun, and then drawing the Sun's energy up into it. Yet could this actually be? Most readers will likely think that is impossible. If you research Sun activity, you will see that this cannot possibly be a solar flare, as they generally [last only a few seconds to an hour](http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/sftheory/flare.htm). The [longest solar flare ever recorded](http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/484/2/920/fulltext/35280.text.html) was 22 hours and 48 minutes. Yet the funnel-looking object in these videos lasts well over 48 hours. **Another possibility that has been put forward within the realms of current scientific understanding is that this is some sort of solar prominence.** According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_prominence), \"A prominence is a large, bright feature extending outward from the Sun's surface, often in a loop shape.\" These forms can exist for hours, days, and even months, though scientists are still studying how and why they are formed. This would be the most logical explanation and is what most who have [scientifically investigated](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/14/solar-flare-ufo-nasa-refueling_n_1344188.html) the above event have concluded. Yet there are questions about this explanation. If you look at the hundreds of images of solar prominences [available here](https://www.google.com/search?q=solar%20prominence&oe=utf-8&biw=1146&bih=653&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=kaSDT_DUGoPciQKVtrHtBQ), you will find exceedingly few that look anything like this phenomenon (other than images of this particular event). And a funnel retaining its shape for days is far outside of normal for a solar prominence, though some claim it might be what's called a \"filament channel.\" Yet look at [these images](https://www.google.com/search?um=1&hl=en&biw=1146&bih=677&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=%22filament+channel%22+solar&oq=%22filament+channel%22+solar&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_l=img.12...17328l18093l0l19517l6l6l0l5l0l0l118l118l0j1l1l0.frgbld.) and [videos](http://www.youtube.com/results?um=1&hl=en&biw=1146&bih=677&q=%22filament%20channel%22%20solar&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=v1) of filament channels. Not very convincing. Another strange anomaly can be seen in the one-minute video covering 15 days above. Notice that the Sun there is clearly rotating while the cloud-like object is stationary relative the SDO and Earth. The strange object hardly moves at all while Sun's surface rotates. If you watch the many videos of solar prominences [available here](http://www.youtube.com/results?q=solar%20prominence&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=w1), you will see that they move in relation", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufo_sun_nasa_video.txt:1:4d16f0a43f82", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15049, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufo_sun_nasa_video.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufo_sun_nasa_video", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "called a \"filament channel.\" Yet look at [these images](https://www.google.com/search?um=1&hl=en&biw=1146&bih=677&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=%22filament+channel%22+solar&oq=%22filament+channel%22+solar&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_l=img.12...17328l18093l0l19517l6l6l0l5l0l0l118l118l0j1l1l0.frgbld.) and [videos](http://www.youtube.com/results?um=1&hl=en&biw=1146&bih=677&q=%22filament%20channel%22%20solar&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=v1) of filament channels.

They are not stable relative to the camera, as this object is. The beautiful one-minute video below of the full Sun for 28 days further demonstrates this. **Full Sun over 28 days in one minute video** If the video doesn't start in a few moments, you need to [Get the Flash Player](http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer) to watch this video. The above video covers the 28 days at the Sun from March 1 - 28, 2012. The event in question, though small, is visible in the lower left corner around 20 to 24 seconds into the video. Notice how everything happening on the Sun moves along with its rotation, except for this one strange event. And then there is the question of why the large object which appears attached to the end of the funnel so suddenly (in relative terms) seems to take off from the Sun and disappear into space, leaving a wake on the Sun's surface. Watch the 12 hours over which the object departs below. **Strange object's departure over 12 hours (40 second video)** If the video doesn't start in a few moments, you need to [Get the Flash Player](http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer) to watch this video. Notice what appears to be the effluent of the object in the above video. With normal solar flares and prominences, once the substance is ejected from the Sun, it is subject to the intense gravity of the Sun, so that it first decelerates as it is shot upward, then rapidly accelerates as it falls back to the Sun. See [this video](http://news.discovery.com/videos/space-sdo-captures-eruptions-on-sun.html) for an example. Yet both the strange object and some of its effluent in the above video slowly accelerate *away* from the Sun, picking up speed at the end. How do you explain that? For another event on May 25, 2012 in which a similar object to that above blocks a filament ejected from the sun, watch the 2 1/2 minute video at [this link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgs4QUNzZfI&). What kind of object could both connect with a filament as in the first videos above and then block a filament like in this video? **Could it be a UFO?** **Most scientists believe that all advanced life forms must be carbon and water based.

Yet is this really a reasonable belief?** Why would there be only one way for life to be formed? How do we know that there might not be many different ways life can exist in this physical reality? Is it not possible that life might come into being in a very different way at extremely low or high temperatures? Is it conceivable that there might be life forms that exist only in a gaseous state? Could there be plasma-based life forms that might even have developed advanced civilizations? Some people believe that the entire planet Earth and our Sun are sentient beings that have a life of their own. Who knows? And who knows what the above solar event really was? Maybe it was just a very strange solar prominence. Yet then again, maybe it was some sort of plasma-based, other-worldly craft or being which occasionally visits the Sun to recharge its energy stores. Or could it be something entirely different all together? Life and the universe are filled with strange mysteries. Let us keep an open mind and not come to rigid conclusions too quickly on such matters.

Enjoy, and feel free to speculate and even let your mind run wild, if not just for the fun of it.

In this remarkable article, the CIA chief stated, \"Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.\" That was not the first, nor the last time the *Times* had an article suggesting that UFOs might be real. Yet the vast majority of articles on UFOs by the *Times* and most other major media over the years have ridiculed those who believe in them. As one example, in describing my whistleblowing activities related to an internationally watched terrorism trial, the lead sentence in a [front page article on the*Wall Street Journal*](https://www.wanttoknow.info/050226fredburkswsj) in 2005 began with \"Frederick Burks believes in UFOs,\" as a way of discrediting my court testimony.

Why is it that we are only now being led to believe that UFOs and ETs might be more fact than fiction?

[Leslie Kean](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-podesta-pulling-back_b_6717872.html) wrote the Times 2010 best-seller [\"U.F.O.s: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials Go On the Record.\"](http://cdn.survivingdeathkean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Book-Reviews-3-pages-Leslie.pdf) Ralph Blumenthal has written about U.F.O.s for [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/05/americans-alien-abduction-science) as well as [The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/science/ufo-sightings-book.html?module=inline). So, despite the embellishments, we were interested to discover parallels between the TV version and the historical and current reality. [[*Read the 2017 Times report on the Pentagon's secret U.F.O. program.*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html?module=inline)] The History series predictably sensationalizes and overdramatizes case investigations and the historical figures involved, adding many story elements that simply never happened. It's already hard enough for those trying to understand the truth about government involvement with U.F.O.s without mixing fact and fiction. Nonetheless, melodrama aside, the real story is there: **Project Blue Book was the code name for an Air Force program set up in 1952, after numerous U.F.O. sightings during the Cold War era, to explain away or debunk as many reports as possible in order to mitigate possible panic and shield the public from a genuine national security problem: an apparently technological phenomenon that was beyond human control and was not Russian, yet represented an unfathomable potential threat.** The central character of the TV series, the prominent astronomer J. Allen Hynek, played by Aidan Gillen, was recruited as Blue Book's scientific consultant and was indeed initially committed to explaining away flying saucers as natural phenomena or mistaken identifications. But he gradually realized that the bizarre objects were real and needed further scientific attention. (Though he never saw a supposed alien creature floating in a tank or crashed in a plane while recreating a reported U.F.O. dogfight, as depicted in the series.) **While Hynek was involved, Blue Book compiled reports of 12,618 sightings of unidentified flying objects, of which 701 remain unexplained to this day.** But what's most important to study during that era is what occurred *outside* Project Blue Book, to the extent that it has been revealed. When [we reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/insider/secret-pentagon-ufo-program.html?module=inline) on the Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which began in 2007, we offered a glimpse into a similar scenario today: military cases being investigated and filmed without the public knowing.

This time, however, there was no public agency to accommodate reports of incidents, even when hundreds of witnesses were involved. We learned through documents from the Pentagon program, and from interviews with participants, that the mystery of the elusive flying objects [is still far from solved](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/unidentified-flying-object-navy.html?module=inline), and that not enough was being done to address that problem almost 50 years since the close of Blue Book. It all began in 1947. Lt. General Nathan Twining, the commander of Air Materiel Command, sent a [secret memo](https://www.project1947.com/fig/twinng47.htm) on \"Flying Discs\" to the commanding general of the Army Air Forces at the Pentagon. Twining stated that \"the phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.\" The silent, disc-like objects demonstrated \"extreme rates of climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and motion which must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar.\" A new project, code-named \"Sign,\" based at Wright Field (now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) outside Dayton, Ohio, was given the mandate to collect U.F.O. reports and assess whether the phenomenon was a threat to national security. With Russia ruled out as the source, the staff wrote a top secret \"Estimate of the Situation,\" concluding that, based on the evidence, U.F.O.s most likely had an interplanetary origin. According to government officials at the time, the estimate was rejected by General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Air Force chief of staff. From then on, the proponents of the off-planet hypothesis lost ground, with Vandenberg and others insisting that conventional explanations be found. **Project Sign eventually evolved into Project Blue Book, with the aim of convincing the public that flying saucers could be explained.** **Yet behind the scenes, authorities grappled with something sobering: well-documented U.F.O. encounters involved multiple trained observers, radar data, photographs, marks on the ground and physical effects on airplanes.** In 1952, the office of Maj. Gen. John Samford, the Air Force director of intelligence, briefed the F.B.I., saying it was \"not entirely impossible that the objects sighted may possibly be ships from another planet such as Mars,\" according to government documents. Air Intelligence had largely ruled out an earthly source, the F.B.I. memo reported. National defense concerns were mounting as well. After Air Force planes scrambled to intercept brilliant objects seen and picked up on radar over Washington in 1952, [Samford called a news conference](https://www.youtube.com/embed/tcRtkA1Rmvw) to calm the country. He announced that between 1,000 and 2,000 reports had been analyzed and that most had been explained. \"However,\" he conceded, a certain percentage \"have been made by credible observers of relatively incredible things.

It is this group of observations that we now are attempting to resolve.\" He said no conclusions had been drawn, but played down any \"conceivable threat\" to the United States. Later that year, however, H. Marshall Chadwell, the assistant director of scientific intelligence for the C.I.A., concluded in a memo to the C.I.A. director, Walter Bedell Smith, that \"sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles.\" By 1953, authorities were concerned that communication channels were becoming dangerously clogged by hundreds of U.F.O. reports. Even false alarms could be perilous, defense agencies worried, since the Soviets might take advantage of the situation by simulating or staging a U.F.O. wave and then attack. **Documents show the C.I.A. then devised a plan for a \"national policy,\" as to \"what should be told the public regarding the phenomenon, in order to minimize risk of panic.\"** **After a closed-door session with a scientific advisory panel chaired by H.P. Robertson from the California Institute of Technology, the C.I.A. issued a secret report recommending a broad educational program for all intelligence agencies, with the aim of \"training and debunking.**\" Training meant more public education on how to identify known objects in the sky. \"The use of true cases showing first the 'mystery' and then the 'explanation' would be forceful,\" the report said. Debunking \"would be accomplished by mass media such as television, motion pictures, and popular articles.\" That plan involved using psychologists, advertising experts, amateur astronomers and even Disney cartoons to create propaganda to reduce public interest. And civilian U.F.O. groups should be \"watched,\" the report stated, because of their \"great influence on mass thinking if widespread sightings should occur.\" The Robertson Panel Report was classified until 1975, five years after Blue Book was shut down. But its legacy endures in the aura of ridicule surrounding U.F.O. reports, inhibiting scientific progress. \"The implication in the Panel Report was that U.F.O.s were a nonsense (nonscience) matter, to be debunked at all costs,\" Hynek wrote. \"It made the subject of U.F.O.s scientifically unrespectable.\" [**Hynek**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JstYxDjdXaQ)**, the former U.F.O. skeptic, eventually concluded that they were a real phenomenon in dire need of scientific attention, with hundreds of cases in the Blue Book files still unexplained.

Even many of the \"closed\" cases were resolved with ridiculous, often infuriating explanations, sometimes by Hynek himself.** **\"The entire Blue Book operation was a foul-up based on the categorical premise that the incredible things reported could not possibly have any basis in fact,\" he wrote in the 1970s, when he was finally free to speak the truth.** **When Blue Book closed in late 1969, the Air Force flatly lied to the American people, issuing a fact sheet claiming that no U.F.O. had ever been a threat to national security**; that U.F.O.s did not represent \"technological developments or principles beyond the range of present day scientific knowledge\"; and that there was no evidence that they were \"extraterrestrial vehicles.\" (Just a few years earlier, in 1967, a glowing red oval-shaped object hovered over Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, and all 10 of the facility's underground nuclear missiles became disabled almost simultaneously while the U.F.O. was present, according to [interviews with witnesses and official government reports](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown). Technicians could find no conventional explanation.) **But whatever the Air Force told the public, it didn't actually stop investigating U.F.O.s.** A once-classified memo, issued secretly in October 1969, a few months before the termination of Blue Book, revealed that regulations were already in place to investigate U.F.O. reports that were \"not part of the Blue Book system.\" The memo, written by Carroll H. Bolender, an Air Force brigadier general, went on to say that \"reports of U.F.O.s which could affect national security would continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedures designed for this purpose.\" Clearly, government agencies continued to have some level of involvement in U.F.O. investigations in the decades following - and to the present. Despite government statements to the contrary, once-secret official documents include detailed reports of dramatic U.F.O. events abroad. Many cases at home were not investigated, including [a 2006 event](https://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/ct-redeye-xpm-2013-03-20-37880251-story.html) in which a disc-shaped object hovered over O'Hare Airport for more than five minutes and shot straight up through the clouds at an incredible speed. Our reporting in 2017, which led to briefings for members of Congressional committees, showed that not much has changed since the close of Project Blue Book.

Greer took the lectern at the National Press Club, in Washington, D.C., in pursuit of the truth about unidentified flying objects. Greer, an emergency-room physician in Virginia and an outspoken ufologist, believed that the government had long withheld from the American people its familiarity with alien visitations. He had founded the Disclosure Project in 1993 in an attempt to penetrate the sanctums of conspiracy. Greer's reckoning that day featured some twenty speakers. He provided, in support of his claims, a four-hundred-and-ninety-two-page dossier called the \"Disclosure Project Briefing Document.\" For public officials too busy to absorb such a vast tract of suppressed knowledge, Greer had prepared a ninety-five-page \"Executive Summary of the Disclosure Project Briefing Document.\" After some throat-clearing, **the \"Executive Summary\" began with \"A Brief Summary,\" which included a series of bullet points outlining what amounted to the greatest secret in human history.** **Over several decades, according to Greer, untold numbers of alien craft had been observed in our planet's airspace; they were able to reach extreme velocities with no visible means of lift or propulsion, and to perform stunning maneuvers at g-forces that would turn a human pilot to soup**. Some of these extraterrestrial spaceships had been \"downed, retrieved and studied since at least the 1940s and possibly as early as the 1930s.\" Efforts to reverse engineer such extraordinary machines had led to \"significant technological breakthroughs in energy generation.\" These operations had mostly been classified as \"cosmic top secret,\" a tier of clearance \"thirty-eight levels\" above that typically granted to the Commander-in-Chief. Why, Greer asked, had such transformative technologies been hidden for", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:0:55d17c242d1a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15059, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "that would turn a human pilot to soup**. Some of these extraterrestrial spaceships had been \"downed, retrieved and studied since at least the 1940s and possibly as early as the 1930s.\" Efforts to reverse engineer such extraordinary machines had led to \"significant technological breakthroughs in energy generation.\" These operations had mostly been classified as \"cosmic top secret,\" a tier of clearance \"thirty-eight levels\" above that typically granted to the Commander-in-Chief. Why, Greer asked, had such transformative technologies been hidden for so long? This was obvious. The \"social, economic and geo-political order of the world\" was at stake. **The idea that aliens had frequented our planet had been circulating among ufologists since the postwar years**, when a Polish émigré, George Adamski, claimed to have rendezvoused with a race of kindly, Nordic-looking Venusians who were disturbed by the domestic and interplanetary effects of nuclear-bomb tests. In the summer of 1947, an alien spaceship was said to have crashed near Roswell, New Mexico. Conspiracy theorists believed that vaguely anthropomorphic bodies had been recovered there, and that the crash debris had been entrusted to private military contractors, who raced to unlock alien hardware before the Russians could. (Documents unearthed after the fall of the Soviet Union suggested that the anxiety about an arms race supercharged by alien technology was mutual.) **All of this, ufologists claimed, had been covered up by Majestic 12, a clandestine, para-governmental organization convened under executive order by President Truman.** President Kennedy was assassinated because he planned to level with Premier Khrushchev; Kennedy had confided in Marilyn Monroe, thereby sealing her fate. **Representative Steven Schiff, of New Mexico, spent years trying to get to the bottom of the Roswell incident, only to die of \"cancer.\"** Greer's \"Executive Summary\" was woolly, but discerning readers could find within it answers to many of the most frequently asked questions about [U.F.O.s](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/aliens)-assuming, as Greer did, that U.F.O.s are helmed by extraterrestrials. Why are they so elusive? Because the aliens are monitoring us. Why? Because they are discomfited by our aspiration to \"weaponize space.\" Have we shot at them? Yes. Should we shoot at them? No. Really? Yes. Why not?** They're friendly. How do we know? \"Obviously, any civilization capable of routine interstellar travel could terminate our civilization in a nanosecond, if that was their intent. **That we are still breathing the free air of Earth is abundant testimony to the non-hostile nature of these ET civilizations.\" At the press conference, Greer appeared in thin-framed glasses, a baggy, funereal suit, and a red tie askew in a starched collar. \"I know many in the media would like to talk about 'little green men,' \" he said. \"But, in reality, the subject is laughed at because it is so serious. I have had grown men weep, who are in the Pentagon, who are members of Congress, and who have said to me, 'What are we going to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:1:4e383b60564f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15060, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "civilizations.\" At the press conference, Greer appeared in thin-framed glasses, a baggy, funereal suit, and a red tie askew in a starched collar. \"I know many in the media would like to talk about 'little green men,' \" he said. \"But, in reality, the subject is laughed at because it is so serious. I have had grown men weep, who are in the Pentagon, who are members of Congress, and who have said to me, 'What are we going to do?' Here is what we will do. We will see that this matter is properly disclosed.\" Among the other speakers was Clifford Stone, a retired Army sergeant, who purported to have visited crash sites and seen aliens, both dead and alive. Stone said that he had catalogued fifty-seven species, many of them humanoid. \"You have individuals that look very much like you and myself, that could walk among us and you wouldn't even notice the difference,\" he said. **Leslie Kean, an independent investigative journalist and a novice U.F.O. researcher who had worked with Greer, watched the proceedings with unease. She had recently published an article in the Boston *Globe* about a new omnibus of compelling evidence concerning U.F.O.s,** and she couldn't understand why a speaker would make an unsupported assertion about alien cadavers when he could be talking about hard data. To Kean, the corpus of genuinely baffling reports deserved scientific scrutiny, regardless of how you felt about aliens. \"There were some good people at that conference, but some of them were making outrageous, grandiose claims,\" Kean told me. \"I knew then that I had to walk away.\" **Greer had hoped that members of the media would cover the event, and they did, with frolicsome derision. **He also hoped that Congress would hold hearings. By all accounts, it did not. Ufologists have perpetual faith in the imminence of Disclosure, a term of art for the government's rapturous confession of its profound U.F.O. knowledge. In the years after the press conference, the expected announcement was apparently postponed by the events of September 11th, the War on Terror, and the financial crisis. In 2009, Greer issued a \"Special Presidential Briefing for President Barack Obama,\" in which he claimed that the inaction of Obama's predecessors had \"led to an unacknowledged crisis that will be the greatest of your Presidency.\" Obama's response remains unknown, but in 2011 ufologists filed two petitions with the White House, to which the Office of Science and Technology Policy responded that it could find no evidence to suggest that any \"extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.\" The government may not have been in regular touch with exotic civilizations, but it had been keeping something from its citizens.** By 2017, Kean was the author of a best-selling U.F.O. book and was known for what she has termed, borrowing from the political scientist Alexander Wendt,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:2:3f9166b2018d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15061, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "House, to which the Office of Science and Technology Policy responded that it could find no evidence to suggest that any \"extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.\" The government may not have been in regular touch with exotic civilizations, but it had been keeping something from its citizens.** By 2017, Kean was the author of a best-selling U.F.O. book and was known for what she has termed, borrowing from the political scientist Alexander Wendt, a \"militantly agnostic\" approach to the phenomenon. On December 16th of that year, in a front-page story in the *Times*, Kean, together with two *Times* journalists, revealed that the Pentagon had been running a surreptitious U.F.O. program for ten years. **The article included two videos, recorded by the Navy, of what were being described in official channels as \"unidentified aerial phenomena,\" or U.A.P. In blogs and on podcasts, ufologists began referring to \"December, 2017\" as shorthand for the moment the taboo began to lift. Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host, has often mentioned the article, praising Kean's work as having precipitated a cultural shift. \"It's a dangerous subject for someone, because you're open to ridicule,\" he said, in an episode this spring. But now \"you could say, 'Listen, this is not something to be mocked anymore-there's something to this.' \" **Since then, high-level officials have publicly conceded their bewilderment about U.A.P. without shame or apology.** Last July, Senator Marco Rubio, the former acting chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, spoke on CBS News about mysterious flying objects in restricted airspace. \"We don't know what it is,\" he said, \"and it isn't ours.\" In December, in a video interview with the economist Tyler Cowen, the former C.I.A. director [John Brennan](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/john-brennan) admitted, somewhat tortuously, that he didn't quite know what to think: \"Some of the phenomena we're going to be seeing continues to be unexplained and might, in fact, be some type of phenomenon that is the result of something that we don't yet understand and that could involve some type of activity that some might say constitutes a different form of life.\" **Last summer, David Norquist, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, announced the formal existence of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force. **The 2021 Intelligence Authorization Act, signed this past December, stipulated that the government had a hundred and eighty days to gather and analyze data from disparate agencies. Its report is expected in June. **In a recent interview with Fox News, John Ratcliffe, the former director of National Intelligence, emphasized that the issue was no longer to be taken lightly. \"When we talk about sightings,\" he said, \"we are talking about objects that have been seen by Navy or Air Force pilots, or have been picked up by satellite imagery, that frankly engage in actions that are difficult to explain, movements that are hard to replicate, that we don't", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:3:f42a9a3ad7bb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15062, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "report is expected in June. **In a recent interview with Fox News, John Ratcliffe, the former director of National Intelligence, emphasized that the issue was no longer to be taken lightly. \"When we talk about sightings,\" he said, \"we are talking about objects that have been seen by Navy or Air Force pilots, or have been picked up by satellite imagery, that frankly engage in actions that are difficult to explain, movements that are hard to replicate, that we don't have the technology for, or are travelling at speeds that exceed the sound barrier without a sonic boom.\"** Leslie Kean is a self-possessed woman with a sensible demeanor and a nimbus of curly graying hair. She lives alone in a light-filled corner apartment near the northern extreme of Manhattan, where, on the wall behind her desk, there is a framed black-and-white image that looks like a sonogram of a Frisbee. The photograph was given to her, along with chain-of-custody documentation, by contacts in the Costa Rican government; in her estimation, it is the finest image of a U.F.O. ever made public. The first time I visited, she wore a black blazer over a T-shirt advertising \"The Phenomenon,\" a documentary from 2020 with strikingly high production values in a genre known for grainy footage of dubious provenance. Kean is stubborn but unassuming, and she tends to speak of the impact of \"the *Times* story,\" and the new cycle of U.F.O. attention it has inaugurated, as if she had not been its principal instigator. She told me, \"When the New York *Times* story came out, there was this sense of 'This is what the U.F.O. people have wanted forever.' \" Kean is always assiduously polite toward the \"U.F.O. people,\" although she stands apart from the ufological mainstream. **\"It's not necessarily that what Greer was saying was wrong-maybe there have been visits by extraterrestrials since 1947,\" she said. \"It's that you have to be strategic about what you say to be taken seriously. You don't put out someone talking about alien bodies, even if it might be true. **Nobody was ready for that; they didn't even know that U.F.O.s were real.\" Kean is certain that U.F.O.s are real. Everything else-what they are, why they're here, why they never alight on the White House lawn-is speculation. Kean feels most at home in the borderlands between the paranormal and the scientific; her latest project examines the controversial scholarship on the possibility of consciousness after death. Until recently, she dreaded the inevitable dinner-party moment when other guests asked about her line of work and she had to mumble something about U.F.O.s. \"Then they'd sort of giggle,\" she said, \"and I would have to say, 'There's actually a lot of serious information.' \" Her blunt, understated way of talking about incomprehensible data gives her an air of probity.

During my visit, as she peered at her extensive library of canonical ufology texts-with such titles as \"Extraterrestrial Contact\" and \"Above Top Secret\"-she sighed and said, \"Unfortunately, most of these aren't very good.\" **In her best-selling book, \"[UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record](https://www.amazon.com/UFOs-Generals-Pilots-Government-Officials/dp/0307717089?ots=1&slotNum=0&imprToken=86bcf131-d758-c9c4-639&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50),\" published in 2010 by an imprint of Random House, Kean wrote that \"the U.S. government routinely ignores UFOs and, when pressed, issues false explanations. Its indifference and/or dismissals are irresponsible, disrespectful to credible, often expert witnesses, and potentially dangerous.\"** Her book is a sweeping reminder that this was not always the case. In the decades after the Second World War, about half of all Americans, including many in power, accepted U.F.O.s as a matter of course. Kean sees herself as a custodian of this lost history. In her apartment, a tranquil space decorated with a Burmese Buddha and bowls of pearlescent seashells, Kean sat down on the floor, opened her file cabinets, and disappeared into a drift of declassified memos, barely legible teletypes, and yellowing copies of *The* *Saturday Evening Post* and the *Times Magazine* featuring flying-saucer covers and long, serious treatments of the phenomenon. Kean grew up in New York City, a descendant of one of the nation's oldest political dynasties. Her grandfather Robert Winthrop Kean served ten terms in Congress; he traced his ancestry, on his father's side, to John Kean, a South Carolina delegate to the Continental Congress, and, on his mother's, to John Winthrop, one of the Puritan founders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. She speaks of her family's legacy in rather abstract terms, except when discussing the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, her grandfather's great-grandfather, whom she regards as an inspiration. **Her uncle is Thomas Kean, who served two terms as New Jersey's governor and went on to chair the 9/11 Commission.** Kean attended the Spence School and went to college at Bard. She has a modest family income, and spent her early adult years as a \"spiritual seeker.\" After helping to found a Zen center in upstate New York, she worked as a photographer at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. In the late nineteen-nineties, after a visit to Burma to interview political prisoners, she stumbled into a career in investigative journalism. She took a job at KPFA, a radio station in Berkeley, as a producer and on-air host for \"Flashpoints,\" a left-wing drive-time news program, where she covered wrongful convictions, the death penalty, and other criminal-justice issues.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:5:607fdc0e4c60", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15064, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "seeker.\" After helping to found a Zen center in upstate New York, she worked as a photographer at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

In 1999, a journalist friend in Paris sent her a ninety-page report by a dozen retired French generals, scientists, and space experts, titled \"Les OVNI et la Défense: À Quoi Doit-On Se Préparer?\"-\"U.F.O.s and Defense: For What Must We Prepare Ourselves?\" The authors, a group known as *cometa*, had analyzed numerous U.F.O. reports, along with the associated radar and photographic evidence. Objects observed at close range by military and commercial pilots seemed to defy the laws of physics; the authors noted their \"easily supersonic speed with no sonic boom\" and \"electromagnetic effects that interfere with the operation of nearby radio or electrical apparatus.\" The vast majority of the sightings could be traced to meteorological or earthly origins, or could not be studied, owing to paltry evidence, but a small percentage of them appeared to involve, as the report put it, \"completely unknown flying machines with exceptional performances that are guided by a natural or artificial intelligence.\" *cometa* had resolved, through the process of elimination, that \"the extraterrestrial hypothesis\" was the most logical explanation. **Kean had read Whitley Strieber's \"[Communion](https://www.amazon.com/Communion-True-Story-Whitley-Strieber/dp/0061474185?ots=1&slotNum=1&imprToken=86bcf131-d758-c9c4-639&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50),\" the 1987 cult best-seller about alien abduction, but until receiving the French findings she had never had more than a mild interest in U.F.O.s.** \"I had spent years at KPFA reporting on the horrors of the world, injustice and oppression, and giving voice to the voiceless,\" she recalled. As she acquainted herself with the plenitude of odd episodes, it was as if she'd seen beyond our own dismal reality and the limitations of conventional thinking, and caught a glimpse of an enchanted cosmos. \"To me, this just transcended the endless struggle of human beings,\" she told me, during a long walk around her neighborhood. \"It was a planetary concern.\" She stopped in the middle of the street. Gesturing toward a heavily overcast sky, she said, \"Why should we assume we already understand everything there is to know, in our infancy here on this planet?\" An editor of the Boston *Globe's* Focus section, who had admired Kean's writing on Burma, tentatively agreed to work with her on a story about U.F.O.s. Kean chose not to discuss it with her KPFA colleagues, apprehensive that they would consider the topic, at best, frivolous.

Blumrich, a *nasa* engineer, argued that the prophet's heavenly vision of wheels within wheels was an encounter not with God but with an alien spaceship.** In \"[The UFO Controversy in America](https://www.amazon.com/Ufo-Controversy-America-David-Jacobs/dp/0253190061?ots=1&slotNum=3&imprToken=86bcf131-d758-c9c4-639&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50)\" (1975), David Jacobs wrote about a series of \"airship\" sightings across the country in 1896 and 1897. Spaceships, in our descriptions, have always displayed capabilities just beyond our technological horizon, and with our own wartime advances they grew staggeringly impressive. It's generally agreed that the modern U.F.O. era began on June 24, 1947, when a private aviator named Kenneth Arnold, while flying a CallAir A-2, saw a loose formation of nine undulating objects near Mt. Rainier. They had the shape of boomerangs or tailless manta rays, and in his estimation they moved at two to three times the speed of sound. He described their motion as that of a \"saucer skipped over water.\" A newspaper headline conjured \"flying saucers.\" By the end of the year, at least eight hundred and fifty similar domestic sightings had been reported, according to one independent U.F.O. investigator. Meanwhile, scientists asserted that flying saucers didn't exist because they *couldn't* exist. The *Times* quoted Gordon Atwater, an astronomer at the Hayden Planetarium, who attributed the flurry of reports to a combination of a \"mild case of meteorological jitters\" and \"mass hypnosis.\" **Within government circles, the issue of how seriously to take what they renamed \"unidentified flying objects\" provoked a deep conflict. By September of 1947, incoming reports of sightings had become too profuse for the Air Force to ignore. That month, in a classified communiqué, Lieutenant General Nathan F. Twining advised the commanding general of the armed forces that \"the phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.\" ** The \"Twining memo,\" which has since gained ecclesiastical stature among ufologists, articulated concerns that some foreign rival-say, the Soviet Union-had made an unimaginable technological breakthrough, and it initiated a classified study, Project Sign, to investigate. Its officials were evenly split between those who thought that the \"flying discs\" were of plausibly \"interplanetary\" origin and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:7:77874018cae1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15066, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "Lieutenant General Nathan F.

Its officials were evenly split between those who thought that the \"flying discs\" were of plausibly \"interplanetary\" origin and those who chalked up the sightings to rampant misperception. On the one hand, according to a memo, **a full twenty per cent of U.F.O. reports lacked ordinary explanations.** On the other hand, there was no dispositive evidence-the wreckage of a crashed saucer, perhaps-and, as a scientist at the *rand* Corporation reasoned, interstellar travel was simply infeasible. But unaccountable things kept happening. In 1948, about a year after the Arnold sighting, two pilots in an Eastern Airlines DC-3 saw a large, cigar-shaped light speed toward them at a tremendous velocity before making an impossibly abrupt turn and vanishing into a clear sky. A pilot in a second plane, and a few witnesses on the ground, gave compatible accounts. It was the first time that a U.F.O. had been observed at close range: the two pilots described seeing a row of windows as it streaked past. Project Sign investigators filed a top-secret \"Estimate of the Situation\" memorandum, which leaned in favor of the extraterrestrial hypothesis. But, opponents argued, if they were here, wouldn't they have notified us? **In July, 1952, such a formal notification seemed to nearly occur, when an armada of U.F.O.s reportedly violated restricted airspace over the White House. The *Times* headline resembled something out of a [Philip K. Dick](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/08/20/blows-against-the-empire) novel: \"*flying objects near washington spotted by both pilots and radar: air force reveals reports of something, perhaps 'saucers,' traveling slowly but jumping up and down*.\"** The Air Force, playing down the incident, told the newspaper that no defensive measures had been taken, although it subsequently emerged that the military had scrambled jets to intercept the trespassers. Major General John Samford, the Air Force's director of intelligence, held the largest press conference since the end of the Second World War. Samford, who had the grave mien of a lawman in a John Ford movie, squinted as he referred to \"a certain percentage of this volume of reports that have been made by credible observers of relatively incredible things.\" The following January, the C.I.A. secretly convened an advisory group of experts, led by Howard P. Robertson, a mathematical physicist from Caltech. The \"Robertson panel\" determined not that we were being visited by U.F.O.s but that we were being inundated with too many U.F.O. reports.

This was a real problem: if notices of genuine incursions over U.S. territory could be lost in a maelstrom of kooky hallucination, there could be grave consequences for national security-for instance, Soviet spy planes could operate with impunity. The Cold War made it crucial that the U.S. government be perceived to have full control over its airspace. To stem the flood of reports, the panel recommended that \"the national security agencies take immediate steps to strip the Unidentified Flying Objects of the special status they have been given and the aura of mystery they have unfortunately acquired.\" **It also suggested that civilian U.F.O. groups be infiltrated and monitored, and enlisted the media in the debunking effort.** The campaign culminated in a 1966 TV special, \"UFO: Friend, Foe or Fantasy?,\" in which the CBS anchorman [Walter Cronkite](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/09/seeing-it-now) patiently consigned U.F.O.s to the oblivion of the third category. **Not all members of the military were content with this stance. Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, the first director of the C.I.A., told a *Times* reporter, \"Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.\"** [See this *New York Time*s article at [this link](https://www.wanttoknow.info/600228nytimes)] The government maintained one public repository for U.F.O. reports: Project Blue Book, a continuation of Project Sign, which operated out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton, Ohio. Blue Book was a meagrely funded division run by a series of low-ranking officers who would have preferred any other billet. The program's only continuous presence, and its only in-house scientist, was an Ohio State astronomer named J. Allen Hynek, a U.F.O. skeptic and a former member of the Robertson panel. Initially, Hynek assumed a \"commonsense\" approach; as he later wrote, \"I felt the lack of 'hard' evidence justified the practical 'it just can't be' attitude.\" Ninety-five per cent of supposed U.F.O.s really did have a garden-variety derivation: uncommon clouds, weather balloons, atmospheric temperature inversions. Luminous orbs were attributable to Venus; silent triangles could be connected to classified military technology. (The U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird were often reported as U.F.O.s, a confusion embraced by the counterintelligence community, which was eager to keep these projects secret.) But the remaining five per cent, despite the government's best efforts, could not be neatly resolved. **Hynek, to his surprise, developed sympathy for the people who saw U.F.O.s; they were much more likely to be respectable, embarrassed citizens than cranks, hoaxsters, and \"U.F.O. buffs.\"** **Still, he was expected to do", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:9:9c14c20cd5f0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15068, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "military technology.

Beginning on March 14, 1966, more than a hundred witnesses in and around Dexter, Michigan, reported seeing glowing lights and large football shapes at low altitudes. Hynek arrived to discover a community in a state of \"near hysteria.\" At a press conference on March 25th, under pressure to avert panic, Hynek attributed some of the sights to the moon and the stars and others to the spontaneous combustion of decomposing vegetation, or \"swamp gas.\" The people of Michigan took this as an affront.** (\"Swamp gas\" became a common ufological metonym for the government's patronizing obfuscation.) Gerald Ford, a native of Grand Rapids and at the time the House Minority Leader, called for congressional hearings, \"in the firm belief that the American public deserves a better explanation than thus far given by the Air Force.\" In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Hynek recommended that an independent body be set up to evaluate the merits of Project Blue Book and finally settle the question of U.F.O. legitimacy. In seventeen years, Blue Book had reviewed approximately twelve thousand cases; seven hundred and one of them remained unexplained. In late 1966, Edward U. Condon, a physicist at the University of Colorado, was given three hundred thousand dollars to conduct such a study. The project was plagued by infighting, especially after the discovery of a memo written by a coördinator noting that a truly disinterested approach would have to allow for the fact that U.F.O.s might exist. That was out of the question-their behavior was not commensurable with our understanding of universal laws. The associated scientists, the coördinator proposed, should stress to their colleagues that they were primarily interested in the psychological and social circumstances of U.F.O. believers. In other words, sightings should be understood as metaphors-for Cold War anxiety or ambivalence about technology. The thousand-page \"Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects,\" or the Condon Report, as it became known, was completed in the late fall of 1968. **Of the ninety-one Blue Book cases selected for examination, thirty of them remained official mysteries.** In a \"puzzling and unusual\" incident in 1956, a preternaturally fast object was recorded on multiple radars near a U.S. Air Force base in England. One of Condon's researchers wrote that \"the apparently rational, intelligent behavior of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of this sighting.\" As Tim McMillan, a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:10:eab9c0a5263c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15069, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "completed in the late fall of 1968. **Of the ninety-one Blue Book cases selected for examination, thirty of them remained official mysteries.** In a \"puzzling and unusual\" incident in 1956, a preternaturally fast object was recorded on multiple radars near a U.S. Air Force base in England. One of Condon's researchers wrote that \"the apparently rational, intelligent behavior of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of this sighting.\" As Tim McMillan, a retired police lieutenant who writes about U.F.O.s and national defense, put it to me, \"You didn't even need the other seven hundred cases. You only needed *one* like that to say, 'Hey, we should look into this.' \" **Condon, who announced long before the study was complete that U.F.O.s were unmitigated bunk, wrote the report's summary and its \"Conclusions and Recommendations\" section. He seemed to have only a glancing familiarity with the other nine hundred pages of the report.** As he put it, \"Careful consideration of the record as it is available to us leads us to conclude that further extensive studies of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby.\" Schoolchildren, he advised, should not be given credit for work involving U.F.O.s. Scientists should take their talents and their money elsewhere. Project Blue Book was shut down in January, 1970. **In 1972, Hynek published \"[The UFO Experience: A Scientific Enquiry](https://www.amazon.com/UFO-Experience-Scientific-Inquiry-Collectors/dp/0809480549?ots=1&slotNum=4&imprToken=86bcf131-d758-c9c4-639&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50),\" a scathing postmortem on Blue Book and the Condon Report, and a blueprint for systematic research.** Blue Book's remit had not been to try to explain U.F.O.s, he wrote; rather, it had been to explain them away. The Condon Report, which focussed on disproving any conjecture about alien spaceships, was even worse. What was instead required was an agnostic approach, one biased in favor neither of extraterrestrial craft nor of the weather or Venus. U.F.O.s were unidentified by definition. But, as Kean writes in her book, the Condon Report licensed scientists and officials to look the other way; meanwhile, \"the media could enjoy the ride while making fun of UFOs or relegating them to science fiction.\" The Robertson panel had finally succeeded in its mission: \"The 'golden age' of official investigations, congressional hearings, press conferences, independent scientific study, powerful citizen groups, best-selling books, and magazine cover stories had come to an end.\" Hynek founded an independent organization to continue his research, but he died, at age seventy-five, in 1986, without having altered the course of public opinion. Once it was clear that U.F.O.s were going to be her life's work, Kean resolved to ally herself with the research tradition that Hynek had pioneered. Ufologists liked to dwell on certain historic encounters, like Roswell, where any solid evidence that might once have existed had become hopelessly entangled with mythology.** Kean chose to focus on \"the really good cases\" that had been reported since the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:11:2ee5537eab58", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15070, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "died, at age seventy-five, in 1986, without having altered the course of public opinion.

Ufologists liked to dwell on certain historic encounters, like Roswell, where any solid evidence that might once have existed had become hopelessly entangled with mythology.** Kean chose to focus on \"the really good cases\" that had been reported since the close of Blue Book, including those that involved professional observers, such as pilots, and ideally multiple witnesses; those that had been substantiated with photos or radar tracks; and especially those in which experts had eliminated other interpretations. ** **One case she studied involved a spooky incident in England in 1980, known as \"Britain's Roswell,\" in which several U.S. Air Force officers claimed to have observed a U.F.O. at close range just outside R.A.F. Bentwaters, in Rendlesham Forest. The deputy base commander made a contemporaneous audio recording. The details of the incident as it is described in Kean's book are sensational, to say the least. Another witness, Sergeant James Penniston, said that he got close enough to a silent triangular craft to feel its electric charge and to note the hieroglyphic-like designs etched into its surface.** [Learn lots more about this most intriguing case on [this website](Rendlesham Forest Incident)] Kean has always avoided the word \"disclosure,\" but it was clear to her that, notwithstanding the Condon Report, the government had concealed a persistent interest in U.F.O.s. In 1976, Major Parviz Jafari, a squadron commander in the Iranian Air Force, was dispatched in an F-4 jet to intercept a glowing diamond outside Tehran, near the Soviet border. In a contribution to Kean's book, Jafari wrote that, as he approached the object, it was \"flashing with intense red, green, orange and blue lights so bright that I was not able to see its body.\" He found his weapons and radio communications jammed. American intelligence sources in Iran described the incident in a classified, four-page memo to Washington. Kean read to me an assessment attached to the document, written by Colonel Roland Evans: \"An outstanding report. This case is a classic, which meets all the criteria necessary for a valid study of the UFO phenomenon.\" She arched her brow and said, \"I mean, you don't see that written very often in a government document, especially when they're telling you they're not interested.\" In 2002, Larry Landsman, the director of projects for the Sci Fi Channel (now Syfy), invited Kean to lead a broad public \"effort seeking new government records on a well-documented UFO case,\" one that might provide fodder for a television special. Sci Fi's producers hired lawyers, researchers, and a P.R. group-the Washington-based firm PodestaMattoon. Edwin S.

Rothschild, the head of PodestaMattoon's energy and environment sector at the time, remembered telling Kean, \"Most people may have this idea that there's something out there, but there are also people who think that, if you start talking about it, you could be a kook.\" He went on, \"We had to draw a firm line between the people who would not have credibility and those who would.\" Kean selected an incident that occurred in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, a rural hamlet southeast of Pittsburgh, on December 9, 1965, in which an object the size of a Volkswagen Beetle allegedly hurtled from the sky. According to multiple witnesses, the acorn-shaped bulk had been removed from the woods on a flatbed truck as service members guarded the area with guns. Kean filed Freedom of Information Act requests for *nasa* files, including some that she believed contained information about debris that was retrieved from the scene. *nasa* claimed that the relevant records had gone missing in 1987. **After a fruitless appeal, Kean filed a lawsuit against *nasa* to force its compliance. Rothschild introduced Kean to [John Podesta](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/john-podesta), President Clinton's former chief of staff, who had a well-known interest in both government transparency and U.F.O.s. Podesta agreed to publicly support the suit. ** The case dragged on for four years, until Kean won a settlement. She received hundreds of largely irrelevant documents. Podesta told me, \"There was a real story there, and you know that when the boxes are missing in the basement and the dog ate my homework. They just refused to own up to what had actually happened. I was perfectly willing to believe that it was the debris of a Soviet satellite that we didn't want to return, but there was nothing that provided any clarity-and after forty years there was no plausible reason for them not to come clean and just say what they thought it was.\" As Kean discovered, a legacy of Cold War paranoia and obstructionism continued to bedevil the U.F.O. issue. **On November 7, 2006, at about 4 *p*.*m*., a revolving, metallic-looking disk was seen suspended approximately nineteen hundred feet above Gate C17 at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. The object hovered for several minutes before accelerating at a severe incline and leaving \"an almost perfect circle in the cloud layer where the craft had been,\"** as one anonymous witness subsequently put it.

Initially, the Federal Aviation Administration denied that it had any information about the incident, but media pressure brought to light a taped phone conversation between a United Airlines supervisor and an air-traffic controller. In the recording, the supervisor, named Sue, asks, \"Hey, did you see a flying disk out by C17?\" She is met with audible laughter. \"A flying . . . you're seeing flying disks?\" the controller asks. Sue replies, \"Well, that's what a pilot in the ramp area at C17 told us.\" There is a pause. \"You're celebrating Christmas today?\" the controller asks, then continues, \"I haven't seen anything, Sue, and if I did I wouldn't admit to it.\" The F.A.A. claimed that it must have been a \"hole-punch cloud\"-a cirrocumulus or altocumulus cloud crisply perforated with a circular gap, which occasionally appears in below-freezing temperatures. According to meteorologists whom Kean interviewed, it was much too warm that day for hole-punch clouds to occur. The episode sparked Kean's indignation. As she put it in her book, \"Those who *do* know the facts about the O'Hare incident continue to mistrust our government, which has demonstrated, once again, that it will avoid dealing with UFO incidents at all costs.\" Kean looked abroad for cases that were treated with greater open-mindedness, and did not have to wait long. On Monday, April 23, 2007, an eighteen-passenger plane operated by Aurigny Air Services departed from Southampton, England, for a routine flight to Alderney, one of the Channel Islands. The captain, Ray Bowyer, had been a professional pilot for eighteen years. In the previous decade, he had flown the forty-minute Channel crossing more than a thousand times. That particular day, the plane took off as scheduled, and climbed through a layer of shallow haze before reaching cruising altitude. Bowyer engaged the autopilot and turned his attention to some paperwork. At 2:06 *p.m.*, Bowyer looked up to discover a gleaming yellow light directly ahead. He first thought that it was sunlight reflecting off the glass vineries of Guernsey's tomato industry below, but the light did not flicker. Bowyer reached for his binoculars. At a magnification of ten times, the yellow glow took on the contour of a corporeal object. It had a long, thin, cigarlike shape, with sharp edges and pointed ends, like a wheel viewed in profile. It was stationary, and radiated a brilliance that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:14:46b8cf9208bc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15073, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "to discover a gleaming yellow light directly ahead.

It was stationary, and radiated a brilliance that was \"difficult to describe,\" Bowyer later wrote, but he \"was able to look at this fantastic light without discomfort.\" Moments later, he saw a second object, which appeared to move in formation with the first. The passenger seated behind Bowyer, whose name was not made public, reached forward to borrow the binoculars. Three rows back, Kate Russell, an Alderney resident, looked up from her book, and she and her husband both saw the \"sunlight-colored\" objects. When the flight landed in Alderney, Bowyer filed the details with Britain's Civil Aviation Authority-which has a Mandatory Occurrence Report system-including a sketch of what he'd seen. In his professional opinion, the objects were each about the size of a \"reasonably large town.\" He had time for a quick cup of tea before his return to Southampton. Local papers made reference to \"[The X-Files](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/04/18/x-factor),\" and the C.A.A. refused to provide further information. A number of Freedom of Information Act requests were filed by the sorts of people who regularly *foia* U.F.O.s. A week after the sighting, the U.K.'s Ministry of Defence concluded that, because the flight position reported was in French airspace, a definitive identification was not the British government's problem. Nevertheless, three weeks later, the British ministry released the available documentation, a packet that included corroborating radar data from an air-traffic controller on the nearby island of Jersey and a statement from a second commercial pilot in the vicinity, who had seen the objects from a different direction. Ten months later, David Clarke, a known U.F.O. skeptic, along with three collaborators, published an audit. The \"Report on Aerial Phenomena Observed Near the Channel Islands, UK, April 23 2007\" was drafted with the coöperation of dozens of domain experts-meteorologists, oceanographers, harbormasters-and various French institutes and British ministries, and it culminated with sixteen prevailing hypotheses, ranked by plausibility. Largely ruled out were such atmospheric aberrations as sun dogs and lenticular clouds, and an exceedingly rare and poorly understood seismological phenomenon known as \"earthquake lights,\" in which tectonic distress expresses itself in bluish auroras or orbs. The report concluded, \"In summary, we are unable to explain the UAP sightings satisfactorily.\" Soon after the Alderney encounter, **Kean began working with James Fox, the director of the documentary \"The Phenomenon,\" to organize an event at the National Press Club.** She and Fox chose a date that roughly coincided with the first anniversary of the O'Hare sighting.

Among the fourteen speakers were Major Jafari, of the \"dogfight over Tehran,\" and Captain Bowyer, whom Kean encouraged to expound on the differences that he had observed between the official treatment of U.F.O. encounters in the U.K. and the U.S. \"I would have been shocked if I was told that the C.A.A. would obstruct an investigation, or if the C.A.A. told me that what I had seen was something entirely different,\" Bowyer said at the lectern, contrasting his experience with the episode at O'Hare. \"But it seems that pilots in America are used to this kind of thing, as far as I can tell.\" None of the speakers made mention of Roswell, alien bodies, reverse-engineered craft, or government coverups. Over the next two years, Kean collected their accounts, and other reports, for her book. In it, she argued that, for reasons of safety and security, and to encourage people who saw peculiar stuff in the sky to speak out, the government needed some sort of centralized U.F.O. agency. Many other countries had followed the lead set by France, and had either declassified and published U.F.O. files (the U.K., Denmark, Brazil, Russia, Sweden) or formed their own official organizations dedicated to the issue (Peru, Chile). The problem in the U.S., as Kean saw it, was that discrete initiatives had been driven by interested individuals; there was no single clearing house for salient data. **She met with her uncle Thomas Kean to discuss the U.F.O. issue and her proposal for a dedicated agency, in the context of his experience as chair of the 9/11 Commission. He told me, \"Like a lot of Americans, I had an immense curiosity about U.F.O.s. The government hasn't come clean about what they have.\"** **Kean's book, which was praised by the theoretical physicist Michio Kaku as \"the gold standard for U.F.O. research,\" and to which John Podesta had contributed a foreword, enhanced and expanded her influence.** In June of 2011, Podesta invited Kean to make a confidential presentation at a think tank he founded, the Center for American Progress. Standing alongside a physicist from Johns Hopkins University and foreign military figures, Kean advised the audience-officials from *nasa*, the Pentagon, and the Department of Transportation, along with congressional staff and retired intelligence officials-that the challenge was \"to undo fifty years of reinforcement of U.A.P. as folklore and pseudoscience.\" Podesta told me, \"It wasn't a bunch of people coming in looking like", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:16:01a7ed3db903", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15075, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "Podesta invited Kean to make a confidential presentation at a think tank he founded, the Center for American Progress.

So what do you know?' \" **In August, 2014, Kean visited the West Wing to meet again with Podesta, who was by then an adviser to [President Obama](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/barack-obama).** She had scaled down her request, proposing that a single individual in the Office of Science and Technology Policy be assigned to handle the issue. Nothing came of it. She was, however, a well-known figure on the international U.F.O. circuit and had a cordial relationship with the Chilean government's Comité de Estudios de Fenómenos Aéreos Anómalos (*cefaa*). She had begun breaking stories from its case files with an atypical recklessness. Kean's work from this period, mostly published on the Huffington Post, shows signs of agitation and evangelism. In March of 2012, she wrote an article called \"UFO Caught on Tape Over Santiago Air Base,\" which referred to a video provided by *cefaa*. Kean described the video as showing \"a dome-shaped, flat-bottomed object with no visible means of propulsion . . . flying at velocities too high to be man-made.\" She asked, \"Is this the case UFO skeptics have been dreading?\" For the most part, people who do not feel that U.F.O.s represent a meaningful category of study regard the opposing view as a harmless curiosity. The world is full of weird, unaccountable convictions: some people believe that leaving your neck exposed in winter makes you ill, and others believe in U.F.O.s. But a small fraction of nonbelievers, known as \"debunkers,\" mirror ardent belief with equally ardent doubt. When Kean wrote about the *cefaa* video, debunkers leaped at the chance to point out that the object in the case they had been dreading was in all probability a housefly or a beetle buzzing around the camera lens. Robert Sheaffer, the proprietor of a blog called Bad UFOs, wrote in his column in the *Skeptical Inquirer*, \"Indeed, the very fact that a video of a fly doing loops is being cited by some of the world's top", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:17:1ac6e63dbf90", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15076, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "ardent doubt.

Robert Sheaffer, the proprietor of a blog called Bad UFOs, wrote in his column in the *Skeptical Inquirer*, \"Indeed, the very fact that a video of a fly doing loops is being cited by some of the world's top UFOlogists as among the best UFO images of all time reveals how utterly lightweight even the best UFO photos and videos are.\" Kean consulted with four entomologists, who mostly declined to issue a categorical judgment on the matter, and urged patience with *cefaa*'s ongoing investigation. \"An informed skeptic is a very different thing from a debunker on a mission,\" she wrote to me.** \"There are many out there who are on a mission to debunk UFOs at all costs. They're not rational and they're not informed.\"** Kean thought that they were blinded by zealotry. The skeptic Michael Shermer, for example, in a review of Kean's book, had idly adduced that a wave of silent black triangles seen over Belgium in 1989 and 1990 were probably experimental, classified stealth bombers-despite official attestations to the fact that any government would be crazy to trot out its latest devices over heavily populated areas of Western Europe. A tendency to discount or overlook inconvenient facts is a thing debunkers and believers have in common. One dogged British researcher has convincingly shown that the Rendlesham case, or Britain's Roswell, probably consisted of a concatenation of a meteor, a lighthouse perceived through woods and fog, and the uncanny sounds made by a muntjac deer. Eyewitness reports are subject to considerable embroidery over time, and strings of improbable coincidences can easily be rendered into an occult pattern by a human mind prone to misapprehension and eager for meaning. The researcher had exhaustively demystified the case, and I was perturbed to learn that Kean seemed unfazed by his verdict. When I asked her about it, she did little more than shrug, as though to suggest that such fluky accounts violated Occam's razor. Even if Rendlesham was \"complex,\" she said, it was still \"one of the top ten U.F.O. encounters of all time.\" And, besides, there were always other cases. Hynek, in \"The UFO Experience,\" had contended that U.F.O. sightings represented a phenomenon that had to be taken in aggregate-hundreds upon hundreds of incredible stories told by credible people. **Many U.F.O. debunkers are overtly hostile, but Mick West has a mild, disarming manner,** one that only occasionally recalls the performative deference with which an orderly might cajole a patient back into his straitjacket.

He grew up in a small mill town in northern England. His family did not have a television or a phone, and he learned to read with his father's collection of Marvel comics. He was very good at math, and, after buying an early home computer with his earnings from a newspaper route, he became obsessed with primitive video games. As an adolescent, in the early nineteen-eighties, he loved science fiction, and was bewitched by a magazine called *The Unexplained: Mysteries of Mind, Space and Time*. The periodical was full of \"true\" stories about U.F.O.s and the paranormal-ghosts and the menacing creatures of cryptozoology. He used to lie in bed at night, as he wrote in his book, \"[Escaping the Rabbit Hole](https://www.amazon.com/Escaping-Rabbit-Hole-Conspiracy-Theories-ebook/dp/B077YS5G2N?ots=1&slotNum=5&imprToken=86bcf131-d758-c9c4-639&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50),\" \"literally trembling with the thought that some alien could enter my room and spirit me away to perform experiments on me.\" Of particular cause for terror was the \"Kelly-Hopkinsville encounter,\" a 1955 case in which a Kentucky farmhouse was said to have come under attack by little green men. As West became scientifically literate, he came to trust that the Kelly-Hopkinsville \"aliens\" were probably owls. Rather than cure his interest in the paranormal, however, this understanding refined it, and he began to take pleasure in the patient dismantling of unsound logic. This practice had, for West, therapeutic value, and as an adult his childhood anxieties are manifested only in a vestigial discomfort with the dark. In the nineties, West moved to California, where he co-founded a video-game studio; he is best known as one of the programmers behind the hugely popular Tony Hawk franchise. In 1999, the company he worked for was acquired by Activision, and, before the age of forty, he more or less retired. He found himself involved in Wikipedia edit wars concerning such contentious topics as homeopathy, scientific foreknowledge in sacred texts, and vegetarian lions. He eventually established his own Web site to combat the widespread misinformation surrounding Morgellons disease, an affliction with no established medical basis, which is characterized by the worry that strange fibres are emerging from one's skin. Then he took on the chemtrails theory, and engaged with 9/11 truthers. As he put it in his book, \"A small part of the reason why I debunk now (and still occasionally address ghost stories) is anger at the fear this nonsense instilled in me as a young child.\" West is a thoughtful, intelligent man.

His e-mails feature numbered and lettered lists and light math. Everything he told me was perfectly persuasive, but even an hour on the phone with him left me feeling vaguely demoralized. Morgellons sufferers and chemtrail hysterics, he supposed, would be grateful to be relieved of their baseless fears, just as he had been disburdened of the psychic hazard posed by farmhouse aliens-and he didn't see why U.F.O. advocates should be any different. He seemed unable to envisage that someone might find solace in the decentering prospect that we are not alone in a universe we ultimately know very little about. In 2013, West founded Metabunk, an online forum where like-minded contributors examine anomalous phenomena. On January 6, 2017, another skeptic brought to his attention a Huffington Post piece by Kean. In the article, \"Groundbreaking UFO Video Just Released by Chilean Navy,\" Kean wrote in detail about an \"exceptional nine-minute\" film, shot on infrared cameras from a helicopter, that *cefaa* had been studying for two years. West watched the clip with an immediate sense of recognition. He posted the link to Skydentify, a Metabunk subforum, positing his theory that the video's odd formations were \"aerodynamic contrails,\" which he was used to seeing as planes flew over his home in Sacramento. By January 11th, the community had ascertained that the purported U.F.O. was IB6830, a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Santiago to Madrid. U.F.O. inquiries can proceed only through the process of elimination, a style of argument that is highly vulnerable to erroneous assumptions. In this case, as the Metabunk participants extrapolated, the helicopter pilots had inaccurately gauged the distance and altitude of the U.F.O., and viable possibilities-such as its being a commercial airliner in a takeoff climb-had been prematurely ruled out. West was not surprised. Although Kean regards pilots as \"the world's best-trained observers of everything that flies,\" even Hynek determined, in 1977, that pilots are particularly prone to error. (He asserted, however, that \"they do slightly better in groups.\") As West has written, \"You can't be an expert in the unknown.\" **During one of my phone calls with Kean-greatly pleasurable distractions that tended to absorb entire afternoons-I mentioned to her that I had been in touch with Mick West. It was the only time I had known her to grow peevish. \"If Mick were really interested in this stuff, he wouldn't debunk every single video,\" she said, almost pityingly. \"He would admit that at least some of them are genuinely weird.\"** **Robert Bigelow was three years old in the spring of 1947, when his grandparents", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:20:7c60e842df3e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15079, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "phone calls with Kean-greatly pleasurable distractions that tended to absorb entire afternoons-I mentioned to her that I had been in touch with Mick West.

In the late nineteen-sixties, when he was in his early twenties, he began to invest in real estate-first in Las Vegas, then across the Southwest-and eventually he made a fortune with Budget Suites of America, a chain of extended-stay motels. Later, he founded a private company, Bigelow Aerospace, to build inflatable astronaut habitats. **In 1995, he established the National Institute for Discovery Science, which described itself as \"a privately funded science institute engaged in research of aerial phenomena, animal mutilations, and other related anomalous phenomena.\" Among the consultants he hired was Hal Puthoff, whose work in paranormal studies dated back decades, to Project Stargate, a C.I.A. program to investigate how \"remote viewing,\" a form of long-distance E.S.P., might be useful in Cold War espionage.** The next year, Bigelow purchased Skinwalker Ranch, a four-hundred-and-eighty-acre parcel a few hours southeast of Salt Lake City, named for a shape-shifting Navajo witch. Its previous owners had described being driven away by coruscating spheres, exsanguinated cattle, and wolflike creatures impervious to gunshots. In 2004, in the wake of a purported decrease in domestic paranormal activity, Bigelow shut down his institute, but he kept the ranch. In 2007, Bigelow received a letter from a senior official at the Defense Intelligence Agency who was curious about Skinwalker. Bigelow connected him to an old friend from the Nevada desert, Senator Harry Reid, who was then the Senate Majority Leader, and the two men met to discuss their common interest in U.F.O.s. The D.I.A. official later visited Skinwalker, where, from a double-wide observation trailer on site, he is said to have had a spectral encounter; as one Bigelow affiliate described it, he saw a \"topological figure\" that \"appeared in mid-air\" and \"went from pretzel-shaped to Möbius-strip-shaped.\" **Reid reached out to Senator Ted Stevens, of Alaska, who believed he'd seen a U.F.O. as a pilot in the Second World War, and Senator Daniel Inouye, of Hawaii. In the 2008 Supplemental Appropriations Bill, twenty-two million dollars of so-called black money was set aside for a new program. **The Pentagon was not enthusiastic.

As one former intelligence official put it, \"There were some government officials who said, 'We shouldn't be doing this, this is really ridiculous, this is a waste of money.' \" He went on, \"And then Reid would call them out of a meeting and say, 'I want you to be doing this. This was appropriated.' It was sort of like a joke that bordered on an annoyance and people worried that if this all came out, that the government was spending money on this, this will be a bad story.\" The Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program was announced in a public solicitation for bids to examine the future of warfare. U.F.O.s were not mentioned, but according to Reid the subtext was clear. Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies, or *baass*, a Bigelow Aerospace subsidiary, was the only bidder. When Bigelow won the government contract, he contacted the same cohort of paranormal investigators he'd worked with at his institute. Other participants were recruited from within the Pentagon's ranks. **In 2008, Luis Elizondo, a longtime counterintelligence officer working in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security, was visited by two people who asked him what he thought about U.F.O.s. He replied that he didn't think about them, which was apparently the correct answer, and he was asked to join.** Bigelow believes, as one source put it to me, that \"there are aliens walking around at the supermarket.\" According to an article by MJ Banias, on the Web site the Debrief, Bigelow hired investigators to look into reports at Skinwalker of doglike creatures who smelled of sulfur and goblins with long, pendulous arms, as well as U.F.O. activity near Mt. Shasta. The program appears to have produced little more than a series of thirty-eight papers, all unclassified except one, about the kind of technology a U.F.O. might exploit-including work on the theoretical viability of warp drives and \"spacetime metric engineering.\" Bigelow's researchers, convinced that crash debris was being hidden in some remote hangar, wanted access to the government's classified data on U.F.O.s. **In June, 2009, Senator Reid filed a request that the program be awarded \"restricted special access program,\" or *sap*, status. The following month, *baass* issued a four-hundred-and-ninety-four-page \"Ten Month Report.\"** The portions of the report that were leaked to Tim McMillan, along with additional sections that I was able to review, were almost exclusively about U.F.O.s, and the information provided", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:22:57de791e6a2b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15081, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "convinced that crash debris was being hidden in some remote hangar, wanted access to the government's classified data on U.F.O.s. **In June, 2009, Senator Reid filed a request that the program be awarded \"restricted special access program,\" or *sap*, status.

(A representative of *baass* declined to comment for this article.) Soon afterward, Elizondo, the counterintelligence officer, was asked to take over the program. Beginning in 2010, he turned an outsourced study of Utah cryptids into the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, or *aatip*, an in-house effort that focussed on the national-security implications of military U.A.P. encounters. **According to Elizondo, the program studied a number of incidents in depth, including what later became known as the \"Nimitz encounter.\"** The Nimitz Carrier Strike Group was conducting training operations in restricted waters off the coast of San Diego and Baja California in November of 2004, when the advanced SPY-1 radar on one of the ships, the U.S.S. Princeton, began to register some strange presences. They were logged as high as eighty thousand feet, and as low as the ocean's surface. **After about a week of radar observations, Commander David Fravor, a graduate of the élite Topgun fighter-pilot school and the commanding officer of the Black Aces squadron, was sent on an intercept mission. As he approached the location, he looked down and saw a roiling shoal in the water and, hovering above it, a white oval object that resembled a large Tic Tac. He estimated it to be about forty feet long, with no wings or other obvious flight surfaces and no visible means of propulsion. It appeared to bounce around like a Ping-Pong ball. Two other pilots, one seated behind him and one in a nearby plane, gave similar accounts.** Fravor descended to chase the object, which reacted to his maneuvers before departing abruptly at high speed. Upon Fravor's return to the Nimitz, another pilot, Chad Underwood, was dispatched to follow up with more advanced sensory equipment. His aircraft's targeting pod recorded a video of the object. The clip, known as \"*flir*1\"-for \"forward-looking infrared radar,\" the technology used to capture the incident-features one minute and sixteen seconds of a blurry ashen dot against a gunmetal background; in the final few seconds, the dot appears to outwit the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:23:3c91645ea071", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15082, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "reacted to his maneuvers before departing abruptly at high speed.

(General Mattis's personal assistant at the time does not recall being approached by Elizondo.) On October 4, 2017, at the behest of Christopher K. Mellon, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Leslie Kean was called to a confidential meeting in the bar of an upscale hotel near the Pentagon. She was greeted by Hal Puthoff, the longtime paranormal investigator, and Jim Semivan, a retired C.I.A. officer, who introduced her to a sturdy, thick-necked, tattooed man with a clipped goatee named Luis Elizondo. The previous day had been his last day of work at the Pentagon. Over the next three hours, Kean was taken through documents that proved the existence of what was, as far as anyone knew, the first government inquiry into U.F.O.s since the close of Project Blue Book, in 1970. The program that Kean had spent years lobbying for had existed the whole time. **After Elizondo resigned, he and other key *aatip* participants-including Mellon, Puthoff, and Semivan-almost immediately joined To the Stars Academy of Arts & Science, an operation dedicated to U.F.O.-related education, entertainment, and research, and organized by Tom DeLonge, a former front man of the pop-punk outfit [Blink-182](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/reviving-the-pop-punk-innocence-of-blink-182).** Later that month, DeLonge invited Elizondo onstage at a launch event. Elizondo announced that they were \"planning to provide never-before-released footage from real U.S. government systems-not blurry amateur photos but real data and real videos.\" Kean was told that she could have the videos, along with chain-of-custody documentation, if she could place a story in the *Times*. Kean soon developed doubts about DeLonge, after he appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast to discuss his belief that what crashed at Roswell was a reverse-engineered U.F.O. built in Argentina by fugitive Nazi scientists, but she had full confidence in Elizondo. \"He had incredible gravitas,\" Kean told me. She called Ralph Blumenthal, an old friend and a former *Times* staffer at work on a biography of the Harvard psychiatrist and alien-abduction researcher John Mack; Blumenthal e-mailed Dean Baquet, the paper's executive editor, to say that they wanted to pitch \"a sensational and highly confidential time-sensitive story\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:24:3212e14323d2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15083, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "his belief that what crashed at Roswell was a reverse-engineered U.F.O. built in Argentina by fugitive Nazi scientists, but she had full confidence in Elizondo. \"He had incredible gravitas,\" Kean told me.

The paper assigned a veteran Pentagon correspondent, Helene Cooper, to work with Kean and Blumenthal. **On Saturday, December 16, 2017, their story-\"*glowing auras and 'black money': the pentagon's mysterious u.f.o. program*\"-appeared online; it was printed on the front page the next day. Accompanying the piece were two videos, including \"*flir*1.\" Senator Reid was quoted as saying, \"I'm not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry I got this going.\" The Pentagon confirmed that the program had existed, but said that it had been closed down in 2012,** in favor of other funding priorities. Elizondo claimed that the program had continued in the absence of dedicated funding. The article dwelled not on the reality of the U.F.O. phenomenon-the only actual case discussed at any length was the Nimitz encounter-but on the existence of the covert initiative. The *Times* article drew millions of readers. Kean noticed a change almost immediately. When people asked her at dinner parties what she did for a living, they no longer giggled at her response but fell rapt. Kean gave all the credit to Elizondo and Mellon for coming forward, but she told me, \"I never would have ever imagined I could have ended up writing for the *Times*. It's the pinnacle of everything I've ever wanted to do-just this miracle that it happened on this great road, great journey.\" It was hard to tell, however, what exactly *aatip* had accomplished. Elizondo went on to host the History Channel docuseries \"Unidentified,\" in which he solemnly invokes his security oath like a catchphrase. He insisted to me that *aatip* had made important strides in understanding the \"five observables\" of U.A.P. behavior-including \"gravity-defying capabilities,\" \"low observability,\" and \"transmedium travel.\" When I pressed for details, he reminded me of his security oath. Perhaps unsurprisingly for a Pentagon project that had begun as a contractor's investigation into goblins and werewolves, and had been reincarnated under the aegis of a musician best known for an album called \"Enema of the State,\" *aatip* was subject to intense scrutiny. Kean is unwavering in her belief that she and an insider exposed something formidable, but a former Pentagon official recently suggested that the story was more complicated: the program", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:25:a60a3de8322c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15084, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 26, "text": "details, he reminded me of his security oath.

Kean is unwavering in her belief that she and an insider exposed something formidable, but a former Pentagon official recently suggested that the story was more complicated: the program she disclosed was of little consequence compared with the one she set in motion. Widespread fascination with the idea that the government cared about U.F.O.s had inspired the government at last to care about U.F.O.s. **Within a month of the *Times* article's publication, the Pentagon's U.A.P. portfolio was reassigned to a civilian intelligence official with a rank equivalent to that of a two-star general.** This successor-who did not want to be named, lest U.F.O. nuts swarm his doorstep-had read Kean's book. He channelled the cascade of media interest to argue that, without a process to handle uncategorizable observations, rigid bureaucracies would overlook anything that didn't follow a standard pattern. At the height of the Cold War, the government had worried that the noise of lurid phantasmagoria might drown out signals relevant to national security, or even provide cover for adversarial incursions; now, it seemed, the concern was that valuable intelligence wasn't being reported. (The Nimitz encounter didn't become subject to official investigation until years after the incident, when an errant file landed on the desk of someone who decided that it merited pursuit.) \"What we needed,\" the former Pentagon official said, \"was something like the post-9/11 fusion centers, where a D.O.D. guy can talk to an F.B.I. guy and an N.R.O. guy-everything we learned from the 9/11 Commission.\" In the summer of 2018, Elizondo's successor brandished Kean's article to make this case to members of Congress. According to the former Pentagon official, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee inserted language into the classified annex of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, passed in August of 2018, that obligated the Pentagon to continue the investigations. \"The U.A.P. issue is being taken very seriously now even compared to where it was two or three years ago,\" the former Pentagon official said. The activity intensified. **In April of 2019, the Navy revised its official guidelines for pilots, encouraging them to report U.A.P.s without fear of scorn or censure. In June, Senator Mark Warner, of Virginia, admitted that he had been briefed on the U.A.P. matter. In September, a spokesperson for the Navy announced that the \"*flir*1\" video, along with two videos associated with sightings off the East Coast in 2015, showed \"incursions into our military training ranges by unidentified aerial phenomena.\" The \"unidentified\" label had been given an institutional imprimatur.** The debunkers were unimpressed by the designation, and their work continued", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:26:be3d52271ed7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15085, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 27, "text": "U.A.P.s without fear of scorn or censure.

Mick West devoted multiple YouTube videos to his contention that \"*flir*1\" shows, in all likelihood, a distant plane. He maintained that the remainder of the available evidence from the Nimitz encounter was even shakier: he suspects that the presences picked up by the U.S.S. Princeton were probably birds or clouds, registered by a brand-new and likely miscalibrated radar system-the U.S.S. Roosevelt, off the East Coast, had also received a technological upgrade before a similar raft of sightings in 2014 and 2015-and that the Tic Tac-shaped object Commander Fravor saw was something like a target balloon. He has no explanation for what the other pilots saw, but points out that perceptions are subject to illusion, and memory is malleable. **Were our finest pilots and radar operators so inept that they were unable to recognize an airplane in restricted airspace? Or was the government using the word \"unidentified\" to conceal some deeply classified program that a branch of the service was testing without bothering to notify the Nimitz pilots?** The former Pentagon official assured me that West \"doesn't have the whole story. There's data he will never see-there's much more that I would include in a classified environment.\" He went on, \"If Mick West feeds the stigma that allows a potential adversary to fly all over your back yard, then, cool-just because it looks weird, I guess we'll ignore it.\" The point of using the term \"unidentified,\" he said, was \"to help remove the stigma.\" He told me, \"At some point, we needed to just admit that there are things in the sky we can't identify.\" Despite the fact that most adults carry around exceptionally good camera technology in their pockets, most U.F.O. photos and videos remain maddeningly indistinct, but the former Pentagon official implied that the government possesses stark visual documentation; Elizondo and Mellon have said the same thing. According to Tim McMillan, in the past two years, the Pentagon's U.A.P. investigators have distributed two classified intelligence papers, on secure networks, that allegedly contain images and videos of bizarre spectacles, including a cube-shaped object and a large equilateral triangle emerging from the ocean. One report brooked the subject of \"alien\" or \"non-human\" technology, but also provided a litany of prosaic possibilities. The former Pentagon official cautioned, \" 'Unidentified' doesn't mean little green men-it just means there's something there.\" He continued, \"If it turns out that everything we've seen is weather", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:27:a5c5e591b634", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15086, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "U.A.P. investigators have distributed two classified intelligence papers, on secure networks, that allegedly contain images and videos of bizarre spectacles, including a cube-shaped object and a large equilateral triangle emerging from the ocean.

The former Pentagon official cautioned, \" 'Unidentified' doesn't mean little green men-it just means there's something there.\" He continued, \"If it turns out that everything we've seen is weather balloons, or a quadcopter designed to look like something else, nobody is going to lose sleep over it.\" Elizondo never got to Mattis, but his successor managed to get briefings in front of Mark Esper, the Secretary of Defense, as well as the director of National Intelligence, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and several members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Government officials in Japan later divulged to the media that they had discussed the topic in a meeting with Esper in Guam. When I asked the former Pentagon official about other foreign governments, he hesitated, then said, \"We would not have moved forward without briefing close allies. This was bigger than the U.S. government.\" **In June of 2020, Senator Marco Rubio added text into the 2021 Intelligence Authorization Act requesting-though not requiring-that the director of National Intelligence, along with the Secretary of Defense, produce \"a detailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena data and intelligence reporting.\"** This language, which allowed them a hundred and eighty days to produce the report, drew heavily from proposals by Mellon, and it was clear that this concerted effort, at least in theory, was a more productive and more cost-effective iteration of the original vision for *aatip*. Mellon told me, \"This creates an opening and an opportunity, and now the name of the game is to make sure we don't miss that open window.\" Still, the former Pentagon official told me, \"it wasn't until August of 2020 that the effort was really real.\" That month, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, David Norquist, publicly announced the existence of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, whose report is anticipated in June. The Intelligence Authorization Act finally passed in December. The former Pentagon official worries that an appetite for disclosure has been heedlessly stoked. \"The public, I would hope, doesn't expect to see the crown jewels,\" he said. West was nonchalant. \"They're just U.F.O. fans,\" he said of Reid and Rubio. \"They've been convinced there's something to it and so are trying to push for disclosure.\" The former Pentagon official conceded that there were \"a lot of government people who are enthusiasts on the subject who watch the History Channel and eat this stuff up 24/7.\" But, he said, the current mood was by no means set by \"a small cadre of true believers.\" **Virtually all [astrobiologists](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/25/have-we-already-been-visited-by-aliens) suspect that we are not", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:28:e31079ebb4df", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15087, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 29, "text": "just U.F.O. fans,\" he said of Reid and Rubio. \"They've been convinced there's something to it and so are trying to push for disclosure.\" The former Pentagon official conceded that there were \"a lot of government people who are enthusiasts on the subject who watch the History Channel and eat this stuff up 24/7.\" But, he said, the current mood was by no means set by \"a small cadre of true believers.\" **Virtually all [astrobiologists](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/25/have-we-already-been-visited-by-aliens) suspect that we are not alone.** Seth Shostak, the senior astronomer at the [*seti*Institute](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/intelligent-ways-to-search-for-extraterrestrials), has wagered that we will find incontrovertible proof of intelligent life by 2036. Astronomers have determined that there may be hundreds of millions of potentially habitable exoplanets in just our galaxy. Interstellar travel by living beings still seems like a wildly remote possibility, but **physicists have known since the early nineteen-nineties that faster-than-light travel is possible in theory, and new research has brought this marginally closer to being achievable in practice. **These advances-along with the further inference that ours is a mediocre or even inferior civilization, one that could well be millions or billions of years behind our distant neighbors-have lent a bare-bones plausibility to the idea that U.F.O.s have extraterrestrial origins. Such a prospect, as Hynek wrote in the mid-nineteen-eighties, \"overheats the human mental circuits and blows the fuses in a protective mechanism for the mind.\" Its destabilizing influence was clear. I would begin interviews with sources who seemed lucid and prudent and who insisted, like Kean, that they were interested only in vetted data, and that they used the term \"U.F.O.\" in the strictly literal sense-whether the objects were spaceships or drones or clouds, we just didn't know. An hour later, they would reveal to me that the aliens had been living in secret bases under the ocean for millions of years, had genetically altered primates to become our ancestors, and had taught accounting to the Sumerians. **Since 2017, Kean has covered the U.F.O. beat for the *Times*, sharing a byline with Ralph Blumenthal on a handful of stories.** These have steered clear of such genre mainstays as crop circles and Nazca Lines, but their most recent article, published last July, veered into fringe territory. In it, they referred to \"a series of unclassified slides,\" of somewhat uncertain lineage but apparently shown at congressional briefings, that mentioned \"off-world\" vehicles and \"crash retrievals.\" Kean told me in an uncharacteristically hesitant but nonetheless matter-of-fact way that she had begun to come around to the idea that U.F.O. fragments had been hoarded somewhere. In 2019, Luis Elizondo had suggested to Tucker Carlson that such detritus existed. (He then quickly invoked his security oath.) Kean cited Jacques Vallée, perhaps the most famous living ufologist, and the basis for François Truffaut's character in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" who has been working with Garry Nolan, a Stanford immunologist, to analyze purported crash material", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:29:4fc8b3b9c04b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15088, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "but nonetheless matter-of-fact way that she had begun to come around to the idea that U.F.O. fragments had been hoarded somewhere.

Kean cited Jacques Vallée, perhaps the most famous living ufologist, and the basis for François Truffaut's character in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" who has been working with Garry Nolan, a Stanford immunologist, to analyze purported crash material for scientific publication. (Vallée declined to speak about it on the record, concerned that it might undermine the peer-review process, but told me, \"We hope it will be the first U.F.O. case published in a refereed scientific journal.\") In the story, Kean and Blumenthal wrote that Harry Reid \"believed that crashes of vehicles from other worlds had occurred and that retrieved materials had been studied secretly for decades, often by aerospace companies under government contracts.\" The day after its publication, the *Times* had to append a correction: Senator Reid did not believe that crash debris had been allocated to private military contractors for study; he believed that U.F.O.s *may* have crashed, and that, if so, we *should* be studying the fallout. When I asked Reid about the confusion, he told me that he admired Kean but that he had never seen proof of any remnants-something Kean had never actually claimed. He left no doubt in our conversation as to his personal assessment. \"I was told for decades that Lockheed had some of these retrieved materials,\" he said. \"And I tried to get, as I recall, a classified approval by the Pentagon to have me go look at the stuff. They would not approve that. I don't know what all the numbers were, what kind of classification it was, but they would not give that to me.\" He told me that the Pentagon had not provided a reason. I asked if that was why he'd requested *sap* status for *aatip*. He said, \"Yeah, that's why I wanted them to take a look at it. But they wouldn't give me the clearance.\" (A representative of Lockheed Martin declined to comment for this article.) The former Pentagon official told me that he found Kean's evidence wanting. \"There are terms in Leslie's slides that we don't use-stuff we would never say,\" he said. \"It doesn't pass the smell test.\" But, when I asked him whether he thought that there might be recovered debris somewhere, he paused for a surprisingly long time. He finally said, \"I couldn't say yes, like Lue\"-Luis Elizondo-\"did. I honestly don't know.\" He continued, \"There are guys who spent their lives studying stuff like Roswell and died with no answers. Are we all going to die with no answers?\" Not everyone needs answers, or expects the government to provide them.

Are we all going to die with no answers?\" Not everyone needs answers, or expects the government to provide them. In February, I spoke to Vincent Aiello, a podcaster and former fighter pilot, who served on the Nimitz at the time of the encounter. He told me that the widespread impression of Commander Fravor's story back then, thirteen years before it became a news sensation, was that it sounded pretty far out, but that the gossip and laughter on the ship petered out after a day or two. \"Most military aviators have a job to do and they do it well,\" he said. \"Why pursue life's great mysteries when that's what Geraldo Rivera is for?\" The mysteries have shown no signs of abatement. In early April, the eminent U.F.O. journalist George Knapp, along with the documentary filmmaker Jeremy Kenyon Lockyer Corbell, best known for his participation in an ill-begotten crusade to \"storm\" Nevada's Area 51, released a video and a series of photos that had apparently been leaked from the U.A.P. Task Force's classified intelligence reports. The video, taken with night-vision goggles, shows three airborne triangles, intermittently flashing with eerie incandescence as they rotate against a starry sky. Kean texted me, \"Breaking huge story.\" She was trying to get to the bottom of the video, but doubted that any of her sources would be willing to authenticate something so hot. The next day, the Department of Defense confirmed that the video was real and said that it had been taken by Navy personnel. Mick West argued, persuasively, that the pyramids were an airplane and two stars, distorted by a lens artifact. Kean, for her part, told me that she was \"only just starting to look into the situation,\" but volunteered that West was \"being reasonable.\" The Pentagon refused further comment. **The government may or may not care about the resolution of the U.F.O. enigma. But, in throwing up its hands and granting that there are things it simply cannot figure out, it has relaxed its grip on the taboo**. For many, this has been a comfort. In March, I spoke with a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force who said that about a decade ago, during combat, he had an extended encounter with a U.F.O., one that registered on two of his plane's sensors. For all the usual reasons, he had never officially reported the sighting, but every once in a while he'd bring a close friend into his confidence over a beer. He did not want to be named. \"Why am I telling you this story?\" he asked. \"I guess", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt:31:725766e3bb71", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15090, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos-new-yorker-210430", "chunk_index": 32, "text": "a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force who said that about a decade ago, during combat, he had an extended encounter with a U.F.O., one that registered on two of his plane's sensors.

During a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., seven former Air Force officers once stationed at nuclear bases around the country said that not only have UFOs visited Air Force bases, some have succeeded in disabling nuclear missiles stationed there. \"I want the government to acknowledge that this phenomenon exists,\" said [Robert Salas](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufos/ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown), a former U.S. Air Force Nuclear Launch Officer. **Salas said he doesn't think the UFOs he claims to have encountered had any offensive intent, but he believes they wanted to leave an impression.** **\"They wanted to shine a light on our nuclear weapons and just send us a message,\" he said. \"My interpretation is the message is get rid of them because it's going to mean our destruction.\"** Other former officers recounted similar stories of unexplained moving lights and odd-shaped flying objects during their time in the service. Leslie Kean, an investigative journalist and author of the new book \"[UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record](http://www.amazon.com/UFOs-Generals-Pilots-Government-Officials/dp/0307716848/ref=sr_1_1?s=gateway&ie=UTF8&qid=1285786705&sr=8-1),\" said thousands of pages of documentation support the officers' accounts. She spent the last 10 years researching UFOs and combing through thousands of pages of declassified government material. Kean said that one declassified document that she researched for her book, relating to the Salas incident, said, \"the fact that no apparent reason for the loss of the 10 missiles can easily be identified is a cause for grave concern to this headquarters.\" **Note:** To watch 18-minutes of this most fascinating testimony on the CNN website, [click here](http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/09/27/5189195-aliens-have-landed-in-the-headlines).

Greer, who organized the program at the National Press Club in Washington, argued that the United States and other governments have known about UFOs for at least 50 years and have been keeping the information secret. **Greer said there were some 400 witnesses who claim to have firsthand experience with UFO sightings or alien evidence, and are willing to testify before Congress. Among them is Daniel Sheehan, a well-known Washington lawyer who is acting as counsel for members of Greer's group.** Sheehan told reporters that during the Carter administration he found out about government-held UFO information that then-CIA Director George Bush, father of the current president, would not release. Sheehan said he was then led into the National Archives, where he was shown photographs of captured UFOs, complete with what appeared to be alien writing symbols. Former Air Force Maj. George Filer III told reporters that when he was at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, an alien craft came down, and an alien got out and was shot by a military policeman. \"Our security police went out there and found him at the end of the runway dead,\" Filer said. **Note:** To watch a video of this most intriguing program, [click here](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=national+press+club+disclosure+project+2001+-sirius).

Ministers even went on to commission weekly reports on UFO sightings from a committee of intelligence experts. The files show reports of UFOs peaked in 1996. The latest batch of UFO files released from the Ministry of Defence to the National Archives shows that, in 1957, the committee received reports detailing an average of one UFO sighting a week. The files also include an account of a wartime meeting attended by Winston Churchill in which, it is claimed, the prime minister was so concerned about a reported encounter between a UFO and RAF bombers, that he ordered it be kept secret for at least 50 years to prevent \"mass panic\". Nick Pope, who used to investigate UFO sightings for the MoD, said: \"The interesting thing is that most of the UFO files from that period have been destroyed. But what happened is that **a scientist whose grandfather was one of his [Churchill's] bodyguards, said look, Churchill and Eisenhower got together to cover up this phenomenal UFO sighting, that was witnessed by an RAF crew on their way back from a bombing raid.

More than 6,000 pages of reports describe people's experiences with unidentified flying objects between 1994 and 2000. Details have been released under a three-year project between the Ministry of Defence and The National Archives. The reports detail how objects of various shapes and sizes have been witnessed flying over a range of locations. Some drawings by witnesses have also been released. **Included in the latest release is a letter from senior MoD official Ralph Noyes, in which he describes seeing a film of UFOs captured by RAF fighter pilots in 1956. Mr Noyes claims the footage was shown at a secret underground screening arranged for air defence staff at the MoD in 1970.** Experts believe the records highlight how shapes of reported UFOs have changed over the last few decades. Many reports in this latest file describe aircraft as big, black and triangular in shape with lights along the edges, whereas the predominant form in the 1940s to 1950s was saucer or disc-shaped.

The request came after Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the millionaire President of Kalmykia, claimed on state television that **he had been visited by aliens at his Moscow apartment several years ago and had spent hours in discussions with them on board their spaceship. The head of the republic said that the humanoid figures wore yellow spacesuits and gave him a tour of their craft, which he described as a \"semi-transparent half-tube\".** They had brought him home in the morning, just as his worried driver and two advisers were about to call a citywide search after finding his apartment empty. \"I am often asked which language I used to talk to them. Perhaps it was on a level of the exchange of ideas,\" Mr Ilyumzhinov, who is also president of the international chess federation FIDE, told the Vladimir Pozner programme on Russia's main First Channel. Mr Ilyumzhinov told his interviewer that his encounter had taken place in 1997. \"I would not have believed it, if I had not had three witnesses.\" **Note:** For lots more on UFOs, check out our information-packed [UFO Information Center](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufoinformation). **Cattle mutilations baffle Colorado ranchers** **2009-12-14, *Los Angeles Times*** [http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-dead-calves14-2009dec14,0,...](http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-dead-calves14-2009dec14,0,3007910,full.story) Livestock are being found with eyes, tongues and other body parts cut neatly out.

Mountain lions, bears or coyotes would leave messier marks, he said. And Sanchez found no tire tracks or footprints that would suggest a human invader -- nor even bloodstains he'd expect to find around the carcasses if someone had butchered them. It's not the first time. In the 1970s, ranchers in eastern and southern Colorado filed more than 200 mutilation reports, according to Colorado Bureau of Investigation reports. The agency investigated, even conducting an undercover operation, but to no avail. **\"It was such a bewilderment,\" recalled Tillie Bishop, a state senator at the time. Some people suspected satanic cults. Others grew convinced of an otherworldly explanation -- space aliens.** In the mid-1990s, 27 cattle in northern New Mexico were mutilated in 16 months, the Associated Press reported. Again, ranchers found cattle with genitals removed, tongues cut off at the roots, and eyes and ears missing. The incisions appeared to have been cauterized, they said. **Note:** For a powerfully revealing documentary on UFOs with top military and government witnesses, [click here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/ufo_videos). **The Road to Area 51** **2009-04-05, *Los Angeles Times*** [http://www.latimes.com/la-mag-april052009-backstory,0,786384.story](http://www.latimes.com/la-mag-april052009-backstory,0,786384.story) Area 51.

But that's what Fife Symington, who served as governor of Arizona for six years in the 1990s, just did. Symington ... says he saw what is now referred to as the \"[Phoenix Lights](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050611ufoevidence).\" Exactly 10 years ago, thousands of Arizonans saw an object in the sky described by witnesses as larger than a football field with brilliant lights. It was also videotaped by many. Witnesses say it made no noise. Symington was governor at the time, and not only did he never publicly mention that he saw it, but there are many who feel he ridiculed those who did. The governor held a news conference after the sightings in which he claimed the case had been solved. At that point, a man in an alien costume walked into the room. That \"alien\" was his chief of staff. The creators of a film about UFOs called \"[Out of the Blue](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060602ufosvideosfootage)\" contacted Symington because they are updating their documentary. **After being asked questions about the 1997 episode, Symington told the filmmakers that he did indeed see the UFO but said nothing publicly, in part, because he didn't want to scare Arizonans.** Symington [says] what he saw in the sky that night was \"otherworldly\" and he believes it was an \"alien spacecraft.\" He is a U.S. Air Force veteran who served in Vietnam and is highly doubtful it was some secret military craft. **Note:** For a three-minute CNN video interview with the ex-governor, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMfEV5qATrY).

During a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., seven former Air Force officers once stationed at nuclear bases around the country said that not only have UFOs visited Air Force bases, some have succeeded in disabling nuclear missiles stationed there. \"I want the government to acknowledge that this phenomenon exists,\" said Robert Salas, a former U.S. Air Force Nuclear Launch Officer. **Salas said he doesn't think the UFOs he claims to have encountered had any offensive intent, but he believes they wanted to leave an impression.** **\"They wanted to shine", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos_national_press_club_witness_testimony.txt:0:ce8a16d81c95", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15108, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos_national_press_club_witness_testimony.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos_national_press_club_witness_testimony", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Air Force officers once stationed at nuclear bases around the country said that not only have UFOs visited Air Force bases, some have succeeded in disabling nuclear missiles stationed there. \"I want the government to acknowledge that this phenomenon exists,\" said Robert Salas, a former U.S. Air Force Nuclear Launch Officer. **Salas said he doesn't think the UFOs he claims to have encountered had any offensive intent, but he believes they wanted to leave an impression.** **\"They wanted to shine a light on our nuclear weapons and just send us a message,\" he said. \"My interpretation is the message is get rid of them because it's going to mean our destruction.\"** Other former officers recounted similar stories of unexplained moving lights and odd-shaped flying objects during their time in the service.

One of the more out-of-the-ordinary press conferences held in Washington this week consisted of former Air Force personnel testifying to the existence of UFOs and their ability to neutralize American and Russian nuclear missiles. **UFO researcher Robert Hastings of Albuquerque, N.M., who organized the National Press Club briefing, said more than 120 former service members had told him they'd seen unidentified flying objects near nuclear weapon storage and testing grounds.** Robert Jamison, a retired USAF nuclear missile targeting officer, told of several occasions having to go out and \"re-start\" missiles that had been deactivated, after UFOs were sighted nearby.

Former Air Force Capt. Robert Salas, a former Minuteman missile-launch officer at Malmstrom AFB, says he was on duty during the incident in March 1967. He says a \"red, oval-shaped object\" hovered low over the base while the missiles were mysteriously rendered unlaunchable. Salas, in an [interview this weekend](http://www.myfoxdc.com/dpp/news/former-air-force-officials-claim-ufo-sighted-at-military-bases-092710) with Washington's Fox5 news, showed formerly classified documents that called the lack of any apparent reason for the shutdown a matter of \"grave concern.\" Salas claims no one at the base was ever debriefed formally about the incident, which he says occurred again at another missile base the following week. At the news conference, Salas told reporters that \"the UFO phenomenon is real, not imaginary and there is excessive secrecy in the government about this issue.\" [He] called \"tampering\" with nuclear weapons a \"national security concern.\" **\"The U.S. Air Force is lying about the national security implications of unidentified aerial objects at nuclear bases and we can prove it.\" Salas claims to have witness testimony from 120 former or retired military personnel that points to alien intervention at nuclear sites in the U.S. as recently as 2003.** **Note:** Capt.

At a news conference at the National Press Club, the six former officers and one ex-enlisted man recalled either personal sightings or reports from subordinates and others of UFOs hovering over nuclear missile silos or nuclear weapons storage areas in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. **Three of the former Air Force officers - though they hadn't seen the UFOs themselves - told reporters that UFOs hovering over silos around Montana's Malmstrom Air Force Base in 1967 appeared to have temporarily deactivated some of the nuclear missiles. **Much of the testimony already has appeared in books, websites and elsewhere. But UFO researcher and author Robert Hastings, who organized the news conference, said the time has come for the U.S. government to acknowledge the UFO visits. \"I believe - these gentlemen believe - that this planet is being visited by beings from another world, who for whatever reason have taken an interest in the nuclear arms race which began at the end of World War II,\" said Hastings, who added that more than 120 former military personnel have told him about UFOs visiting nuclear sites. \"Regarding the missile shutdown incidents, my opinion ... is that whoever are aboard these craft are sending a signal to both Washington and Moscow, among others, that we are playing with fire - that the possession and threatened use of nuclear weapons potentially threatens the human race and the integrity of the planetary environment,\" he said. **Note:** For a three-minute CNN clip of the best of this astounding press conference, [click here](http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2010/09/27/bts.ufo.activity.cnn).

The group, convened by UFO researcher Robert Hastings, came to the National Press Club in Washington to discuss their individual experiences and to urge a government that tried to ignore and silence them when they came forward years ago to finally come clean. **Hastings said he believes that visitors from outer space are fixating on nuclear weapons because they want to send a message: Disarm before the world destroys itself. Hastings said he has heard of a UFO incident occurring at Malmstrom as recently as 2007.** The declassified documents Hastings presented at Monday's news conference include decades-old government memos detailing reports of sightings of objects in the skies above Alabama, Montana, New Mexico and North Dakota. He has talked to 120 former or retired U.S. military about the presence of UFOs at nuclear weapons sites across the United States and around the globe as early as 1945, when the world entered the nuclear age with the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For some of the officers who came forward Monday, going public wasn't easy. Bruce Fenstermacher, a missile combat crew commander at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyo., was \"laughed at\" by superiors when he reported a UFO sighting at a launch site that one of his sergeants had passed on to him, he said. He decided to keep his head low after that. \"I was very careful about who I told what,\" he said. \"I was concerned. I don't want to be considered a kook. But I think it's more important to come out and tell our story.\" **Aliens Are Monitoring Our Nukes, Worry Ex-Air Force Officers** **September 23, 2010, Fox News** [http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/09/23/aliens-monitoring-nukes-worry-ex-air-force-officers/](http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/09/23/aliens-monitoring-nukes-worry-ex-air-force-officers/) Captain Robert Salas was on duty in Montana in 1967 when a UFO shut down the nuclear missiles on his base.

The press conference will also address present-day concerns about the abuse of government secrecy as well as the ongoing threat of nuclear weapons. \"This is only the tip of the iceberg, these stories,\" Salas told FoxNews.com. **Note:** Mr. Salas has contacted WantToKnow.info with more information on his amazing experience.

The beings have repeated their efforts in the US and have been active since 1948, the men said, and accused the respective governments of trying to keep the information secret. The unlikely claims were compiled by six former US airmen and another member of the military who interviewed or researched the evidence of 120 ex-military personnel. **The men's aim is to press the two governments to recognise the long-standing extra-terrestrial visits as fact. One of the men, Capt Robert Salas, said: \"The US Air Force is lying about the national security implications of unidentified aerial objects at nuclear bases and we can prove it.\"** He said said he witnessed such an event first-hand on March 16, 1967, at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana which housed Minuteman nuclear missiles. Capt Salas continued: \"I was on duty when an object came over and hovered directly over the site. The missiles shut down - 10 Minuteman missiles.

The officers claimed, through their own individual accounts, that during the Cold War UFOs visited various USAF installations, but that's just the precursor to a more remarkable assertion: the aliens were tampering with our nukes. In one account, retired targeting officer Robert Jamison said all 10 missiles in his charge - known as a \"flight\" - went off alert status just as rumors of unidentified lights in the sky overhead swept through the base. Jamison didn't see the UFO himself, but several others on the base witnessed the incident. The cause of his missiles going offline is unknown. The fact that all of the officers - whose accounts took place at different times and installations - told similar stories with similar outcomes was a compelling enough narrative for the journalists on hand for the event. **Hastings and the officers don't think their aliens are hostile in nature, but rather that they aimed to show humankind the error of its ways and how close it was to destroying itself during that period in history.** Present along with the Air Force officers were a bevy of declassified documents depicting odd aerial phenomena recorded by the U.S. government over the years. But what Hastings and the officers really want, they said, is the truth, like the details of Project Blue Book, an Air Force investigation running from 1947 to 1969 in which some 12,618 sighting were recorded, 701 of which remain \"unidentified.\" According to Hastings and company, the government knows what's going on and has been keeping it under wraps for decades.

The recollections were mostly secondhand: Robert Salas, Dwynne Arneson and Robert Jamieson, three retired military officers who played a part in the Malmstrom incident, said they were told that UFOs had been sighted around the time of the malfunctions. **Salas said he was told that a \"red, glowing object,\" about 30 feet in diameter, hovered just outside the silo facility when the weapon systems went offline.** **Note:** Though this is one of the weakest articles on this National Press Club conference, the webpage does have an excellent 18-minute video summary of the event at the top of the page. **What you can do:** Inform your media and political representatives of this important information on UFOs.

Salas of the USAF is one of the many brave military officers who have come forward to share their personal experience of a major cover-up around UFOs. I had the privilege of spending some time with him personally in February 2010. He came across as a quiet, warm man who was still disturbed by his experience. We have stayed in contact, and he later sent me an essay describing his detailed research into a most amazing - even inspiring - UFO incident he experienced, which I've posted with his permission below. **Captain Salas states he was present in March of 1967 at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana when a large, saucer-shaped craft at a very close distance was reported to him at the same time as numerous nuclear missile warheads were deactivated.** Could this have been a message from extraterrestrial beings not to engage in nuclear conflicts? Why have this and [many other UFO incidents](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up) reported by high-ranking officials not been given major news coverage? Don't miss Capt. Salas' excellent essay below, and then visit the links listed in the \"What You Can Do\" section at the end for more on this fascinating topic.

Salas** On March 25, 1967, I woke up groggy from my 24-hour \"tour in the hole,\" as we referred to duty in the underground capsule. As I recall that morning, I picked up the *Great Falls Tribune* and read accounts of UFO reports around the area. Later that afternoon, I received a call from one of the airmen who had seen the object at Oscar Flight where we had experienced the strange incident of multiple warheads being disabled the morning before.

As much as anything that has transpired in my life, that conversation has consistently haunted me to this day. I was unaware at that time that the entire flight of ten Minuteman I missiles was also disabled while UFOs were observed over the launch facilities of nearby Echo Flight on March 16, 1967. They too were not allowed to talk about it. Only later did I discover the intense policy of secrecy around UFOs throughout the Air Force. James Klotz and I have documented these events in our book *[Faded Giant](http://www.amazon.com/Faded-Giant-Robert-Salas/dp/1419603418/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1269557260&sr=8-1).* There are multiple witness statements and documentation to support these claims. At least for the sake of that airman I spoke with, and for all the other officers and men in the Air Force who have had to keep silent about what they experienced with these objects, I, without reservation, accuse the U.S. Department of the Air Force of a blatant, pervasive and continuing cover-up of the facts, deception, distortion, and lying to the public about the reality of the UFO phenomenon.

Lewis Chase, Malmstrom AFB, Base UFO Officer, will also be reviewed. And, since I was on station and a witness to one of the incidents, this essay started with a very brief description of my own recollection of the facts of these significant events. I gratefully acknowledge that much of the material used in this report was obtained through the efforts of investigators James Klotz, Dr. Michael Swords, Robert Powell and Raymond Fowler. The hand-written notes of Dr. Craig and other documentation are also archived at Texas A&M University Library, and we are grateful for their use. I would like to dedicate this article to the memory of Dr. James McDonald, a true scientist who, by right of his abilities and intense interest, deserved to have been the principal investigator of a real scientific study of the UFO phenomenon. On August 9, 1967, Dr. Roy Craig made a visit to the home of Raymond Fowler to discuss some reports of sightings. Craig was part of the U.S. Air Force financed University of Colorado UFO Study Group ([Condon Committee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condon_Committee)) chaired by Dr. Edward Condon. **The [final report](http://www.ncas.org/condon/) of this committee is held up today as the reason why the U.S. government no longer examines UFO cases.** Fowler had been assigned the title of an \"Early Warning Coordinator\" for the group by virtue of the fact that he was an investigator for National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomenon (NICAP). He was also on the Sylvania Minuteman Production board in support of their contract for the Minuteman Missile ground electrical systems. Fowler had received reports of missile equipment failures at missile sites in Montana. He told Craig about the reports he had received from sources on site that these failures were associated with the appearance of unidentified aerial objects around the missile sites. Craig was interested because he was assigned to look into such incidents as part of the study. **Background of Dr. Roy Craig and his position with Condon Committee** Craig received his Ph.D. in physical chemistry. In 1966 he was an Associate Professor at the University of Colorado when the university was awarded $500,000 by the Air Force to do a scientific study on the UFO phenomenon. Craig had no experience or training in investigative procedures and only had a passing interest in UFOs. He knew little of the history of the phenomenon when he began working with the group. Yet, he was assigned as one of three principal investigators for the study. \"My assignment would be to investigate the physical aspects of current UFO reports, working with a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown.txt:2:95bd0cc65e1b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15119, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "the university was awarded $500,000 by the Air Force to do a scientific study on the UFO phenomenon. Craig had no experience or training in investigative procedures and only had a passing interest in UFOs. He knew little of the history of the phenomenon when he began working with the group. Yet, he was assigned as one of three principal investigators for the study. \"My assignment would be to investigate the physical aspects of current UFO reports, working with a staff psychologist, who would study the psychological aspects of the report... My associate would look into the minds of the persons reporting the sightings.\" So, even before looking into cases, Craig was tasked to work with a psychologist. The clear implication here is that the group leadership had a pre-disposition to thinking that the reports of UFOs could be explained as delusions of the mind. In addition, he had stipulated to Condon that he would accept the assignment if he did not have to deal with any classified information. \"If an investigation led to a requirement for access to secret information, which seldom happened, I turned the case over to another member of the project and accepted his judgment regarding the extent of UFO pertinence to the case.\" ** As the committee was organized, Condon deputy Robert Low was the only member (presumably other than Condon) who was authorized to review classified material. That was also problematic from the beginning, since prior to the start of the study, Robert Low had written a now infamous memo in which he had characterized the study as being done by non-believers and to trick the public into believing it was objective. When it counted the most, Robert Low failed to push the Air Force for the release information on a classified investigation that very much involved UFOs. ** **A Visit to Malmstrom AFB (October 9-14, 1967)** According to his notes written during his visit, Craig had four objectives. First, he wanted to review with Lt. Col. Lewis Chase regarding his UFO encounter in 1957 while flying a training mission as aircraft commander of an RB-47. The Missile site shutdowns and the possibility of UFO involvement was also on his list. Craig knew of the Shutdowns at missile sites from Ray Fowler. It is significant that he lists the date of the shutdowns as March 24, 1967. That significance will be discussed later. We note that the **civilian agencies involved, such as Sylvania and Boeing were not allowed to talk about it.** In fact Fowler has told me that he only mentioned the rumors of the Echo Flight shutdown of 10 Minuteman missiles to Craig with some trepidation of losing his job and security clearance. The report of the shutdowns was cloaked in secrecy even before Craig arrived at Malmstrom. The depth of that secrecy would soon be escalated after his arrival.

The report of the shutdowns was cloaked in secrecy even before Craig arrived at Malmstrom. The depth of that secrecy would soon be escalated after his arrival. In Craig's book on his experience with the Condon Committee, he describes an encounter with Lt. Col. Chase, whose position description included the title of Base UFO Officer. **The fact that the position of base UFO officer even existed is revealing in itself.** Here's what Craig had to say about his encounter with this officer ([click for verification](http://books.google.com/books?id=2FK54XizXNMC&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171&dq=%E2%80%9CAfter+Colonel+Chase+and+I+had+exchanged+pleasantries+in+his+office,+I+asked+him+about+the+Echo+incident.%22&source=bl&ots=kay-PAB4un&sig=FitSnh5yyrFuNggqUv_Z-2uoBkY&hl=en&ei=2SOxS_CPIIH2sgONl7z8AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CAfter%20Colonel%20Chase%20and%20I%20had%20exchanged%20pleasantries%20in%20his%20office%2C%20I%20asked%20him%20about%20the%20Echo%20incident.%22&f=false)): \"After Colonel Chase and I had exchanged pleasantries in his office, I asked him about the Echo incident. The Colonel caught his breath, and expressed surprise that I knew of it. 'I can't talk about that.' ... If I needed to know the cause of this incident, I could arrange through official channels, to see their report after completion of the investigation. ... Although local newspapers carried stories of UFO sightings which would coincide in time with Echo, Colonel Chase had assured me that the incident had not involved a UFO. ... I accepted the information as factual and turned review of Major Schraff's report (on the Echo Incident) over to Bob Low, who had received security clearance to read secret information related to the UFO study.\" Low, in turn, had to interface with his Air Force liaison in Washington, Col. Hippler. A portion of the memo he wrote to Low is shown here. Low's note at the bottom of this handwritten memo states: \"Roy, I called Hippler and he said he would try to get this, but he suspects it's going to be classified too high for us to look at it. Says he thinks interference by pulses from nuclear explosions is probably involved.\" The tone of this note indicates that Low was simply accepting this rationale for classifying the missile shutdowns as a non-UFO event. According to records of Dr. McDonald, Robert Low never followed up on this request. If Low had followed up on his request and asked for more details, such as the possibility of nuclear explosion EMP (electromagnetic pulse) from the Air Force, he might have discovered that the U.S. did not test any nuclear weapons in the period from March 10 through April 4, 1967; the time period of the shutdowns (source: D.O.E. Report DOE/NV-209 rev. 15, December 2000, *U.S. Nuclear Tests 1945 - 1992*).

Even on the face of it, Low should have realized that if nuclear EMP was truly involved, it would have created widespread havoc throughout our strategic missile forces. Clearly the reasons given by Hippler were simply intended to give cover to Low and others to back away from any further investigation by the Condon Committee. Craig's notes indicate that he knew the names of many individuals whom he could have interviewed with respect to \"rumors\" of UFO involvement in the missile shutdowns. There were civilian representatives from Sylvania and Boeing who knew the sources of the \"rumors\" of UFOs. Their names had been given to him by Fowler. Fowler also gave Craig the name of Dan Renualdi, a member of the Site Activation Task Force (SATAF) who was a very credible eye-witness. He reported being within a few feet of the object. In addition, one of the NCOs on the Air Force Technical Evaluation team admitted to seeing a saucer. There is no record of Craig interviewing these men. **Craig did not ask to know the names of any of the Echo Flight crew on duty at the time of the shutdowns or any maintenance or security personnel at Echo. ** **It is important to emphasize that, although he was charged with investigating this incident, Craig failed to conduct or document interviews with any principal witnesses, including me.** This is verified by his notes and his own book. By his own admission he simply took the word of Col. Chase that there was no UFO involvement and did not pursue an in-depth investigation as he was authorized and responsible to do. **The Secret World of Lt. Col. Lewis D. Chase, Base UFO Officer** On the evening of September 19, 1957 (or July 17, 1957 - there is some confusion on the date) Major Lewis D. Chase was piloting an RB-47 aircraft on a training mission that started out over the Gulf of Mexico near Louisiana then headed north. As the aircraft approached Jackson, Mississippi, Chase and other crew members saw a lighted object above them at 35,000 ft. They determined pretty quickly that the object was not an aircraft because it was emitting an intense electromagnetic signature on their equipment; similar in intensity to a ground based radar. As they turned to the west toward Texas, the object followed them. When they contacted Air Defense Command ground control (GCI) at Ft. Worth, they confirmed that they had radar contact with both the object and his aircraft. As the RB-47 continued north toward Kansas, the object appeared at the 11 o'clock position of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown.txt:5:c20fcf8a0840", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15122, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "the object was not an aircraft because it was emitting an intense electromagnetic signature on their equipment; similar in intensity to a ground based radar.

Suddenly the object started closing on them. As it approached it accelerated at high speed and passed directly in front of the RB-47. The object then stopped and hovered in mid-air about ten miles from the aircraft's low 2 o'clock position. **As the RB-47 passed over the stationary object, Chase watched it blink out. The object simply disappeared! The object later re-appeared in another position. These maneuvers continued for over 2 hours.** Chase wrote a detailed report of the incident at the request of AFOSI (Air Force Office of Special Investigations), whose representatives met him and his crew on arrival at Forbes AFB, Kansas. Chase told Craig that there was a voice recording of his communications with his crew during the incident which was confiscated by AFOSI. **Chase and his crew were told by AFOSI not to talk about the incident.** Some of the details of this incident were told to Roy Craig during his visit to Malmstrom AFB, who included them in the Condon Report. Others were recorded in an interview with Chase by Dr. James McDonald on January 30, 1969, just a short time after the public release of the Condon Report. Chase had asked Craig and Major Quintanilla, head of Blue Book in 1967, to check if there was an incident report in the Blue Book files during their meeting of June 12. Quintanilla reported that there was no file of the incident. Later, after completion of the Condon report, a \"summary\" report of the incident appeared in the Blue Book files. Dr. James McDonald had found that the report of this incident had been classified during Craig's search for it.** The Air Force essentially admitted to McDonald, after the termination of the study, that they indeed had some \"classified\" UFO incident reports that were not made available to the Condon Committee investigators for the study! ** Soon after the Condon Committee began work in earnest, they convened a meeting with the Air Force at the University of Colorado on June 12, 1967.

By this date, the Malmstrom UFO incidents had taken place and Lt. Col. Chase had been involved with the handling of those incidents. The Air Force had established \"special contacts\" for UFO matters at some of their bases. Those contacts were called Base UFO Investigators and were \"requested\" to attend this meeting by Major General Otto Glasser, Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Major Chase held the highest ranking of these investigators, who were mostly junior grade officers. Chase wrote a trip report of this meeting and parts are quoted here, verbatim. \"Much effort was expended in explaining the methods that have been used to discount approximately 95% of the UFO sightings to date, i.e., optical mirage, stars, satellites, temperature inversion, etc. **No time was devoted to the 5% of sightings on the Project Blue Book list that remain admittedly unexplained to date.**\" ([Project Blue Book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Book) was an earlier UFO report) In another paragraph he stated: \"It was also quite clear that, for the study to be effective, there is almost total dependency upon base UFO officers to sort the multitude of reports and to identify those cases worthy of detailed examination.\" Apparently the Air Force was going to be able to choose how they would be investigated. The last paragraph of his trip report reveals much about how the Condon Committee and the Air Force were intending to orchestrate this program. \"Although the University study has approximately 8 months to run, and barring any dramatic events, the conclusions in the initial formal report will most likely read as follows: a. There is no evidence to support a hypothesis that extraterrestrials have visited earth. b. Certain events have occurred that are difficult to explain due to lack of conclusive data and/or instrumentation and state of the art investigative procedures.\" He concluded by saying, \"However, it is reemphasized that there will be no big change in the UFO program, unless it is a civilian/military sharing of charges of concealing information from the public. The program for some lengthy period will remain under Air Force control due to the dependency upon Blue Book files and individual base UFO officers.\" Since Chase was the highest ranked officer at this meeting, he was effectively representing the Air Force brass. He had been directed to attend the meeting by a Major General at the highest levels of Air Force headquarters. And with his trip report, he was prepared to respond to any inquiries from headquarters about the meeting and whether or not the Condon Committee would cooperate in the manner the Air Force desired. It seems that those questions were answered for him. ** By this time, Chase had already been clued in on how the Air Force wanted the UFO question handled.

Chase was Chief of the Operations Division at Malmstrom AFB during the missile/UFO incidents in 1967. On March 16, 1967 Echo Flight was disabled while UFOs were observed near the missile launch sites by multiple witnesses. The Air Force considered this incident one \"of grave concern to this headquarters.\" ** **A week later on the morning of March 24, 1967 Oscar flight was disabled as a UFO hovered by the front gate of the Launch Control Facility as verified by myself and other witnesses.** On the evening of March 24, 1967 a civilian truck driver, Ken Williams, observed a large domed shaped lighted object while driving near Belt, Montana (not far from Great Falls, MT). The object was about a mile to his left and seemed to be pacing his truck at the same speed. Soon the object stopped and hovered for a moment, then dropped into a ravine and landed. Williams observed it as it pulsated with a very bright white light. Later the object was also seen by Montana Highway patrolman Bud Nader before it finally flew off at high speed. Lt. Col. Chase was notified of this incident about an hour later because of all the UFO sighting reports coming into the base. After discussions with the base commander, Col. Klibbe, he decided to investigate the situation. By 3:30 am, there had been numerous reports of sightings, including some over Malmstrom AFB. That morning, details were put into a message sent to various Air Force offices, including the Office of the Air Force Chief of Staff and the Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson AFB (TDET). Four months later word had filtered back to TDET that there had been some equipment problems during the March 24th sightings. They sent an inquiry to Chase. It stated that \"Our office has been informed that during the sightings there were equipment malfunctions and abnormalities in the equipment. One individual stated that the USAF instructed both military and civilian personnel not to discuss what they had seen, as it was a classified government experiment. Request information on the validity of such statements. If some type of experiment did occur on or about 24 March 1967, please advise.\" Within a few days, Chase replied. \"This office has no knowledge of equipment malfunctions and abnormalities in equipment during the period of reported UFO sightings. No validity can be established to the statement that a classified government", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown.txt:8:657ada9b5ac4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15125, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "instructed both military and civilian personnel not to discuss what they had seen, as it was a classified government experiment.

No validity can be established to the statement that a classified government experiment was in progress or that military and civilian personnel were requested not discuss what they had seen.\" **These are blatantly false statements since I and others can attest that we were ordered not to talk to anyone about our incident and that our equipment certainly did malfunction.** And, if it had been a military experiment, we would have since had the capability of easily disabling nuclear missiles at will. This correspondence was written after the Condon Committee meeting with the Air Force Base UFO officers. Since Chase was obviously not disclosing the missile shutdown incidents even to another Air Force office, clearly the cover-up was ongoing, and he was in the middle of it. By the time Roy Craig came to ask questions about the Echo Flight incident, Lt. Col. Chase would know what he was expected to do. **The Non-Scientific Study** In August 1966, Lt. Col. Robert Hippler, representing the Air Force Office of Science and Technology and serving as the study group's contact with the Pentagon, stood before the highly educated group Edward Condon had selected to participate in the study and said, \"You see, first of all, we (the Air Force) have not charged you, and you have not promised, to prove or disprove anything.\" He may not have realized it, but he was telling his audience not to perform a scientific study**.** The scientific method is understood by anyone who has ever passed a science class in high school. *A scientific method consists of the collection of data through observation and experimentation, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses (Wikipedia). ***By their own admission, the Air Force did not give the study group any hypothesis to prove or disprove. They did not provide the group with all the data they had in their possession or access to witnesses. ** As was pointed out, they had classified UFO files and reports which were not made available to the study group. Thus, the scientific method could not have been used. **The Air Force did not really want the scientific study they had promised Congress and the public. They simply wanted to divest themselves of the responsibility of responding to public inquiry on the subject of UFOs. ** James McDonald who had investigated sightings throughout the U.S. and in Australia had provided the study group with a list of twenty best cases.

The study group declined to look at them. As Lt. Col. Chase had pointed out, it would be up the Air Force to decide which cases ought to be investigated. And, while Blue Book opened up their files to the group, the classified cases were not made available for investigation. Chase lied to Craig about UFO involvement in the Echo incident and did not mention the fact that Oscar flight was disabled on March 24. Craig was told that Echo Flight was disabled on the 24th, and that was never corrected to him (the actual date was March 16) by anyone in the Air Force, because then they would have had to admit that a second flight (Oscar) was disabled under similar circumstances. Roy Craig had refused to look at any cases which might involve a security classification. He simply bought into Chase's explanation and did no further investigation of an incident that was referred to him by credible sources. Therefore, one of the most important cases, the Malmstrom AFB missile shutdowns, which could have had a major impact on the results of the study, was not even considered. As has been stated many times before, The Condon study was a whitewash of the UFO \"problem,\" and that paint job was bought and paid for by the Air Force. This was a critical period in time on the question of public disclosure of information held by our government about the phenomenon. ** As a result of the \"findings\" of the Condon Study, the Air Force took and has ever since taken the position that the phenomenon has no bearing on our national security interest, and therefore no relevance to the Air Force or any other government agency. Therefore, they claim, they no longer investigate UFO reports. ** This policy has, of course, allowed the withholding of facts and information from the public to continue. It has allowed the making of policies and government intervention with and about these unknown objects without oversight, public discourse or approval. It has allowed an intolerable abuse of secrecy in our government. ** Note:** The fact that UFOs possibly disabled nuclear warheads may be a message from extraterrestrial forces for us not to play with such dangerous toys.

This highly unusual UFO video special presents UFOs and alien visitation to our planet as a matter of fact. **Though [the film's existence is acknowledged](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0235174/) by the respected website of the Internet Movie Database, you will not find it available anywhere for purchase. ** Those who tracked this incredible production state that it was shown only once, and with no advance notice on stations in only five US cities. Thanks to a viewer who was able to roll the VCR and capture it, we have a record of the startling statements it contained. Watch this fascinating 45-minute program at the link below. [**www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/ufos_disney_alien_encounters_video**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/ufos_disney_alien_encounters_video) At first glance, this unique Disney TV special appears to be an elaborate promotion of a scary [New Tomorrowland ride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExtraTERRORestrial_Alien_Encounter) on alien encounters which was about to open at Disney World. But on closer inspection, it is much more. **The entire program, which opens with a short segment by Disney CEO [Michael Eisner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Eisner), doesn't even question the existence of UFOs and a major UFO cover-up.** At times it has a tone of ridicule towards those who still deny the existence of UFOs. Considering the very limited showing and audience, and the highly unusual stance on UFOs taken, many suspect that this program was a probe to measure public reaction to news of the reality of visitation and interaction with various forms of non-human intelligent life on Earth. The 10-minute section on alien abductions seems particularly designed to scare viewers. For information that the abduction phenomenon may not be as scary as presented in this film, read about the thought-provoking documentary *Touched*, based on the careful research of Harvard Professor John Mack at [this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20100704102814/http://www.johnemackinstitute.org/center/center_news.asp?id=203).

All quotes were spoken by host/narrator Robert Urich unless otherwise noted. Remember, Disney CEO Michael Eisner and narrator Robert Urich delivered these quotes with straight, matter-of-fact, totally serious cadence and inflection, as you can see in the video we've posted at the link above.* **Robert Urich** [Intro sequence over various UFO photos and film]: This is not swamp gas. It is not a flock of birds. This is an actual spacecraft from another world, piloted by alien intelligence - one sighting from tens of thousands made over the last fifty years on virtually every continent on the globe. Intelligent life from distant galaxies is now attempting to make open contact with the human race. And tonight, we'll show you the evidence. **Disney CEO Michael Eisner** [standing in front of a military hangar, guarded by armed troops]: Tonight we celebrate the New Tomorrowland at Walt Disney World in Florida with a television special that's out of this world. Hello, I'm Michael Eisner, head of the Walt Disney Company. At a top secret military installation somewhere in the United States, there are those who believe that the government is hiding the remains of an alien spacecraft that mysteriously crashed to earth. **With more and more scientific evidence of alien encounters and UFO sightings, the idea of creatures from another planet might not be as far-fetched as we once thought.** In fact, one of you out there could have the next alien encounter. Enjoy tonight's special. I'm going to walk over and see if I can sneak a peak.

From beyond the boundaries of our perceptions, intelligent beings are beckoning mankind to join the galactic community. It's an invitation which is both wondrous and terrifying. This is the nature of alien encounters. Mankind has the unique ability to ignore the obvious, especially when the facts reveal a disturbing truth. We once believed the sun revolved around the Earth. When Galileo demonstrated the reverse is true in 1634, he was charged with heresy and placed under house arrest for the last eight years of his life. The charges were later dropped - 342 years later. **Now as we approach the new millennium, mankind is in the midst of the most profound event in history - actual contact with intelligent life from other planets. For nearly 50 years, officials have been documenting routine alien encounters here on earth, and thousands of people have seen or experienced this alien presence.** Yet many others still refuse to acknowledge the obvious evidence all around them. What is it like to be confronted by a creature whose intelligence and skill is far beyond the comprehension of mankind? Would it be enlightening? Would it be an exercise in terror? Or perhaps both? Here in the New Tomorrowland at the Walt Disney World resort near Orlando, Florida, these concepts are brought to life as guests experience their own alien encounter, a sensory thriller from Disney and George Lucas. We'll give you a sneak preview later in the show. But first, we must prepare you for the future with some shocking insights from the recent past. Alien ships seem to arrive in waves, and if the last few years are any indication, planet Earth is experiencing a tsunami of sightings. For the last few months of 1994 and lately in 1995, Gulf Breeze, Florida has been ground zero for alien encounters. Especially during the day, extraterrestrial craft have become common ornaments in the uneasy skies. **You would think these alien sightings would be front-page news. So why have they received almost no national attention?** The answer is simple. For governments determined to maintain their authority, extraterrestrial contact is pure dynamite. **Capt. Kevin Randle** (retired air force intelligence officer): There's beings from another planet. We don't know where they come from. We don't know what they're doing here.

Well, we invited them here.** There have been reports of alien encounters throughout recorded history. But ... most alien activity on earth in this century seems to have been sparked by the single most profound technological achievement in human history. The atomic bomb did more than blow away every conventional notion of combat. It also saddled mankind with the awesome responsibility of life and death for the entire planet. **But what the world didn't know in 1945 was that the atomic bomb's brilliant burst of energy would also be mankind's cosmic calling card, announcing to the universe that a technological society had evolved on a small blue planet in the backwaters of the stars. So as the world celebrated the war's end in 1945, aliens who heard man's atomic trumpet were already charting their course toward earth, responding to our open invitation.** **As early as 1947, the large alien ships began to arrive, navigated by living creatures. Their advanced physics allowed them to traverse the galaxy and pierce earth's atmosphere with amazing speed. The U.S. military immediately went on the alert against the unknown menace. Sightings were perceived as threats to the security of an America still reeling from the edgy consciousness of war. And the sightings were taking place all across the country. ** More than one alien craft crashed and was recovered for secret U.S. military research. The most famous case took place in July of 1947 just outside the community of Roswell, New Mexico - famous, because local officials openly admitted they had retrieved an alien ship before their commanders instructed them to keep the story confidential. What you can't explain, they reasoned, you must deny. **This is the actual site where the Roswell saucer was discovered, along with the bodies of three extraterrestrial missionaries who didn't survive the collision. The debris and the dead were impounded and taken away for top secret study, while a classified investigative committee called the Majestic Twelve was organized by President Truman, and a government cover-up was initiated with a calculated disinformation campaign. ** But while the Pentagon", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufos_video_disney.txt:3:3153f2c91e63", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15132, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufos_video_disney.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufos_video_disney", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "the story confidential.

By the early 1960s, UFOs were having a chilling effect on our defense operations. Their tremendous speed often caused them to be misidentified as incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles, putting American air bases on red alert. There needed to be some way for the U.S. and the Soviets to distinguish between nuclear attack and alien visitors. **Clifford Stone** [retired army officer]: The hot line between Moscow and Washington was set up so that they could go ahead and make last-minute pleas, that \"We're not attacking you, and you're not attacking us.\" The purpose of this was to insure that a nuclear war would not be touched off by a UFO appearing on the scopes and being mistaken for enemy aircraft. **Urich:** The hot line eased some international tensions, but it didn't halt the interaction between the military and the aliens, which continues to this day. **Stone:** **[In] November of 1975, essentially every SAC [Strategic Air Command] base in the United States was [visited by UFOs](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#2).** We have reason to believe that the UFOs went ahead and had some effect on changing the codes within the missiles, within the launch control facility, to change where the missiles would hit. 1976, September, Iran, two F-4s try to intercept a UFO and shoot at one of the UFOs. The weapons systems of the planes go dead, the communications systems go dead. These are just two examples of cases which sound like they came out of science fiction, but in reality, they're from government documentation, documents released by the State Department. **Urich:** Indications are that government, military and scientific leaders will soon release nearly a half-century of official documentation of ongoing alien encounters on earth. Perhaps they feel it would be too embarrassing not to reveal the truth, before the truth reveals itself. But these **[FBI files](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-FBI-chief-Hoover-Roswell-UFO) acquired through the Freedom of Information Act outline nearly fifty years of UFO reports investigated by federal agents all across America**, overwhelming evidence that something sinister is at work.

As this internal government memo illustrates, there are some security secrets outside the jurisdiction of the White House. Planet earth has always been a laboratory for alien life forms which can drop in from space or slowly mutate into bizarre fleshy organisms at our feet [holding a large mushroom]. Understanding the nature of these strange creatures from above, and below, is the greatest challenge of our age. We now know that our future, indeed the future of earth itself, rests in the balance of the solid and the ethereal, of common sense and the irrational, in our relationship with alien life as grotesque as a fungus, or as glorious as the heavens. **Note:** For those interested in more on this UFO video, see an in-depth article on Disney's significant role in shaping public opinion on UFOs and much more, see [this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20120202035308/http://silverscreensaucers.blogspot.com/2011/07/ufos-and-disney-behind-magic-kingdom.html). **What you can do:** Inform your media and political representatives of this important information on UFOs.

May 11, 2001 **Government is covering up UFO evidence, group says ** By Julia Duin THE WASHINGTON TIMES The U.S. government has been covering up evidence of extraterrestrial visits for more than 50 years, an array of 20 retired Air Force, Federal Aviation Administration and intelligence officers said Wednesday. They demanded Congress hold hearings on what they say is long-standing secret U.S. involvement with UFOs and extraterrestrials. Calling it the \"greatest secret of the 20th century,\" the officials, who termed themselves \"witnesses\" of UFO-related events, described a series of military investigations they said they saw: crashes of alien spacecraft, bodies of alien beings, secret government documents, even James Bond-style \"erasures\" of people who knew too much. \"The individuals who have these sightings range from airline pilots and military pilots to police officers, some of the people your lives depend on, on a daily basis,\" retired Air Force Lt. Col. Charles Brown told a roomful of skeptical reporters. \"They are very reputable, dependable people,\" he said. \"The field is filled with hoaxes and scams,\" said Dr. Steven Greer, director of the [Disclosure Project](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg), which had gathered the witnesses. \"But it doesn ́t mean all of it is.\" The 20 witnesses, he said, were a fraction of the 400 people who are willing to testify under oath and under congressional immunity about a secretive portion of the government they say has gone out of control. UFOs have long fascinated Americans, including several U.S. presidents. Webster L. Hubbell, a former associate attorney general under President Clinton, has described in an autobiography his unsuccessful quest to determine government involvement in the topic.

UFOs have long fascinated Americans, including several U.S. presidents. Webster L. Hubbell, a former associate attorney general under President Clinton, has described in an autobiography his unsuccessful quest to determine government involvement in the topic. John Callahan, a former FAA division chief of accidents and investigations, said he was directed by CIA officers to cover up a Nov. 18, 1986, incident involving a UFO and a Japanese airliner near Anchorage, Alaska. \"We were all sworn to secrecy that this event never happened,\" he said. Michael Smith, a former U.S. Air Force air traffic controller stationed near Klamath Falls, Ore., in the 1960s and early 1970s, reported seeing a UFO hovering at 80,000 feet one night. \"I was told you keep it to yourself,\" he said. \"NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command] called me one night to say there ́s a UFO coming up the California coastline. I asked them what to do. They said nothing, not to write it down.\" After he was stationed at another military base in Michigan, UFOs were so close to one landing strip, he said, that two incoming B-52s had to be steered around them. The Disclosure Project, a Crozet, Va.-based research organization that has been gathering government witnesses for several years, says its reason for going public is because the U.S. government has long had information on anti-gravity propulsion systems. These have been retrieved from downed spacecraft, such as those from a purported crash in Roswell, N.M., in July 1947. These propulsion systems, which would use electromagnetic and \"zero point energy state\" technology to produce vast amounts of energy without any pollution, would drastically change the world ́s oil-based economy. Such energy sources would not require damming the world ́s rivers or building power plants, transmission lines or other expensive infrastructures needed to produce electricity for the world ́s 6 billion inhabitants. Such electro-gravitic technology would also allow people to travel totally above the ground, rendering roads obsolete. Several witnesses talked of incredible speeds demonstrated by these crafts, estimated by radar technicians to be more than 10,000 miles an hour. The fastest known speed of a man-made aircraft is 3,000 miles an hour. But information on extraterrestrial speeds is never made public, said Daniel Sheehan, counsel for Project Disclosure. Even the Vatican Library, he said, has hidden information on UFOs. Donna Hare, a NASA design illustrator with secret clearance, said UFOs were routinely airbrushed out of high altitude photos of the Earth before being released to the public. \"We always airbrush them out before we release them to the public,\" one technician told her. Curious, she began asking around the agency. \"A guard told me", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufosgovernmentwitnessestestify.txt:1:13380f86ca39", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15137, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufosgovernmentwitnessestestify.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufosgovernmentwitnessestestify", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "on extraterrestrial speeds is never made public, said Daniel Sheehan, counsel for Project Disclosure.

Curious, she began asking around the agency. \"A guard told me he was asked to burn some photographs and not to look at them,\" she said. \"And there was another guard guarding him, watching him burn the photographs. He looked at one and it was a picture of a UFO and he immediately was hit in the head and had a big gash in his forehead.\" Apollo astronauts, she said, had spotted UFOs, but they \"are told to keep this quiet and not to talk about it,\" she said. One of them, Edgar Mitchell, who walked on the moon as part of the Apollo 14 team, is a witness for Project Disclosure. Karl Wolf, an Air Force sergeant who was assigned to the National Security Agency, said that mysterious structures were discovered on the far side of the moon when the United States was mapping its surface before the 1969 lunar landing. Those photos too were culled out of the public record. The Pentagon does not comment on UFOs, except to say they do not exist and that such objects really are high altitude balloons, swamp gas or military aircraft. Despite the government ́s refusal to discuss the issue, several witnesses have also told of being stationed at military bases or near silos containing nuclear missiles when a UFO swung by. Afterward, military officers would discover the missiles had been temporarily deactivated. **Note:** For a two-page summary of riveting testimony from top government officials on the UFO cover-up with links for verification, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up).

The money has been effective in waging war, but threats of terror and weapons of mass destruction still exist, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. **Military spending rose by 11 percent**, which the group called a \"remarkable increase.'' The amount was up 18 percent from 2001. The $956 billion spent on defense costs worldwide corresponded to 2.7 percent of the world's gross domestic product, according to the annual report. \"It's very close to the Cold War peak in 1987,'' said SIPRI researcher Elisabeth Skoens, who co-authored the report. SIPRI also warned of fears that biotechnology research, particularly concerning human genes, could lead to the development of a new class of biological weapons. \"The free access to genetic sequence data for the human genome and a large number of other genomes, including for pathogenic micro-organisms, is a great scientific resource, but it could pose a significant threat if misused,'' the report said. Researcher Richard Guthrie said developments in mapping the human genome, which could lead to improved medicines and vaccines for heart and neurological problems, also could be used by terrorists. \"It is something to be concerned about,'' he told The Associated Press, but added that no plausible threats have been made. **The United States led the world in defense spending, accounting for 47 percent of the total [$450 billion], followed by Japan with 5 percent and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:usmilitaryspending.txt:0:cb6400a303e7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15139, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "usmilitaryspending.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "usmilitaryspending", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "if misused,'' the report said.

The 2003 rise in defense spending coincided with a decrease in the number of conflicts worldwide, which fell to 19, the second-lowest since the think tank began issuing the reports 35 years ago. SIPRI also noted that 14 separate peace missions began last year, the most since the end of the Cold War. The report had mixed reviews about efforts to contain weapons of mass destruction. It warned that attempts to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons were hampered last year when North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and cited Iran's apparent possession of nuclear material and information. Guthrie said those developments were offset by Libya's acknowledgment that it was developing its own nuclear program and its decision to abandon the program voluntarily. \"Perhaps luckily, evidence of past and present WMD problems in ... Iran, Libya and North Korea was strong enough to maintain the momentum of international cooperation against the proliferation menace - and many states were motivated to work for less violent solutions,'' said Alyson J.K. Bailes, the think tank's director. Guthrie said that while the invasion may have served as warning to other states with weapons of mass destruction, it could have the reverse effect in that some states may see an increase in arsenals as the only way to prevent a forced regime change. As for North Korea, Shannon Kile, who follows nuclear issues for the think tank, said the communist country isn't likely to follow Libya's lead. \"Quite frankly, this cabal of elderly generals that sit around (Kim Jong Il), sometime ago made the same cost benefit calculation, but came up with the conclusion that the benefits of acquiring nuclear weapons outweigh not having them,'' said Kile, who visited North Korea in 2002. He added that the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in a bid to find WMDs affected North Korea. North Korea, Kile said, \"sees nuclear weapons as being very much a security guarantee.'' Bailes said Iraq was the biggest factor of 2003. \"It's been an illustration of how quickly history moves these days. Many of the lessons that people initially drew from that invasion, many of the ways they thought it would change the world, look quite different from the vantage point now,''", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:usmilitaryspending.txt:1:e8c693f97c5e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15140, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "usmilitaryspending.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "usmilitaryspending", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "added that the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in a bid to find WMDs affected North Korea.

Many of the lessons that people initially drew from that invasion, many of the ways they thought it would change the world, look quite different from the vantage point now,'' she said. The report said the March 2003 invasion highlighted the U.S. military's lethal effectiveness, but said the postwar occupation, which has seen more than 800 U.S. soldiers killed in attacks by insurgents, was evident that control in Iraq remained haphazard at best. Andrew Cottey, whose report detailed the effect of the invasion and its aftermath, warned that instability in Iraq was likely to continue and could spread and bring civil war to neighboring states.

These groups are actively supporting Israel's hawk-like conservatives and strongly oppose an independent state for the Palestinians. They are actually hoping for WWIII to come soon! The below article in the *Village Voice* reveals some powerful information on the connection between these groups and the White House. The truth is coming out! Take care and have a great day, Fred [http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0420/perlstein.php](http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0420/perlstein.php) **The Jesus Landing Pad**** **by **Rick Perlstein** May 18th, 2004 10:00 AM It was an e-mail we weren't meant to see. Not for our eyes were the notes that showed White House staffers taking two-hour meetings with Christian fundamentalists, where they passed off bogus social science on gay marriage as if it were holy writ and issued fiery warnings that \"the Presidents [sic] Administration and current Government is engaged in cultural, economical, and social struggle on every level\"-this to a group whose representative in Israel believed herself to have been attacked by witchcraft unleashed by proximity to a volume of *Harry Potter*. Most of all, apparently, we're not supposed to know the National Security Council's top Middle East aide consults with apocalyptic Christians eager to ensure American policy on Israel conforms with their sectarian doomsday scenarios. But now we know. \"Everything that you're discussing is information you're not supposed to have,\" barked Pentecostal minister Robert G. Upton when asked about the off-the-record briefing his delegation received on March 25. Details of that meeting appear in a confidential memo signed by Upton and obtained by the *Voice*. The e-mailed meeting summary reveals NSC Near East and North African Affairs director Elliott Abrams sitting down with the Apostolic Congress and massaging their theological concerns. Claiming to be \"the Christian Voice in the Nation's Capital,\" the members vociferously oppose the idea of a Palestinian state. They fear an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza might enable just that, and they object on the grounds that all of Old Testament Israel belongs to the Jews. Until Israel is intact and Solomon's temple rebuilt, they believe, Christ won't come back to earth. Abrams attempted to assuage their concerns by stating that \"the Gaza Strip had no significant Biblical influence such as Joseph's tomb or Rachel's tomb and therefore is a piece of land that can be sacrificed for the cause of peace.\" Three weeks after the confab, President George W. Bush reversed long-standing U.S. policy, endorsing Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank in exchange for Israel's disengagement from the Gaza Strip. In an interview with the *Voice*, Upton denied having written", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:visionsofarmageddon.txt:0:44b3a8229e71", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15149, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "visionsofarmageddon.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "visionsofarmageddon", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "attempted to assuage their concerns by stating that \"the Gaza Strip had no significant Biblical influence such as Joseph's tomb or Rachel's tomb and therefore is a piece of land that can be sacrificed for the cause of peace.\" Three weeks after the confab, President George W. Bush reversed long-standing U.S. policy, endorsing Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank in exchange for Israel's disengagement from the Gaza Strip. In an interview with the *Voice*, Upton denied having written the document, though it was sent out from an e-mail account of one of his staffers and bears the organization's seal, which is nearly identical to the Great Seal of the United States. Its idiosyncratic grammar and punctuation tics also closely match those of texts on the Apostolic Congress's website, and Upton verified key details it recounted, including the number of participants in the meeting (\"45 ministers including wives\") and its conclusion \"with a heart-moving send-off of the President in his Presidential helicopter.\" Upton refused to confirm further details. Affiliated with the United Pentecostal Church, the Apostolic Congress is part of an important and disciplined political constituency courted by recent Republican administrations. As a subset of the broader Christian Zionist movement, it has a lengthy history of opposition to any proposal that will not result in what it calls a \"one-state solution\" in Israel. The White House's association with the congress, which has just posted a new staffer in Israel who may be running afoul of Israel's strict anti-missionary laws, also raises diplomatic concerns. The staffer, Kim Hadassah Johnson, wrote in a report obtained by the *Voice*, \"We are establishing the Meet the Need Fund in Israel-'MNFI.' . . . The fund will be an Interest Free Loan Fund that will enable us to loan funds to new believers (others upon application) who need assistance. They will have the opportunity to repay the loan (although it will not be mandatory).\" When that language was read to Moshe Fox, minister for public and interreligious affairs at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, he responded, \"It sounds against the law which prohibits any kind of money or material [inducement] to make people convert to another religion. That's what it sounds like.\" (Fox's judgment was e-mailed to Johnson, who did not return a request for comment.) The Apostolic Congress dates its origins to 1981, when, according to its website, \"Brother Stan Wachtstetter was able to open the door to Apostolic Christians into the White House.\" Apostolics, a sect of Pentecostals, claim legitimacy as the heirs of the original church because they, as the 12 apostles supposedly did, baptize converts in the name of Jesus, not in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Ronald Reagan bore theological affinities with such Christians because of his belief that the world would end in a fiery Armageddon. Reagan himself referenced this belief explicitly a half-dozen", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:visionsofarmageddon.txt:1:9cb4fd927c61", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15150, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "visionsofarmageddon.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "visionsofarmageddon", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "to open the door to Apostolic Christians into the White House.\" Apostolics, a sect of Pentecostals, claim legitimacy as the heirs of the original church because they, as the 12 apostles supposedly did, baptize converts in the name of Jesus, not in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Ronald Reagan bore theological affinities with such Christians because of his belief that the world would end in a fiery Armageddon. Reagan himself referenced this belief explicitly a half-dozen times during his presidency. While the language of apocalyptic Christianity is absent from George W. Bush's speeches, he has proven eager to work with apocalyptics-a point of pride for Upton. \"We're in constant contact with the White House,\" he boasts. \"I'm briefed at least once a week via telephone briefings. . . . I was there about two weeks ago . . . At that time we met with the president.\" Last spring, after President Bush announced his Road Map plan for peace in the Middle East, the Apostolic Congress co-sponsored an effort with the Jewish group Americans for a Safe Israel that placed billboards in 23 cities with a quotation from Genesis (\"Unto thy offspring will I give this land\") and the message, \"Pray that President Bush Honors God's Covenant with Israel. Call the White House with this message.\" It then provided the White House phone number and the Apostolic Congress's Web address. In the interview with the *Voice*, Pastor Upton claimed personal responsibility for directing 50,000 postcards to the White House opposing the Road Map, which aims to create a Palestinian state. \"I'm in total disagreement with any form of Palestinian state,\" Upton said. \"Within a two-week period, getting 50,000 postcards saying the exact same thing from places all over the country, that resonated with the White House. That really caused [President Bush] to backpedal on the Road Map.\" When I sought to confirm Upton's account of the meeting with the White House, I was directed to National Security Council spokesman Frederick Jones, whose initial response upon being read a list of the names of White House staffers present was a curt, \"You know half the people you just mentioned are Jewish?\" When asked for comment on top White House staffers meeting with representatives of an organization that may be breaking Israeli law, Jones responded, \"Why would the White House comment on that?\" When asked whose job it is in the administration to study the Bible to discern what parts of Israel were or weren't acceptable sacrifices for peace, Jones said that his previous statements had been off-the-record. When Pastor Upton was asked to explain why the group's website describes the Apostolic Congress as \"the Christian Voice in the nation's capital,\" instead of simply *a* Christian voice in the nation's capital, he responded, \"There has been a real lack of leadership in having someone emerge as a Christian", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:visionsofarmageddon.txt:2:18ecaa8106be", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15151, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "visionsofarmageddon.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "visionsofarmageddon", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "is in the administration to study the Bible to discern what parts of Israel were or weren't acceptable sacrifices for peace, Jones said that his previous statements had been off-the-record.

Exactly. We want to know what God would have us say or what God would have us do in every issue.\" The Middle East was not the only issue discussed at the March 25 meeting. James Wilkinson, deputy national security advisor for communications, spoke first and is characterized as stating that the 9-11 Commission \"is portraying those who have given their all to protect this nation as 'weak on terrorism,' \" that \"99 percent of all the men and women protecting us in this fight against terrorism are career citizens,\" and offered the example of Frances Town-send, deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism, \"who sacrificed Christmas to do a 'security video' conference.\" Tim Goeglein, deputy director of public liaison and the White House's point man with evangelical Christians, moderated, and he also spoke on the issue of same-sex marriage. According to the memo, he asked the rhetorical questions: \"What will happen to our country if that actually happens? What do those pushing such hope to gain?\" His answer: \"They want to change America.\" How so? He quoted the research of Hoover Institute senior fellow Stanley Kurtz, who holds that since gay marriage was legalized in Scandinavia, marriage itself has virtually ceased to exist. (In fact, since Sweden instituted a registered-partnership law for same-sex couples in the mid '90s, there has been no overall change in the marriage and divorce rates there.) It is Matt Schlapp, White House political director and Karl Rove's chief lieutenant, who was paraphrased as stating \"that the Presidents Administration and current Government is engaged in cultural, economical, and social struggle on every level.\" Also present at the meeting was Kristen Silverberg, deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy. (None of the participants responded to interview requests.) The meeting was closed by Goeglein, who was asked, \"What can we do to assist in this fight for these issues and our nations [sic] foundation and values?\" and who reportedly responded, \"Pray, pray, pray, pray.\" The Apostolic Congress's representative in Israel, Kim Johnson, is ethnically Jewish, keeps kosher, and holds herself to the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:visionsofarmageddon.txt:3:a947ce19f409", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15152, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "visionsofarmageddon.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "visionsofarmageddon", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "every level.\" Also present at the meeting was Kristen Silverberg, deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy.

In one letter home obtained by the *Voice* she notes that many of the Apostolic Christians she works with in Israel are Filipino women \"married to Jewish men-who on occasion accompany their wives to meetings. We are planning to start a fellowship with this select group where we can meet for dinners and get to know one another. Please Pray for the timing and formation of such.\" Elsewhere she talks of a discussion with someone \"on the pitfalls and aggravations of Christians who missionize Jews.\" She works often among the Jewish poor-the kind of people who might be interested in interest-free loans-and is thrilled to \"meet the outcasts of this Land-how wonderful because they are in the in-casts for His Kingdom.\" An ecstatic figure who from her own reports appears to operate at the edge of sanity (\"Two of the three nights in my apartment I have been attacked by a hair raising spirit of fear,\" she writes, noting the sublet contained a *Harry Potter* book; \"at this time I am associating it with witchcraft\"), Johnson has also met with Knesset member Gila Gamliel. (Gamliel did not respond to interview requests.) She also boasted of an imminent meeting with a \"Knesset leader.\" \"At this point and for all future mails it is important for me to note that this country has very stiff anti-missionary laws,\" she warns the followers back home. [D]iscretion is required in all mails. This is particularly important to understand when people write mails or ask about organization efforts regarding such.\" Her boss, Pastor Upton, displays a photograph on the Apostolic Congress website of a meeting between himself and Beny Elon, Prime Minister Sharon's tourism minister, famous in Israel for his advocacy of the expulsion of Palestinians from Israeli-controlled lands. His spokesman in the U.S., Ronn Torassian, affirmed that \"Minister Elon knows Mr. Upton well,\" but when asked whether he is aware that Mr. Upton's staffer may be breaking Israel's anti-missionary laws, snapped: \"It's not something he's interested in discussing with *The Village Voice*.\" In addition to its work in Israel, the Apostolic Congress is part of the increasingly Christian public face of pro-Israel activities in the United States.

Don Wagner, author of the book *Anxious for Armageddon*, has been studying Christian Zionism for 15 years, and believes that the current hard-line pro-Israel movement in the U.S. is \"predominantly gentile.\" Often, devotees work in concert with Jewish groups like Americans for a Safe Israel, or AFSI, which set up a mostly Christian Committee for a One-State Solution as the sponsor of last year's billboard campaign. The committee's board included, in addition to Upton, such evangelical luminaries as Gary Bauer and E.E. \"Ed\" McAteer of the Religious Roundtable. AFSI's executive director, Helen Freedman, confirms the increasingly Christian cast of her coalition. \"We have many good Jews, of course,\" she says, \"but they're in the minority.\" She adds, \"The liberal Jew is unable to believe the Arab when he says his goal is to Islamize the West. . . . But I believe it. And evangelical Christians believe it.\" Of Jews who might otherwise support her group's view of Jews' divine right to Israel, she laments, \"They're embarrassed about quoting the Bible, about referring to the Covenant, about talking about the Promised Land.\" Pastor Upton is not embarrassed, and Helen Freedman is proud of her association with him. She is wistful when asked if she, like Upton, has been able to finagle a meeting with the president. \"Pastor Upton is the head of a whole Apostolic Congress,\" she laments. \"It's a nationwide group of evangelicals.\" Upton has something Freedman covets: a voting bloc. She laughs off concerns that, for Christian Zionists, actual Jews living in Israel serve as mere props for their end-time scenario: \"We have a different conception of what [the end of the world] will be like . . . Whoever is right will rejoice, and whoever was wrong will say, 'Whoops!' \" She's not worried, either, about evangelical anti-Semitism: \"I don't think it exists,\" she says. She does say, however, that it would concern her if she learned the Apostolic Congress had a representative in Israel trying to win converts: \"If we discovered that people were trying to convert Jews to Christianity, we would be very upset.\" Kim Johnson doesn't call it converting Jews to Christianity. She calls it \"Circumcision of the Heart\"-a spiritual circumcision Jews must undergo because, she writes in paraphrase of Jeremiah, chapter 9, \"God will destroy all the uncircumcised nations along with the House of Israel, because the House of Israel is uncircumcised in the heart . . . [I]t is through the Gospel . . . that men's hearts are circumcised.\" Apostolics believe that only 144,000", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:visionsofarmageddon.txt:5:65f36cb997e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15154, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "visionsofarmageddon.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "visionsofarmageddon", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "Christianity, we would be very upset.\" Kim Johnson doesn't call it converting Jews to Christianity.

[I]t is through the Gospel . . . that men's hearts are circumcised.\" Apostolics believe that only 144,000 Jews who have not, prior to the Second Coming of Christ, acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah will be saved in the end times. Though even for those who do not believe in this literal interpretation of the Bible-or for anyone who lives in Israel, or who cares about Israel, or whose security might be affected by a widespread conflagration in the Middle East, which is everyone-the scriptural prophecies of the Christian Zionists should be the least of their worries. Instead, we should be worried about self-fulfilling prophecies. \"Biblically,\" stated one South Carolina minister in support of the anti-Road Map billboard campaign, \"there's always going to be a war.\" Don Wagner, an evangelical, worries that in the Republican Party, people who believe this \"are dominating the discourse now, in an election year.\" He calls the attempt to yoke Scripture to current events \"a modern heresy, with cultish proportions. \"I mean, it's appalling,\" he rails on. \"And it also shows how marginalized mainstream Christian thinking, and the majority of evangelical thought, have become.\" It demonstrates, he says, \"the absolute convergence of the neoconservatives with the Christian Zionists and the pro-Israel lobby, driving U.S. Mideast policy.\" The problem is not that George W. Bush is discussing policy with people who press right-wing solutions to achieve peace in the Middle East, or with devout Christians. It is that he is discussing policy with Christians who might not care about peace at all-at least until the rapture. The Jewish pro-Israel lobby, in the interests of peace for those living in the present, might want to consider a disengagement.

As these articles and thousands of pages of declassified government documents make clear, mind control has been secretly studied for many decades. If you are unaware of this important field of study, there are many reliable, verifiable resources which give much more information than the article below.

They may be crazy, but the Pentagon has pursued a weapon that can do just that.*** *Washington Post* By Sharon Weinberger Sunday, January 14, 2007; Page W22 **If Harlan Girard is crazy, he doesn't act the part.** He is standing just where he said he would be, below the Philadelphia train station's World War II memorial - a soaring statue of a winged angel embracing a fallen combatant, as if lifting him to heaven. Girard is wearing pressed khaki pants, expensive-looking leather loafers and a crisp blue button-down. He looks like a local businessman dressed for a casual Friday - a local businessman with a wickedly dark sense of humor, which had become apparent when he said to look for him beneath \"the angel sodomizing a dead soldier.\" At 70, he appears robust and healthy - not the slightest bit disheveled or unusual-looking. He is also carrying a bag. Girard's description of himself is matter-of-fact, until he explains what's in the bag: documents he believes prove that the government is attempting to control his mind. He carries that black, weathered bag everywhere he goes. \"Every time I go out, I'm prepared to come home and find everything is stolen,\" he says. The bag aside, Girard appears intelligent and coherent. At a table in front of Dunkin' Donuts inside the train station, Girard opens the bag and pulls out a thick stack of documents, carefully labeled and sorted with yellow sticky notes bearing neat block print. The documents are an authentic-looking mix of news stories, articles culled from military journals and even some declassified national security documents that do seem to show that the U.S. government has attempted to develop weapons that send voices into people's heads. **\"It's undeniable that the technology exists,\" Girard says, \"but if you go to the police and say, 'I'm hearing voices,' they're going to lock you up for psychiatric evaluation.\"** The thing that's missing from his bag - the lack of which makes it hard to prove he isn't crazy - is even a single document that would buttress the implausible notion that the government is currently targeting a large group of American citizens with mind-control technology. The only direct evidence for that, Girard admits, lies with alleged victims such as himself. And of those, there are many. ** It's 9:01 P.M. when the first person speaks during the Saturday conference call.** Unsure whether anyone else is on the line yet, the female caller throws out the first question: \"You got gang stalking or V2K?\" she asks no one in particular.

There's a short, uncomfortable pause. \"V2K, really bad. 24-7,\" a man replies. \"Gang stalking,\" another woman says. \"Oh, yeah, join the club,\" yet another man replies. The members of this confessional \"club\" are not your usual victims. This isn't a group for alcoholics, drug addicts or survivors of childhood abuse; **the people connecting on the call are self-described victims of mind control - people who believe they have been targeted by a secret government program that tracks them around the clock, using technology to probe and control their minds.** **The callers frequently refer to themselves as TIs, which is short for Targeted Individuals, and talk about V2K - the official military abbreviation stands for \"[voice to skull](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/05/army-removes-pa/)\" and denotes weapons that beam voices or sounds into the head. In their esoteric lexicon, \"gang stalking\" refers to the belief that they are being followed and harassed: by neighbors, strangers or colleagues who are agents for the government.** A few more \"hellos\" are exchanged, interrupted by beeps signaling late arrivals: Bill from Columbus, Barbara from Philadelphia, Jim from California and a dozen or so others. Derrick Robinson, the conference call moderator, calls order. \"It's five after 9,\" says Robinson, with the sweetly reasonable intonation of a late-night radio host. \"Maybe we should go ahead and start.\" The idea of a group of people convinced they are targeted by weapons that can invade their minds has become a cultural joke, shorthanded by the image of solitary lunatics wearing tinfoil hats to deflect invisible mind beams. \"Tinfoil hat,\" says Wikipedia, has become \"a popular stereotype and term of derision; the phrase serves as a byword for paranoia and is associated with conspiracy theorists.\" In 2005, a group of MIT students conducted a formal study using aluminum foil and radio signals. Their surprising finding: Tinfoil hats may actually amplify radio frequency signals. Of course, the tech students meant the study as a joke. But during the Saturday conference call, the subject of aluminum foil is deadly serious. The MIT study had prompted renewed debate; while a few TIs realized it was a joke at their expense, some saw the findings as an explanation for why tinfoil didn't seem to stop the voices. Others vouched for the material. \"Tinfoil helps tremendously,\" reports one conference call participant, who describes wrapping it around her body underneath her clothing. \"Where do you put the tinfoil?\" a man asks. \"Anywhere, everywhere,\" she replies. \"I even put it in a hat.\" A TI in an online mind-control forum recommends a Web site", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt:2:f152e4f379e2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15158, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "few TIs realized it was a joke at their expense, some saw the findings as an explanation for why tinfoil didn't seem to stop the voices.

In the course of the evening, there are as many as 40 clicks from people joining the call, and much larger numbers participate in the online forum, which has 143 members.** A note there mentioning interest from a journalist prompted more than 200 e-mail responses. Until recently, people who believe the government is beaming voices into their heads would have added social isolation to their catalogue of woes. But now, **many have discovered hundreds, possibly thousands, of others just like them all over the world. Web sites dedicated to electronic harassment and gang stalking have popped up in India, China, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Russia and elsewhere. ** Victims have begun to host support meetings in major cities, including Washington. Favorite topics at the meetings include lessons on how to build shields (the proverbial tinfoil hats), media and PR training, and possible legal strategies for outlawing mind control. The biggest hurdle for TIs is getting people to take their concerns seriously. A proposal made in 2001 by Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) to ban \"[psychotronic weapons](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrollers10pg#psychic)\" (another common term for mind-control technology) was hailed by TIs as a great step forward. But the bill was widely derided by bloggers and columnists and quickly dropped. Doug Gordon, Kucinich's spokesman, would not discuss mind control other than to say the proposal was part of broader legislation outlawing weapons in space. The bill was later reintroduced, minus the mind control. \"It was not the concentration of the legislation, which is why it was tightened up and redrafted,\" was all Gordon would say. Unable to garner much support from their elected representatives, TIs have started their own PR campaign. And so, last spring, the Saturday conference calls centered on plans to hold a rally in Washington. A 2005 attempt at a rally drew a few dozen people and was ultimately rained out; the TIs were determined to make another go of it.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt:3:287b0e8ba4f9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15159, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "was not the concentration of the legislation, which is why it was tightened up and redrafted,\" was all Gordon would say.

And so, last spring, the Saturday conference calls centered on plans to hold a rally in Washington. A 2005 attempt at a rally drew a few dozen people and was ultimately rained out; the TIs were determined to make another go of it. Conversations focused around designing T-shirts, setting up congressional appointments, fundraising, creating a new Web site and formalizing a slogan. After some debate over whether to focus on gang stalking or mind control, the group came up with a compromise slogan that covered both: \"Freedom From Covert Surveillance and Electronic Harassment.\" Conference call moderator Robinson, who says his gang stalking began when he worked at the National Security Agency in the 1980s, offers his assessment of the group's prospects: Maybe this rally wouldn't produce much press, but it's a first step. \"I see this as a movement,\" he says. \"We're picking up people all the time.\" **Harlan Girard says his problems began in 1983**, while he was a real estate developer in Los Angeles. The harassment was subtle at first: One day a woman pulled up in a car, wagged her finger at him, then sped away; he saw people running underneath his window at night; he noticed some of his neighbors seemed to be watching him; he heard someone moving in the crawl space under his apartment at night. Girard sought advice from this then-girlfriend, a practicing psychologist, whom he declines to identify. He says she told him, \"Nobody can become psychotic in their late 40s.\" She said he didn't seem to manifest other symptoms of psychotic behavior - he dressed well, paid his bills - and, besides his claims of surveillance, which sounded paranoid, he behaved normally. \"People who are psychotic are socially isolated,\" he recalls her saying. After a few months, Girard says, the harassment abruptly stopped. But the respite didn't last. In 1984, appropriately enough, things got seriously weird. He'd left his real estate career to return to school at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was studying for a master's degree in landscape architecture. He harbored dreams of designing parks and public spaces. Then, he says, he began to hear voices. Girard could distinguish several different male voices, which came complete with a mental image of how the voices were being generated: from a recording studio, with \"four slops sitting around a card table drinking beer,\" he says. The voices were crass but also strangely courteous, addressing him as \"Mr. Girard.\" They taunted him. They asked him if he thought he was normal; they suggested he was going crazy.

They insulted his classmates: When an overweight student showed up for a field trip in a white raincoat, they said, \"Hey, Mr. Girard, doesn't she look like a refrigerator?\" Six months after the voices began, they had another question for him: \"Mr. Girard, Mr. Girard. Why aren't you dead yet?\" At first, he recalls, the voices would speak just two or three times a day, but it escalated into a near-constant cacophony, often accompanied by severe pain all over his body - which Girard now attributes to directed-energy weapons that can shoot invisible beams. The voices even suggested how he could figure out what was happening to him. He says they told him to go to the electrical engineering department to \"tell them you're writing science fiction and you don't want to write anything inconsistent with physical reality. Then tell them exactly what has happened.\" **Girard went and got some rudimentary explanations of how technology could explain some of the things he was describing.** \"Finally, I said: 'Look, I must come to the point, because I need answers. This is happening to me; it's not science fiction.'\" They laughed. He got the same response from friends, he says. \"They regarded me as crazy, which is a humiliating experience.\" When asked why he didn't consult a doctor about the voices and the pain, he says, \"I don't dare start talking to people because of the potential stigma of it all. I don't want to be treated differently. Here I was in Philadelphia. Something was going on, I don't know any doctors... I know somebody's doing something to me.\" It was a struggle to graduate, he says, but he was determined, and he persevered. In 1988, the same year he finished his degree, his father died, leaving Girard an inheritance large enough that he did not have to work. **So, instead of becoming a landscape architect, Girard began a full-time investigation of what was happening to him, often traveling to Washington in pursuit of government documents relating to mind control. **He put an ad in a magazine seeking other victims. Only a few people responded. But over the years, as he met more and more people like himself, he grew convinced that he was part of what he calls an \"electronic concentration camp.\" **What he was finding on his research trips also buttressed his belief: Girard learned that in the 1950s, the CIA had drugged unwitting victims with LSD as part of a rogue mind-control experiment called [MK-ULTRA](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050626mkultra).

He came across references to the CIA seeking to influence the mind with electromagnetic fields. Then he found references in an academic research book to work that military researchers at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research had done [in the 1970s](https://patents.google.com/patent/US3951134?oq=3%2c951%2c134) with pulsed microwaves to transmit words that a subject would hear in his head. ** Elsewhere, he came across references to attempts to use electromagnetic energy, sound waves or microwave beams to cause non-lethal pain to the body. For every symptom he experienced, he believed he found references to a weapon that could cause it. How much of the research Girard cites checks out? **Concerns about microwaves and mind control date to the 1960s, when the U.S. government discovered that its [embassy in Moscow](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrollers10pg#nonlethal) was being bombarded by low-level electromagnetic radiation. In 1965, according to declassified Defense Department documents, the Pentagon, at the behest of the White House, launched Project Pandora, top-secret research to explore the behavioral and biological effects of low-level microwaves. ** **For approximately four years, the Pentagon conducted secret research: zapping monkeys; exposing unwitting sailors to microwave radiation; and conducting a host of other unusual experiments (a sub-project of Project Pandora was titled Project Bizarre). ** The results were mixed, and the program was plagued by disagreements and scientific squabbles. The \"Moscow signal,\" as it was called, was eventually attributed to eavesdropping, not mind control, and Pandora ended in 1970. And with it, the military's research into so-called non-thermal microwave effects seemed to die out, at least in the unclassified realm. But there are hints of ongoing research: **An academic paper written for the Air Force in the mid-1990s mentions the idea of a weapon that would use sound waves to send words into a person's head. \"The signal can be a '[message from God](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-when-seeing-hearing-isnt-believing)' that can warn the enemy of impending doom, or encourage the enemy to surrender,\" the author concluded.** In 2002, the Air Force Research Laboratory patented precisely such a technology: using microwaves to send words into someone's head. That work is frequently cited on mind-control Web sites. Rich Garcia, a spokesman for the research laboratory's directed energy directorate, declined to discuss that patent or current or related research in the field, citing the lab's policy not to comment on its microwave work. **In response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed for this article, the Air Force released unclassified documents surrounding that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt:6:78854f60d464", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15162, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "Research Laboratory patented precisely such a technology: using microwaves to send words into someone's head.

Research appeared to continue at least through 2002. Where this work has gone since is unclear - the research laboratory, citing classification, refused to discuss it or release other materials.** The official U.S. Air Force position is that there are no non-thermal effects of microwaves. Yet Dennis Bushnell, chief scientist at NASA's Langley Research Center, tagged microwave attacks against the human brain as part of future warfare in a 2001 presentation to the National Defense Industrial Association about \"Future Strategic Issues.\" \"That work is exceedingly sensitive\" and unlikely to be reported in any unclassified documents, he says. Meanwhile, **the military's use of weapons that employ electromagnetic radiation to create pain is well-known, **as are some of the limitations of such weapons. In 2001, the Pentagon declassified one element of this research: the Active Denial System, a weapon that uses electromagnetic radiation to heat skin and create an intense burning sensation.** So, yes, there is technology designed to beam painful invisible rays at humans**, but the weapon seems to fall far short of what could account for many of the TIs' symptoms. While its exact range is classified, Doug Beason, an expert in directed-energy weapons, puts it at about 700 meters, and the beam cannot penetrate a number of materials, such as aluminum. Considering the size of the full-scale weapon, which resembles a satellite dish, and its operational limitations, the ability of the government or anyone else to shoot beams at hundreds of people - on city streets, into their homes and while they travel in cars and planes - is beyond improbable. **But, given the history of America's clandestine research, it's reasonable to assume that if the defense establishment could develop mind-control or long-distance ray weapons, it almost certainly would. And, once developed, the possibility that they might be tested on innocent civilians could not be categorically dismissed.** Girard, for his part, believes these weapons were not only developed but were also tested on him more than 20 years ago. What would the government gain by torturing him? Again, Girard found what he believed to be an explanation, or at least a precedent: **During the Cold War, the government conducted radiation", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt:7:463a10ec1ac7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15163, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "mind-control or long-distance ray weapons, it almost certainly would.

Again, Girard found what he believed to be an explanation, or at least a precedent: **During the Cold War, the government conducted radiation experiments on scores of unwitting victims, essentially using them as [human guinea pigs](https://www.WantToKnow.info/humanguineapigs).** Girard came to believe that he, too, was a walking experiment. **Not that Girard thinks his selection was totally random: He believes he was targeted because of a disparaging remark he made to a Republican fundraiser about George H.W. Bush in the early 1980s. Later, Girard says, the voices confirmed his suspicion.** \"One night I was going to bed; the usual drivel was going on,\" he says. \"The constant stream of drivel. I was just about to go to bed, and a voice says: 'Mr. Girard, do you know who was in our studio with us? That was George Bush, vice president of the United States.'\" Girard's story, however strange, reflects what TIs around the world report: a chance encounter with a government agency or official, followed by surveillance and gang stalking, and then, in many cases, voices, and pain similar to electric shocks. Some in the community have taken it upon themselves to document as many cases as possible. One TI from California conducted about 50 interviews, narrowing the symptoms down to several major areas: \"ringing in the ears,\" \"manipulation of body parts,\" \"hearing voices,\" \"piercing sensation on skin,\" \"sinus problems\" and \"sexual attacks.\" In fact, the TI continued, \"many report the sensation of having their genitalia manipulated.\" Both male and female TIs report a variety of \"attacks\" to their sexual organs. \"My testicles became so sore I could barely walk,\" Girard says of his early experiences. Others, however, report the attacks in the form of sexual stimulation, including one TI who claims he dropped out of the seminary after constant sexual stimulation by directed-energy weapons. Susan Sayler, a TI in San Diego, says many women among the TIs suffer from attacks to their sexual organs but are often embarrassed to talk about it with outsiders. \"It's sporadic, you just never know when it will happen,\" she says. \"A lot of the women say it's as soon as you lay down in bed - that's when you would get hit the worst. It happened to me as I was driving, at odd times.\" What made her think it was an electronic attack and not just in her head? \"There was no sexual attraction to a man when it would happen.

A winner of the National Book Award, Naylor is best known for her acclaimed novel, *The Women of Brewster Place*, which described a group of women living in a poor urban neighborhood and was later made into a miniseries by Oprah Winfrey.** But in 2005, she published a lesser-known work, *[1996](http://www.amazon.com/1996-Gloria-Naylor/dp/0883782782/ref=sr_1_11?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1295902933&sr=1-11)*, a semi-autobiographical book describing her experience as a TI. \"I didn't want to tell this story. It's going to take courage. Perhaps more courage than I possess, but they've left me no alternatives,\" Naylor writes at the beginning of her book. \"I am in a battle for my mind. If I stop now, they'll have won, and I will lose myself.\" The book is coherent, if hard to believe. It's also marked by disturbing passages describing how Jewish American agents were responsible for Naylor's surveillance. \"Of the many cars that kept coming and going down my road, most were driven by Jews,\" she writes in the book. When asked about that passage in a recent interview, she defended her logic: Being from New York, she claimed, she can recognize Jews. Naylor lives on a quiet street in Brooklyn in a majestic brownstone with an interior featuring intricate woodwork and tasteful decorations that attest to a successful literary career. She speaks about her situation calmly, occasionally laughing at her own predicament and her struggle with what she originally thought was mental illness. \"I would observe myself,\" she explains. \"I would lie in bed while the conversations were going on, and I'd ask: Maybe it is schizophrenia?\" Like Girard, Naylor describes what she calls \"street theater\" - incidents that might be dismissed by others as coincidental, but which Naylor believes were set up. She noticed suspicious cars driving by her isolated vacation home. On an airplane, fellow passengers mimicked her every movement - like mimes on a street. Voices similar to those in Girard's case followed - taunting voices cursing her, telling her she was stupid, that she couldn't write. Expletive-laced language filled her head. Naylor sought help from a psychiatrist and received a prescription for an antipsychotic drug. But the medication failed to stop the voices, she says, which only added to her conviction that the harassment was real.

Naylor sought help from a psychiatrist and received a prescription for an antipsychotic drug. But the medication failed to stop the voices, she says, which only added to her conviction that the harassment was real. For almost four years, Naylor says, the voices prevented her from writing. In 2000, she says, around the time she discovered the mind-control forums, the voices stopped and the surveillance tapered off. It was then that she began writing *1996* as a \"catharsis.\" **Colleagues urged Naylor not to publish the book, saying she would destroy her reputation. But she did publish, albeit with a small publishing house. The book was generally ignored by critics but embraced by TIs.** Naylor is not the first writer to describe such a personal descent. Evelyn Waugh, one of the great novelists of the 20th century, details similar experiences in *[The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold](http://www.amazon.com/Ordeal-Gilbert-Pinfold-Evelyn-Waugh/dp/0316926221/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1295903198&sr=8-1)*. Waugh's book, published in 1957, has eerie similarities to Naylor's. Embarking on a recuperative cruise, Pinfold begins to hear voices on the ship that he believes are part of a wireless system capable of broadcasting into his head; he believes the instigator recruited fellow passengers to act as operatives; and he describes \"performances\" put on by passengers directed at him yet meant to look innocuous to others. Waugh wrote his book several years after recovering from a similar episode and realizing that the voices and paranoia were the result of drug-induced hallucinations. **Naylor ... is now back at work on an historical novel she hopes will return her to the literary mainstream. She remains convinced that she was targeted by mind control. The many echoes of her ordeal she sees on the mind-control forums reassure her she's not crazy, she says.** Of course, some of the things she sees on the forum do strike her as crazy. \"But who I am to say?\" she says. \"Maybe I sound crazy to somebody else.\" Some TIs, such as Ed Moore, a young medical doctor, take a slightly more skeptical approach. He criticizes what he calls the \"wacky claims\" of TIs who blame various government agencies or groups of people without any proof. \"I have yet to see a claim of who is behind this that has any data to support it,\" he writes. Nonetheless, Moore still believes the voices in his head are the result of mind control and that the U.S. government is the most likely culprit. Moore started hearing voices in 2003, just as he completed his medical residency in anesthesiology; he was pulling an all-nighter studying for board exams when he heard voices coming from a nearby house commenting on him, on his", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt:10:88bb9bd5284f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15166, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "see a claim of who is behind this that has any data to support it,\" he writes.

Moore started hearing voices in 2003, just as he completed his medical residency in anesthesiology; he was pulling an all-nighter studying for board exams when he heard voices coming from a nearby house commenting on him, on his abilities as a doctor, on his sanity. At first, he thought he was simply overhearing conversations through walls (much as Waugh's fictional alter ego first thought), but when no one else could hear the voices, he realized they were in his head. Moore went through a traumatic two years, including hospitalization for depression with auditory hallucinations. \"One tries to convince friends and family that you are being electronically harassed with voices that only you can hear,\" he writes in an e-mail. \"You learn to stop doing that. They don't believe you, and they become sad and concerned, and it amplifies your own depression when you have voices screaming at you and your friends and family looking at you as a helpless, sick, mentally unbalanced wreck.\" He says he grew frustrated with anti-psychotic medications meant to stop the voices, both because the treatments didn't work and because psychiatrists showed no interest in what the voices were telling him. He began to look for some other way to cope. \"In March of 2005, I started looking up support groups on the Internet,\" he wrote. \"My wife would cry when she would see these sites, knowing I still heard voices, but I did not know what else to do.\" In 2006, he says, his wife, who had stood by him for three years, filed for divorce. Moore, like other TIs, is cautious about sharing details of his life. He worries about looking foolish to friends and colleagues - but he says that risk is ultimately worthwhile if he can bring attention to the issue. With his father's financial help, Moore is now studying for an electrical engineering degree at the University of Texas at San Antonio, hoping to prove that V2K, the technology to send voices into people's heads, is real. Being in school, around other people, helps him cope, he writes, but the voices continue to taunt him. Recently, he says, they told him: \"We'll never stop [messing] with you.\" ** A week before the TIs rally on the National Mall, John Alexander, one of the people whom Harlan Girard holds personally responsible for the voices in his head, is at a Chili's restaurant in Crystal City explaining over a Philly cheese steak and fries why the United States needs mind-control weapons.** A former Green Beret who served in Vietnam, Alexander went on to a number of national security jobs, and rubbed", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt:11:45133e2b23a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15167, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "told him: \"We'll never stop [messing] with you.\" ** A week before the TIs rally on the National Mall, John Alexander, one of the people whom Harlan Girard holds personally responsible for the voices in his head, is at a Chili's restaurant in Crystal City explaining over a Philly cheese steak and fries why the United States needs mind-control weapons.** A former Green Beret who served in Vietnam, Alexander went on to a number of national security jobs, and rubbed shoulders with prominent military and political leaders. **Long known for taking an interest in exotic weapons, his 1980 article, \"[The New Mental Battlefield](www.wanttoknow.info/mk/alexander-new-battlefield.pdf),\" published in the Army journal Military Review, is cited by self-described victims as proof of his complicity in mind control.** Now retired from the government and living in Las Vegas, Alexander continues to advise the military. He is in the Washington area that day for an official meeting. Beneath a shock of white hair is the mind of a self-styled military thinker. Alexander belongs to a particular set of Pentagon advisers who consider themselves defense intellectuals, focusing on big-picture issues, future threats and new capabilities. Alexander's career led him from work on sticky foam that would stop an enemy in his or her tracks to dalliances in paranormal studies and psychics, which he still defends as operationally useful. In an earlier phone conversation, Alexander said that in the 1990s, when he took part in briefings at the CIA, there was never any talk of \"mind control, or mind-altering drugs or technologies, or anything like that.\" **According to Alexander, the military and intelligence agencies were still scared by the excesses of MK-ULTRA, the infamous CIA program that involved, in part, slipping LSD to unsuspecting victims. \"Until recently, anything that smacked of [mind control] was extremely dangerous\" because Congress would simply take the money away, he said.** Alexander acknowledged that \"there were some abuses that took place,\" but added that, on the whole, \"I would argue we threw the baby out with the bath water.\" But September 11, 2001, changed the mood in Washington, and some in the national security community are again expressing interest in mind control, particularly a younger generation of officials who weren't around for MK-ULTRA. \"It's interesting, that it's coming back,\" Alexander observed. While Alexander scoffs at the notion that he is somehow part of an elaborate plot to control people's minds, he acknowledges support for learning how to tap into a potential enemy's brain. He gives as an example the possible use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, for lie detection. \"Brain mapping\" with fMRI theoretically could allow interrogators to know when someone is lying by watching for activity in particular parts of the brain. For interrogating terrorists, fMRI could come in handy, Alexander suggests. But any conceivable use of the technique would fall far short of the kind of mind-reading TIs complain", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt:12:24021ecce60b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15168, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "for learning how to tap into a potential enemy's brain.

For interrogating terrorists, fMRI could come in handy, Alexander suggests. But any conceivable use of the technique would fall far short of the kind of mind-reading TIs complain about. Alexander also is intrigued by the possibility of using electronic means to modify behavior. The dilemma of the war on terrorism, he notes, is that it never ends. So what do you do with enemies, such as those at Guantanamo: keep them there forever? That's impractical. Behavior modification could be an alternative, he says. \"Maybe I can fix you, or electronically neuter you, so it's safe to release you into society, so you won't come back and kill me,\" Alexander says. It's only a matter of time before technology allows that scenario to come true, he continues. \"We're now getting to where we can do that.\" He pauses for a moment to take a bite of his sandwich. \"Where does that fall in the ethics spectrum? That's a really tough question.\" **When Alexander encounters a query he doesn't want to answer, such as one about the ethics of mind control, he smiles and raises his hands level to his chest, as if balancing two imaginary weights. In one hand is mind control and the sanctity of free thought - and in the other hand, a tad higher - is the war on terrorism.** But none of this has anything to do with the TIs, he says. \"Just because things are secret, people tend to extrapolate. Common sense does not prevail, and even when you point out huge leaps in logic that just cannot be true, they are not dissuaded.\" What is it that brings someone, even an intelligent person, to ascribe the experience of hearing disembodied voices to government weapons? In her book, *Abducted*, Harvard psychologist Susan Clancy examines a group that has striking parallels to the TIs: people who believe they've been kidnapped by aliens. The similarities are often uncanny: Would-be abductees describe strange pains, and feelings of being watched or targeted. And although the alleged abductees don't generally have auditory hallucinations, they do sometimes believe that their thoughts are controlled by aliens, or that they've been implanted with advanced technology. (On the online forum, some TIs posted vociferous objections to the parallel, concerned that the public finds UFOs even weirder than mind control. \"It will keep us all marginalized and discredited,\" one griped.) Clancy argues that the main reason people believe they've been abducted by aliens is that it provides them with a compelling narrative to explain their perception that strange things have happened to them, such", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt:13:76ac5be898f1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15169, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "thoughts are controlled by aliens, or that they've been implanted with advanced technology.

Clancy argues that the main reason people believe they've been abducted by aliens is that it provides them with a compelling narrative to explain their perception that strange things have happened to them, such as marks on their bodies (marks others would simply dismiss as bruises), stimulation to their sexual organs (as the TIs describe) or feelings of paranoia. \"It's not just an explanation for your problems; it's a source of meaning for your life,\" Clancy says. In the case of TIs, mind-control weapons are an explanation for the voices they hear in their head. Socrates heard a voice and thought it was a demon; Joan of Arc heard voices from God. As one TI noted in an e-mail: \"Each person undergoing this harassment is looking for the solution to the problem. Each person analyzes it through his or her own particular spectrum of beliefs. If you are a scientific-minded person, then you will probably analyze the situation from that perspective and conclude it must be done with some kind of electronic devices. If you are a religious person, you will see it as a struggle between the elements of whatever religion you believe in. If you are maybe, perhaps more eccentric, you may think that it is alien in nature.\" Or, if you happen to live in the United States in the early 21st century, you may fear the growing power of the NSA, CIA and FBI. Being a victim of government surveillance is also, arguably, better than being insane. In Waugh's novella based on his own painful experience, when Pinfold concludes that hidden technology is being used to infiltrate his brain, he \"felt nothing but gratitude in his discovery.\" Why? \"He might be unpopular; he might be ridiculous; but he was not mad.\" Ralph Hoffman, a professor of psychiatry at Yale who has studied auditory hallucinations, regularly sees people who believe the voices are a part of government harassment (others believe they are God, dead relatives or even ex-girlfriends). Not all people who hear voices are schizophrenic, he says, noting that people can hear voices episodically in highly emotional states. What exactly causes these voices is still unknown, but one thing is certain: People who think the voices are caused by some external force are rarely dissuaded from their delusional belief, he says. \"These are highly emotional and gripping experiences that are so compelling for them that ordinary reality seems bland.\" Perhaps because the experience is so vivid, he says, even some of those who improve through treatment merely decide the medical regimen somehow helped protect their brain from government weapons.

Scott Temple, a professor of psychiatry at Penn State University who has been involved in two recent studies of auditory hallucinations, notes that those who suffer such hallucinations frequently lack insight into their illness. Even among those who do understand they are sick, \"that awareness comes and goes,\" he says. \"People feel overwhelmed, and the delusional interpretations return.\" Back at the Philadelphia train station, \"handlers\" had spoken to him only briefly - they weren't in the right position to attack him, Girard surmises, based on the lack of voices. Today, his conversation jumps more rapidly from one subject to the next: victims of radiation experiments, his hatred of George H.W. Bush, MK-ULTRA, his personal experiences. Asked about his studies at Penn, he replies by talking about his problems with reading: \"I told you, everything I write they dictate to me,\" he says, referring again to the voices. \"When I read, they're reading to me. My eyes go across; they're moving my eyes down the line. They're reading it to me. When I close the book, I can't remember a thing I read. That's why they do it.\" The week before, Girard had pointed to only one person who appeared suspicious to him - a young African American man reading a book; this time, however, he hears more voices, which leads him to believe the station is crawling with agents. \"Let's change our location,\" Girard says after a while. \"I'm sure they have 40 or 50 people in here today. I escaped their surveillance last time - they won't let that happen again.\" Asked to explain the connection between mind control and the University of Pennsylvania, which Girard alleges is involved in the conspiracy, he begins to talk about defense contractors located near the Philadelphia campus: \"General Electric was right next to the parking garage; General Electric Space Systems occupies a huge building right over there. From that building, you could see into the studio where I was doing my work most of the time. I asked somebody what they were doing there. You know, it had to do with computers. GE Space Systems. They were supposed to be tracking missile debris from this location . . . pardon me. What was your question again?\" **Yet many parts of Girard's life seem to reflect that of any affluent 70-year-old bachelor. He travels frequently to France for extended vacations and takes part in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt:15:b9fd986953fe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15171, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "into the studio where I was doing my work most of the time.

What was your question again?\" **Yet many parts of Girard's life seem to reflect that of any affluent 70-year-old bachelor. He travels frequently to France for extended vacations and takes part in French cultural activities in Philadelphia. He has set up a travel scholarship at the Cleveland Institute of Art in the name of his late mother, who attended school there (he changed his last name 27 years ago for \"personal reasons\"), and he travels to meet the students who benefit from the fund. ** **And while the bulk of his time is spent on his research and writing about mind control, he has other interests. He follows politics and describes outings with friends and family members with whom he doesn't talk about mind control, knowing they would view it skeptically.** Girard acknowledges that some of his experiences mirror symptoms of schizophrenia, but asked if he ever worried that the voices might in fact be caused by mental illness, he answers sharply with one word: \"No.\" How, then, does he know the voices are real? \"How do you know you know anything?\" Girard replies. \"How do you know I exist? How do you know this isn't a dream you're having, from which you'll wake up in a few minutes? I suppose that analogy is the closest thing: You know when you have a dream. Sometimes it could be perfectly lucid, but you know it's a dream.\" The very \"realness\" of the voices is the issue - how do you disbelieve something you perceive as real? That's precisely what Hoffman, the Yale psychiatrist, points out: So lucid are the voices that the sufferers - regardless of their educational level or self-awareness - are unable to see them as anything but real. \"One thing I can assure you,\" Hoffman says, \"is that for them, it feels real.\" It looks like almost any other small political rally in Washington. Posters adorn the gate on the southwest side of the Capitol Reflecting Pool, as attendees set up a table with press materials, while volunteers test a loudspeaker and set out coolers filled with bottled water. The sun is out, the weather is perfect, and an eclectic collection of people from across the country has gathered to protest mind control. There is not a tinfoil hat to be seen. Only the posters and paraphernalia hint at the unusual. \"Stop USA electronic harassment,\" urges one poster. \"Directed Energy Assaults,\" reads another. Smaller signs in the shape of tombstones say, \"RIP MKULTRA.\" The main display, set in front of the speaker's lectern has a more extended message: \"HELP STOP", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt:16:79a283993b0d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15172, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "sun is out, the weather is perfect, and an eclectic collection of people from across the country has gathered to protest mind control.

Smaller signs in the shape of tombstones say, \"RIP MKULTRA.\" The main display, set in front of the speaker's lectern has a more extended message: \"HELP STOP HI-TECH ASSAULT PSYCHOTRONIC TORTURE.\" About 35 TIs show up for the June rally, in addition to a few friends and family members. Speakers alternate between giving personal testimonials and descriptions of research into mind-control technology. Most of the gawkers at the rally are foreign tourists. A few hecklers snicker at the signs, but mostly people are either confused or indifferent. The articles on mind control at the table - from mainstream news magazines - go untouched. \"How can you expect people to get worked up over this if they don't care about eavesdropping or eminent domain?\" one man challenges after stopping to flip through the literature. Mary Ann Stratton, who is manning the table, merely shrugs and smiles sadly. There is no answer: Everyone at the rally acknowledges it is an uphill battle. **In general, the outlook for TIs is not good; many lose their jobs, houses and family. Depression is common. But for many at the rally, experiencing the community of mind-control victims seems to help.** One TI, a man who had been a rescue swimmer in the Coast Guard before voices in his head sent him on a downward spiral, expressed the solace he found among fellow TIs in a long e-mail to another TI: \"I think that the only people that can help are people going through the same thing. Everyone else will not believe you, or they are possibly involved.\" In the end, though, nothing could help him enough. In August 2006, he would commit suicide. But at least for the day, the rally is boosting TI spirits. Girard, in what for him is an ebullient mood, takes the microphone. A small crowd of tourists gathers at the sidelines, listening with casual interest. With the Capitol looming behind him, he reaches the crescendo of his speech, rallying the attendees to remember an important thing: They are part of a single community. \"I've heard it said, 'We can't get anywhere because everyone's story is different.' We are all the same,\" Girard booms. \"You knew someone with the power to commit you to the electronic concentration camp system.\" Several weeks after the rally, Girard shows up for a meeting with a reporter at the stately Mayflower Hotel in Washington, where he has stayed frequently over the two decades he has traveled to the capital to battle mind control.

He walks in with a lit cigarette, which he apologetically puts out after a hotel employee tells him smoking isn't allowed anymore. He is half an hour late - delayed, he says, by a meeting on Capitol Hill. Wearing a monogrammed dress shirt and tie, he looks, as always, serious and professional. Girard declines to mention whom on Capitol Hill he'd met with, other than to say it was a congressional staffer. Embarrassment is likely a factor: Girard readily acknowledges that most people he meets with, ranging from scholars to politicians, ignore his entreaties or dismiss him as a lunatic. Lately, his focus is on [his Web site](https://web.archive.org/web/20080220230633/http://www.icomw.org/intro.asp), which he sees as the culmination of nearly a quarter-century of research. When completed, it will contain more than 300 pages of documents. What next? Maybe he'll move to France (there are victims there, too), or maybe the U.S. government will finally just kill him, he says. Meanwhile, he is always searching for absolute proof that the government has decoded the brain. His latest interest is [LifeLog](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2003/05/58909), a project once funded by the Pentagon that he read about in Wired News. The article described it this way: \"The embryonic LifeLog program would dump everything an individual does into a giant database: every e-mail sent or received, every picture taken, every Web page surfed, every phone call made, every TV show watched, every magazine read. All of this - and more - would combine with information gleaned from a variety of sources: a GPS transmitter to keep tabs on where that person went, audiovisual sensors to capture what he or she sees or says, and biomedical monitors to keep track of the individual's health.\" Girard suggests that the government, using similar technology, has \"catalogued\" his life over the past two years - every sight and sound (Evelyn Waugh, in his mind-control book, writes about his character's similar fear that his harassers were creating a file of his entire life). Girard thinks the government can control his movements, inject thoughts into his head, cause him pain day and night. He believes that he will die a victim of mind control. Is there any reason for optimism? Girard hesitates, then asks a rhetorical question. \"Why, despite all this, why am I the same person? Why am I Harlan Girard?\" **For all his anguish, be it the result of mental illness or, as Girard contends, government mind control, the voices haven't managed to conquer the thing", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt:18:bd45556dc0bc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15174, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "voicesinheadelectronicharassment", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "can control his movements, inject thoughts into his head, cause him pain day and night.

This highly intriguing article reveals that the US government recovered over 1,000 tons of secret documents from the Nazis. **These astonishing documents showed beyond a shadow of a doubt that in almost all areas of scientific research, the Nazis were far ahead of the allied forces - often by a factor of 10 years or more. ** How was this possible? With similar financial resources and brain power to that of the allies, how did they make such huge leaps in technology in such a short span of time? It doesn't really make sense unless you consider the possibility that they might have had access to technology from some advanced civilization. Could they have recovered one or more crashed UFOs and back engineered the technology? Sound far fetched? Can you come up with a better explanation?

War Secrets by the Thousands Harper's Magazine October 1946, Page 329 **Secrets by the Thousands**** By C. Lester Walker** *Harper's readers are familiar with Mr. Walker's articles and the skillful mechanics of the Allied war. He now gives us a look at some of the disconcertingly effective tricks that were hidden up the enemy sleeve.* **Someone wrote to Wright Field recently, saying he understood this country had got together quite a collection of enemy war secrets, that many were now on public sale, and could he, please, be sent everything on German jet engines. The Air Documents Division of the Army Air Forces answered:** **\"Sorry - but that would be fifty tons.\"** Moreover, that fifty tons was just a small portion of what is today undoubtedly the biggest collection of captured enemy war secrets ever assembled. If you always thought of war secrets - as who hasn't? - as coming in sixes and sevens, as a few items of information readily handed on to the properly interested authorities, it may interest you to learn that the war secrets in this collection run into the thousands, that the mass of documents is mountainous, and that there was never before been anything quite comparable to it. The collection is today chiefly in three places: Wright Field (Ohio), the Library of Congress, and the Department of Commerce. Wright Field is working from a documents \"mother lode\" of fifteen hundred tons. In Washington, the Office of Technical Services (which has absorbed the Office of the Publication Board, the government agency originally set up to handle the collection) reports that tens of thousands of tons of material", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology.txt:0:3fe6b5219671", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15179, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "and that there was never before been anything quite comparable to it.

Wright Field is working from a documents \"mother lode\" of fifteen hundred tons. In Washington, the Office of Technical Services (which has absorbed the Office of the Publication Board, the government agency originally set up to handle the collection) reports that tens of thousands of tons of material are involved. **It is estimated that over a million separate items must be handled, and that they are, very likely, practically all the scientific, industrial and military secrets of Nazi Germany.** One Washington official has called it \"the greatest single source of this type of material in the world, the first orderly exploitation of an entire country's brain-power.\" How the collection came to be goes back, for beginnings, to one day in 1944 when the Allied Combined Chief' of Staff set in motion a colossal search for war secrets in occupied German territory. They created a group of military-civilian teams, termed the Joint Intelligence Objectives Committee, which was to follow the invading armies into Germany and uncover all her military, scientific, and industrial secrets for early use against Japan. These teams worked against tine to get the most vital information before it was. destroyed, and in getting it performed prodigies of ingenuity and tenacity. At an optical company at Wetzlav, near Frankfurt, for example, the American colonel investigating felt positive that the high executives were holding out on him. But nothing would shake their story: they had given him everything. He returned next day with a legal document which he asked them all to sign. It declared they had turned over \"all scientific and trade data; and if not, would accept the consequences.\" Two days later they glumly signed the document, then led he colonel to a cache in a warehouse wall. From a safe tumbled out the secret file on optical instruments, microscopy, aiming devices. One two-man search team found itself completely stymied. Records that they had to find had completely disappeared. A rumor indicated they might have been hidden in a mountain. The two scoured the region in a jeep. Nothing. But keeping at it, they stumbled one day onto a small woods road whose entrance was posted: Achtung! Minen! Gingerly, slowly, they inched their jeep in. Nothing happened. But a concrete dugout sunk in the hill revealed another sign: \"Opening Will Cause Explosion.\" \"We tossed a coin,\" one member of this search team said later, \"and the loser hitched the jeep tow rope to the dugout door, held his breath! and stepped on the gas.\" There was no explosion. The door-ripped from its hinges. The sought-for secret files were inside.

The door-ripped from its hinges. The sought-for secret files were inside. The German Patent Office put some of its most secret patents down a sixteen-hundred-foot mine shaft at Heringen, then piled liquid oxygen, in cylinders, on top of them. When the American Joint Intelligence Objectives team found them, it was doubtful that they could be saved. They were legible, but in such bad shape that a trip to the surface would make them disintegrate. Photo equipment and a crew were therefore lowered into the shaft and a complete microfilm record made of the patents there. **PERHAPS one of the most exciting searches was also the grimmest. This was the hunt for hidden documents which might reveal that Nazi scientists had frozen human beings to death and then tried to bring them back to life again.** Interviewing four Nazi doctors one day in June 1945, at a laboratory of the Institut fur Luftfahrtmedizin, at Gut Hirschau, Bavaria, an American medical corps major, Leo Alexander, was struck with the dreadful conviction, despite repeated denials, that this had occurred. His suspicion were aroused by three things. All the small animal laboratory equipment was carefully preserved; all large-animal equipment destroyed. One of the doctors wanted to dissolve his research institute and dismiss his staff. And none of the scientists could find any data on human beings at all, not even on those rescued from North Sea waters and saved by the new revival techniques. Did this mean that everything of the sort was hidden away with other data which, the doctors didn't want to show? Wishing to leave the four Germans in a frame of mind not to destroy their records, the American concealed his suspicions, and, for the time being, transferred his search elsewhere. Chance suddenly played into his hands. The Allied radio one night broadcast a grim tale of the Dachau concentration camp. Researches on death, and treatment of shock, from exposure to cold had been performed on prisoners. The broadcast named the leading experimenter, one Dr. Rascher, and called him a member of the medical staff of the SS. For Alexander this was a lead. He happened just to have learned that the American Seventh Army had recently captured a vast mass of especially secret SS records. He therefore headed for the Seventh Army Documents Center to see what was there. **There was more than he anticipated. Even to the complete and final report - Himmler's personal copy with his green-penciled annotations all over it - with the names of Rascher and all others involved, and containing all the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology.txt:2:aa79110c2c24", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15181, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "For Alexander this was a lead.

Even to the complete and final report - Himmler's personal copy with his green-penciled annotations all over it - with the names of Rascher and all others involved, and containing all the damning details of the almost unbelievable experiments.** **Victims had been immersed naked in ice water until they lost consciousness. All the time elaborate testings were constantly made:** rectal, skin, and interior-of-the-stomach temperatures; pulse, blood sugar, blood chlorides, blood count and sedimentation; urine tests; spinal fluid. Appendix 7, Figure 5, showed that **seven subjects were chilled to death beyond revival in from fifty-three to one hundred and six minutes.** \"This table,\" Alexander commented in his own report, \"is certainly the most laconic confession of seven murders in existence.\" It had been with the rest of the documents - in Himmler's private cave in mountain at Hallein. Even though the side of the mountain had been dynamited down over the cave mouth, the American searchers had found it. The earliest Joint Intelligence Objectives search teams were followed by others, which were to dig out industrial and scientific secrets in particular. The Technical Industrial Intelligence Committee was one group of these, composed of three hundred and eighty civilians representing seventeen American industries. Later came the teams of the Office of the Publication Board itself and many more groups direct from private industry. Of the latter - called, in Germany, Field Intelligence Agencies, Technical (FIAT) - there have been over five hundred; of one to ten members each, operating by invitation and under the aegis of the OPB. Today the search still goes on. The Office of Technical Services has a European staff of four to five hundred. At Hoechst, it has one hundred abstractors who struggle feverishly to keep ahead of the forty OTS document-recording cameras which route to them each month over one hundred thousand feet of microfilm. II **What did we find? You'd like some outstanding examples from the war secrets collection?** **The head of the communications unit of Technical Industrial Intelligence Branch opened his desk drawer and took out the tiniest vacuum tube I had ever seen. It was about half thumb-size.** **\"Notice it is heavy porcelain - not glass - and thus virtually indestructible. It is a thousand watt - one-tenth the size of similar American tube. Today our manufacturers know the secret of making it...**. And here's something....\" He pulled some brown, papery-looking ribbon off a spool. It was a quarter-inch wide, with a dull and a shiny side. \"That's Magnetophone tape,\" he said. \"It's plastic, metallized on one side with iron oxide.

In Germany that supplanted phonograph recordings. A day's Radio program can be magnetized on one reel. You can demagnetize it, wipe it off and put a new program on at any time. No needle; so absolutely no noise or record wear. An hour-long reel costs fifty cents.\" **He showed me then what had been two of the most closely-guarded technical secrets of the war: the infra-red device which the Germans invented for seeing at night, and the remarkable diminutive generator which operated it. **German cars could drive at any speed in a total blackout, seeing objects clear as day two hundred meters ahead. Tanks with this device could spot targets two miles away. As a sniper scope it enabled German riflemen to pick off a man in total blackness. There was a sighting tube, and a selenium screen out front. The screen caught the incoming infra-red light, which drove electrons from the selenium along the tube to another screen which was electrically charged and fluorescent. A visible image appeared on this screen. Its clearness and its accuracy for aiming purposes were phenomenal. Inside the tube, distortion of the stream of electrons by the earth's magnetism was even allowed for! **The diminutive generator - five inches across - stepped up current from an ordinary flashlight battery to 15,000 volts. It had a walnut-sized motor which spun a rotor at 10,000 rpm - so fast that originally it had destroyed all lubricants with the great amount of ozone it produced. The Germans had developed a new grease: chlorinated paraffin oil. The generator then ran 3,000 hours!** A canvas bag on the sniper's back housed the device. His rifle had two triggers. He pressed one for a few seconds to operate the generator and the scope.. Then the other to kill his man in the dark. \"That captured secret,\" my guide declared, \"we first used at Okinawa - to the bewilderment of the Japs.\" We got, in addition, among these prize secrets, the technique and the machine for making the world's most remarkable electric condenser. Millions of condensers are essential to the radio and radar industry. **Our condensers were always made of metal foil. This one is made of paper, coated with 1/250,000 of an inch of vaporized zinc. Forty per cent smaller, twenty per cent cheaper than our condensers, it is also self-healing.** That is, if a breakdown occurs (like a fuse blowing out), the zinc film", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology.txt:4:eba6fcd5feb9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15183, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "among these prize secrets, the technique and the machine for making the world's most remarkable electric condenser.

Forty per cent smaller, twenty per cent cheaper than our condensers, it is also self-healing.** That is, if a breakdown occurs (like a fuse blowing out), the zinc film evaporates, the paper immediately insulates, and the condenser is right again. It keeps on working through multiple breakdowns - at fifty per cent higher voltage than our condensers! To most American radio experts this is magic, double-distilled. Mica was another thing. None is mined in Germany, so during the war our Signal Corps was mystified. Where was Germany getting it? One day a certain piece of mica was handed to one of our experts in the U.S. Bureau of Mines for analysis and opinion. \"Natural mica,\" he reported, \"and no impurities.\" But the mica was synthetic. The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Silicate Research had discovered how to make it and - something which had always eluded scientists - in large sheets. We know now, thanks to FIAT teams, that ingredients of natural mica were melted in crucibles of carbon capable of taking 2,350 degrees of heat, and then - this was the real secret - cooled in a special way. Complete absence of vibration was the first essential. Then two forces directly perpendicular to each other were applied. One, vertically, was a controlled gradient of temperature in the cooling. At right angles to this, horizontally, was introduced a magnetic field. This forced the formation of the crystals in large laminated sheets on that plane. \"You see this . . .\" the head of Communications Unit, TIIB, said to me. It was metal and looked like a complicated doll's house with the roof off. **\"It is the chassis or frame, for a radio. To make the same thing, Americans would machine cut, hollow, shape, fit - a dozen different processes. This is done on a press in one operation. It is called the 'cold extrusion' process. We do it with some soft, splattery metals. But by this process the Germans do it with cold steel! Thousands of parts now made as castings or drop forgings or from malleable iron can now be made this way. The production speed increase is a little matter of one thousand per cent.\"** This one war secret alone, many American steel men believe, will revolutionize dozens of our metal fabrication industries.

In textiles the war secrets collection has produced so many revelations that American textile men are a little dizzy. There is a German rayon-weaving machine, discovered a year ago by the American 'Knitting Machine' Team, which increases production in relation to floor space by one hundred and fifty percent. Their \"Links-Links\" loom produces a ladderless, run-proof hosiery. New German needle-making machinery, it is thought will revolutionize that business in both the United Kingdom and the United States. There is a German method for pulling the wool from sheepskins without injury to hide or fiber, by use of an enzyme. Formerly the \"puller\" - a trade secret - was made from animal pancreas from American packing houses. During the war the Nazis made it from a mold called aspergil paraciticus, which they seeded in bran. It results not only in better wool, but in ten per cent greater yield. Another discovery was a way to put a crimp in viscose rayon fibers which gives them the appearance, warmth, wear resistance, and reaction-to-dyes of wool. The secret here, our investigators found, was the addition to the cellulose of twenty-five per cent fish protein. **But of all the industrial secrets, perhaps, the biggest windfall came from the laboratories and plants of the great German cartel, I. G. Farbenindustrie. Never before, it is claimed, was there such a store-house of secret information. It covers liquid and solid fuels, metallurgy, synthetic rubber, textiles, chemicals, plastics, drugs, dyes. One American dye authority declares:** **\"It includes the production know-how and the secret formulas for over fifty thousand dyes. Many of them are faster and better than ours. Many are colors we were never able to make. The American dye industry will be advanced at least ten years.\"** III **IN MATTERS of food, medicine, and branches of the military art the finds of the search teams were no less impressive. And in aeronautics and guided missiles they proved to be downright alarming.** One of the food secrets the Nazis had discovered was a way to sterilize fruit juices without heat. The juice was filtered, then cooled, then carbonated and stored under eight atmospheres of carbon-dioxide pressure. Later the carbon-dioxide was removed; the juice passed through another filter - which, this time, germ-proofed it - and then was bottled. Something, perhaps, for American canners to think about. Milk pasteurization by ultra-violet light has always failed in other countries, but the Germans had found how to do it by using light tubes of great length, and simultaneously how to enrich the milk with vitamin D. At a plant in Kiel, British searchers of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Committee found that cheese was being made -", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology.txt:6:aaeb7385de1f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15185, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "passed through another filter - which, this time, germ-proofed it - and then was bottled. Something, perhaps, for American canners to think about.

At a plant in Kiel, British searchers of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Committee found that cheese was being made - \"good quality Hollander and Tilitser\" - by a new method at unheard-of speed. \"Eighty minutes from the renneting to the hooping of the curd,\" report the investigators. The cheese industry around the world had never been able to equal that. Butter (in a creamery near Hamburg) was being produced by something long wished for by American butter makers: a continuous butter making machine. An invention of dairy equipment manufacturers in Stuttgart, it took up less space than American churns and turned out fifteen hundred pounds an hour. The machine was promptly shipped to this country to be tested by the American Butter Institute. Among other food innovations was a German way of making yeast in almost limitless quantities. The waste sulfite liquor from the beechwood used to manufacture cellulose was treated with an organism known to bacteriologists as candida arborea at temperatures higher than ever used in yeast manufacture before. The finished product served as both animal and human food. Its caloric value is four times that of lean meat, and it contains twice as much protein. **The Germans also had developed new methods of preserving food by plastics and new, advanced refrigeration techniques. Refrigeration and air-conditioning on German U-boats had become so efficient that the submarines could travel from Germany to the Pacific, operate there for two months, and then return to Germany without having to take on fresh water for the crew.** A secret plastics mixture (among its ingredients were polyvinyl acetate, chalk, and talc) was used to coat bread and cheese. A loaf fresh from the oven was dipped, dried, redipped, then heated half an hour at 285 degrees. It would be unspoiled and good to eat eight months later. \"As for medical secrets in this collection,\" one Army-surgeon has remarked,** \"some of them will save American medicine years of research; some of them are revolutionary - like, for instance, the German technique for treatment after prolonged and usually fatal exposure to cold.\" This discovery - revealed to us by Major Alexander's search already mentioned - reversed everything medical science thought about the subject. In every one of the dread experiments the subjects were most successfully revived, both temporarily and permanently, by immediate immersion in hot water. In two cases of complete standstill of heart and cessation of respiration, a hot bath at 122 degrees brought both subjects back to life. **Before our war with Japan ended,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology.txt:7:715389edc8a3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15186, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "and usually fatal exposure to cold.\" This discovery - revealed to us by Major Alexander's search already mentioned - reversed everything medical science thought about the subject.

Another discovery was periston, a substitute for the blood liquid. An oxidation production of adrenalin (adrenichrome) was produced in quantity successfully only by the Nazis and was used with good results in combating high blood pressure (of which 750,000 persons die annually in the United States). Today we have the secret of manufacture and considerable of the supply. Likewise of great importance medically were certain researches by Dr. Boris Rojewsky of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Biophysics at Frankfurt. These were on the ionization of air as related to health. **Positively ionized air was discovered to have deleterious effects upon human well-being, and to account for the discomfort and depression felt at times when the barometer is falling. In many persons, it was found, its presence brought on asthma, hay fever, and nervous tension. It raised high blood pressure, sometimes to the danger point. It would bring on the symptoms common in mountain sickness - labored and rapid breathing, dizziness, fatigue, sleepiness.** **Negatively ionized air, however, did all the opposite. It was exhilarating, creating a feeling of high spirits and well-being. Mental depression was wiped out by it.** In pathological cases it steadied breathing, reduced high blood pressure, was a check on allergies and asthma. The importance of its presence wherever human beings live, work, or recuperate from illness may some day make its production one of the major functions of air conditioning. IV **But of highest significance for the future were the Nazi secrets in aviation and in various types of missiles.** **\"The V-2 rocket, which bombed London,\" an Army Air Force publication reports, \"was just a toy compared to what the Germans had up their sleeve.\"** **When the war ended, we now know, they had 138 types of guided missiles in various stages of production or development, using every known kind of remote control and fuse: radio, radar, wire, continuous wave, acoustics, infra-red, light beams, and magnetics, to name some; and for power, all methods of jet propulsion for either subsonic or supersonic speeds.

Jet propulsion had even been applied to helicopter flight.** The fuel was piped to combustion chambers at the rotor blade tips, where it exploded, whirling the blades around like a lawn sprinkler or pinwheel. As for rocket propulsion, their A-4 rocket, which was just getting into large scale production when the war ended, was forty-six feet long, weighed over 24,000 pounds, and traveled 230 miles. It rose sixty miles above the earth and had a maximum speed of 3,735 miles an hour - three times that of the earth's rotation at the equator. The secret of its supersonic speed, we know today, lay in its rocket motor which used liquid oxygen and alcohol for fuel. It was either radio controlled or self-guided to its target by gyroscopic means. Since its speed was supersonic, it could not be heard before it struck. Another German rocket which was coming along was the A-9. This was bigger still - 29,000 pounds - and had wings which gave it a flying range of 3,000 miles. It was manufactured at the famous Peenemunde army experiment station and achieved the unbelievable speed of 5,870 miles an hour. A long range rocket-motored bomber which, the war documents indicate, was never completed merely because of the war's quick ending, would have been capable of flight from Germany to New York in forty minutes. Pilot-guided from a pressurized cabin, it would have flown at an altitude of 154 miles. Launching was to be by catapult at 500 miles an hour, and the ship would rise to its maximum altitude in as short a time as four minutes. There, fuel exhausted, it would glide through the outer atmosphere, bearing down on its target. With one hundred bombers of this type the Germans hoped to destroy any city on earth in a few days' operations. **Little wonder, then, that today Army Air Force experts declare publicly that in rocket power and guided missiles the Nazis were ahead of us by at least ten years.** The Germans even had devices ready which would take care of pilots forced to leave supersonic planes in flight. Normally a pilot who stuck his head out at such speeds would have it shorn off. His parachute on opening would burst in space. To prevent these calamitous happenings an ejector seat had been invented which flung the pilot clear instantaneously. His chute was already burst, that is, made of latticed ribbons which checked his fall only after the down-drag of his", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology.txt:9:6e7bf7c15a26", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15188, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__4610_secret_nazi_war_technology", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "Germans even had devices ready which would take care of pilots forced to leave supersonic planes in flight.

His chute was already burst, that is, made of latticed ribbons which checked his fall only after the down-drag of his weight began to close its holes. **A Nazi variation of the guided air missile was a torpedo for underwater work which went unerringly to its mark, drawn by the propeller sound of the victim ship from as far away as ten miles. This missile swam thirty feet below the water, at forty miles an hour, and left no wake. When directly under its target, it exploded.** All such revelations naturally raise the question: was Germany so far advanced in air, rocket, and missile research that, given a little more time, she might have won the war? Her war secrets, as now disclosed, would seem to indicate that possibility. And the Deputy Commanding General of Army Air Forces Intelligence, Air Technical Service Command, has told the Society of Aeronautical Engineers within the past few months: \"The Germans were preparing rocket surprises for the whole world in general and England in particular which would have, it is believed, changed the course of the war if the invasion had been postponed for so short a time as half a year.\" V **For the release and dissemination of all these one-time secrets the Office of the Publication Board was established by an order of President Truman within ten days after Japan surrendered. The order directed that not only enemy war secrets should be published, but also (with some exceptions) all American secrets, scientific and technical, of all government war boards.** (The Office of Scientific Research and Development, the National Research Council, and other such.) And thereby was created what is being termed now the biggest publishing problem a government agency ever had to handle. For the war secrets, which conventionally used to be counted in scores, will run to three-quarters of a million separate documentary items (two-thirds of them on aeronautics) and will require several years and several hundreds of people to screen and prepare them for wide public use. Today translators and abstracters of the Office of Technical Services, successor to the OPB, are processing them at the rate of about a thousand a week. Indexing and cataloging the part of the collection which will be permanently kept may require more than two millions cards; and at Wright Field the task is so complicated that electric punch-card machine are to be installed.

A whole new glossary of German-English terms has had to be compiled - something like forty thousand words on new technical and scientific items. With so many documents, it has, of course, been impossible because of time and money limitations to reprint or reproduce more than a very few. To tell the public what is available, therefore, the OTS issues a bibliography weekly. This contains the newest war secrets information as released - with titles, prices of copies currently available or to be made up, and an abstract of contents. The original document, or the microfilm copy, is then generally sent to the Library of Congress, which is now the greatest depository. To make them more easily accessible to the public, the Library sends copies, when enough are available, to about 125 so-called \"depository\" libraries throughout the United States. **And is the public doing anything with these one-time war secrets? It is - it is eating them up. As many as twenty thousand orders have been filled in a month, and the order rate is now a thousand items a day. Scientists and engineers declare that the information is \"cutting years from the time we would devote to problems already scientifically investigated.\"** And American business men . . .! A run through the Publication Board's letters file shows the following; The Bendix Company in South Bend, Indiana, writes for a German patent on the record player changer \"with records stacked above the turntable.\" Pillsbury Mills wants to have what is available on German flour and bread production methods. Kendall Manufacturing Company (\"Soapine\") wants insect repellent compounds. Pioneer Hi-Bred Corn Company, Iowa, asks about \"interrogation of research workers at the agricultural high school at Hohenheim.\" Pacific Mills requests I. G. Farbenindustrie's water-repellent, crease-resistant finish for spun rayon. The Polaroid Company would like something on \"the status of exploitation of photography and optics in Germany.\" (There are, incidentally, ten to twenty thousand German patents yet to be screened.) The most insatiable customer is Amtorg, the Soviet Union's foreign trade organization. One of its representatives walked into the Publication Board office with the bibliography in hand and said, \"I want copies of everything.\" The Russians sent one order in May for $5,594.00 worth - two thousand separate war secrets reports. In general, they buy every report issued. Americans, too, think there is extraordinarily good prospecting in the war secrets lode. **Company executives practically park on the OTS's front doorstep, wanting to be first to get hold of a particular report on publication.

Some information is so valuable that to get it a single day ahead of a competitor, may be worth thousands of dollars. **But the OTS takes elaborate precautions to be sure that no report is ever available to anyone before general public release. After a certain American aircraft company had ordered a particular captured war document, it was queried as to whether the information therein had made it or saved it any money. The cost of the report had been a few dollars. The company answered: \"Yea - at least a hundred thousand dollars.\" **A research head of another business firm took notes for three hours in the OTS offices one day. \"Thanks very much,\" he said, as he stood to go, \"the notes from these documents are worth at least half a million dollars to my company.\"** **And after seeing the complete report the German synthetic fiber industry, one American manufacturer remarked:** **\"This report would be worth twenty million dollars to my company if it could have it exclusively.\"** **Of course you, and anybody else, can now have it, and lots of other once secret information, for a few dollars. All the war secrets, as released, are completely in the public domain.** **Note:** How can the Nazi technology have been so far superior to that of the allies?

It's us versus them, whoever they are. And the government helps to feed that. The government generates perceptions. And people think, well, there must be a reason for the government's position on this war. The truth of the matter is that we're in a heavily militarized society driven by greed, lust for profit, and wars are being created just to keep fueling that. It moves right into this ... idea of a manifest destiny. And then you leap into the 21st century where there are still people who believe, as in the [Project for the New American Century](https://www.wanttoknow.info/020907pnacprojectnewamericancentury), that it has to be that America must rule the world. We don't always consider that we're inheritors not only of a physical world, but we're inheritors of a consciousness. We're inheritors of thought structures. And the thought structures that we've inherited no longer serve a practical purpose in this country. We move into a false consciousness of fear, of separation from the rest of the world. I see the world as one. I think that human unity is the truth that surrounds all of us. **And when we start separating ourselves, polarized thinking is a precursor of war. When we go to war, we're living a lie. We're separating ourselves from part of humanity. It's a belief that we don't have an ability to be able to solve things, and somehow the power of our weapons is greater than the power of our reason or, even deeper, the power of our heart. *** - former Congressman Dennis Kucinich I commit to staying open, never losing sight of my love and trust in humanity and the common good.

Human Rights belong to people collectively. To believe in rights for some and not others is a denial of the humanness of people worldwide. Yet, denial is exactly what Congress and George W. Bush did with the signing of the Military Commission Act of 2006.** The new official US policy is that torture and suspension of due process are acceptable for anyone the president deems to be a terrorist or supporter. **This act is the overt denial of the inalienable rights of human beings propagated in our Declaration of Independence and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. More so, US actions declared to the world that the US suspends human rights for those it believes are evil. The precious words, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,\" did not declare that only some men (and women) possess unalienable rights. Our independence was founded on the understanding that all men and women are recognized by this nation as having innate rights derived by their humanity. Likewise, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, created by the United Nations in 1948, signed and ratified by the US Congress, specifies in its preamble that \"recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.\" **The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been a guide for international law for most of six decades, and as such binds the United States to its general principles.** Article 10 states that \"everyone is entitled to full equality, to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him,\" and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights.txt:1:4ee40bae03f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15203, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.\" **The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been a guide for international law for most of six decades, and as such binds the United States to its general principles.** Article 10 states that \"everyone is entitled to full equality, to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him,\" and **Article 5 specifically prohibits torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Both of these basic human rights have been superceded by the passage the of Military Commissions Act of 2006.** Additionally, the Universal Declaration of Human rights declares that everyone has the right to freedom of thought and freedom of expression and opinion. This means that humans have the inalienable right to be able to freely think their own thoughts and discover their own truths.

Freedom of thought or cognitive liberty is the natural human right of each person to be secure in their ability to perceive the world to the best of their ability. To have true cognitive liberty in a world as complex as ours would mean that first we must have access to truthful and unbiased information about the actions of others and the general state of the world.

Wright Mills, in his 1956 book *The Power Elite*, documents how World War II solidified a trinity of power in the US, comprised of corporate, military and government elites in a centralized power structure motivated by class interests and working in unison through \"higher circles\" of contact and agreement. Mills described how the power elite were those \"who decide whatever is decided\" of major consequence.[[7]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn7) With the advent of the military-industrial complex after World War II, President Eisenhower observed that an internal military industrial power faction was consolidating their long-term plans for the domination of America and, eventually, the world. Eisenhower was in no position to fight these men, and history records his feelings on the subject with the text of his short farewell address: \"....But threats, new in kind or degree, constantly arise.

This elite group included not just generals and industrialists but philosophers, scientists, academics, and politicians who have now become the most powerful public-private war organization ever known. **Strauss espoused an elitist philosophy that fawned over the characteristics of those who inherited wealth and lived lives of leisure to pursue whatever their interests may be. His ideas have been transformed into a cogent ideology in which the media, religion, and government are used to subdue the masses while the real \"nobles\" follow their own will without regard to the laws designed to control lesser men.** Strauss was likewise fond of secrecy, as a necessity for control, because if the lesser men found out what was being done to them they would no doubt be upset. \"The people will not be happy to learn that there is only one natural right - the right of the superior to rule over the inferior, the master over the slave, the husband over the wife, and the wise few over the vulgar many.\" In *On Tyranny*, Strauss refers to this natural right as the \"tyrannical teaching\" of his beloved ancients..[[9]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn9) Leo Strauss, Albert Wohlstetter, and others at the University of Chicago's Committee on Social Thought receive wide credit for promoting the neo-conservative agenda through their students, Paul Wolfowitz, Allan Bloom, and Bloom's student Richard Perle.

Bush became CIA Director. Bush allowed the formation of \"Team B\" headed by Richard Pipes along with Paul Wolfowitz, Lewis Libby, Paul Nitze and others, who formed the second Committee on the Present Danger to raise awareness of the Soviet threat and the continuing need for a strong aggressive defense policy. Their efforts led to strong anti-Soviet positioning during the Reagan administration.

The current CPD proudly boasts on their website; \"In times of great challenge to the security of the United States, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents have traditionally joined to make an assertive defense of American interests. Twice before in American history, The Committee on the Present Danger has risen to this challenge. It emerged in 1950 as a bipartisan education and advocacy organization dedicated to building a national consensus for a strong defense against Soviet expansionism. In 1976, the Committee on the Present Danger reemerged, with leadership from the labor movement, bipartisan representatives of the foreign policy community and academia, all of whom were concerned about strategic drift in US security policy. With victory in the Cold War, the mission of the Committee on the Present Danger was considered complete and consequently was deactivated. Today, the current CPD promotes radical Islamists as the primary threat to the American people and millions of others who prize liberty. They claim that the threat is global.

Their key piece of information warfare was the Communist Red Menace.[[26]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn26) One of the opening salvos in this war of deception was fired by George Kennan, the American ambassador to Moscow, describing the Soviet threat in a \"long cable\" sent to Washington in 1946. Kennan spent decades studying the Russian political scene.

In the 1950s, one such group, the first Committee on the Present Danger (CPD), promulgated a series of \"gap crises.\" The Bomber Gap, the Missile Gap, the Space Gap, and the Brainwashing and Psychotronic Gap were used to justify increased military technology spending. **Congress was led to believe that the Soviets were a much greater threat than they actually were, and that a terrifying new weapon was being developed that threatened America.

In short, the strength of a field drops off in inverse proportion to the distance of the target from the source. Without a means of concentrating and directing a beam of energy across long distances, any effect that an EMF weapon may have would be limited to its immediate vicinity. From 1900 until his death in 1943, Nikola Tesla worked to develop just such a weapon. In a letter to the *New York Times* editor in 1908 Tesla wrote, \"When I spoke of future warfare I meant that it should be conducted by direct application of electrical waves without the use of aerial engines or other implements of destruction... What I said in regard to the greatest achievement of the man of science whose mind is bent upon the mastery of the physical universe, was nothing more than what I stated in one of my unpublished addresses, from which I quote: \"According to an adopted theory, every ponderable atom is differentiated from a tenuous fluid, filling all space merely by spinning motion, as a whirl of water in a calm lake. By being set in movement this fluid, the ether, becomes gross matter. Its movement arrested, the primary substance reverts to its normal state. It appears, then, possible for man through harnessed energy of the medium and suitable agencies for starting and stopping ether whirls to cause matter to form and disappear. At his command, almost without effort on his part, old worlds would vanish and new ones would spring into being. \"He could alter the size of this planet, control its seasons, adjust its distance from the sun, guide it on its eternal journey along any path he might choose, through the depths of the universe. He could make planets collide and produce his suns and stars, his heat and light; he could originate life in all its infinite forms. To cause at will the birth and death of matter would be man's grandest deed, which would give him the mastery of physical creation, make him fulfill his ultimate destiny.\"[[40]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn40)* * Tesla made several claims during the latter years of his life, published by the *New York Times* in what became an annual event.

The Manhattan Project, developed by the DOD in 1942, generated a vastly destructive weapon that required a well-established and unbelievably expensive aerospace industry, along with unprecedented levels of secrecy and autonomy from Congress and the public.[[46]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn46) The US government also ignored Tesla's offer to produce a \"city killing machine,\" which was composed of an electromagnetic shield and a wireless torpedo. Tesla made several proposals during the 1930s, none of which received funding. Among Tesla's claims, published annually on his birthday in the *New York Times,* were methods of harnessing the power of the sun to electrify the earth and provide free electrical power to anybody, anywhere. Tesla did, however, conceive of at least one device that became a major part of our nation's arsenal - radar. As early as 1917 he published his theory and developed the first prototype in 1934.

[[47]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn47) At first glance, it would seem probable that the military had taken over the management of Tesla's material. In fact, a number of projects related to his life's work were in development. For instance, the building of beam weapons at Wright Patterson Air Force Base under the code name \"Project Nick\"[[48]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn48) headed by Brigadier General L.C. Craigie. This project was however, cancelled due to an apparent lack of understanding of Tesla's means of transmitting high-energy waves without a loss of power over great distances. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began another project in 1958 codenamed \"Seesaw\" at Lawrence Livermore Labs[[49]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn49) aimed at combating reported Soviet advances in electromagnetic weapons and defenses, advances that many believe came about after 1952 when the bulk of Tesla's research and personal effects were turned over to his nephew, Sava Kosanovic, who promptly whisked them away to Yugoslavia. Eight years later Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev would state that, \"A new and fantastic weapon is in the hatching stage,\"[[50]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn50) horrifying many and prompting calls for more effective means of using EMF, espionage and counter-espionage. On February 9, 1981, the office of the Undersecretary of Defense Research and Engineering department sent a letter to the FBI that requested the papers of Tesla, stating, \"We believe that certain of Tesla's papers may contain basic principles which would be of considerable value to certain ongoing research within the DOD.* *It would be very helpful to have access to these papers. The letter was signed by Lt. Col. Allan J.

Mind-control, per se, refers to a well-funded, broad based series of programs designed to explore the furthest reaches of human cognitive ability. The Nazis, as well as the Japanese, had been experimenting on prisoners throughout the war. Recovery of the records of these experiments led the US to proceed with investigations into new means of interrogations and the building of resistance to interrogations of US personnel.[[55]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn55) **The CIA, in association with various other agencies, undertook a long series of experiments on unsuspecting prisoners, students, military personnel and others recruited into one of the at least 162 subprojects of what became known as MKULTRA**.[[56]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn56) Interest was certainly piqued by the case of Cardinal Mindseztny and the reports of brainwashing techniques used on American soldiers in prisoner of war camps in Korea[[57]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn57).

The leader in this pharmaceutical and psychological research was Dr. Ewen Cameron.** Cameron was at the time, one of the most esteemed psychiatrists in the world. As president of the American Psychiatric Association, Canadian Psychiatric Association, and one of the founders of the World Psychiatric Association, Dr. Cameron began experimenting on brainwashing techniques as early as the 1930s with schizophrenic patients. **At this time lobotomies were not yet in common use, though the procedure would begin to be implemented in 1936 on a wide scale. Electroshock therapy was some years from being accepted as a primary means of changing behavior.[[72]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn72) **Cameron relied on torturous and highly stressful techniques for breaking down the personality of his patients. Schizophrenics would be stripped down naked beneath red lights for eight hours a day, sometimes for up to eight months with repeated messages inundating their senses. **In other experiments Cameron would attempt to induce the delirium associated with a high fever by cooking his patients in an electric cage until their body temperature reached 102 degrees. From January of 1957 until September of 1960 Cameron became one of the promising researchers the CIA turned to in order to develop means and methods of \"brainwashing\" and programming human beings to do the will of the agency. **Cameron received $64,242.44[[73]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn73) from the CIA to develop a combination of techniques that would destroy an individual's memory of an event and enable the programmer to control their behavior through post-hypnotic commands. ** Cameron used a variety of drug combinations coupled with prolonged sleep deprivation, isolation, hypnosis, and electro convulsive therapy in order to \"wipe\" an individual's memory. His techniques worked, to a certain extent, but ethical considerations led the CIA to cut Cameron's funding in the US, prompting Cameron to move to Canada to continue his work with funding channeled through the Canadian Government.

It used university facilities and personnel without their knowledge.\"** [[78]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn78) As an example of the hubris wrought by institutions veiled in secrecy, given unlimited funds and staffed with amoral people we can only refer to the statement made by George White in a letter to MKUltra director Sidney Gottlieb: \"I toiled wholeheartedly in the vineyards because it was fun, fun, fun! Where else could an *American *boy lie, cheat, rape and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the All Highest?\" [[79]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn79) After Watergate, more information hit the papers, COINTELPRO was uncovered by a group of people who have never been apprehended, in spite of a six-year FBI investigation. The COINTELPRO program was secret until 1971, when an FBI field office was burglarized by a group calling themselves the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI. These people broke into an FBI office in Pennsylvania, rifled through the filing cabinets and leaked to the press documents detailing the abuses suffered by a wide variety of activists, including a long-term plan to destroy Martin Luther King Jr.: \"Agents tapped his phone, bugged his rooms, trumpeted his supposed commie connections, and his sexual proclivities, and sicced the Internal Revenue Service on him. When it was announced in 1964 that King would receive a Nobel Peace Prize, the FBI grew desperate. Hoping to prevent King from accepting the award, the Bureau mailed him a package containing a tape of phone calls documenting King's extramarital affairs and an anonymous, threatening letter (shown here in censored form). In barely concealed language, King was told to commit suicide before the award ceremony or risk seeing his \"filthy, abnormal fraudulent self\" exposed to the nation.

Ross MD, and \"A Nation Betrayed\" [[summary here](http://www.wanttoknow.info/nationbetrayed10pg)] by Carol Rutz. At this point victims began to come forward with claims of being horribly abused in these programs, one of the most famous is a woman named Candy Jones who described in stunning detail a tale of corruption and abuse.[[82]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn82) When Jimmy Carter became President in 1976 he promptly moved to introduce a modicum of control, he instituted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act establishing an 11 member secret court to oversee the *s*urveillance activities of our covert agencies. As an example of the limited reporting requirements for the court we have the first report issued to Vice President Mondale from Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti in 1979: This report is submitted pursuant to Section 107 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, Title 50, United States Code Section 1807. During calendar year 1979, 199 applications were made for orders and extensions of orders approving electronic surveillance under the Act. The United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court issued 207 orders granting authority for the requested electronic surveillances. No orders were entered which modified or denied the requested authority.[[83]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn83) Pointedly Carter's reform measure did not do anything to insure that the American public would be protected in the future from abuse and testing at the hands of the intelligence arm of the military-industrial complex. Carter's move to reform the CIA was to appoint an outsider as head of the agency, Admiral Stansfield Turner.

The technology is being tested by corporations such as McDonald's and WalMart to direct advertisements into a consumer's head. The Long Rage Acoustical Device (LRAD),[[111]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn111) is used by the military in situations such as crowd control, mass notification, and perimeter enforcement. For instance, an unruly mob may not hear a warning to disperse with traditional acoustic technology, or border enforcement agents may need to warn an approaching intruder to turn away or face bodily harm. The technology has advantages over lethal force, yet it also has the potential to inflict physical harm, emotional manipulation, and death. According to *Defense Update*, **the LRAD can produce a 150-decibel acoustic beam from 300 meters away. The human threshold for pain is between 120 to 140 decibels.**[[112]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn112) In a 2003 *New York Times* article Mr. Norris demonstrates his technology to the reporter. At 1% of capacity, the reporter's eyes hurt, and hours later still experienced a headache.[[113]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn113)**This technology can inflict permanent damage and death despite its classification as a non-lethal weapon. ** While the LRAD may be seen as a way to save lives in times of disaster or to avoid civilian casualties, the LRAD and similar directed acoustics may be cause for concern to those who exercise their right to assemble and conduct peaceful demonstrations and protests. **The New York City police used the LRAD at the Republican National Convention and it was also used in Miami at a WTO Free Trade protests**.[[114]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn114) Covering one's ears will not protect a person and given, the long-range capabilities, fleeing from the beam may not help either (as evidenced in the use of directed acoustics against Jewish settlers in Gaza). The Associated Press (AP) reported that a device called \"the scream\" was used in a 2005 protest against Palestinians who \"covered their ears and grabbed their heads, overcome by dizziness and nausea, after the vehicle-mounted device began sending out bursts of audible, but not loud, sound at intervals of about 10 seconds.

Bush's Decade of the Brain produced outstanding advances for those with spinal cord injuries as well, which allows a paralyzed person to control a computer screen or a limb with a brain implant. There is also a new field in neurological research, Augmented Cognition. From universities to private business to the military, advances in neuro-technology can be used for amazing good. However, as we learned from the history of the Cold War, technology that has the capacity to heal also has the capacity to harm. Of great concern is the research being conducted at DARPA, which is trying to revolutionize the way soldiers receive information, respond to orders, adapt to stress, and perform while sleep deprived. TMS is being developed for military purposes using electrical impulses at close proximity to the skull to enhance mood, affect sleep patterns, and increase creativity.[[116]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn116) This technology is beginning to replace electro-shock therapy. DARPA granted a contract to the Medical University of South Carolina to research now to improve a soldier's performance. A soldier's reaction to stress may be less intense, or a 40-hour flight will allow for the soldier to remain awake without the side effects of sleep deprivation.[[117]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn117) Few, if any, understand the long-term effects of TMS, given its relative infancy in the overall field of Augmented Cognition. Does TMS produce unknown neurological effects ten, twenty, fifty years down the road? To what extent is TMS being researched? TMS is part of the overall field of Augmented Cognition. In essence, **Augmented Cognition allows a human to interact with a computer through brain waves. The idea is to enhance a person's cognitive capabilities in the area of memory, learning, attention, visualization, and decision-making.** One application of augmented cognition allows a user to monitor a person's brain functions and send anticipatory commands to the person being monitored. For instance, a military command unit will be able to monitor a pilot in a cockpit, and based on the sensory output of the soldier, the base command can input messages directly into the pilot's brain to improve performance. **DARPA describes this as a human computer symbiosis** whereby, \"This research will enable development of closed loop human-computer technologies, where the state of the user is measured, analyzed, and automatically adapted to by the computational system.\"[[118]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn118) The increase in human-computer relations and the ability to manipulate and control a person's senses, memory, and neural output has wide implications.

The basic ability to enter a person's mind is not a futuristic fantasy. This is real and in prototype. DARPA began this research in 1983.[[119]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn119) The Internet has become a focal point in our lives with reliance for information and communication. Our interaction and intimacy with computers is increasingly pervasive, as is our exposure to the field of augmented cognition. DARPA does not address the implications of such symbiosis, or the dilemma of the extent to which a person can or should be manipulated. The use of this technology is used for military purposes but it may not be long until it is used to \"improve\" the factory worker, prisoners, or the mentally ill. **The Implant** Another realm of brain research is the field of neural implants. Until recently, implants were a futuristic fantasy. Current advances in the private and military sectors have produced an implant that can allow a victim of a spinal cord injury to walk again or give an amputee the ability to control her leg with her mind. In the private sector, Cyberkinetics is leading the way to liberating some people from wheelchairs. This technology is a path to a more functional way of life, but it is also possible that the use of implants could be used for malevolence. John Donohoe, founder, chief scientific officer, and director of Cyberkinetics, addressed the issue of mind control and neural implants. **When asked if creating a brain-machine interface will open the door to mind control Donohoe responded, \"We do that all the time already.** Advertising is mind control. Even pharmaceutical agents are a form of mind control. When people have behaviors that deviate far from the norm, they are given medications that bring their mind back into the realm of behavior that we call normal. If a child were to have a seizure and became unconscious because of the seizure, and we controlled his mind so that he did not have seizures, that would be a wonderful thing.

The following are quotes from four experts who were willing to publicly address the subject. **Vladimir Nikolaevich Lopatin** Director of The Republican Scientific Research Institute of Intellectual Property, Moscow, former Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the Vologda from 1995 to 1999, and Senior Assistant to the General Public Prosecutor of the Russian Federation. During the 1990s Lopatin was active in the Russian Federation's banning of EMF technologies for military purposes.[[122]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn122) The following are quotes from Lopatin: \"At the same time, the necessity of protection from information weapons, information terrorism and information war is being discussed more often during the last years.\" \"Based on the data of special services, by the beginning of the 21st century expenses for purchasing means of information war increased within the last 15 years in the USA in four times and are ahead of all armament programs.

This technology can be adjusted for non-lethal or lethal use'.\"** Discussing neurotechnology, Smith adds, \"Brain mapping indicated to us the pleasure centers of the brain. TMS is the accessing these with rapidly changing magnetic fields to produce electrical fields. If the right hand rule is operative, the effect of inducing electrical fields by changing magnetic fields improves mood. Lenz's law, however, gives the direction of the induced electromotive force (EMF) resulting from electromagnetic induction, thus: The EMF induced in an electric circuit always acts in such a direction that the current it drives around a closed circuit produces a magnetic field which opposes the change in magnetic flux. In other words, **it would be possible to create depression and a feeling of overwhelming hopelessness by the induction of a current into the electrical circuit of the brain,** which opposed the change in magnetic flux.[[123]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn123) \"In 2004, The US Air Force Directorate: Controlled Effects gives a clear picture of objectives: \"The Controlled Effects long-term challenge focuses technology developments in three primary areas Measured Global Force Projection looks at the exploitation of electromagnetic and other non-conventional force capabilities against facilities and equipment to achieve strategic, tactical, and lethal and non-lethal force projection around the world. **\"Controlled Personnel Effects investigates technologies to make selected adversaries think and act according to our needs.** Dominant Remote Control seeks to control, at a distance, an enemy's vehicles, sensors, communications, and information systems and manipulate them for military purposes.

For instance, the Sheriff and weapons that can heat the skin for crowd control do what the military states, but they are capable of much more. Thermal heating weapons act like a car radio; you can change the frequencies to get different effects. The electromagnetic weapons send an impulse through the nervous system. They can transfer sounds, like Woody Norris' directed acoustic weapons, which is contracted to the US government. It modulates a signal that is a radio frequency, which can be changed to affect certain organs. It can override an organ like the heart or the liver. \"So changing the perimeter is like changing the broadcast on the radio. **These extremely low frequencies also have the capability to send messages directly into the head when only the receiver can hear it.** (see the 1985 Radiofrequency Radiation Dosimetry Handbook). \"The handbook talks about electromagnetics and about the rapid healing of bones.

Easiest to test would be prisoners in undisclosed CIA detention centers, civilians in war torn regions, and even US citizens in protest crowds or civilian jails.** In addition to the rubber bullets and pepper spray, which are common in many police forces, new concept weapons are also in use. Perhaps soon Americans will learn first-hand, the effects of the new human control technologies. However, hundreds of people continue to assert that a person or persons, whom they do not know, have been targeting them with electromagnetic weapons in a widespread campaign of either illegal experimentation or outright persecution. These experiences involved a number of discrete phenomena: Hearing voices when no one was present. Feeling sensations of burning, itching, tickling, or pressure with no apparent physical cause. Sleeplessness and anxiety as a result of \"humming\" or \"buzzing\". Loss of bodily control, such as twitching or jerking of an arm or leg suddenly and without control. Unexpected emotional states, such as a sudden overwhelming feeling of dread, rage, lust or sorrow that passes as quickly as it arises.[[138]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn138) ** ** The levels of research on directed energy is now large enough to support a Directed Energy (DE) Professional Society made up of private contractors and Department of Defense officials with security clearances.

The course will include a description of four areas of systems engineering assessment that are brought together to form military worth analysis. These are: 1) weapon system concept performance trade studies, 2) target vulnerability assessment, 3) engagement-level system operational effectiveness assessment, and 4) war gaming and mission/campaign level analysis. Each of these areas will be covered during the short course, with emphasis on the elements that are drawn from each of these areas to support military worth analysis. The course will particularly emphasize methods for assessing system level effectiveness in the context of traditional weapon effectiveness tools such as the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) and for providing data on DE weapons effectiveness to mission and campaign level analysis tools and to models and simulations used to support war gaming. Topics to be covered include: Definition of military worth analysis Elements of DE weapon system performance trade studies and how they feed military worth analysis Target vulnerability assessment and its use to support weapon effectiveness **Adapting standard weapon \"kill\" criteria to measure benefit of DE effects** Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) weapon effectiveness models Military utility studies Modeling and simulation to support war games and war fighter exercises Mission and campaign level modeling Course 10. Laser Lethality Classification: Secret Course Description: This course reviews laser material interactions over parameter ranges of interest for weapons applications. Fundamental considerations of the optical coupling of the laser energy into the material will be presented. This will be followed by physics-based treatments of the response of metals, organic-based materials, and ceramics to the laser irradiation. Metals: Simple cw, one-dimensional treatments will be utilized to illustrate the general principles of the response of metals to laser radiation, but two-dimensional cases, phase changes, and pulsed effects will be discussed as well.

Course 11.†Directed Energy Bioeffects Classification: Secret Course Description and Topics: **This course will introduce the basics of the biological effects of Directed Energy on cells, tissues, organisms, and humans, with particular emphasis on the influence of such effects on the development of use of Directed-Energy-Emitting technologies.** The student will learn about the mechanisms, resulting damage, and mission impact of laser-tissue interaction. The student will learn what tissues are most susceptible to laser damage based on wavelength, exposure duration, and irradiance. The potential mission-impact of sub0-threshold, threshold, and suprathreshold exposures will be discussed. Student will understand the nature of RF bioeffects research, including human/animal studies, modeling and simulation, and biotechnology approaches. Students will become familiar with current state of knowledge on potential health effects RF, such as cancer, memory loss, and birth defects. Students will become familiar with basis and structure of current RF safety standards, comparison between competing standards, and how RF safety standards are applied. Students will be instructed on common RF measurement equipment and important factors for investigating potential RF overexposures. Topics to be covered include: Laser damage of the eye (retina and cornea) Laser damage to the skin Laser safety standards Laser damage as a function of energy, pulse duration, wavelength, and spot size RF bioeffects research and the current scientific consensus on RF hazards RF safety standards RF measurement basics Investigating RF overexposures\"[[140]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn140) The US Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate released a paper in 2004 which presents \"Crowd Control Modeling and Simulation.\" This report discusses behavioral changes [that can be made in] human populations.[[141]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn141) **That the Department of Defense calls for new weapons systems designed to work on the psychological underpinnings of a population should give human rights activists great cause for alarm. **The use of electromagnetic weapons to alter the emotional state, hamper the ability of an enemy or US citizens to think clearly, and result in chaos and pain are morally problematic for a number of reasons: **Creating fear, anxiety confusion and irrational behavior within an individual or a population is counterproductive to the operations of a free society and to the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights.txt:38:246ca434de2e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15240, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "designed to work on the psychological underpinnings of a population should give human rights activists great cause for alarm. **The use of electromagnetic weapons to alter the emotional state, hamper the ability of an enemy or US citizens to think clearly, and result in chaos and pain are morally problematic for a number of reasons: **Creating fear, anxiety confusion and irrational behavior within an individual or a population is counterproductive to the operations of a free society and to the execution of warfare.** Chaos only breeds the need for greater and greater means of physical repression; irrational behavior is by definition unpredictable and as such provides significant difficulty when the task is to secure an area. **These weapons leave no tell tale clues.** There are no bullet holes or gross damage (with the exception of those designed to maim, burn or explode targets). They are operated from a great distance, meaning that the operator has no feedback as to the effects of his or her actions. This provides us with a very dangerous circumstance very similar to [Millgram's experiment](https://www.wanttoknow.info/g/stanford_prison_experiment_milgram) where we can predict with certainty gross abuses of power. **Any device that invades a persons mind, either through induction of \"evoked potentials\" through electromagnetic means or through the various \"crazy-making\" tactics employed in both information warfare and psychological operations is a violation of human rights and cognitive liberty.** In terms of authorizing and administering tests of radioactive substances and other tests on unsuspecting members of the public, history shows that people without ethical standards can rise to positions of great responsibility, and once ensconced in such positions of trust, produce the most horrifying abuses without fear of reprisal. When layers of secrecy overlay the activities of otherwise rational and intelligent men, the failings of their hearts more readily show. In the case of actually attempting to control human behavior through both overt and covert means our departments of defense and intelligence agencies, both subordinate to the executive branch of government have historically proven incapable of protecting the public and undeserving of the trust given them to perform their functions for the public good.

The current affairs of our country have produced many.\"[[144]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn144) The abundance of neuro-research has led to the development of several products by private business in the name of national security, including brain fingerprinting.[[145]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn145) John Norseen, a neuroscientist interested in Biofusion, the relationship between humans and computers, says, **\"If this research pans out you can begin to manipulate what someone is thinking even before they know it.\"** Norseen says he is agnostic on the moral ramifications of this research.

Our brains control our bodies, actions, and thought processes. If the government and the scientists they employ perceive that the human mind as simply a collection of neurons, it then becomes possible to justify the surveillance of the human mind and body for national security purposes.

They have poisoned thousands with atomic testing, experimented on young children using drugs, trauma and hypnosis, sprayed major cities with biological agents to prepare for a future attack, overthrown governments, instituted mass killings, and engaged in every form of information distortion. [See [this verifiable list](https://www.wanttoknow.info/humanguineapigs) of humans being used as guinea pigs.] The current \"War on Terror\" has revealed to the public some of the tools that the military has been developing for decades. High profile weapons systems flash across the nightly reports of the major news networks, including highflying Stealth bombers on grainy green tinted video from the noses of \"smart\" bombs. On occasion, glimpses are given through the media of what one article dubbed \"Wonder Weapons,\"[[148]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn148) weapons that fall under the military category of \"Non-Lethal Weapons.\" In fact, the general position of the agencies who do comment on weapons that exploit the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum is that they have no biological effect at all, except for what are dubbed \"thermal effects,\" in essence heating of human cells.[[149]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#_ftn149) Research into this subject has shown that this position is inaccurate, and that the effects of electromagnetic radiation weapons on human beings are in fact both chilling and dramatic. As reported in 2001, the case of Dr. Eldon Byrd should be considered with great weight: \"A medical engineer, Eldon Byrd, reported a case that illustrates this point. After working on the Polaris submarine, which carried long-range nuclear weapons, Byrd developed non-lethal weapons with reversible effects. He regarded this as a humanitarian alternative to 'punching holes in people and having their blood leak out' in battle. His inventions used magnetic fields at biologically active wave frequencies to affect brain function. \"**Byrd could put animals to sleep at a distance and influence their movements.

Their ability to redirect public attention toward external threats and away from their own motivations in effect silences opposition to their programs. By controlling the flow of information in society, the power elites provide the public with a limited choice in all matters that pertain to machinations of government and corporate control. Given more advanced technologies for the control of information, unscrupulous individuals who ascribe to a \"might makes right\" philosophy may well find the ways and means of employing these technologies against those who would oppose their plans. The dangers here are great, in that the individual who would direct the torture and killing of innocents is usually removed from the actual fact. It is left up to lesser authorities to administer the beatings, bullets, and mind/body bending technologies. For the US Government to unilaterally declare that our country will not comply with international human rights laws, nor uphold the core values of our nation's foundation is an indication of extremism that supersedes the values and beliefs of the American people. When such extremism exists, we need to take seriously the founders' declaration that, \"to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, - That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.\" (Declaration of Independence 1776) [Contents](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights#toc) Peter Phillips is a Professor of Sociology at Sonoma State University and Director of [Project Censored](https://projectcensored.org/).

We do this by measuring brain-wave responses to words, phrases, sounds or pictures presented by a computer. We present details about a crime, training or other types of specific knowledge, mixed in a sequence with other, irrelevant items. We use details that the person being tested would have encountered in the course of committing a crime, but that an innocent person would have no way of knowing. We can tell by the brainwave response if a person recognizes the stimulus or not. If the suspect recognizes the details of the crime, this indicates that he has a record of the crime stored in his brain.\" For more research, see the Brain Wave Science site, the official internet identity of Brain Fingerprinting Laboratories at [http://www.brainwavescience.com/Publications.php](https://web.archive.org/web/20060206083148/http://www.brainwavescience.com/Publications.php).

Through the use of the psychological understanding of the human being as a social animal and the ability to manipulate a subject's environment through isolation, drugs and hypnosis, US funded scientists have long searched for better means of controlling human behavior. This research has included the use of wireless directed electromagnetic energy under the heading of \"Information Warfare\" and \"[Non Lethal Weapons](https://www.wanttoknow.info/nonlethalweaponsnewsarticles).\" **New technological capabilities have been developed in black budget projects[[1]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn1) over the last few decades-including the ability to influence human emotion, disrupt thought, and present excruciating pain through the manipulation of magnetic fields.** The US military and intelligence agencies have at their disposal frightful new weapons which could be directed against the public in the event of mass protests or civil disturbance. [Psychological Warfare](https://www.wanttoknow.info/060123psyops), Information War, and [mind control](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse) may seem to be exotic topics, but the impact of these technologies and techniques is profound. Our minds are being impacted through a longstanding series of programs aimed at manipulating public opinion through intelligence agencies, think tanks, corporate media and a host of non-governmental organizations designed to engender fear, division and uncertainty in the public.[[18]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn18) According to Mary C. FitzGerald of the Hudson Institute, new-concept weapons, such as laser, electromagnetic, plasma, climatic, genetic and biotechnological are the central principle driving the modernization of national defense.

There was, however, no public debate surrounding these black operations because they were classified under the guise of national security. **[MKULTRA](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mindcontrol), Project PANDORA, plutonium testing, and many more projects conducted by the DOD and the CIA were exposed by committees led by Senators Rockefeller and Church in the 1970s.[[86]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn86) However, tighter restrictions on human experiment including accountability and transparency did not occur until 1997**, when President Clinton instituted revised protocols on human experiments.[[87]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn87) Official reports insist that the research involving experiments during the 1950s through the 1970s was destroyed. Yet, the scientists involved went without punishment, free to continue their careers.[[88]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn88) Given the [levels of ongoing EMF technology research](http://www.airforcemag.com/Features/Pages/2018/June%202018/AFSOC-General-Calls-for-More-Emphasis-on-Directed-Energy-Weapons.aspx) today, and the recent retroactive approval of torture approved by the Military Commissions Act, it may be that human testing is occurring under post-9/11 national security protocols. **Crowd Control using the Electromagnetic Spectrum** A peek into the US arsenal of weapons is like a look into a science fiction film. Various military research labs provide a view of the current technology available to enhance US soldiers in the field and manipulate the emotions and behaviors of the perceived enemy. The electromagnetic spectrum has provided the military with an expanse of weapons, which are operational and in military and private use today in the form of millimeter waves,[[102]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn102) pulsed energy projectiles, and high power magnetic weapons. **Raytheon outfitted Humvees with their Silent Guardian Protection System, a device capable of heating the skin to 1/64 of an inch, causing instant pain similar to intense sunburn, [*[103]*](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn103) with the goal to facilitate dispersing a crowd. Pulsed Energy Projectiles (PEPs) are another form of weaponry that is used to paralyze a victim with pain.

It would be possible to create depression and a feeling of overwhelming hopelessness by the induction of a current into the electrical circuit of the brain.[[123]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn123)Through sensory deception, it may be possible to [create synthetic images or holograms](https://www.wanttoknow.info/060123psyops) to confuse an individual's visual sense or, in a similar manner, confuse his senses of sound, taste, touch, or smell. There are several ways that microwaves can affect humans. For instance, weapons that can heat the skin for crowd control do what the military states, but they are capable of much more. Thermal heating weapons act like a car radio; you can change the frequencies to get different effects. The electromagnetic weapons send an impulse through the nervous system. They can transfer sounds. **Extremely low frequencies also have the capability to send messages directly into the head when only the receiver can hear it.

The problem is that the military's role is to be paranoid and think up scenarios where the worst can happen then prepare for this in order to protect the people from a hypothetical future event. According to the defense budget report, 40% of the budget is dedicated to black projects. There is no oversight and no public knowledge. **There needs to be a debate in the public sphere because while these weapons appear frightening, they also have amazing therapeutic potentials. There is the possibility of quicker healing and curing disease. And what is just as important about government transparency concerning weapons is the transparency of life saving science being kept from the public. If we have the ability to cure and the government or military hides this, we have just as big a problem.** **The Military-Industrial Complex** Military contractors run our wars in concert with [power elites](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/ruling-class). The money involved in the non-lethal weapons industry is growing and military contractors are reaping the profits. Corporations also have the power to determine which studies will reach the public.[[125]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn125) And the military will allow negative or alarming studies to remain unreported or lost in a sea of classified documents. Emmett Paige Jr., Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence declared in 1996 that, \"Well over a decade ago, a Soviet general reportedly said 'to prevail in the next conflict, one must control the electromagnetic spectrum.'\" The Department of Defense is committed to ensuring that \"in the next conflict it is we who will control the spectrum.\"[[133]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn133) The US Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate released a paper in 2004 which presents \"Crowd Control Modeling and Simulation.\" This report discusses behavioral changes [that can be made in] human populations.[[141]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn141)The use of electromagnetic weapons to alter the emotional state, hamper the ability of an enemy or US citizens to think clearly, and result in chaos and pain are problematic for a number of reasons: Creating fear, anxiety confusion and irrational behavior within an individual or a population is counterproductive to the operations of a free", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__electromagnetic-weapons.txt:3:2770967cdb8c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15263, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__electromagnetic-weapons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__electromagnetic-weapons", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "Directorate released a paper in 2004 which presents \"Crowd Control Modeling and Simulation.\" This report discusses behavioral changes [that can be made in] human populations.[[141]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn141)The use of electromagnetic weapons to alter the emotional state, hamper the ability of an enemy or US citizens to think clearly, and result in chaos and pain are problematic for a number of reasons: Creating fear, anxiety confusion and irrational behavior within an individual or a population is counterproductive to the operations of a free society and to the execution of warfare. Chaos only breeds the need for greater and greater means of physical repression. These weapons leave no tell tale clues. There are no bullet holes or gross damage. They are operated from a great distance, meaning that the operator has no feedback as to the effects of his or her actions. Any device that invades a persons mind is a violation of human rights. The control and manipulation of a human brain is a terrifying possibility. Lieutenant Colonel Timothy L. Thomas, US Army (ret), published an article in the military journal *Parameters *which likens the mind as a new battlefield. He quotes a Russian army major in relation to mind wars, \"It is completely clear that the state which is first to create such weapons will achieve incomparable superiority.\"[[147]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn147) **Under the cover of secrecy provided by claims of national security, researchers in service to higher circle policy elites have implanted electrodes into human subjects to control minds and tortured prisoners and the mentally ill in efforts to find better \"brainwashing\" techniques. **They have poisoned thousands with atomic testing, experimented on young children using drugs, trauma and hypnosis, sprayed major cities with biological agents to prepare for a future attack, overthrown governments, instituted mass killings, and engaged in every form of information distortion. [See [this verifiable list](https://www.wanttoknow.info/humanguineapigs) of incidents where humans beings were used as guinea pigs.] The general position of the agencies who do comment on weapons that exploit the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum is that they have no biological effect at all, except for what are dubbed \"thermal effects,\" in essence heating of human cells.[[149]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons#_ftn149)Research into this subject has shown that this position is inaccurate, and that the effects of electromagnetic radiation weapons on human beings are in fact both chilling and dramatic. The case of Dr. Eldon Byrd, a medical engineer, should be considered with great weight. After working on the Polaris submarine, which carried long-range nuclear weapons, Byrd developed non-lethal weapons with reversible effects. He regarded this as a humanitarian alternative to 'punching holes in people and having their blood leak out' in battle. His inventions used magnetic fields at biologically active wave frequencies to affect brain function. **Byrd could put animals to sleep at a distance and influence their movements.

The dangers here are great, in that the individual who would direct the torture and killing of innocents is usually removed from the actual fact. It is left up to lesser authorities to administer the beatings, bullets, and mind/body bending technologies. Power elites who fund and support efforts at supplanting the will of the people do so from on high. Their ability to redirect public attention toward external threats and away from their own motivations in effect silences opposition to their programs. By controlling the flow of information in society, the power elites provide the public with a limited choice in all matters that pertain to machinations of government and corporate control.

The [HAARP project website acknowledged](https://web.archive.org/web/20130429190247/http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/gen.html) that experiments were conducted which used electromagnetic frequencies to fire pulsed, directed energy beams in order to \"temporarily excite a limited area of the ionosphere.\" **Some scientists state that purposefully disturbing this sensitive layer could have major and even disastrous consequences.** Concerned HAARP researchers like [Dr. Michel Chossudovsky](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-ultimate-weapon-of-mass-destruction-owning-the-weather-for-military-use) of the University of Ottawa and Alaska's [Dr. Nick Begich](https://web.archive.org/web/20070302152131/http://www.earthpulse.com/src/category.asp?catid=13) (son of a US Congressman) present evidence suggesting that these disturbances can even be used to trigger earthquakes, affect hurricanes, and for weather control. **Who Created HAARP?** [Dr. Bernard", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__haarp_weather_modification_electromagnetic_warfare_weapons.txt:0:283f935f02e0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15269, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__haarp_weather_modification_electromagnetic_warfare_weapons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__haarp_weather_modification_electromagnetic_warfare_weapons", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "frequencies to fire pulsed, directed energy beams in order to \"temporarily excite a limited area of the ionosphere.\" **Some scientists state that purposefully disturbing this sensitive layer could have major and even disastrous consequences.** Concerned HAARP researchers like [Dr. Michel Chossudovsky](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-ultimate-weapon-of-mass-destruction-owning-the-weather-for-military-use) of the University of Ottawa and Alaska's [Dr. Nick Begich](https://web.archive.org/web/20070302152131/http://www.earthpulse.com/src/category.asp?catid=13) (son of a US Congressman) present evidence suggesting that these disturbances can even be used to trigger earthquakes, affect hurricanes, and for weather control. **Who Created HAARP?** [Dr. Bernard Eastlund](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Eastlund) is the scientist whose name is most associated with the creation and development of the HAARP project. [His revealing website](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829144259/http://www.eastlundscience.com/HAARP.html) provides reliable information on his involvement with the project. A [1987 patent](https://web.archive.org/web/20170706142614/https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=4686605.PN.&OS=PN/4686605&RS=PN/4686605) issued to Dr. Eastlund is titled \"Method and apparatus for altering a region in the earth's atmosphere, ionosphere, and/or magnetosphere.\" **In this patent, which sets the stage for HAARP, Dr. Eastlund makes a number of fascinating statements which clearly contradict the claim that it is only being used for research and not for military purposes or such purposes as weather control. **Here are a few of key statements taken verbatim from the patent: [The] temperature of the ionosphere has been raised by hundreds of degrees in these experiments. **A means and method is provided to cause interference with or even total disruption of communications over a very large portion of the earth.** This invention could be employed to disrupt not only land based communications, both civilian and military, but also airborne communications and sea communications. This would have significant military implications. It is possible ... to take advantage of one or more such beams to carry out a communications network even though the rest of the world's communications are disrupted. [It] can be used to an advantage for positive communication and eavesdropping purposes. Exceedingly large amounts of power can be very efficiently produced and transmitted. This invention has a phenomenal variety of ... potential future developments. Large regions of the atmosphere could be lifted to an unexpectedly high altitude so that missiles encounter unexpected and unplanned drag forces with resultant destruction or deflection. **Weather modification is possible by, for example, altering upper atmosphere wind patterns or altering solar absorption patterns by constructing one or more [plumes of atmospheric particles](https://web.archive.org/web/20190426110355/https://www.nrl.navy.mil/news/releases/nrl-scientists-produce-densest-artificial-ionospheric-plasma-clouds-using-haarp) which will act as a lens or focusing device.** Ozone, nitrogen, etc. concentrations in the atmosphere could be artificially increased. Electromagnetic pulse defenses are also possible. **The earth's magnetic field could be decreased or disrupted at appropriate altitudes to modify or eliminate the magnetic field. ** For those with any background in science, you might find it quite revealing to [explore this patent](https://web.archive.org/web/20150217212223/https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=4686605.PN.&OS=PN/4686605&RS=PN/4686605) in more detail.

And remember that since the time of this patent, in which Alaska is mentioned several times as the ideal location, the government fully acknowledges that it built a massive array of antennas in Alaska with the capability of disturbing the ionosphere exactly as described in Eastlund's patent. **HAARP Documentaries** Two key major media documentaries, one by Canada's public broadcasting network [CBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC) and the other by the History Channel, reveal the inner workings of the HAARP project in a most powerful way. The very well researched CBC documentary includes this key quote: \"It isn't just conspiracy theorists who are concerned about HAARP. In January of 1999, the European Union called the project a global concern and passed a resolution calling for more information on its health and environmental risks. Despite those concerns, officials at HAARP insist the project is nothing more sinister than a radio science research facility.\" The European Union (EU) document which brings HAARP and similar [electromagnetic weapons](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050812electromagneticbeamweapons) into question can be [verified here](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A4-1999-0005+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN). The actual wording at bullet point 24 in this telling document states that the EU \"considers HAARP by virtue of its far-reaching impact on the environment to be a global concern and calls for its legal, ecological and ethical implications to be examined by an international independent body before any further research and testing.\" This revealing document further states that the EU regrets the repeated refusal of the U.S. government to give evidence on the project. **This engaging 15-minute CBC documentary is [available for free viewing](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/haarp_video_documentary). An even more detailed and revealing 45-minute History Channel documentary on HAARP and other secret weapons used for electromagnetic warfare is [available here](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=history+channel+haarp&oq=history+channel+haarp).** Here are two quotes from the History Channel documentary: \"Electromagnetic weapons ... pack an invisible wallop hundreds of times more powerful than the electrical current in a lightning bolt. One can blast enemy missiles out of the sky, another could be used to blind soldiers on the battlefield, still another to control an unruly crowd by burning the surface of their skin. If detonated over a large city, an electromagnetic weapon could destroy all electronics in seconds. They all use directed energy to create a powerful electromagnetic pulse.\" \"Directed energy is such a powerful technology it could be used to heat the ionosphere to turn weather into a weapon of war. Imagine using a flood to destroy a city or tornadoes to decimate an approaching army in the desert. If an electromagnetic pulse went off over a city, basically all the electronic things in your home would wink and go out, and they would be permanently destroyed.

If an electromagnetic pulse went off over a city, basically all the electronic things in your home would wink and go out, and they would be permanently destroyed. The military has spent a huge amount of time on weather modification as a concept for battle environments.\" Another video along similar lines, the excellent History Channel documentary titled \"The Invisible Machine: Electromagnetic Warfare,\" is [available here](https://www.google.com/search?num=40&tbm=vid&q=the+invisible+machine+electromagnetic+warfare). For those who still doubt that such devastating secret weapons have been developed, here is an intriguing quote from [an article](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=14727) in New Zealand's leading newspaper, the *New Zealand Herald*: \"Top-secret wartime experiments [WWII] were conducted off the coast of Auckland to perfect a tidal wave bomb, declassified files reveal. United States defence chiefs said that if the project had been completed before the end of the war, it could have played a role as effective as that of the atom bomb. Details of the tsunami bomb, known as [Project Seal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Seal), are contained in 53-year-old documents released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\" **If the military secretly developed a weapon which could cause a tsunami well over half a century ago, what kind of advanced deadly weapons might be available now?** And why is it that the general public still doesn't know about secret weapons developed over 70 years ago? Clearly the military has the capability to cause a tsunami and likely to cause earthquakes and hurricanes, as well. To understand why the media isn't covering these highly critical issues, see [this revealing essay](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediacorruption). It's time to take action to spread the word on this vital topic. And for another excellent documentary on HAARP, which includes an extensive interview with Dr. Bernard Eastlund, watch \"[Holes in Heaven](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22holes+in+heaven%22&num=40&tbm=vid).\" **Secrecy Around the Project** Having interpreted for top generals in [my work as a language interpreter](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050418fredburksinterpretingstories) with the US Department of State, I learned that military planners are always interested in developing the most devastating weapons possible. Yet these weapons are kept secret as long as possible, allegedly for reasons of national security. The many layers of intense secrecy both in the military and government result in very few people being aware of the gruesome capabilities for death and destruction The massive [Manhattan Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_project) (development of the first atomic bomb) is one such example. **The building of an entire city to support the project in Oak Ridge, Tennessee was [successfully kept secret](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Manhattan_Project#Project_sites) even from the state's governor.** The stealth bomber was kept top secret for many years, and the public still has no way of knowing it's full capabilities.

It is through the use of the highly organized military and intelligence services that the [power elite](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) of our world, in cooperation with key allies in government and corporate ownership of the media, are able to carry out major cover-ups and secret operations like those involved with HAARP. Some researchers have raised questions about the [possible involvement](https://web.archive.org/web/20130310024139/http://montalk.net/conspiracy/142/haarp-earthquakes-and-hurricanes) of HAARP in major disasters like the earthquakes in Haiti and Japan, the Indonesian tsunami, and [hurricane Katrina](https://www.WantToKnow.info/hurricanekatrinanewsarticles). **Could these have been HAARP experiments gone awry?** Might they even have been caused by rogue elements which gained control of this devastating technology? Disasters like this happen naturally on a regular basis, yet if you begin to research, there is some high strangeness around some of these disasters. The evidence is inconclusive, yet with the known and unknown major destructive capabilities of this weapon, serious questions remain. **HAARP and Manipulation of Emotions** The capability of influencing and even controlling human emotions has been studied by the military and intelligence services of the world for many decades. A concise, information-packed description of such programs with links to declassified CIA documents for verification is [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol). One thoroughly researched book titled *Mind Controllers* describes an effective method of remotely influencing human emotions. Here's a key quote from this revealing book: \"With the use of powerful computers, segments of human emotions which include anger, anxiety, sadness, fear, embarrassment, jealousy, resentment, shame, and terror, have been identified and isolated within the EEG signals as 'emotion signature clusters.' Their relevant frequencies and amplitudes have been measured. Then the very frequency/amplitude cluster is synthesized and stored on another computer. Each one of these negative emotions is properly and separately tagged. **They are then placed on the Silent Sound carrier frequencies and could silently trigger the occurrence of the same basic emotion in another human being.\"** An excellent 10-page summary of the book is [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrollers10pg). For the section focused on nonlethal weapons, which includes the above quote, see [this page](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrollers10pg#nonlethal). Using HAARP's powerful broadcast capabilities, it is within the realm of possibility that powerful antennas like that of HAARP and major facilities elsewhere could triangulate on an exact location anywhere in the world and send highly intensified frequencies matching the emotion signature of a desired emotion to produce anger or any other desired emotion in a group of people, as the human mind naturally entrains to strong frequencies around it. This may all sound quite unbelievable to those who are not versed in the secret ways", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__haarp_weather_modification_electromagnetic_warfare_weapons.txt:4:36696d29b429", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15273, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__haarp_weather_modification_electromagnetic_warfare_weapons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__haarp_weather_modification_electromagnetic_warfare_weapons", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "is within the realm of possibility that powerful antennas like that of HAARP and major facilities elsewhere could triangulate on an exact location anywhere in the world and send highly intensified frequencies matching the emotion signature of a desired emotion to produce anger or any other desired emotion in a group of people, as the human mind naturally entrains to strong frequencies around it. This may all sound quite unbelievable to those who are not versed in the secret ways of of the [military-intelligence complex](https://www.WantToKnow.info/intelligenceagencynewsarticles). Yet there is strong evidence to support this possibility. Here is the abstract of U.S. patent number 5,159,703, approved in 1992, over 25 years ago: \"A silent communications system in which nonaural carriers, in the very low or very high audio frequency range or in the adjacent ultrasonic frequency spectrum, are amplitude or frequency modulated with the desired intelligence and propagated acoustically or vibrationally, for inducement into the brain, typically through the use of loudspeakers, earphones or piezoelectric transducers. The modulated carriers may be transmitted directly in real time or may be conveniently recorded and stored on mechanical, magnetic or optical media for delayed or repeated transmission to the listener.\" You can view the entire patent on the U.S. Patent and Trade Office website at [this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20150718104855/https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=5,159,703.PN.&OS=PN/5,159,703&RS=PN/5,159,703). Below are the listed objects of the invention in that patent: **to provide a technique for producing a subliminal presentation which is inaudible to the listener(s), yet is perceived and demodulated (decoded) by the ear for use by the subconscious mind.** to provide a technique for transmitting inaudible subliminal information to the listener(s) at a constant, high level of signal strength and on a clear band of frequencies. to provide a technique for producing inaudible subliminal presentations to which music or other \"foreground\" programming may be added, if desired. In other words, the subliminal messages could be inserted into TV and radio waves without the awareness of the listener or viewer. Such messages could easily be beamed from satellites, as well, triangulated on a desired location. **Using the incredible broadcasting capabilities of HAARP, these subliminal message could conceivably even be broadcast over a larger area to create the desired effect on an entire population.** Sounds scary doesn't it? So why is this not being discussed more widely? An informative paper on the usage of the silent sound technology and it's implications is [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/mind_control_articles/silent_sound_nonlethal_weapons). At least a dozen other patents have been approved related to the usage of technology designed to cause subliminal changes in desired targets. A list and brief descriptions of many of these patents with links for verification is available on [this webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050331behaviormodificationtv). Here's a sample quote from [Patent #6,506,148](https://web.archive.org/web/20170706090747/https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6506148.PN.&OS=PN%2F6506148&RS=PN%2F6506148): \"It is therefore possible to manipulate the nervous system of a subject by pulsing images displayed on a nearby computer monitor or TV set.

For the latter, the image pulsing may be imbedded in the program material, or it may be overlaid by modulating a video stream.\" Clearly, technologies have been developed and refined with the specific purpose of passing subliminal messages unbeknownst to the target. The capability of remotely influencing emotions through the use of certain wave lengths has been successfully demonstrated. The implications are huge. Yet there is exceedingly little regulation of how this technology will be used. By educating yourself on this important matter and spreading the word to your friends and colleagues, you can make a difference in building the necessary momentum to bring these matters to light and to ensure they are not used in disempowering ways. Jesse Ventura, the former Navy Seal who turned pro wrestler only to then become governor of Minnesota, has a TV special on HAARP that is a bit sensationalized, yet contains useful information. You can watch this revealing program online at [this link](https://www.google.com/search?q=haarp+jesse+ventura&num=40&tbm=vid). **For many other ideas and suggestions on how you can further educate yourself and what you can do to help inform others about this secret program and make a difference in our world, see the box below.** And to bring this matter home, let us also look at where each of us are keeping secrets in ways that can end up harming those around us.

The closure provided the excuse to stop the live broadcasting of HAARP's signals on a public website, which gave strong evidence of links between HAARP activities and major weather catastrophes (see [this webpage](http://montalk.net/haarp.pdf) for more). Operation of the facility [was transferred](https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu) to the University of Alaska in 2015. Undoubtedly HAARP-like weather control and military research continues elsewhere. With all the intense secrecy around the project for reasons of \"national security,\" it's hard to know what is really happening, but clearly the public is largely being kept in the dark.

However, this was far from the case. [Even members of Congress are uninformed](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/secret-war) about the presence of US military forces in countries all over the world. US bombs and weapons sold to the Saudis in their war with Yemen, [which weren't reported or authorized by Congress](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-us-enabling-war-has-made-yemen-hell-earth-civilians), led to at least 10,000 deaths of innocent civilians. This war was supported by both the Obama and Trump administrations. A [2007 Defense Department study](https://theintercept.com/2024/03/07/pentagon-somalia-africa-terrorism-failure/) recently obtained by *The Intercept* reveals how top US government officials viewed America's war in Africa as a \"stalemate or worse, and has been especially ruinous for Somalis.\" Despite this grim reality, covert factions within the military-intelligence complex have [supported at least nine coups in African countries](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-another-ustrained-soldier-stages-coup-west-africa) since 2008, with a [vast network of military bases](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-us-military-says-it-has-light-footprint-africa-these-documents-show-vast-network-bases) scattered across the continent. Meanwhile, Somali families of innocent civilians killed by US drone strikes [rarely receive compensation](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-advocates-demand-compensation-us-drone-strike-victims-somalia) from the Pentagon. Collective action against the violent atrocities happening in the Gaza strip and US arm sales to Israel are appropriately being questioned on a massive scale. **However, the US has supported brutalities all over the world for decades, many of these seldom talked about on any mainstream level. Understanding the longstanding history of the US war machine is essential for those seeking justice in the wars that the US Military-Intelligence Complex is currently fueling.** Public support for war has always been built on [media manipulation](https://www.wanttoknow.info/008/080916_mass_media_manipulations), misinformation and outright lies. Below, we provide a window into this reality with our War Failures and Lies section in our [Military-Intelligence Corruption Information Center](https://www.wanttoknow.info/military-intelligence-corruption-information). We discuss the sobering reality that the wars we've started and helped fuel rarely achieved productive and peaceful outcomes. **Yet going deeper, we explore how covert action within the US war machine often involved backing extremist and terrorist groups all over the world. The agency's latest covert action involves supporting Neo-Nazis in Ukraine since at least 2014.** We can't shift the chaos we're in until we name it. When we can recognize what's harming us - in our personal lives and as a society - we already have a degree of freedom from it.

This effort was [spearheaded by](https://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0906/p25s02-cogn.html) PR firm Hill & Knowlton, which was paid $10.7 million to sway public opinion in favor of war. This firm swayed public opinion in part by telling and repeating a terrible lie. The American public [was told](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-when-contemplating-war-beware-babies-incubators) that Iraqi soldiers had killed babies in incubators during the invasion of Kuwait. A congressional committee even heard testimony to that effect. Top tier newspapers like *The Washington Post *were fooled by the [incubator baby hoax](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/26/the-kuwaiti-incubator-hoax/35b1e882-f796-4acb-a106-9280a7dda521/). Initially, everyone bought the lie, including politicians. Congress authorized military intervention in 1991. The war was over before anyone really understood that they'd been fooled. George H.W. Bush and powerful US [neoconservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism) allies had [long been preparing carefully](https://www.wanttoknow.info/020907pnacprojectnewamericancentury) for this war. After supporting Iraq's invasion of Iran, bleeding Iran's energy, oil and military resources, the US turned its military machine against Iraq. Using Kuwait as a launchpad for invasion, the Bush administration relentlessly unleashed terrible weapons against Iraq such as cluster bombs, napalm, and white phosphorus. American weapons destroyed Iraq's electrical, sewage, and water systems, leading to terrible and long term consequences for the Iraqi people. Economic sanctions strangled the devastated Iraqi economy. This was the Gulf War of 1990, in which the US would declare a victory. **Yet who were the winners? US oil companies, big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citibank, military contractors, and [neoconservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism) hardliners all profited immensely from the conflict.** **Through its bloody wars in the Middle East, the US effectively stymied technological advancement and economic growth throughout the region. **Meanwhile, other places in the Middle East, like Israel, Egypt and Turkey, all bought billions of dollars worth of US arms and weapons. **The US war machine also has a well-documented history of backing extremist groups as part of its foreign policy agendas. **In the 1980s, CIA director William Casey [persuaded US Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone) to provide [radical Muslims like Osama Bin Laden](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1670089.stm) and the militant Mujaheddin of Afghanistan with US warfare training and missiles to shoot down Soviet planes. Yet after defeating the Soviets over the course of a brutal decade, radical Islam would turn its attention to the US, seeking retaliation for their war crimes and bloodshed throughout the Middle East.

In light of the current Ukraine-Russia war, the agency's latest covert action involves [supporting Neo-Nazis in Ukraine](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-how-us-uk-government-propaganda-specialists-collaborated-with-nazis-ukraine) since at least 2014, the year of the far-right coup that overthrew pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych and incorporated the [Nazi group Azov Battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Brigade) into the country's National Guard. Since then, [declassified government documents](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--cia-has-backed-ukrainian-insurgents-before-lets-learn-from-those-mistakes) show that Ukraine was systematically developed as a proxy for US war against Russia. A former CIA official [reported](https://news.yahoo.com/cia-trained-ukrainian-paramilitaries-may-take-central-role-if-russia-invades-185258008.html) that the US was training an insurgency of Ukrainians on how \"to kill Russians\" in a secret CIA training program that started in 2015 and [operated for years](https://news.yahoo.com/exclusive-secret-cia-training-program-in-ukraine-helped-kyiv-prepare-for-russian-invasion-090052743.html). It also appears highly likely that the CIA has provided support to Azov Battalion. In 2016, Congress [removed a ban](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/congress-has-removed-a-ban-on-funding-neo-nazis-from-its-year-end-spending-bill/) on funding Ukrainian neo-fascist groups, effectively paving the way for American arms and weapons to fall in the hands of Ukraine's Nazi organizations. A January 2018 report by the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab confirmed that Azov Battalion was a recipient of American lethal weapons. This report appears to have disappeared from the internet. In recent months, a wide spectrum of observers of the Ukrainian civil war have documented the transfer of heavy weapons made in the USA to the Azov Battalion, and right under the nose of the US State Department. As NATO's de facto [lobbyist](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/donate/honor-roll-of-contributors-2019/) in Washington, and one of the most [fervent advocates](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/why-arming-ukraine-would-end-the-deadlock-in-the-donbas/) in Washington for arming the Ukrainian military, the Atlantic Council was an extremely unlikely source for such a disclosure. While the think tank's motives for exposing Azov's use of American arms remains unclear, its researchers wound up highlighting a truly scandalous episode of semi-covert American support for neo-Nazis. - Excerpt from Real News Network, \"[The US Is Arming And Assisting Neo-Nazis In Ukraine, While Congress Debates Prohibition](https://therealnews.com/the-us-is-arming-and-assisting-neo-nazis-in-ukraine-while-congress-debates-prohibition)\" Meanwhile, the Russia-Ukraine war has led to [half a million war casualties](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/us/politics/ukraine-russia-war-casualties.html) and the Pentagon is [unable to account](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-us-has-spent-billions-ukraine-war-aid-but-that-money-landing-corrupt-pockets) for the billions of US weaponry and financial aid flowing into Ukraine.

Futhermore, wars rarely achieve productive and peaceful outcomes. Whistleblower documents have brought this to light time and time again. [**The Pentagon Papers**](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-pentagon-papers-out-40-years-after-leak) released by former US military analyst Daniel Ellsburg uncovered the long history of government lies about the Vietnam War. What the American public heard was that we were winning the war, yet classified reports from top military officials show that they knew that American victory wouldn't be possible. A stalemate was found to be the most likely outcome-a stalemate that would lead to over 50,000 American deaths and millions of Vietnamese casualties. The impacts of this brutal war continue to reverberate, as illustrated by the US military use of 20 million gallons of the toxic herbicide Agent Orange on 4.5 million acres of Vietnam to destroy forest cover and food crops. Now, half a million Vietnamese children are born with serious birth defects and millions of Vietnamese continue to suffer from cancer and illnesses [caused by Agent Orange](https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/agent-orange-1). Inquiring deeper, the whole justification for war with Vietnam [was based on a lie](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/02/vietnam-presidents-lie-to-wage-war-iraq): the Tonkin Gulf incident in 1964. Support for war with Vietnam grew after the public was told that North Vietnamese torpedo boats launched an \"unprovoked attack\" against a U.S. destroyer in the Tonkin Gulf. The torpedo attack never happened, yet was reported as having taken place by the US government. [**The Afghan War Papers**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/afghan-papers-reveal-us-public-were-misled-about-unwinnable-war) revealed a series of confidential interviews with key military insiders regarding the Afghanistan war, in which high-ranking military officials [knew the war was unwinnable](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--us-set-up-afghan-army-fail) while keeping that view [hidden from the public](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/world/asia/afghanistan-war-documents.html). What was exposed were deliberate attempts to manipulate statistics so that the American public perceived military success in Afghanistan. \"Every data point was altered to present the best picture possible,\" said Bob Crowley, an army colonel who served as a senior counterinsurgency adviser to US military commanders in 2013 and 2014.** Worst off, an interview with one official estimated that [40% of US aid to Afghanistan](https://theworld.org/stories/2019-12-11/us-spending-afghanistan-fueled-rampant-corruption-reports-says) had been pocketed by officials, gangsters, warlords, drug lords and insurgents. ** Although US efforts in Afghanistan did pave the way for successes in health, education, and women's rights, billions of dollars [haven't improved safety or the economy](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-billions-dollars-havent-improved-safety-or-economy-afghanistan) in Afghanistan.

A $549 million fleet of cargo planes that flew for only a year and were sold for scrap for $40,257 six years later. A $249 million road construction project that only completed 15% of the road. A third of the 510 projects for the construction of hospital facilities in Afghanistan did not exist in the locations that SIGAR was given coordinates to. **One of the hospitals [was even reported](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bmvzzd/the-us-thought-one-of-its-afghani-hospitals-was-in-the-mediterranean-sea) to be in the Mediterranean Sea. \"Did we actually consider sustainability?\" Why build something if we know from the beginning that the Afghans will never be able to sustain or maintain it. That's the cruelest joke we have played on these poor Afghan citizens in some of these communities. We give them a brand new hospital, school or clinic and there's no doctors, no medicine or no electricity. - John Sopko, [Special Inspector General for SIGAR](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/nobodys-been-held-accountable-for-wasteful-spending-in-afghanistan-says-u-s-watchdog/) [**Iraq's Pentagon Papers**](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-iraqs-pentagon-papers-daniel-ellsberg) published by Wikileaks indicated more lies and deliberate downplaying of countless civilian deaths and [horrific instances of torture](https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/10/23/iraq-wikileaks-documents-describe-torture-detainees). The [Wikileaks publication](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-wikileaks-war-secrecy-truths-consequences) was a collection of 2,325,961 diplomatic cables and other US State Department records that disclosed shocking details about US forces misconduct, and the blatant denial of these abuses by the Pentagon. In the two years following 9/11, an [investigation by the Center for Public Integrity](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/false-pretenses/) found that Bush and top officials \"[uttered at least 935 lies](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--iraq-war-started-posttruth-era-america-to-blame)\" about the threat that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein posed to the United States. The possible presence of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq dominated the airwaves to justify going to war with Iraq, which gave rise to these war atrocities.

Harmful lies to justify war are exacerbated by the Pentagon's close relationship with corporate media. Corporate platforms like ABC, NBC, CBS, and PBS all skewed their coverage of the 2003 invasion of Iraq to solidify public support for war: A [2003 report](https://fair.org/take-action/action-alerts/in-iraq-crisis-networks-are-megaphones-for-official-views/) by the media watchdog Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) found that in the two weeks leading up to the invasion, ABC World News, NBC Nightly News, CBS Evening News, and the PBS Newshour featured a total of 267 American experts, analysts, and commentators on camera to supposedly help make sense of the march to war. Of these 267 guests, an astounding 75% were current or former government or military officials, and a grand total of one expressed any skepticism. The bedrock democratic principle of an independent, adversarial press was simply tossed out the window. - Excerpt from *LA Progressive*, \"[Who Controls How We Remember the Iraq War?](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-who-controls-how-we-remember-iraq-war)\" **We're $28,700 in the red for the quarter.

Their bodies were then allegedly burned to ashes, which the Russians claim to have eventually recovered.

Yet as the media chose to seriously downplay this key move, to this day very few know anything about it. ** The first article, from the respected British newspaper *The Guardian*, describes how Jose Bustani - the highly successful United Nations inspector of weapons of mass destruction at the time - had his position threatened by the U.S. government, and the shady reasons behind it. The article from the *New York Times* gives the final result - Bustani was removed by a UN vote with almost as many abstentions as votes in favor. If the U.S. had not forced out this highly praised man from his post, the Iraq War might never have happened. Notice that the * Times* fails to go into any depth about what really happened or its consequences. How sad that no major media media besides *The Guardian* was willing to discuss the implications of this highly manipulative act.

The coup will also shut down the peaceful options for dealing with the chemical weapons Iraq may possess, helping to ensure that war then becomes the only means of destroying them. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) enforces the chemical weapons convention. It inspects labs and factories and arsenals and oversees the destruction of the weapons they contain. Its director-general is a workaholic Brazilian diplomat called Jose Bustani. He has, arguably, done more in the past five years to promote world peace than anyone else on earth. His inspectors have overseen the destruction of 2 million chemical weapons and two-thirds of the world's chemical weapon facilities. He has so successfully cajoled reluctant nations that the number of signatories to the convention has risen from 87 to 145 in the past five years: the fastest growth rate of any multilateral body in recent times. **In May 2000, as a tribute to his extraordinary record, Bustani was re-elected unanimously by the member states for a second five-year term, even though he had yet to complete his first one. Last year Colin Powell wrote to him to thank him for his \"very impressive\" work. But now everything has changed. The man celebrated for his achievements has been denounced as an enemy of the people.** In January, with no prior warning or explanation, the US state department asked the Brazilian government to recall him, on the grounds that it did not like his \"management style\". This request directly contravenes the chemical weapons convention, which states \"the director-general ... shall not seek or receive instructions from any government\". Brazil refused. In March the US government accused Bustani of \"financial mismanagement\", \"demoralisation\" of his staff, \"bias\" and \"ill-considered initiatives\". It warned that if he wanted to avoid damage to his reputation, he must resign. Again, the US was trampling the convention, which insists that member states shall \"not seek to influence\" the staff. He refused to go. On March 19 the US proposed a vote of no confidence in Bustani. It lost. So it then did something unprecedented in the history of multi lateral diplomacy. It called a \"special session\" of the member states to oust him. The session begins on Sunday. And this time the US is likely to get what it wants.

And this time the US is likely to get what it wants. Since losing the vote last month, the United States, which is supposed to be the organisation's biggest donor, has been twisting the arms of weaker nations, refusing to pay its dues unless they support it, with the result that the OPCW could go under. Last week Bustani told me, \"the Europeans are so afraid that the US will abandon the convention that they are prepared to sacrifice my post to keep it on board\". His last hope is that the United Kingdom, whose record of support for the organisation has so far been exemplary, will make a stand. The meeting on Sunday will present Tony Blair's government with one of the clearest choices it has yet faced between multilateralism and the \"special relationship\". The US has not sought to substantiate the charges it has made against Bustani. The OPCW is certainly suffering from a financial crisis, but that is largely because the US unilaterally capped its budget and then failed to pay what it owed. The organisation's accounts have just been audited and found to be perfectly sound. Staff morale is higher than any organisation as underfunded as the OPCW could reasonably expect. Bustani's real crimes are contained in the last two charges, of \"bias\" and \"ill-considered initiatives\". **The charge of bias arises precisely because the OPCW is not biased. It has sought to examine facilities in the United States with the same rigour with which it examines facilities anywhere else.** But, just like Iraq, the US has refused to accept weapons inspectors from countries it regards as hostile to its interests, and has told those who have been allowed in which parts of a site they may and may not inspect. It has also passed special legislation permitting the president to block unannounced inspections, and banning inspectors from removing samples of its chemicals. \"Ill-considered initiatives\" is code for the attempts Bustani has made, in line with his mandate, to persuade Saddam Hussein to sign the chemical weapons convention. If Iraq agrees, it will then be subject to the same inspections - both routine and unannounced - as any other member state (with the exception, of course, of the United States). Bustani has so far been unsuccessful, but only because, he believes, he has not yet received the backing of the UN security council, with the result that Saddam knows he would have little to gain from signing. Bustani has suggested that if the security council were to support the OPCW's bid to persuade Iraq to sign, this would provide the US with an alternative to war.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__iraq_war_media.txt:2:b547e32fe343", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15289, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__iraq_war_media.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__iraq_war_media", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "as any other member state (with the exception, of course, of the United States).

Bustani has suggested that if the security council were to support the OPCW's bid to persuade Iraq to sign, this would provide the US with an alternative to war. It is hard to see why Saddam Hussein would accept weapons inspectors from Unmovic - the organisation backed by the security council - after its predecessor, Unscom, was found to be stuffed with spies planted by the US government. It is much easier to see why he might accept inspectors from an organisation which has remained scrupulously even-handed. Indeed, when Unscom was thrown out of Iraq in 1998, the OPCW was allowed in to complete the destruction of the weapons it had found. **Bustani has to go because he has proposed the solution to a problem the US does not want solved. ** \"What the Americans are doing,\" Bustani says, \"is a coup d'etat. They are using brute force to amend the convention and unseat the director-general.\" As the chemical weapons convention has no provisions permitting these measures, the US is simply ripping up the rules. If it wins, then the OPCW, like Unscom, will be fatally compromised. Success for the United States on Sunday would threaten the independence of every multilateral body. This is, then, one of those rare occasions on which our government could make a massive difference to the way the world is run. It could choose to support its closest ally, wrecking multilateralism and shutting down the alternatives to war. Or it could defy the United States in defence of world peace and international law. It will take that principled stand only if we, the people from whom it draws its power, make so much noise that it must listen. We have five days in which to stop the US from bullying its way to war. * *[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E0D91E3FF930A15757C0A9649C8B63](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E0D91E3FF930A15757C0A9649C8B63) *Published on Tuesday, April 23, 2002 in the [New York Times](http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?frow=0&n=10&srcht=a&query=%22Jos%E9+M.+Bustani%2C+a+Brazilian+diplomat+who+was+unanimously%22&srchst=nyt&hdlquery=&bylquery=&daterange=period&mon1=01&day1=01&year1=2001&mon2=09&day2=07&year2=2006&submit.x=23&submit.y=8)* [http://www.monbiot.com](http://www.monbiot.com) **U.S. Forces Out Head of Chemical Arms Agency by Marlise Simons** THE HAGUE, April 22 - The United States succeeded today in ousting the director of the global agency charged with ridding the world of chemical weapons after an intense diplomatic campaign that made a number of countries uncomfortable. **José M.

Most European nations voted with the United States, except for France, which abstained. Mexico, one of the countries that voted no, called the maneuver \"illegal\" because there was no provision in the rules to dismiss the director general. Diplomats said the many abstentions reflected the unease of a number of countries over the action. They said it had opened the door further for other international bodies to come under attack. **The United States, which is responsible for 22 percent of the agency's budget, had threatened to cut off funding until Mr. Bustani left.** \"I think a lot of people swallowed this because they thought it was better for Bustani to be removed than have the U.S. pull out and see the organization collapse,\" said one European diplomat at the meeting. **The firing of Mr. Bustani follows the removal last week of Robert Watson, a British-born climatologist who had been outspoken on the threat of global warming, as the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He was removed after pressure from Washington and at least one American oil company.** Mr. Bustani said that American officials approached him in late February, asking him to resign, but not to make the request public. \"They said they did not like my management style, but they said they were not prepare to elaborate,\" he said in an interview. Several weeks later, the State Department circulated a lengthy paper among members of the group and dispatched envoys to a number of capitals to secure enough votes to fire Mr. Bustani. The paper accuses him of confrontational and abrasive conduct and poor administrative and financial management. American officials also said Mr. Bustani had taken some \"ill-considered initiatives,\" without consulting with the United States and others. \"An effective director general needs to consult with member states, instead of launching initiatives,\" said an American official.

Almost all major developments in the Middle East, including ISIS and Al Qaeda, somehow end up supporting the long-term goals of Washington's elite to eliminate its enemies in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Iran.

They are ruthless, fanatical killers on a mission, and that mission is to wipe out anyone and everyone from any religion or belief system and to impose Shari'ah law. The mass executions, beheadings and even crucifixions that they are committing as they work towards this goal are flaunted like badges of pride, video taped and uploaded for the whole world to see. This is the new face of evil. Would it interest you to know who helped these psychopaths rise to power? Would it interest you to know who armed them, funded them and trained them? Would it interest you to know why? **This story makes more sense if we start in the middle, so we'll begin with the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.** The Libyan revolution was Obama's first major foreign intervention. It was portrayed as an extension of the Arab Spring, and NATO involvement was framed in humanitarian terms.

Not surprising, considering the fact that **the leader of the Libyan rebels later admitted that his fighters included Al-Qaeda linked jihadists**** who fought against allied troops in Iraq **(as reported in [this article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8407047/Libyan-rebel-commander-admits-his-fighters-have-al-Qaeda-links.html) in the UK's *Telegraph*)**.** These jihadist militants from Iraq were part of what national security analysts commonly referred to as Al-Qaeda in Iraq. Remember Al-Qaeda in Iraq was ISIS before it was rebranded. **With the assistance of U.S. and NATO intelligence and air support, the Libyan rebels captured Gaddafi and summarily executed him in the street, all the while enthusiastically chanting \"Allah Akbar\".** For many of those who had bought the official line about how these rebels were freedom fighters aiming to establish a liberal democracy in Libya, this was the beginning of the end of their illusions. Prior to the U.S. and NATO backed intervention, Libya had the highest standard of living of any country in Africa. This according to the [U.N.'s Human Development Index rankings for 2010.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Libya_under_Muammar_Gaddafi#mediaviewer/File:UN_Human_Development_Report_2010_1.PNG) However in the years following the coup, [the country descended into chaos](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/11054194/Libya-in-chaos-as-Islamists-seize-capitals-airport.html), with [extremism and violence running rampant.](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/world/2014/07/22/Libyan-rebels-behead-Filipino-for-being-non-Muslim-.html) Libya is now widely regarded as [failed state](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/deadly-libya-violence-pushes-country-toward-failed-state-n169331). **After Gaddafi was overthrown, the Libyan armories were looted and massive quantities of weapons were sent by the Libyan rebels to Syria. The weapons, which included anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles were smuggled into Syria through Turkey, a NATO ally. The *Times of London* [reported on the arrival of the shipment](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/middleeast/article3537770.ece) on September 14th, 2012 (further confirmation in [this New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/22/world/africa/in-a-turnabout-syria-rebels-get-libyan-weapons.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)). ** **This was just three days after Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed by the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi.

The \"rat line\" was a covert network used to channel weapons and ammunition from Libya, through southern Turkey and across the Syrian border. Funding was provided by Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. With Stevens dead, any [direct U.S. involvement in that arms shipment](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-syria-heavy-weapons-jihadists-2012-10) was buried, and Washington would continue to claim that they had not sent heavy weaponry into Syria. It was at this time that [jihadist fighters from Libya began flooding into Syria](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9606691/Syria-despatch-rebel-fighters-fear-the-growing-influence-of-their-Bin-Laden-faction.html) as well. And not just low level militants. Many were [experienced commanders who had fought in multiple theaters](http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/11/isis_praised_slain_c.php). The U.S. and its allies were now fully focused on taking down Assad's government in Syria. **As in Libya this [regime change was to be framed in terms of human rights](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gerard-powers/humanitarian-intervention-and-just-war-in-syria_b_1707436.html), and now overt support began to supplement the backdoor channels, as reported in [this*New York Times*article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/world/middleeast/arms-airlift-to-syrian-rebels-expands-with-cia-aid.html?pagewanted=all). The growing jihadist presence was swept under the rug and covered up. ** However as the rebels gained strength, the reports of [war crimes](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jun/27/syrians-behead-christians-helping-military-cia-shi/) and atrocities that they were committing began to create a bit of a public relations problem for Washington. It then became standard policy to insist that U.S. support was only being given to what they referred to as [\"moderate\" rebel forces](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/syria-civil-war-us-will-arm-moderate-rebels-says-barack-obama-confirming-use-of-chemical-weapons-by-president-bashar-alassads-regime-8658368.html). This distinction, however, had no basis in reality. **In an interview given in April of 2014, FSA commander Jamal Maarouf [admitted that his fighters regularly conduct joint operations with Al-Nusra.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/i-am-not-fighting-againstalqaida-itsnot-our-problem-says-wests-last-hope-in-syria-9233424.html) Al-Nusra is the official Al-Qa'ida branch in Syria.** This statement is further validated by an interview given in June of 2013 by Colonel Abdel Basset Al-Tawil, commander of the FSA's Northern Front. In this interview, he openly discusses his ties with Al-Nusra and expresses his desire to see Syria ruled by sharia law.

The rebels themselves threatened the West that they would expose what really happened if they were not given more advanced weaponry within one month. By the way, this also explains why [Washington then decided to target Russia next.](http://scgnews.com/the-ukraine-crisis-what-youre-not-being-told) This threat was made on June 10th, 2013. In what can only be described as an amazing coincidence, just nine days later, [the rebels received their first official shipment of heavy weapons in Aleppo.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10131063/Syrian-rebels-get-first-heavy-weapons-on-the-front-line-of-Aleppo.html) After the second sarin gas fiasco, which was also exposed and therefore failed to garner public support for airstrikes, the U.S. continued to increase its the training and support for the rebels.

According to *Haaretz*, Israel had also provided direct assistance in military operations against Assad four months prior (access a cached version of the *Haaretz* page [here](https://archive.today/qeRSZ)). **Then in May of 2014, [PBS ran a report](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/foreign-affairs-defense/syria-arming-the-rebels/syrian-rebels-describe-u-s-backed-training-in-qatar/) in which they interviewed rebels who were trained by the U.S. in Qatar. According to those rebels they were being trained to finish off soldiers who survived attacks.** \"They trained us to ambush regime or enemy vehicles and cut off the road,\" said the fighter, who is identified only as \"Hussein.\" \"They also trained us on how to attack a vehicle, raid it, retrieve information or weapons and munitions, and how to finish off soldiers still alive after an ambush.\" **This is a blatant violation of the Geneva conventions.** It also runs contrary to conventional military strategy. In conventional military strategy soldiers are better off left wounded, because this ends up costing the enemy more resources. Executing captured enemy soldiers is the kind of tactic used when you want to strike terror in the hearts of the enemy. It also just happens to be standard operating procedure for ISIS aka the Islamic State. One month after this report, in June of 2014, ISIS made its dramatic entry, crossing over the Syrian border into Iraq, capturing Mosul, Baiji and almost reaching Baghdad. The internet was suddenly flooded with footage of drive by shootings, large scale death marches, and mass graves. And of course any Iraqi soldier that was captured was executed. **Massive quantities of American military equipment [were seized during that operation](http://www.news.com.au/world/iraqi-sunni-insurgents-seize-huge-cache-of-usmade-arms-and-equipment/story-fndir2ev-1226952811362). ISIS took entire truckloads of humvees. They also took helicopters, tanks, and artillery. They photographed and video taped themselves and advertised what they were doing on social media, and yet for some reason Washington didn't even TRY to stop them.** U.S. military doctrine clearly calls for the destruction of military equipment and supplies when friendly forces cannot prevent them from falling into enemy hands, but that didn't happen here. ISIS was allowed to carry this equipment out of Iraq and into Syria unimpeded.** The U.S. military had the means to strike these convoys, but they didn't lift a finger, even though they had been launching drone strikes in Pakistan that same week, as [reported in the*New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/world/asia/pakistan.html).** Why would they do that?

The Soviets invaded, and the ten years of war that followed are considered by many historians as being one of the primary causes of the fall of the USSR. This example doesn't just establish precedent. **What we're seeing happen in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria right now is actually the continuation of an old story. Al-Nusra and ISIS (the Islamic State) are ideological and organizational decedents of these extremist elements that the U.S. government made use of thirty years ago.** The U.S. then went on to create a breeding ground for these extremists by invading Iraq in 2003. Had it not been for the vacuum of power left by the removal and execution of Saddam, Al-Qaeda in Iraq, aka ISIS, would not exist. And had it not been for Washington's attempt at toppling Assad by arming, funding and training shadowy militant groups in Syria, there is no way that ISIS would have been capable of storming into Iraq in June of 2014. **No matter how you cut it, ISIS is a product of U.S. government's twisted foreign policy.** Now all of this may seem contradictory to you as you watch the drums of war against ISIS begin to beat louder and the [air strikes against them are", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__isis-islamic-state-origins.txt:5:26e512567494", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15298, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__isis-islamic-state-origins.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__isis-islamic-state-origins", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "been for Washington's attempt at toppling Assad by arming, funding and training shadowy militant groups in Syria, there is no way that ISIS would have been capable of storming into Iraq in June of 2014. **No matter how you cut it, ISIS is a product of U.S. government's twisted foreign policy.** Now all of this may seem contradictory to you as you watch the drums of war against ISIS begin to beat louder and the [air strikes against them are gradually widened](http://www.wjla.com/articles/2014/08/president-obama-considers-possible-airstrikes-in-syria-against-isil-s-terrorist-army--106516.html).

Why did the U.S. government back Saddam in 1980 when he launched a war of aggression against Iran, even though they knew that he was using chemical weapons? Why did the U.S. fund and arm Islamic extremists in Afghanistan against the Soviets?** There's a pattern here if you look closely. This is a tried and true geopolitical strategy. Step 1 [Problem]: **Build up a dictator or extremist group which can then be used to wage proxy wars against opponents. During this stage any crimes committed by these proxies are swept under the rug.** Step 2 [Reaction]: When these nasty characters have outlived their usefulness, that's when it's time to pull out all that dirt from under the rug and start publicizing it 24/7. This obviously works best when the public has no idea how these bad guys came to power. Step 3 [Solution]: Finally, when the public practically begs for the government to do something thanks to the media constant war drums, a solution is proposed. Usually the solution involves military intervention, the loss of certain liberties, or both. **ISIS has been extremely useful to US interests. They have essentially done Washington's dirty work by weakening Assad. **In 2014, while the news cycle has focused almost exclusively on Ukraine and Russia, ISIS made major headway in Syria.

The U.S. government and its allies should should be aggressively condemned for their failed regime change policies and the individuals behind these decisions should be charged for war crimes. This would have to be done on a nation by nation level since the U.N. has done nothing but enable NATO aggression. While this may not immediately result in these criminals being arrested, it would send a message. This can be done. Malaysia has already proven this [by convicting the Bush administration of war crimes](http://www.salon.com/2011/11/23/bush_and_blair_found_guilty_of_war_crimes_for_iraq_attack/) in absentia (note the strange coincidence that one Malaysian Airlines flight has disappeared and one has been shot down). Now you might be thinking: \"This all sounds fine and good, but what does this have to do with me? I can't influence this situation.\" That perspective is quite common, and for most people, it's paralyzing. But the truth of the matter is that we can influence this. We've done it before, and we can do it again. This isn't going to be easy. **To succeed we have to start thinking strategically. Like it or not, this is a [chess game](https://www.WantToKnow.info/brzezinskigrandchessboard).** If we really want to rock the boat, we have to start reaching out to people in positions of influence. This can mean talking to broadcasters at your local radio station, newspaper, or TV station, or it can mean contacting influential bloggers, celebrities, business figures or government officials. Reaching out to current serving military and young people who may be considering joining up is also important. But even if it's just your neighbor or your coworker, every single person we can reach brings us closer to critical mass. **The most important step is to start.** [[Video link](http://www.youtube.com/embed/9RC1Mepk_Sw)] If you are confused about why this is all happening, watch this video we put out on September 11th, 2012.

Pro-Israeli media and groups depict Israel as the innocent victim and Palestinians as heartless terrorists killing innocent civilians. Pro-Palestinian media and groups villainize the Israelis as indiscriminate killers and glorify their own cause. **Very rarely, even in Western media, do we see balanced stories on the highly charged conflict between Israel and Palestine.** Below is a rare, balanced article from Canada's respected *Toronto Star* which explores the root causes of the intense Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Though written years back, it clearly shows how powerful factions of both sides play a role in fostering a tense climate which supports an ever more entrenched cycle of hatred and violence.

This particular utterance did not describe a heinous incident or act but instead conveyed an over-riding state of mind, one that enabled at least some Israeli soldiers to carry out some thoroughly loathsome deeds while they were deployed in Gaza - including, it seems, the cold-blooded murder of Palestinian civilians. **\"I don't know how to describe it,\" said the soldier in question, a squad leader who is clearly troubled by much of what he saw. \"The lives of Palestinians, let's say, is something much, much", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__israelis_palestinians_conflict_causes.txt:0:e52b574f63f9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15302, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__israelis_palestinians_conflict_causes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__israelis_palestinians_conflict_causes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "describe a heinous incident or act but instead conveyed an over-riding state of mind, one that enabled at least some Israeli soldiers to carry out some thoroughly loathsome deeds while they were deployed in Gaza - including, it seems, the cold-blooded murder of Palestinian civilians. **\"I don't know how to describe it,\" said the soldier in question, a squad leader who is clearly troubled by much of what he saw. \"The lives of Palestinians, let's say, is something much, much less important than the lives of our soldiers.\"** Psychologists have at least a couple of terms for the tendency of humans to view their adversaries as springing from a lower order of being. Known either as pseudo-speciation or dehumanization, the phenomenon is as ancient as the Bible and as common nowadays as olive trees in the Holy Land. **It enables both Arabs and Jews to behave in ways that would be nearly impossible if their victims were acknowledged to be human beings.** \"We know from professional studies this happens in just about every conflict,\" said Gabriel Ben-Dor, who heads the school of politics at the University of Haifa. \"The more protracted the conflict, the more likely it is to occur.\" Dating back to at least 1948, the feud between Jews and Arabs has had more than six decades to fester and weep, and by now the process of dehumanization is practically complete. It is also mutual. \"Certainly on the Arab side and particularly the Islamist side, Israelis and Jews are totally dehumanized,\" said Yossi Alpher, co-editor of the [bitterlemons.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20101213193924/https://bitterlemons.net/about.php) Internet site. \"In Friday sermons in mosques, they say we are descendants of pigs and monkeys. \"We are totally dehumanized in the militant Islamist narrative.\" If there is one man in this country who has explored the dark side of Israel's heart, it is Yehuda Shaul, director of [Breaking the Silence](http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/about/organization), an organization that collects and publishes accounts by Israeli soldiers about their sometimes brutal behaviour while on duty in the Palestinian territories. Shaul says the reports in *Haaretz* and *Maariv* - tales of widespread vandalism and at least some cases of unprovoked killing of civilians - are consistent with the war stories he has so far collected on his own about the January offensive, and he finds them unusually troubling. \"It's a very, very different situation,\" he said. **\"The soldiers say: 'Everyone is an enemy. Everyone here is a legitimate target.'

Ninety-eight per cent of kids in Gaza did not feel safe during the (January) war. So how will those children perceive the Israelis now?\" **Organized religion has done little to reduce tensions on either side and has often made an already deadly situation even worse, driving wedges between Muslims and Jews while ignoring or denying their common humanity.** \"Religion has so much influence in the Middle East,\" said Ben-Dor. \"It's the key factor, but it is not playing a positive role at all.\" Meanwhile, the conflict grinds on, the hatred deepens, and the death toll climbs relentlessly higher. \"I do predict the cycle of violence will continue,\" said Abu Tawahina. \"The next generation of Palestinians and Israelis will be more fundamentalist and extremist. \"When aggression is carried out on one side, the other side will react aggressively as well.\" **Note:** See original article on the *Toronto Star* website on [this webpage](https://www.thestar.com/news/2009/03/21/how_israelis_islamists_dehumanize_each_other.html).

Lester Walker** **October 1946** Someone wrote to Wright Field recently, saying he understood this country had got together quite a collection of enemy war secrets, that many were now on public sale, and could he, please, be sent everything on German jetengines. The Air Documents Division of 'the Army Air Forces' answered: \"Sorry - butthat would be fifty tons.\" Moreover, that **fifty tons was just a small portion of what is today undoubtedly the biggest collection of captured enemy war secrets ever assembled.** It may interest you to learn that the war secrets in this collection run into the thousands, that the mass of documents is mountainous, and that there has never before been anything quite comparable to it. Wright Field is working from a documents \"mother lode\" of fifteen hundred tons. In Washington, the Office of Technical Services ... reports that tens of thousands of tons of material are involved. It is estimated that over a million separate items must be handled, and that they, very likely, contain practically all the scientific, industrial, and military secrets of Germany. How the collection came to be goes back, for beginnings, to one day in 1944 when the Allied Combined Chief of Staff set in motion a colossal search for war secrets in occupied German territory.

It was about half thumb-size. \"Notice it is heavy porcelain - not glass - and thus virtually indestructible. It is a thousand watt - one-tenth the size of similar American tube. Today our manufacturers know the secret of making it. **He [also] showed me then what had been two of the most closely-guarded technical secrets of the war: the infra-red device which the Germans invented for seeing at night, and the remarkable diminutive generator which operated it. The diminutive generator - five inches across - stepped up current from an ordinary flashlight battery to 15,000 volts. It had a walnut-sized motor which spun a rotor at 10,000 rpm. The generator then ran 3,000 hours!** \"You see this...\" the head of Communications Unit, TIIB, said to me. It was metal, and looked like a complicated doll's house with the roof off. \"It is the chassis or frame, for a radio. To make the same thing, Americans would machine cut, hollow, shape, fit - a dozen different processes. This is done on a press in one operation. It is called the 'cold extrusion' process. We do it with some soft, splattery metals. But by this process the Germans do it with cold steel! Thousands of parts now made as castings or drop forgings or from malleable iron can now be made this way. **The production speed increase is a little matter of one thousand per cent.\"** But of all the industrial secrets, perhaps, the biggest windfall came from the laboratories and plants of the great German cartel, I. G. Farbenindustrie. Never before, it is claimed, was there such a store-house of secret information. It covers liquid and solid fuels, metallurgy, synthetic rubber, textiles, chemicals, plastics, drugs, dyes. One American dye authority declares: \"It includes the production know-how and the secret formulas for over fifty thousand dyes. Many of them are faster and better than ours. Many are colors we were never able to make. The American dye industry will be advanced at least ten years.\" In matters of food, medicine, and branches", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__nazi_technology_war_secrets_2p.txt:1:22e920cc2f9c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15307, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__nazi_technology_war_secrets_2p.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__nazi_technology_war_secrets_2p", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "it is claimed, was there such a store-house of secret information.

Many are colors we were never able to make. The American dye industry will be advanced at least ten years.\" In matters of food, medicine, and branches of the military art the finds of the search teams were no less impressive. Perhaps one of the most exciting searches was also the grimmest. This was the hunt for hidden documents which might reveal that Nazi scientists had frozen human beings to death and then tried to bring them back to life again. **Victims had been immersed naked in ice water until they lost consciousness. All the time elaborate testings were constantly made. Seven subjects were chilled to death beyond revival in from fifty-three to one hundred and six minutes.** \"As for medical secrets in this collection,\" one Army-surgeon has remarked, \"some of them will save American medicine years of research. Some of them are revolutionary - like, for instance, the German technique for treatment after prolonged and usually fatal exposure to cold.\" This discovery ... reversed everything medical science thought about the subject. In every one of the dread experiments the subjects were most successfully revived, both temporarily and permanently, by immediate immersion in hot water. In two cases of complete standstill of heart and cessation of respiration, a hot bath at 122 degrees brought both subjects back to life. Positively ionized air was discovered to have deleterious effects upon human well-being, and to account for the discomfort and depression felt at times when the barometer is falling. In many persons, it was found, its presence brought on asthma, hay fever, and nervous tension. It raised high blood pressure, sometimes to the danger point. It would bring on the symptoms common in mountain sickness - labored and rapid breathing, dizziness, fatigue, sleepiness. Negatively ionized air, however, did all the opposite. It was exhilarating, creating a feeling of high spirits and well-being. Mental depression was wiped out by it. And in aeronautics and guided missiles [the secrets] proved to be downright alarming. \"The V-2 rocket, which bombed London,\" an Army Air Force publication reports, \"was just a toy compared to what the Germans had up their sleeve.\" When the war ended, we now know, they had 138 types of guided missiles in various stages of production or development, using every known kind of remote control and fuse: radio, radar, wire, continuous wave, acoustics, infra-red, light beams, and magnetics, to name some; and for power, all methods of jet propulsion for either subsonic or supersonic speeds.

Little wonder, then, that today **Army Air Force experts declare publicly that in rocket power and guided missiles the Nazis were ahead of us by at least ten years.** For the release and dissemination of all these one-time secrets the Office of the Publication Board was established by an order of President Truman within ten days after Japan surrendered. Today translators and abstracters of the Office of Technical Services [OTS], successor to the OPB, are processing them at the rate of about a thousand a week. The order directed that not only enemy war secrets should be published, but also (with some exceptions) all American secrets, scientific and technical, of all government war boards. And is the public doing anything with these one-time war secrets? It is eating them up. As many as twenty thousand orders have been filled in a month, and the order rate is now a thousand items a day. Scientists and engineers declare that the information is \"cutting years from the time we would devote to problems already scientifically investigated.\" Company executives practically park on the OTS's front doorstep, wanting to be first to get hold of a particular report on publication. Some information is so valuable that to get it a single day ahead of a competitor, may be worth thousands of dollars. **A research head of another business firm took notes for three hours in the OTS offices one day. \"Thanks very much,\" he said, as he stood to go, \"the notes from these documents are worth at least half a million dollars to my company.\"** **Note:** To read the entire fascinating article on Nazi secret experiments, Nazi secret weapons, and Nazi war technology, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/war/4610_secret_nazi_war_technology).

Declassified documents from the U.S. National Archives prove that through Operation Paperclip, the CIA, NASA, and many other branches of government provided aliases for top Nazi scientists to enter and be employed by the U.S., even though many of these had committed heinous war crimes.

Chapter IV: Operation Paperclip \"What you were made to feel was that the country was in desperate peril and we had to do whatever it took to save it.\" - Hugh Cunningham, CIA Official181 As the Western Theater of World War II came to a close, there was a mad rush between the Soviet Union and the United States to be the first army to enter and secure Germany. It was not for consideration of land; that would be meted out later during the Yalta and Potsdam conferences. Nor was it to capture the Nazi leadership and bring them to trial for their heinous crimes against humanity. In fact, the goal was the opposite. The rush to secure Germany was much more about securing Germany's infrastructure: their leadership and the best minds in intelligence, science and industry. **NationalArchives.gov hosts a list of over 1,500 Nazis that were transferred into America, many of them rampant war criminals.182 It has been released to the public only recently thanks to the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. The project that oversaw this endeavor is known as Operation Paperclip** and was undertaken by the Office Of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA. President Harry Truman formally ordered the Operation in August 1945, but it had covertly begun months earlier, in May. Truman's orders expressly forbid the transfer of any person known \"to have been a member of the Nazi Party, and more than a nominal participant in its activities, or an active supporter of Nazi militarism\".183 This directive was not followed, for it would have prevented the acquisition of a lot of prominent Nazis such as Arthur Rudolph, who endorsed the usage of slave labor from concentration camps for the building of the V2 rocket184 and later became a prominent figure in NASA.185 More people would die building the V2 rocket - a number estimated at 60,000 - than were killed by it in combat.186 The dossiers of prominent Nazis brought into the United States such as Wernher von Braun cannot be found on the National Archives sheet; we can conclude that either identities were faked and whitewashed during the process, or the 1,500 names is an incomplete tally. Regardless, we can conclude that the order of Truman was not heeded, and **many former Nazis became entrenched within the United States science, intelligence and industrial industries, undoubtedly contributing to a web of psychopathic conditioning.** There are many interesting profiles of war criminals who found employment in the United States after the war. Krunoslav Draganovic, for example, was a Franciscan priest who actively served the Nazi satellite regime in Croatia, where they were responsible for over 350,000 deaths. He also facilitated", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__operation-paperclip.txt:1:c2b905fda1cd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15312, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__operation-paperclip.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__operation-paperclip", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "we can conclude that the order of Truman was not heeded, and **many former Nazis became entrenched within the United States science, intelligence and industrial industries, undoubtedly contributing to a web of psychopathic conditioning.** There are many interesting profiles of war criminals who found employment in the United States after the war. Krunoslav Draganovic, for example, was a Franciscan priest who actively served the Nazi satellite regime in Croatia, where they were responsible for over 350,000 deaths. He also facilitated the escape of numerous Croatian war criminals through the assets of the clergy. After the war, he was hired as a U.S. spy.187 **Kurt Blome was the director of the Nazi Biological Warfare program and former SS officer. He oversaw nerve gas experimentation on prisoners at Auschwitz, and established the bioweapons research center for Heinrich Himmler. One of his experiments involved inoculating prisoners with the plague and recording its progression.188 He was hired by the US Army Chemical Corps in 1951 to work on chemical warfare research.189** **The most interesting case study is that of Reinhard Gehlen, a Major General in the German Wehrmacht, close confidant of Hitler, and head of the German Army Intelligence on the Eastern Front. The OSS found that Gehlen's knowledge of the Soviets that he had gained during World War II was so important that not only did they let him keep his job, he was able to maintain a vast majority of his infrastructure. What became known as the Gehlen organization functioned as a semi-autonomous intelligence unit for the United States and West Berlin, and employed over 100 former Gestapo and SS officers.190** \"The Gehlen Organization was the one group that did have networks inside Eastern Europe, and that is why we hired them... Hiring Gehlen was the biggest mistake the US ever made. Our allies said, 'You are putting Nazis at the senior levels of your intelligence', and they were right. The Gehlen organization was the primary source of intelligence that claimed that, 'The Soviets were about to attack West Germany' ...that was the biggest bunch of baloney. Gehlen had to make his money by creating a threat that we were afraid of, so we would give him more money to tell us about it. In my opinion, the Gehlen Organization provided nothing worthwhile for understanding or estimating Soviet military or political capabilities in Eastern Europe or anywhere else. The Gehlen organization had been penetrated by Soviet intelligence and many of the US Nazi assets were now double agents, taking CIA wages and turning around and selling information to the enemy.\" - Victor Marchetti, CIA Veteran and former Chief of Soviet Strategic War Plans191 The lack of internal security in the Gehlen Organization was egregious. One former Army Counter-Intelligence Corps officer lamented: \"Recruiting methods then employed were so loose that former German Officers and noncoms were blindly being approached to work for American", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__operation-paperclip.txt:2:83ac3703c446", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15313, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__operation-paperclip.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__operation-paperclip", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "been penetrated by Soviet intelligence and many of the US Nazi assets were now double agents, taking CIA wages and turning around and selling information to the enemy.\" - Victor Marchetti, CIA Veteran and former Chief of Soviet Strategic War Plans191 The lack of internal security in the Gehlen Organization was egregious. One former Army Counter-Intelligence Corps officer lamented: \"Recruiting methods then employed were so loose that former German Officers and noncoms were blindly being approached to work for American Intelligence in espionage activity directed against the USSR.\"192 Not only did this mean that the Gehlen Organization became saturated with radical Nazis and other fascist elements, it also served as an easy entry of infiltration by the Soviet Union. The organization functioned semi-autonomously so strict controls over their operations was impossible. The Soviet press did not hesitate to use the Gehlen Organization as an effective propaganda tool, pointing out that the West had maintained the very intelligence unit that was responsible for a long series of crimes against humanity along the Eastern Front of the War. Future Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms stated that: \"The reports in the Soviet-dominated press in Germany concerning the use of former German staff and intelligence is such that there is no question that the Russians know this operation is going on even though they got some of the details wrong... Certainly the fact that so much publicity has been given to this indicates serious flaws in the Operation.\"193 One official CIA document titled \"Forging an Intelligence Partnership: The CIA and the Origins of the BND, 1945-49\", noted that the Gehlen Organization would take CIA assets that they received and then sell them on the black market for more funds.194 The reference is vague but likely refers to selling arms and ammunition to various underground right wing elements. **Consider this: At the end of the War, the Office of Strategic Services was a small organization of 13,000 members195, while the Gehlen organization consisted of at least 4,000 members by the year 1949.196 Can we accurately say that United States intelligence absorbed the Nazi infrastructure without considering how much of an influence it had on the beginnings of these clandestine institutions?** 181 John Marks, \"The Search for the Manchurian Candidate: The CIA and Mind Control\" 1979.

Written and Produced by Adam Curtis. VO: In the past, politicians promised to create a better world. They had different ways of achieving this. But their power and authority came from the optimistic visions they offered to their people. Those dreams failed. And today, people have lost faith in ideologies. Increasingly, politicians are seen simply as managers of public life. But now, they have discovered a new role that restores their power and authority. Instead of delivering dreams, politicians now promise to protect us from nightmares. They say that they will rescue us from dreadful dangers that we cannot see and do not understand. And the greatest danger of all is international terrorism. A powerful and sinister network, with sleeper cells in countries across the world. A threat that needs to be fought by a war on terror. But much of this threat is a fantasy, which has been exaggerated and distorted by politicians. It's a dark illusion that has spread unquestioned through governments around the world, the security services, and the international media. VO: This is a series of films about how and why that fantasy was created, and who it benefits. At the heart of the story are two groups: the American neoconservatives, and the radical Islamists. Both were idealists who were born out of the failure of the liberal dream to build a better world. And both had a very similar explanation for what caused that failure. These two groups have changed the world, but not in the way that either intended. Together, they created today's nightmare vision of a secret, organized evil that threatens the world. A fantasy that politicians then found restored their power and authority in a disillusioned age. And those with the darkest fears became the most powerful. [ OPENING TITLES: THE POWER OF NIGHTMARES / THE RISE OF THE POLITICS OF FEAR Part One: BABY IT'S COLD OUTSIDE ] VO: The story begins in the summer of 1949...

His name was Sayyed Qutb. Qutb had been sent to the U.S. to study its educational system, and he enrolled in the local state college. His photographs appear in the college yearbook. But Qutb was destined to become much more than a school inspector. Out of his experiences of America that summer, Qutb was going to develop a powerful set of ideas that would directly inspire those who flew the planes on the attack of September the 11th. As he had traveled across the country, Qutb had become increasingly disenchanted with America. The very things that, on the surface, made the country look prosperous and happy, Qutb saw as signs of an inner corruption and decay. JOHN CALVERT, Islamist historian: This was Truman's America, and many Americans today regard it as a golden age of their civilization. But for Qutb, he saw a sinister side in this. All around him was crassness, corruption, vulgarity-talk centered on movie stars and automobile prices. He was also very concerned that the inhabitants of Greeley spent a lot of time in lawn care. Pruning their hedges, cutting their lawns. This, for Qutb, was indicative of the selfish and materialistic aspect of American life. Americans lived these isolated lives surrounded by their lawns. They lusted after material goods. And this, says Qutb quite succinctly, is the taste of America. VO: What Qutb believed he was seeing was a hidden and dangerous reality underneath the surface of ordinary American life. One summer night, he went to a dance at a local church hall. He later wrote that what he saw that night crystallized his vision. CALVERT: He talks about how the pastor played on the gramophone one of the big-band hits of the day, \"Baby, It's Cold Outside.\" He dimmed the lights so as to create a dreamy, romantic effect. And then, Qutb says that \"chests met chests, arms circled waists, and the hall was full of lust and love.\" VO: To most people watching this dance, it would have been an innocent picture of youthful happiness. But Qutb saw something else: the dancers in front of him were tragic lost souls. They believed that they were free. But in reality, they were trapped by their own selfish and greedy desires. American society was not going forwards; it was taking people backwards. They were becoming isolated beings, driven by primitive animal forces. Such creatures, Qutb believed, could corrode the very bonds that held society together. And he became determined that night to prevent this culture of selfish individualism taking over his own country. [ TITLE: CHICAGO ] VO: But Qutb was not alone.

At the same time, in Chicago, there was another man who shared the same fears about the destructive force of individualism in America. He was an obscure political philosopher at the University of Chicago. But his ideas would also have far-reaching consequences, because they would become the shaping force behind the neoconservative movement, which now dominates the American administration. He was called Leo Strauss. Strauss is a mysterious figure. He refused to be filmed or interviewed. He devoted his time to creating a loyal band of students. And what he taught them was that the prosperous liberal society they were living in contained the seeds of its own destruction. Professor HARVEY MANSFIELD, Straussian Philosopher, Harvard University: He didn't give interviews, or write political essays, or appear on the radio-there wasn't TV yet-or things like that. But he did want to get a school of students to see what he had seen: that Western liberalism led to nihilism, and had undergone a development at the end of which it could no longer define itself or defend itself. A development which took everything praiseworthy and admirable out of human beings, and made us into dwarf animals. Made us into herd animals-sick little dwarves, satisfied with a dangerous life in which nothing is true and everything is permitted. VO: Strauss believed that the liberal idea of individual freedom led people to question everything-all values, all moral truths. Instead, people were led by their own selfish desires. And this threatened to tear apart the shared values which held society together. But there was a way to stop this, Strauss believed. It was for politicians to assert powerful and inspiring myths that everyone could believe in. They might not be true, but they were necessary illusions. One of these was religion; the other was the myth of the nation. And in America, that was the idea that the country had a unique destiny to battle the forces of evil throughout the world. This myth was epitomized, Strauss told his students, in his favorite television program: Gunsmoke. Professor STANLEY ROSEN, Pupil of Leo Strauss 1949: Strauss was a great fan of American television. Gunsmoke was his great favorite, and he would hurry home from the seminar, which would end at, you know, 5:30 or so, and have a quick dinner so he could be at his seat before the television set when Gunsmoke came on. And he felt that this was good, this show. This had a salutary effect on the American public, because it showed the conflict between good and evil in a way that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__power_of_nightmares_transcript_1.txt:2:3180bfabec9b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15320, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__power_of_nightmares_transcript_1.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__power_of_nightmares_transcript_1", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "was a great fan of American television.

And he felt that this was good, this show. This had a salutary effect on the American public, because it showed the conflict between good and evil in a way that would be immediately intelligible to everyone. BAD MAN on Gunsmoke: Let's see what happens! JAMES ARNESS: No! [ SHOOTS bad man; bad man DROPS to the ground ] ROSEN: The hero has a white hat; he's faster on the draw than the bad man; the good guy wins. And it's not just that the good guy wins, but that values are clear. That's America! We're gonna triumph over the evils of... of... that are trying to destroy us and the virtues of the Western frontier. Good and evil. VO: Leo Strauss' other favorite program was Perry Mason. And this, he told his students, epitomized the role that they, the elite, had to play. In public, they should promote the myths necessary to rescue America from decay. But in private, they didn't have to believe in them. ROSEN: Perry Mason was different from Gunsmoke. The extremely cunning man who, as far as we can see, is very virtuous and uses his great intelligence and quickness of mind to rescue his clients from dangers, but who could be fooling us-because he's cleverer than we are. Is he really telling the truth? Maybe his client is guilty! VO: In 1950, Sayyed Qutb traveled back to Egypt from America. He too was determined to find some way of controlling the forces of selfish individualism. And as he traveled, he began to envisage a new type of society. It would have all the modern benefits of Western science and technology, but a more political Islam would have a central role to play, keeping individualism in check. It would provide a moral framework that would stop people's selfish desires from overwhelming them. But Qutb realized that American culture was already spreading to Egypt, trapping the masses in its seductive dream. What was needed, he believed, was an elite, a vanguard who could see through these illusions of freedom, just as he had in America, and who would then lead the masses to realize the higher truth. Dr AZZAM TAMIMI, Institute of Islamic Political Thought: The masses need to be led. And it is this vanguard group that will be responsible for the task of leading the people out of the darkness and into the light of Islam.

Because the masses had succumbed to their own selfish desires, and he wanted the vanguard to be different, to be pure, to be standing together outside all of this corrupt situation, bringing people back to the truth. VO: On his return, Qutb became politically active in Egypt. He joined a group called the Muslim Brotherhood, who wanted Islam to play a major role in governing Egyptian society. And in 1952, the Brotherhood supported the revolution led by General Nasser that overthrew the last remnants of British rule. But Nasser very quickly made it clear that the new Egypt was going to be a secular society that emulated Western morals. He quickly forged an alliance with America. And the CIA came to Egypt to organize security agencies for the new regime. Faced with this, the Muslim Brotherhood began to organize against Nasser, and in 1954 Qutb and other leading members of the Brotherhood were arrested by the security services. What then happened to Qutb was going to have consequences for the whole world. [ ARABIC-SPEAKING VOICE FROM PRISON CAMP FILM ] VO: In the 1970s, this film was made, that showed what happened in Nasser's main prison in the '50s and '60s. It was based on the testimony of survivors. Torturers who had been trained by the CIA unleashed an orgy of violence against Muslim Brotherhood members accused of plotting to overthrow Nasser. At one point, Qutb was covered with animal fat and locked in a cell with dogs trained to attack humans. Inside the cell, he had a heart attack. General FOUAD ALLAM, Interrogator Interior Ministry 1958-87 (speaking in Arabic; subtitled): Sayyed Qutb thought of himself as a superior sort of person. He saw himself as an important Islamist thinker and a strong character. And so on and so on. But at the end of the day, when he was in the military prison he gave us the exact details about his secret group and the orders he had given. The most dangerous was the order to flood the whole of the Nile delta and drown this corrupt land of infidels. VO: Qutb survived, but the torture had a powerful radicalizing effect on his ideas. Up to this point, he had believed that the Western secular ideas simply created the selfishness and the isolation he had seen in the United States. But the torture, he believed, showed that this culture also unleashed the most brutal and barbarous aspects of human beings.

VO: Qutb survived, but the torture had a powerful radicalizing effect on his ideas. Up to this point, he had believed that the Western secular ideas simply created the selfishness and the isolation he had seen in the United States. But the torture, he believed, showed that this culture also unleashed the most brutal and barbarous aspects of human beings. Qutb began to have an apocalyptic vision of a disease that was spreading from the West throughout the world. He called it jahilliyah-a state of barbarous ignorance. What made it so terrifying and insidious was that people didn't realize that they were infected. They believed that they were free, and that their politicians were taking them forward to a new world. But in fact, they were regressing to a barbarous age. ROXANNE EUBEN, Political Scientist: The sense is that jahilliyah is so dangerous now, because not only is it advanced by Western powers, but Muslims-this is like a charge of false consciousness-Muslims have become infected with this jahilliyah, so now the threat to Islam is also from within. It's from without, and within. It's a state of emergency, because jahilliyah is a condition that pervades everything and everybody. It's even infected our powers of imagination-we don't even know that we're sick! That we now worship materialism, and the self, and individual truths over the real truths. Um, so it's an incredible sense of epic confrontation, where Islam is being insulted on all fronts-from within, from without, culturally, militarily, economically, politically. And under those circumstances, any way of fighting it becomes justified and legitimate, and in fact has a kind of existential weight, because somehow it's doing God's will on earth. VO: To Qutb, this force of jahilliyah had now gone so deep into the minds of Muslims that a dramatic way had to be found to free them. In a series of books he wrote secretly in prison, which were then smuggled out, Qutb called upon a revolutionary vanguard to rise up and overthrow the leaders who had allowed jahilliyah to infect their countries. The implication was that these leaders could justifiably be killed, because they had become so corrupted, they were no longer Muslims, even though they said they were. Faced with this, Nasser decided to crush Qutb and his ideas, and in 1966 Qutb was put on trial for treason. This is the only known film of Qutb as he awaits sentence. The verdict was a foregone conclusion, and on August 29, 1966, Qutb was executed. But his ideas lived on. The day after his execution, a young schoolboy set up a secret group. He hoped that it would one day become the vanguard that Qutb had hoped for. His name was Ayman Zawahiri, and Zawahiri was to become the mentor to Osama bin-Laden.

[ TITLE: AMERICA 1967 ] VO: But at the very moment when Sayyed Qutb's ideas seemed dead and buried, Leo Strauss' ideas about how to transform America were about to become powerful and influential, because the liberal political order that had dominated America since the war started to collapse. [ TITLE: 11pm, JULY 25th 1967 ] PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON: Law and order have broken down in Detroit, Michigan. Pillage, looting, murder... VO: Only a few years before, President Johnson had promised policies that would create a new and a better world in America. He had called it \"the Great Society.\" [ TITLE: President LYNDON JOHNSON, 1964 ] JOHNSON: The Great Society is in place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind. It is a place where the City of Man... VO: But now, in the wake of some of the worst riots ever seen in America, that dream seemed to have ended in violence and hatred. One prominent liberal journalist called Irving Kristol began to question whether it might actually be the policies themselves that were causing social breakdown. IRVING KRISTOL: If you had asked any liberal in 1960, we are going to pass these laws, these laws, these laws, and these laws, mentioning all the laws that in fact were passed in the 1960s and '70s, would you say crime will go up, drug addiction will go up, illegitimacy will go up, or will they get down? Obviously, everyone would have said, they will get down. And everyone would have been wrong. Now, that's not something that the liberals have been able to face up to. They've had their reforms, and they have led to consequences that they did not expect and they don't know what to do about. VO: In the early '70s, Irving Kristol became the focus of a group of disaffected intellectuals in Washington. They were determined to understand why the optimistic liberal policies had failed. And they found the answer in the theories of Leo Strauss. Strauss explained that it was the very basis of the liberal idea-the belief in individual freedom-that was causing the chaos, because it undermined the shared moral framework that held society together. Individuals pursued their own selfish interests, and this inevitably led to conflict. As the movement grew, many young students who had studied Strauss' ideas came to Washington to join this group.

Some, like Paul Wolfowitz, had been taught Strauss' ideas at the University of Chicago, as had Francis Fukuyama. And others, like Irving Kristol's son William, had studied Strauss' theories at Harvard. This group became known as the neoconservatives. WILLIAM KRISTOL: Well, many of them couldn't get academic jobs, and the political science and philosophy faculties were not terribly friendly to those of a conservative or moderately conservative disposition. And the truth is that a lot of people who ended up in Washington started out as academics. I did; Paul Wolfowitz did; and decided they probably didn't have very good prospects in the academy. What we all had in common, I think, was a certain doubt about what once seemed a kind of great certainty and confidence in liberal progress. The philosophic grounds for liberal democracy had been weakened. So I think Straussians who came to Washington, they didn't think of themselves as Churchill or Lincoln, let me assure you, but they did that, you know, there's something noble about public life, and about politics, and they tried to make a contribution in many different areas. VO: The neoconservatives were idealists. Their aim was to try and stop the social disintegration they believed liberal freedoms had unleashed. They wanted to find a way of uniting the people, by giving them a shared purpose. One of their great influences in doing this would be the theories of Leo Strauss. They would set out to recreate the myth of America as a unique nation whose destiny was to battle against evil in the world. And in this project, the source of evil would be America's Cold War enemy: the Soviet Union. And by doing this, they believed that they would not only give new meaning and purpose to people's lives, but they would spread the good of democracy around the world. Professor STEPHEN HOLMES, Political Philosopher: The United States would not only, according to these-the Straussians, be able to bring good to the world, but would be able to overcome the fundamental weaknesses of American society, a society that has been suffering, almost rotting, in their language, from relativism, liberalism, lack of self-confidence, lack of belief in itself. And one of the main political projects of the Straussians during the Cold War was to reinforce the self-confidence of Americans, and the belief that America was fundamentally the only force for good in the world, that had to be supported, otherwise evil would prevail.

VO: But to do this, the neoconservatives were going to have to defeat one of the most powerful men in the world. Henry Kissinger was the Secretary of State under President Nixon, and he didn't believe in a world of good and evil. What drove Kissinger was a ruthless, pragmatic vision of power in the world. With America's growing political and social chaos, Kissinger wanted the country to give up its ideological battles. Instead, it should come to terms with countries like the Soviet Union, to create a new kind of global interdependence. A world in which America would be safe. HENRY KISSINGER, Interviewed 1975: I believe that with all the dislocations we know-now experience, there also exists an extraordinary opportunity to form, for the first time in history, a truly global society, carried by the principle of interdependence. And if we act wisely and with vision, I think we can look back to all this turmoil as the birth pangs of a more creative and better system. VO: Kissinger had begun this process in 1972, when he persuaded the Soviet Union to sign a treaty with America limiting nuclear arms. It was the start of what was called \"détente.\" And President Nixon returned to Washington to announce triumphantly that the age of fear was over. PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON, June 1, 1972: Last Friday, in Moscow, we witnessed the beginning of the end of that era which began in 1945. With this step, we have enhanced the security of both nations. We have begun to reduce the level of fear, by reducing the causes of fear-for our two peoples, and for all peoples in the world. VO: But a world without fear was not what the neoconservatives needed to pursue their project. They now set out to destroy Henry Kissinger's vision. What gave them their opportunity was the growing collapse of American political power, both abroad and at home. The defeat in Vietnam, and the resignation of President Nixon over Watergate, led to a crisis of confidence in America's political class. And the neoconservatives seized their moment. They allied themselves with two right-wingers in the new administration of Gerald Ford. One was Donald Rumsfeld, the new Secretary of Defense. The other was Dick Cheney, the President's Chief of Staff. Rumsfeld began to make speeches alleging that the Soviets were ignoring Kissinger's treaties and secretly building up their weapons, with the intention of attacking America.

Rumsfeld began to make speeches alleging that the Soviets were ignoring Kissinger's treaties and secretly building up their weapons, with the intention of attacking America. DONALD RUMSFELD, US Secretary of Defense, Speaking in 1976: The Soviet Union has been busy. They've been busy in terms of their level of effort; they've been busy in terms of the actual weapons they've been producing; they've been busy in terms of expanding production rates; they've been busy in terms of expanding their institutional capability to produce additional weapons at additional rates; they've been busy in terms of expanding their capability to increasingly improve the sophistication of those weapons. Year after year after year, they've been demonstrating that they have steadiness of purpose. They're purposeful about what they're doing. Now, your question is, what ought one to be doing about that? VO: The CIA, and other agencies who watched the Soviet Union continuously for any sign of threat, said that this was a complete fiction. There was no truth to Rumsfeld's allegations. But Rumsfeld used his position to persuade President Ford to set up an independent inquiry. He said it would prove that there was a hidden threat to America. And the inquiry would be run by a group of neoconservatives, one of whom was Paul Wolfowitz. The aim was to change the way America saw the Soviet Union. MELVIN GOODMAN, Head of Office of Soviet Affairs CIA, 1976-87: And Rumsfeld won that very intense, intense political battle that was waged in Washington in 1975 and 1976. Now, as part of that battle, Rumsfeld and others, people such as Paul Wolfowitz, wanted to get into the CIA. And their mission was to create a much more severe view of the Soviet Union, Soviet intentions, Soviet views about fighting and winning a nuclear war. VO: The neoconservatives chose, as the inquiry chairman, a well-known critic and historian of the Soviet Union called Richard Pipes. Pipes was convinced that whatever the Soviets said publicly, secretly they still intended to attack and conquer America. This was their hidden mindset. The inquiry was called Team B, and the other leading member was Paul Wolfowitz. Professor RICHARD PIPES: And the idea was then to appoint a group of outside experts who have access to the same evidence as the CIA used to arrive at these conclusions, and to see if they could come up with different conclusions.

And I was asked to chair it, because I was not an expert on nuclear weapons. I was, if anything, an expert on the Soviet mindset, but not on the weapons. But that was the real key, was the question of the Soviet mindset, because the CIA looked only at-they were known as \"bean counters,\" always looking at weapons. But weapons can be used in various ways. They can be used for defensive purposes or offensive purposes. Well, all right, I collected this group of experts, and we began to sift through the evidence. VO: Team B began examining all the CIA data on the Soviet Union. But however closely they looked, there was little evidence of the dangerous weapons or defense systems they claimed the Soviets were developing. Rather than accept that this meant that the systems didn't exist, Team B made an assumption that the Soviets had developed systems that were so sophisticated, they were undetectable. For example, they could find no evidence that the Soviet submarine fleet had an acoustic defense system. What this meant, Team B said, was that the Soviets had actually invented a new non-acoustic system, which was impossible to detect. And this meant that the whole of the American submarine fleet was at risk from an invisible threat that was there, even though there was no evidence for it. Dr ANNE CAHN, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, 1977-80: They couldn't say that the Soviets had acoustic means of picking up American submarines, because they couldn't find it. So they said, well maybe they have a non-acoustic means of making our submarine fleet vulnerable. But there was no evidence that they had a non-acoustic system. They're saying, \"we can't find evidence that they're doing it the way that everyone thinks they're doing it, so they must be doing it a different way. We don't know what that different way is, but they must be doing it.\" INTERVIEWER (off-camera): Even though there was no evidence. CAHN: Even though there was no evidence. INTERVIEWER: So they're saying there, that the fact that the weapon doesn't exist... CAHN: Doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. It just means that we haven't found it. PIPES: Now, that's important, yes. If something is not there, that's significant. INTERVIEWER: By its absence. PIPES: By its absence.

And the CIA wasn't aware of that. VO: What Team B accused the CIA of missing was a hidden and sinister reality in the Soviet Union. Not only were there many secret weapons the CIA hadn't found, but they were wrong about many of those they could observe, such as the Soviet air defenses. The CIA were convinced that these were in a state of collapse, reflecting the growing economic chaos in the Soviet Union. Team B said that this was actually a cunning deception by the Soviet regime. The air-defense system worked perfectly. But the only evidence they produced to prove this was the official Soviet training manual, which proudly asserted that their air-defense system was fully integrated and functioned flawlessly. The CIA accused Team B of moving into a fantasy world. PIPES: The CIA was very loath to deal with issues which could not be demonstrated in a kind of mathematical form. I said they could consider the soft evidence. They deal with realities, whereas this was a fantasy. That's how it was perceived. And there were battles all the time on this subject. INTERVIEWER: Did you think it was a fantasy? PIPES: No! I thought it was absolute reality. CAHN: I would say that all of it was fantasy. I mean, they looked at radars out in Krasnoyarsk and said, \"This is a laser beam weapon,\" when in fact it was nothing of the sort. They even took a Russian military manual, which the correct translation of it is \"The Art of Winning.\" And when they translated it and put it into Team B, they called it \"The Art of Conquest.\" Well, there's a difference between \"conquest\" and \"winning.\" And if you go through most of Team B's specific allegations about weapons systems, and you just examine them one by one, they were all wrong. INTERVIEWER: All of them? CAHN: All of them. INTERVIEWER: Nothing true? CAHN: I don't believe anything in Team B was really true. VO: The neoconservatives set up a lobby group to publicize the findings of Team B. It was called the Committee on the Present Danger, and a growing number of politicians joined, including a Presidential hopeful, Ronald Reagan. [ TITLE: The Price of Peace and Freedom / Committee on the Present Danger, propaganda film 1978 ] VO: Through films and television, the Committee portrayed a world in which America was under threat from hidden forces that could strike at any time, forces that America must conquer to survive.

ALEKSANDR SOLZHENITSYN, through interpreter: A concentration of world evil, of hatred for humanity, is taking place. And it is fully determined to destroy your society. Must you wait until the young men of America have to fall defending the borders of their continent?! VO: This dramatic battle between good and evil was precisely the kind of myth that Leo Strauss had taught his students would be necessary to rescue the country from moral decay. It might not be true, but it was necessary, to re-engage the public in a grand vision of America's destiny, that would give meaning and purpose to their lives. The neoconservatives were succeeding in creating a simplistic fiction-a vision of the Soviet Union as the center of all evil in the world, and America as the only country that could rescue the world. And this nightmarish vision was beginning to give the neoconservatives great power and influence. HOLMES: The Straussians started to create a worldview which is a fiction. The world is not divided into good and evil. The battle in which we are engaged is not a battle between good and evil. The United States, as anyone who observes understands, has done some good and some bad things. It's like any great power. This is the way history is. But they wanted to create a world of moral certainties, so therefore they invent mythologies-fairytales-describing any force in the world that obstructs the United States as somehow Satanic, or associated with evil. TITLE: EGYPT 1979 [ CLIPS FROM WESTERN - STYLE EGYPTIAN TV COMMERCIALS ] VO: By the late 1970s, Egypt had been transformed. On the surface, it had become a modern, Westernized state with a prosperous middle class who were benefiting from a flood of Western capital that was being invested in the country. One member of this prosperous Egyptian elite was Ayman Zawahiri. He was now a young doctor, just starting his career. OMAR AZZAM, Cousin of Ayman Zawahiri: Ayman, he was an ideal person, who was a doctor coming from a very good family. His father was a professor in the university, his grandfather was an ambassador, his other grandfather was Sheikh of al-Azhar; very well-respected family. He used to be the sort of person that acted by the book. Not looking for prestige, not looking for money, not looking for propaganda. Ayman became a leader because of his attitudes.

He used to be the sort of person that acted by the book. Not looking for prestige, not looking for money, not looking for propaganda. Ayman became a leader because of his attitudes. VO: In reality, Zawahiri was the leader of an underground Islamist cell. The group that he had started as a schoolboy, which he had modeled on the ideas of Sayyed Qutb, had grown. Sayyed Qutb's ideas were now spreading rapidly in Egypt- above all, among students-because his predictions about the corruption from the West seemed to have come true. The government of President Sadat was controlled by a small group of millionaires, who were backed by Western banks. The banks had been let in by what Sadat called his open-door policy. To the Western media, Sadat denied any corruption. All Egyptians knew that this was a blatant lie. PRESIDENT SADAT 1977: Who has benefited now from the open-door policy? Taxi drivers. The liberals. All of those have benefited from the open-door policy. It is not like they say, that there are millionaires here and so. No, not at all. This is pure, um, pure black propaganda from the side of the Soviet Union and agents here in the country. VO: Zawahiri was convinced that the time was now approaching to fulfill Qutb's vision. The vanguard should rise up and overthrow this corrupt regime. And the man who would give the Islamists that opportunity would be Henry Kissinger. As part of his attempt to create a stable and balanced world, Kissinger had persuaded President Sadat to begin peace negotiations with the Israelis. To Kissinger, the ruthless pragmatist, religious divisions and hatreds were irrelevant. The most important thing was to create a safer world. And in 1977, Sadat had flown to Jerusalem to start the peace process. To the West, it was a heroic act. But to the Islamists, it was a complete betrayal. It showed that Sadat's mind had become so corrupted by the West that he was now completely under their control. And under the theories of Sayyed Qutb, this meant that he was no longer a Muslim, and so could justifiably be killed. And then, in 1979, the Ayatollah Khomeini showed Zawahiri that his dream of creating an Islamist state was possible. [ SUBTITLE OVER RIOT SCENE : God is great! ] VO: Khomeini had inspired an uprising against the Shah of Iran. The Shah was another leader who had allowed Western banks to corrupt his country.

He acknowledged this by placing Qutb's face on one of the postage stamps of the new Islamic republic. In his first sermon, Khomeini addressed the West. \"Yes,\" he told them, \"we are reactionaries, and you are enlightened intellectuals. You who want freedom for everything, the freedom that will corrupt our country, corrupt our youth, and freedom that will pave the way for the oppressor-freedom that would drag our country to the bottom.\" REPORTER (off-camera): You sound very dissatisfied with what's happening in Iran now. PRESIDENT SADAT 1979: Not... MORE than dissatisfied, this is disgraceful! Really! I was myself, I was the Secretary-General of the Muslim Congress at one time. This, putting the name \"Islamic revolution,\" is a crime. A crime against Islam in the first hand. REPORTER : President Sadat, do you expect that the Shah will accept the invitation? It seems like a good solution right now. SADAT : Quote me: My airplane is ready to bring him here. Any moment. VO: At the end of 1980, Ayman Zawahiri, with a number of other followers of Qutb who had formed cells, came together. They created an organization they called Islamic Jihad. Its leader was a man called Abdel Salam Faraj. And Faraj argued that they should kill Sadat in a spectacular way that would shock the masses. It would make them see the true reality of the corruption surrounding them, and they would rise up and overthrow the regime. KAMAL HABIB , Founder member of Islamic Jihad (speaking in Arabic, subtitled): The jihadi movement - some of the leaders are still alive - I was one and so was Ayman Zawahiri. We spearheaded the jihadi state of mind rather than the earlier, more moderate ideas in the liberal era that simply accepted reality. Psychologically we thought we were superior to reality. We despised the everyday vision of the world, and we wanted to transform or change this reality. Therefore our dream was to get rid of Sadat.

They were immediately arrested, and the regime launched a massive manhunt for those behind the plot. But the effect of the assassination on the Egyptian people was not what Zawahiri had hoped for. That night, Cairo remained calm. The masses failed to rise up. And in the following weeks, Zawahiri and many other conspirators were arrested. The assassins were tried immediately and executed. But then, nearly 300 Islamists, including Zawahiri, were put on trial in a pavilion in Cairo's industrial exhibition park. It was agreed that Zawahiri would be their spokesman.

Who are we? Who are we? Why did they bring us here? And what we want to say? About the first question: we are Muslims! We are Muslims who believed in their religion, in their broad feelings, as both an ideology and practice. We believed in our religion, both as an ideology and practice. And hence, we tried our best to establish [unintelligible] Islamic state and Islamic society! PRISONER , shouting: La illah la-illallah! PRISONERS : La illah la-illallah! (etc.) GILLES KEPEL , Historian of Islamist Movement: Zawahiri, the man is an aristocrat. He comes from a major Egyptian -Saudi family. And he thinks that, you know, he is a visionary, and the means do not matter, just as in Lenin-I mean, revolution in one country or revolution worldwide. He was convinced that this was a means to mobilize the masses, that they had tried something, that it had not worked, then he failed that-you know, the masses that were still under the spell of ideology, the ideology of America. And he is looking for a new strategy. VO: At the trial, Zawahiri was sentenced to three years in prison, along with many others of Islamic Jihad. He was taken to cells behind the Police National Museum, where, like Sayyed Qutb, he was tortured. And under this torture, he began to interpret Qutb's theories in a far more radical way. The mystery, for Zawahiri, was why the Egyptian people had failed to see the truth and rise up. It must be because the infection of selfish individualism had gone so deep into people's minds that they were now as corrupted as their leaders.

And Zawahiri believed that this meant that they too could legitimately be killed. But such killing, Zawahiri believed, would have a noble purpose, because of the fear and the terror that it would create in the minds of ordinary Muslims. It would shock them into seeing reality in a different way. They would then see the truth. Dr AZZAM TAMIMI , Institute of Islamic Political Thought: Ayman Zawahiri came to the conclusion that because you have what you believe to be a sublime objective, then the means can be as ugly as they can get. You can kill as many people as you wish, because the end means is noble. The logic is that \"we are the vanguards, we are the correct Muslims, everybody else is wrong. Not only wrong, but everybody else is not a Muslim, and the only means available to us today is just to kill our way to perfection.\" [ TITLE : AMERICA 1981 ] COUNTRY SINGER : I'm goin' to a city where the roses never fade... VO: And at this very same moment, religion was being mobilized politically in America, but for a very different purpose. And those encouraging this were the neoconservatives. Many neoconservatives had become advisers to the Presidential campaign of Ronald Reagan. And as they became more involved with the Republican Party, they had forged an alliance with the religious wing of the party, because it shared their aim of the moral regeneration of America. IRVING KRISTOL , Founder of Neoconservative movement: The notion that a purely secular society can cope with all of the terrible pathologies that now affect our society, I think has turned out to be false. And that has made me culturally conservative. I mean, I really think religion has a role now to play in redeeming the country. And liberalism is not prepared to give religion a role. Conservatism is, but it doesn't know how to do it. VO: By the late '70s, there were millions of fundamentalist Christians in America. But their preachers had always told them not to vote. It would mean compromising with a doomed and immoral society. But the neoconservatives and their new Republican allies made an alliance with a number of powerful preachers, who told their followers to become involved with politics for the first time.

It's time for God's people to come out of the closet, out of the churches, and change America! We must do it! PAUL WEYRICH , Religious activist - Republican Party: The conservative movement, up to that point, was essentially an intellectual movement. It had some very powerful thinkers, but it didn't have many troops. And as Stalin said of the Pope, \"where are his divisions?\". Well, we didn't have many divisions. When these folks became active, all of a sudden the conservative movement had lots of divisions. We were able to move literally millions of people. And this is something that we had literally no ability to do prior to that time. INTERVIEWER (off-camera): Literally millions? WEYRICH : Literally millions. VO: And at the beginning of 1981, Ronald Reagan took power in America. The religious vote was crucial in his election, because many millions of fundamentalists voted for the first time. And as they had hoped, many neoconservatives were given power in the new administration. Paul Wolfowitz became head of the State Department policy staff, while his close friend Richard Perle became the Assistant Secretary of Defense. And the head of Team B, Richard Pipes, became one of Reagan's chief advisers. The neoconservatives believed that they now had the chance to implement their vision of America's revolutionary destiny-to use the country's power aggressively as a force for good in the world, in an epic battle to defeat the Soviet Union. It was a vision that they shared with millions of their new religious allies. UNIDENTIFIED PREACHER : I take a personal and public stand as a minister, a stand against Communism. To destroy it, to wipe it from the face of the Earth, because believe you me, these people are dedicated to the destruction of the United States of America and freedom as we know it. VO: But the neoconservatives faced immense opposition to this new policy. It came not just from the bureaucracies and Congress, but from the President himself. Reagan was convinced that the Soviet Union was an evil force, but he still believed that he could negotiate with them to end the Cold War.

Professor RICHARD PIPES , Adviser to President Reagan 1980-83: Reagan at first didn't quite understand that their aggressiveness is rooted in the system. He had a rather benign view of human beings. He was a very kindly man, and he attributed kind motives to others. There was another form of mirror imaging. And he would say on more than one occasion, something like this: \"If I could just sit down with the Soviet leaders and explain to them that they're following a wrong ideology, and if they adopt the right ideologies, they could make their people happy and prosperous.\" So [unintelligible] \"Mr. President, that is not going to do it! You have to go after the system. Force them to reform the system.\" It took him a very long time to assimilate this view.

They would demonstrate that the majority of terrorism and revolutionary movements around the world were actually part of a secret network, coordinated by Moscow, to take over the world. The main proponent of this theory was a leading neoconservative who was the special adviser to the Secretary of State. His name was Michael Ledeen, and he had been influenced by a best-selling book called The Terror Network. It alleged that terrorism was not the fragmented phenomenon that it appeared to be. In reality, all terrorist groups, from the PLO to the Baader-Meinhof group in Germany, and the Provisional IRA, all of them were a part of a coordinated strategy of terror run by the Soviet Union. But the CIA completely disagreed. They said this was just another neoconservative fantasy. MICHAEL LEDEEN , Special Adviser to the US Secretary of State 1981-1982: The CIA denied it. They tried to convince people that we were really crazy. I mean, they never believed that the Soviet Union was a driving force in the international terror network. They always wanted to believe that terrorist organizations were just what they said they were: local groups trying to avenge terrible evils done to them, or trying to rectify terrible social conditions, and things like that. And the CIA really did buy into the rhetoric. I don't know what their motive was. I mean, I don't know what people's motives are, hardly ever. And I don't much worry about motives.

VO: But the neoconservatives had a powerful ally. He was William Casey, and he was the new head of the CIA. Casey was sympathetic to the neoconservative view. And when he read the Terror Network book, he was convinced. He called a meeting of the CIA's Soviet analysts at their headquarters, and told them to produce a report for the President that proved this hidden network existed. But the analysts told him that this would be impossible, because much of the information in the book came from black propaganda the CIA themselves had invented to smear the Soviet Union. They knew that the terror network didn't exist, because they themselves had made it up. MELVIN GOODMAN , Head of Soviet Affairs CIA, 1976-87: And when we looked through the book, we found very clear episodes where CIA black propaganda-clandestine information that was designed under a covert action plan to be planted in European newspapers-were picked up and put in this book. A lot of it was made up. It was made up out of whole cloth. INTERVIEWER (off-camera): You told him this? GOODMAN : We told him that, point blank. And we even had the operations people to tell Bill Casey this. I thought maybe this might have an impact, but all of us were dismissed. Casey had made up his mind. He knew the Soviets were involved in terrorism, so there was nothing we could tell him to disabuse him. Lies became reality. VO: In the end, Casey found a university professor who described himself as a terror expert, and he produced a dossier that confirmed that the hidden terror network did, in fact, exist. Under such intense lobbying, Reagan agreed to give the neoconservatives what they wanted, and in 1983 he signed a secret document that fundamentally changed American foreign policy. The country would now fund covert wars to push back the hidden Soviet threat around the world. President RONALD REAGAN : The specter of Marxist-Leninist controlled governments with ideological and political loyalties to the Soviet Union proves that there's a direct challenge to which we must respond. They are the focus of evil in the modern world. VO: It was a triumph for the neoconservatives. America was now setting out to do battle against the forces of evil in the world.

They began to believe their own fiction. They had become what they called \"democratic revolutionaries,\" who were going to use force to change the world. LEDEEN : We were aiming for an expansion of the zone of freedom in the world. And in part that had to do with fighting Communism, and in part that had to do with fighting other kinds of tyrannies. But that's what we were about, and that's what we're still about. INTERVIEWER (off-camera): When you say you were democratic revolutionaries, what do you mean? LEDEEN : It meant that we wanted to support the people who wanted to carry out revolutions against tyrannical regimes in the name of democracy, in order to install a democratic system. INTERVIEWER : As simple as that. LEDEEN : Yeah. It's not nuclear physics, you know. I mean, freedom is a fairly simple thing to get. JAMES ARNESS on Gunsmoke (VO): It's a chancy job-makes a man watchful and a little lonely. But somebody has to do it. VO: The neoconservatives now set out to transform the world. In next week's episode, they find themselves joining forces with the Islamists in Afghanistan, and together they fight an epic battle against the Soviet Union. And both come to believe that they had defeated the Evil Empire. But this imagined victory would leave them without an enemy. And in a world disillusioned with grand political ideas, they would need to invent new fantasies and new nightmares, in order to maintain their power.

Written and Produced by Adam Curtis. VO: In the past, politicians promised to create a better world. They had different ways of achieving this. But their power and authority came from the optimistic visions they offered their people. Those dreams failed. And today, people have lost faith in ideologies. Increasingly, politicians are seen simply as managers of public life. But now, they have discovered a new role that restores their power and authority. Instead of delivering dreams, politicians now promise to protect us from nightmares. They say that they will rescue us from dreadful dangers that we cannot see and do not understand. And the greatest danger of all is international terrorism. A powerful and sinister network, with sleeper cells in countries across the world. A threat that needs to be fought by a war on terror. But much of this threat is a fantasy, which has been exaggerated and distorted by politicians. It's a dark illusion that has spread unquestioned through governments around the world, the security services, and the international media. VO: This is a series of films about how and why that fantasy was created, and who it benefits. At the heart of the story are two groups: the American neoconservatives, and the radical Islamists. In this week's episode, the two groups come together to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. And both believe that they defeat the Evil Empire, and so had the power to transform the world. [SUBTITLE OVER CROWD SCENE : We will fight for an Islamic State, we will die for it!] VO: But both failed in their revolutions. In response, the neoconservatives invent a new fantasy enemy, Bill Clinton, to try and regain their power; while the Islamists descend into a desperate cycle of violence and terror to try and persuade the people to follow them. Out of all this come the seeds of the strange world of fantasy, deception, violence, and fear in which we now live.

President RONALD REAGAN : Just as the Columbia, we think, represents man's finest aspirations in the field of science and technology, so too does the struggle of the Afghan people represent man's highest aspirations for freedom. I am dedicating, on behalf of the American people, the March 22nd launch of the Columbia to the people of Afghanistan. VO: Since 1979, the mujaheddin resistance had been fighting a vicious war in Afghanistan against the Soviet invasion. But now, a small group in the Reagan White House saw in these fighters a way of achieving their vision of transforming the world. To them, they were not just nationalists; they were freedom fighters, who could bring down the Soviet Union and help spread democracy around the world. It was called the Reagan Doctrine. JACK WHEELER , Adviser to the Reagan White House, 1981-1984: It was a small group of people and-yes, we did have. Everyone thinks, \"oh, the Reagan Doctrine, the Reagan Administration,\" like everybody was for. No. It was a small little cabal within the Soviet-within the Reagan White House, that really pulled this off. What united this small group of ours was the vision of bringing more freedom to the world, more security to the world, to actually get rid of the Soviet Union itself. As a result, supporting the freedom fighters became the premier cause for the entire conservative movement during the Reagan years. VO: But the Americans were setting out to defeat a mythological enemy. As last week's episode showed, the neoconservatives, who were now in power in Reagan's White House, had created an exaggerated and distorted vision of the Soviet Union as the source of all evil in the world. One of their main influences were the theories of the philosopher Leo Strauss. He believed that liberal societies needed simple, powerful myths to inspire and unite the people. And in the 1970s, the neoconservatives had done just this. Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, and other neoconservatives had set out to reassert the myth of America as a unique country, whose destiny was to struggle against evil throughout the world. Now in power, they had come to believe this myth. They saw themselves as revolutionaries who were going to transform the world, starting with the defeat of the Evil Empire. RICHARD PERLE , Assistant Secretary of Defense 1981-1987: We're closer to being revolutionaries than conservatives, in the sense that we want to change some deeply entrenched notions about the proper role of American power in the world. We want to see that power used constructively, and to enlarge the opportunity for decent governance", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__power_of_nightmares_transcript_2.txt:1:4e2752d35f9d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15341, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__power_of_nightmares_transcript_2.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__power_of_nightmares_transcript_2", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "they had come to believe this myth.

We want to see that power used constructively, and to enlarge the opportunity for decent governance around the world. We're not happy about the old, cozy relationships with dictators. VO: And the man who was going to help the neoconservatives do this was the new head of the CIA, William Casey. He was convinced that Afghanistan was one of the keys to this aggressive new policy. America was already sending limited amounts of aid to the mujaheddin. But now, Casey ordered one of his agents to go and form an alliance with the freedom fighters, and give them as much money as they wanted and the most sophisticated weapons to defeat the Soviet military forces. MILTON BEARDEN , CIA Field Officer, Afghanistan, 1985-89: For Casey, Afghanistan seemed to be possibly one of the keys. So he tapped me one day to go. He says, \"I want you to go out to Afghanistan, I want you to go next month, and I will give you whatever you need to win.\" Yeah. He said, \"I want you go to there and win.\" As opposed to, \"let's go there and bleed these guys,\" make a [unintelligible] Vietnam, \"I want you to go there and win. Whatever you need, you can have.\" He gave me the Stinger missiles and a billion dollars. [ SUBTITLE OVER AFGHAN WAR SCENE : God is great!] VO : American money and weapons now began to pour across the Pakistan border into Afghanistan. CIA agents trained the mujaheddin in the techniques of assassination and terror, including car bombing. And they gave them satellite images of Russian troops to help in their attacks. [ SUBTITLE OVER AFGHAN WAR SCENE : Move your fat arse and shoot the f...ing rocket!] VO: At the very same time, another group began to arrive in Afghanistan to fight alongside the mujaheddin. They were Arabs from across the Middle East, who had been told by their religious leaders that their duty was to go and free Muslim lands from the Soviet invader. ABDULLAH ANAS , General Commander Afghan Arabs, Northern Afghanistan, 1984-1989: I saw the fatwa, the order saying that every Muslim has a duty to help the Afghans to liberate their land. But I had no idea, where is this Afghanistan? How can I go there? I've never heard about Afghanistan, and I've never heard-in the map. Which airline goes there? From where can I take the visa?

ABDULLAH ANAS , General Commander Afghan Arabs, Northern Afghanistan, 1984-1989: I saw the fatwa, the order saying that every Muslim has a duty to help the Afghans to liberate their land. But I had no idea, where is this Afghanistan? How can I go there? I've never heard about Afghanistan, and I've never heard-in the map. Which airline goes there? From where can I take the visa? It-100 questions! But I did meet Abdullah Azzam. VO: Abdullah Azzam was a charismatic religious leader who had begun to organize the Arab volunteers in Afghanistan. He had set up what he called the Services Bureau, in Peshawar on the Afghan border. It became the headquarters of an international brigade of Arab fighters. Azzam quickly became one of the most powerful figures in the battle against the Soviets. He was allowed to visit America on many occasions, both to raise funds and recruit volunteers for the jihad. Dr. AZZAM TAMIMI , Institute of Islamic Political Thought: When, Abdullah Azzam became so instrumental in marketing the Afghan cause among the Arabs, he became very important. He became called \"the emir of the Arab mujaheddin.\" The leader of the Arab mujaheddin. And he set up an office in Peshawar which provided services to Arabs who came and wanted to participate in the jihad. There were no doors closed, so all doors were opened, because the Americans, the Saudis, the Pakistanis, and many other people wanted the Soviet Union to lose in Afghanistan, and to be humiliated. That brought about huge numbers of Arabs from different backgrounds in the jihad in Afghanistan. He went to America, he went to Saudi Arabia, he traveled wherever he wanted, because the Afghan cause was a cause that everybody was happy supporting. VO: But like the neoconservatives, Azzam also saw the struggle against the Soviets as just the first step in a much wider revolution. He was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, who wanted Islam to play a political role in governing Muslim societies. And Abdullah Azzam believed that the Arabs in Afghanistan could be the nucleus of a new political force. They would return to their own countries and persuade the people to reject the corrupt, autocratic regimes that dominated the Middle East. But these regimes, Azzam insisted, must be overthrown by political means. He made every fighter pledge they would not use terrorism against civilians in the pursuit of their vision. One of Azzam's closest aides was a Saudi, Osama bin-Laden. ANAS : Osama came to participate in '85. When he was-when he came, as you know, he is, he came from a rich family from Saudi, and he had much, much money to spend. Sheikh Abdullah Azzam was a scholar, he can organize the Afghans, but he is not a rich man. So when Osama came, he filled in this gap.

Sheikh Abdullah Azzam was a scholar, he can organize the Afghans, but he is not a rich man. So when Osama came, he filled in this gap. So the main duty of Osama at that time was spending money. Beside his good personal qualities. VO: But then, in 1985, a new force began to arrive in Afghanistan, who were going to challenge Azzam's approach. They were the extreme radical Islamists, who were being expelled from prisons across the Arab world. BEARDEN : And then, very quietly, most of the governments in the Middle East, the Arab governments, began to empty their prisons of their bad guys and send them off to the jihad with the very fondest hope that they would become martyred. Many of them were the people in Egypt that had not been executed after the murder of Sadat, but were implicated in it and had been in prison. Off they go. VO: One of the most powerful of these newcomers was Ayman Zawahiri. He was the leader of a radical faction from Egypt called Islamic Jihad. And he was convinced that they, not the moderates, were the true Islamists. AYMAN ZAWAHIRI , in cage: We are here! We are here! The real Islamic front! We are here! The real Islamic front and the real Islamic opposition against Zionist. We are here! The real Islamic front against Zionism, Communism, and imperialism. VO: Ayman Zawahiri was a follower of the Egyptian revolutionary Sayyed Qutb, who had been executed in 1966. As last week's program showed, Qutb believed that the liberal ideas of Western societies corrupted the minds of Muslims, because they unleashed the most selfish aspects of human nature. Zawahiri had interpreted Qutb's theories to mean that this corruption included the Western system of democracy. Democracy, Zawahiri believed, encouraged politicians to set themselves up as the source of all authority, and by doing this, they were rejecting the higher authority of the Koran. This meant they were no longer true Muslims, and so they, and those who supported them, could legitimately be killed. The terror this created, he said, would shock the masses into seeing the truth behind the corrupt façade of democracy. ANAS : When the Egyptians, the jihadi group, came from Egypt with their own explanation, with their own ideas, that anybody participating in any parliament, or any political party, or going to elect, or call people for the election, and sort of these activities, is totally rejecting the Koran. So when you say that, it means when a Muslim is rejecting the Koran, simply must be killed.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__power_of_nightmares_transcript_2.txt:4:1cbfcf791d7a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15344, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__power_of_nightmares_transcript_2.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__power_of_nightmares_transcript_2", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "shock the masses into seeing the truth behind the corrupt façade of democracy.

So when you say that, it means when a Muslim is rejecting the Koran, simply must be killed. And should be killed, must be killed! And that's what happened. VO: Zawahiri and his small group settled in Peshawar. They began to spread this new idea among the foreign fighters, radicalizing the Islamist movement. It was not only a direct challenge to the moderate ideas of Abdullah Azzam, but it also involved a militant rejection of all American influence over the jihad, because America was the source of this corruption. BEARDEN : The only times that I ever ran into any real trouble in Afghanistan was when I ran into these guys. You know, there'd be kind of a moment or two, where it looked a little bit like the bar scene in Star Wars, each group kind of jockeying around, and finally somebody has to sort of defuse the situation. [ TITLE : MOSCOW 1987 ] NEWS ANNOUNCER (speaking in Russian, subtitled): The indicator lights aren't on. Please adjust them. (pause) Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has issued a decree... VO: Then, in 1987, the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev decided he was going to withdraw Russian troops from Afghanistan. Gorbachev was convinced that the whole Soviet system was facing collapse. He was determined to try and save it through political reform, and this meant reversing the policies of his predecessors, including the occupation of Afghanistan. MIKHAIL GORBACHEV , General Secretary, Soviet Communist Party (speaking in Russian, via interpreter) : The state of the Soviet Union and its society could be described very simply with a phrase used by people across the country: \"We can't go on living like this any longer.\" And that applied to everything. The economy was stagnating. There were shortages. And the quality of goods was very poor. We had to finish this war, but in such a way that the Russian people would understand why tens of thousands had died. We couldn't just run away from there in shame, no. We needed to find a process. VO: Gorbachev asked the Americans to help him negotiate a peace that would create a stable government in Afghanistan. But the hard-liners in Washington refused point-blank. They would continue to help the mujaheddin until the last Russians left, without any negotiation. The future of Afghanistan would then be decided, they said, by the freedom fighters.

They would continue to help the mujaheddin until the last Russians left, without any negotiation. The future of Afghanistan would then be decided, they said, by the freedom fighters. VLADIMIR POZNER , Soviet Spokesman in the United States, 1987: I think that basically, we've asked the United States to help us get out, if you're really interested in stopping the bloodshed. MODERATOR : But can you get out and leave a government in Afghanistan that supports, that is a friend of the Soviet Union? POZNER : I believe that we can get out, provided that no more aid is given to what people here call freedom fighters, and we call counterrevolutionaries. I believe that's possible, provided that the United States is also interested in the same. RICHARD PERLE , Assistant Secretary of Defense 1981-1987 : Well, it's not very complicated. They arrived in a matter of days, on Christmas Eve in 1979; they could be home by Christmas Eve, if they decided to leave Afghanistan and let the Afghans decide their own future. If you leave, the problem of support to the mujaheddin solves itself. VO: Gorbachev was shocked by the intransigence of the U.S. Administration. He sent a private message through the KGB, warning the Americans that if they allowed the mujaheddin to take control in Afghanistan, it would not produce democracy. Instead, he predicted, the most extreme forms of Islamism would rise up and triumph. But Gorbachev's warning was ignored. As Soviet troops left Afghanistan, both the Americans and the Islamists came to believe that they had not only won the battle for Afghanistan, they had also begun the downfall of the entire Evil Empire. BEARDEN : I felt we won, because I was part of it; I'm sure that the Afghan Arabs thought \"we won,\" and then all summer long, the East Germans begin to gather-a hundred here, a thousand there, tens of thousands-until November 9th, when the wall was opened. And that's it. Start the clock running on the Soviet Union. And it was over. So the Soviet Union was all crapped up and broken. And that was done. VO: For the neoconservatives, the collapse of the Soviet Union was a triumph. And out of that triumph was going to come the central myth that still inspires them today: that through the aggressive use of American power, they could transform the world and spread democracy.

But in reality, their victory was an illusion. They had conquered a phantom enemy, an exaggerated and distorted fantasy they had created in their own minds. The real reason the Soviet Union collapsed was because it was a decrepit system, decaying from within. MELVIN GOODMAN , Head of Office of Soviet Affairs CIA, 1976-1987: I think probably one of the greatest myths in America, in the political discourse now, right now, is that actions of the American government were responsible for the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union collapsed like a house of cards because it was a house of cards. It rotted away from within. The economy was rotten, the political process was rotten, they had developed a central government that was no longer believed by people outside of Moscow, there was total cynicism throughout the Soviet system of governance, there was no real civil society. But the Reagan Administration and their-the minions of the Reagan Administration, will tell you that Afghanistan led to the collapse of the Soviet Union itself-the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the collapse of the East European empire. We were saying that this was entirely fanciful. And the United States missed all of this, because they believed their own myths and their own fanciful notions. They had become their own victims of their own lies. VO: And for the Islamists too, a great myth was born out of the struggle in Afghanistan-that it was they who had conquered the Soviet Union. [ SUBTITLES OVER MUJAHEDDIN GATHERING : God is great! Death to Gorbachev! Long live Afghanistan!] VO: The Islamists believed that this great victory would start a revolution that would sweep across the Arab world and topple the corrupt leaders. But as with the neoconservatives, this dream was built on an illusion. GILLES KEPEL , Historian of the Islamist Movement: The Islamists were convinced that they were the key instrument in the demise of the Soviet Army in Afghanistan. They just would not like to remember that without U.S. military help and training, they couldn't have done anything. And also the Afghans were the ones who ousted the Soviets, not the Arab jihadis, who didn't really fight, who were trained, but they were not the fighters. But the myth has it that they were the ones who won. I mean, this was a jihad that had triumphed. This was something very powerful that was a mobilizing force for Islamists worldwide. VO: But there was a deep rift within the Islamist fighters based in Peshawar-between the moderates, led by Abdullah Azzam, who believed this revolution could be accomplished politically; and the extremists, like Ayman Zawahiri, who saw violent revolution as the only way.

VO: But there was a deep rift within the Islamist fighters based in Peshawar-between the moderates, led by Abdullah Azzam, who believed this revolution could be accomplished politically; and the extremists, like Ayman Zawahiri, who saw violent revolution as the only way. And Zawahiri now set out to extend his influence over the movement, and to undermine Abdullah Azzam. To do this, he seduced Osama bin-Laden-and his money-away from Azzam. He promised bin-Laden that he could become the emir, the leader of Zawahiri's small extremist group, Islamic Jihad. ANAS : Ayman Zawahiri and another group of Egyptians, they refused to pray behind Abdullah Azzam in Peshawar. They used to create rumors in Peshawar against Abdullah Azzam. That's why we became angry about Osama, why he became-he closed these people to him. They accepted him as an emir, and he accepted them as a group. Finally, I don't know who did use the other. INTERVIEWER (off-camera): What do you think? ANAS : I think the other used him. INTERVIEWER : Because he had the money. ANAS : Yes. VO: Then, at the end of 1989, Abdullah Azzam was assassinated by a huge car bomb in Peshawar. It is still unknown who carried out the assassination. But despite his death, it seemed as if Azzam's vision of a political revolution might prevail. In the early '90s, in countries across the Arab world, Islamist parties began to gather mass support. [ SUBTITLE OVER POLITICAL RALLY : Islamic State! ] VO: In Algeria, the Islamic Salvation Front won overwhelming victories in local elections, and looked certain to win the coming general election. And at the same time in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood began to win mass support, and a growing number of seats in Parliament. Both parties were riding to power on an idealistic vision. They would use Islam in a political way to create a new type of model society through peaceful means. SAIF AL BANNA , Senior member, Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt (speaking in Arabic, subtitled): We can change people through education and religious conviction. We want to build a popular base. This is the right way. We do not want a military coup; we do not want violence; we want our rights. If people believe in us, the government must comply with the people's wishes. VO: But the governments in both Egypt and Algeria faced a terrible dilemma. At the heart of the Islamist vision was the idea that the Koran should be used as the political framework for the society.

At the heart of the Islamist vision was the idea that the Koran should be used as the political framework for the society. An absolute set of laws, beyond debate, that all politicians had to follow. The implication of this was that political parties would be irrelevant, because there could be no disagreement. The people were about to vote in parties that might use that power to end democracy. ALI HAROUN , Algerian Minister for Human Rights (1991-1992) (speaking in French, subtitled): But what a dilemma! Do you find a way of stopping the electoral process and cancelling the second round? Or do you let power go to a party which claims: \"One man, one vote, but only once! We won't have any elections after this, because democracy is non-religious. Once we're in power, we'll stay there forever, because we alone are the keepers of religious truth, and we alone shall apply the Koran.\" VO: Faced by this dilemma, in Algeria the army decided to step in, and in June 1991 they staged a coup d'état and immediately canceled the elections. Mass protests by the Islamists were repressed violently, and their leaders arrested. At the same time, in Egypt, the government also clamped down. They arrested hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood members, and banned the organization from any political activity. ESSAM EL ERIAN , Senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt: What happened is a wave of arresting Muslim brothers, a wave of military courts for Muslim brothers, going to kill some of Muslim brothers under torture. They stopped all the free elections in all of their society and institutions. And this wave, in this manner, you open the doors of hell for the violent groups who were hidden underground-and stopped the moderates, open the door for the violence. VO: For Ayman Zawahiri, this was a dramatic confirmation of his belief that the Western system of democracy was a corrupt sham. Groups of radical Islamists who had developed his theories into even more extreme forms now set out to create violent revolutions in Algeria and Egypt. It would be the start of a jihad that would liberate the Muslim world from corruption. OSAMA BIN-LADEN (speaking in Arabic, subtitled): The only way to eradicate the humiliation and Kufr that has overcome the land of Islam is Jihad, bullets, and martyrdom operations. KEPEL : Bin-Laden and the others started, from now on, to wage their own jihad, i.e. not to compromise, not to try to compromise with more moderate groups, but thinking that an armed vanguard would be able to implement the seizing of power.

They thought that would capture the hearts and minds of of the Muslim masses, that people realize that the strength and victory were on the side of the jihadis. [ TITLE : AMERICA 1991 ] VO: At this same time, in Washington, the other group who believed that they had brought down the Soviet Union-the neoconservatives-were also determined to push on with their revolutionary agenda. They were convinced that the Soviet Union was just one of many evil regimes in the world led by tyrants that threatened America. Regimes they had to conquer to liberate the world and spread democracy. MICHAEL LEDEEN , Neoconservative theorist: We want, you know, down with tyranny. We want free countries. We think that America is better off if we live in a world primarily populated with free countries, who have to appeal to their own people for the source of their power, and to ratify their decisions. And we think that if the whole world were like that, then we would be much more secure, and that typically we were attacked by tyrants. I think it's America's destiny, because I think that America's always going to come under attack from tyrants. So I think that our only choice is whether we're going to win or lose, and when we will fight, and under what circumstances, but that we're gonna have to fight. That's automatic, because they're gonna come after us. VO: One of the most evil of these tyrants, the neoconservatives decided, was Saddam Hussein. In the 1980s, Saddam had been America's close ally. But in 1990, he invaded Kuwait. The neoconservatives now saw him as a key to pursuing the next stage of their transformation of the world. An American-led coalition had been created by President Bush senior, to liberate Kuwait. But the neoconservatives, like Paul Wolfowitz, who was Undersecretary of Defense, wanted to push on to Baghdad, and bring about a transformation of the Middle East. It would fulfill America's unique role to defeat evil in the world. Professor STEPHEN HOLMES , Political Philosopher: You see already, in 1991, the hopes of Wolfowitz and others, that the battle against Saddam Hussein, or other petty tyrants, could take the place of the battle against the Soviet Union, and could bear this interpretation of a battle between good and evil.

Professor STEPHEN HOLMES , Political Philosopher: You see already, in 1991, the hopes of Wolfowitz and others, that the battle against Saddam Hussein, or other petty tyrants, could take the place of the battle against the Soviet Union, and could bear this interpretation of a battle between good and evil. So, what you're seeing is the attempt to keep alive the idea that America is engaged in a battle of pure good against pure evil, and to preserve that framework for a world after the end of the Soviet Union. VO: But President Reagan was no longer in charge. The neoconservatives now had a leader who did not share their vision. President GEORGE HW BUSH : Kuwait is liberated. Iraq's army is defeated. Our military objectives are met. And I am pleased to announce that all United States and Coalition forces will suspend combat operations. VO: Once Kuwait was freed, Bush ordered the fighting to stop. His view was that America's role was to create stability in the world, not to try and change it. Like Henry Kissinger, who had been the enemy of the neoconservatives in the 1970s, Bush saw questions of good and evil as irrelevant. The higher aim was to achieve a stable balance of power in the Middle East. BRENT SCOWCROFT , National Security Adviser to President George Bush Sr., Interviewed in 1996: Saddam Hussein is not a threat to his neighbors. He's a nuisance; he's an annoyance; but he's not a threat. That we achieved. It was never our objective to get Saddam Hussein. Indeed, had we tried, we still might be occupying Baghdad. That would have turned a great success into a very messy probably defeat. VO: In private, the neoconservatives like Paul Wolfowitz were furious. Not just because Saddam Hussein had been left in power, but because they saw this as a clear expression of the corrupt liberal values that dominated America-a moral relativism that was prepared to compromise with the forces of evil in the world. HOLMES : Wolfowitz' anger is fundamentally an anger against the weakness of American liberalism: the compromising nature of a man like George Bush senior. His willingness to make concessions, to negotiate, not to drive to the bitter end. And his anger is motivated, interestingly, less by hatred of Saddam Hussein, than by hatred of American liberals, who are a source of weakness, and a source of rot, and a source of relativism, that had been corroding American society for decades. VO: Faced by this defeat, the neoconservative movement now turned inwards, to try and defeat the forces of liberalism that were holding it back. And to do this, they turned again to the theories of Leo Strauss.

VO: Faced by this defeat, the neoconservative movement now turned inwards, to try and defeat the forces of liberalism that were holding it back. And to do this, they turned again to the theories of Leo Strauss. Strauss believed that good politicians should reassert the absolute moral values that would unite society, and this would overcome the moral relativism that liberalism created. One of the most influential Straussians was the new assistant to the Vice-President, William Kristol. WILLIAM KRISTOL , Chief of Staff to the Vice President, 1988-92: For Strauss, liberalism produced a decent way of life, and one that he thought was worth defending, but a dead end where nothing could be said to be true; one had no guidance on how to live, everything was relative. Strauss suggests that maybe we didn't just have to sit there and accept that that was our fate. Politics could help shape the way people live, that politics could help shape the way that people live, teach them some good lessons about living decent and noble human lives. And can we think about what cultures, and what politics, what social orders produce more admirable human beings? I mean, that whole question was put back on the table by Strauss, I think. VO: The neoconservatives set out to reform America. And at the heart of their project was the political use of religion. Together with their long-term allies, the religious right, they began a campaign to bring moral and religious issues back into the center of conservative politics. It became known as the \"culture wars.\" [ TITLE : Christian Coalition commercial ] VO (on commercial) : Your tax dollars are being used to sponsor obscene and pornographic displays.

ROBERTSON : Satan, be gone! Out from this [unintelligible]! C'mon! VO: For the religious right, this campaign was a genuine attempt to renew the religious basis of American society. But for the neoconservatives, religion was a myth, like the myth of America as a unique nation that they had promoted in the Cold War. Strauss had taught that these myths were necessary to give ordinary people meaning and purpose, and so ensure a stable society.

These ex-Marxists, or in some cases ex-liberal Straussians, could see themselves as a kind of Leninist group, you know, who have this covert vision which they want to use to effect change in history, while concealing parts of it from people incapable of understanding it. VO: Out of this campaign, a new and powerful moral agenda began to take over the Republican Party. It reached a dramatic climax at the Republican Convention in 1992, when the religious right seized control of the party's policy-making machinery. George Bush became committed to running for President with policies that would ban abortion, gay rights, and multiculturalism. Speakers who tried to promote the traditional conservative values of individual freedom were booed off the stage. WILLIAM WELD , Republican Governor of Massachusetts : I happen to think that individual freedom should extend to a woman's right to choose. CONVENTION DELEGATES : (whistles and boos) WELD : I want the government out of your pocketbook and your bedroom! VO: For the neoconservatives, the aim of this new morality was to unite the nation. But in fact, it had completely the opposite effect. Mainstream Republican voters were frightened away by the harsh moralism that had taken over their party. They turned instead to Bill Clinton, a politician who connected with their real concerns and needs, like tax and the state of the economy. DIANE BLAIR , Clinton Campaign : In the week after the Republican Convention, Republican moderates, young people, and particularly women saying, \"I've been sort of torn between the two parties, but where do I sign up to help Clinton get elected?

But the neoconservatives were determined to regain power. And to do this, they were going to do to Bill Clinton what they had done to the Soviet Union: they would transform the President of the United States into a fantasy enemy, an image of evil that would make people realize the truth of the liberal corruption of America. [ TITLE : ALGERIA 1992 / June 1992 ] UNIDENTIFIED POLITICIAN (speaking in Arabic, subtitled): We realize that other nations have surpassed us. In what? In knowledge. And Islam- [ GUNSHOTS , CHAOS ] VO: In the early '90s, Algeria, Egypt, and other Arab countries were being torn apart by a horrific wave of Islamist terror. The jihadists who had returned from Afghanistan were trying to topple the regimes. At the heart of their strategy was the idea that Ayman Zawahiri and others had taught them: that those who were involved in politics could legitimately be killed, because they had become corrupted and thus were no longer Muslims. This violence, they believed, would shock people into rising up, and the corrupt regimes would then be overthrown. ABDULLAH ANAS , Member of the Political Council, Islamic Salvation Front, Algeria 1993: \"They must die!\" Not only \"must die,\" they DID kill. They did kill people. Not just any-it's not just an idea from far, it became true. People were killed. [ TITLE : 4th June 1993 ] ANAS : Many many rulers; many many holy men; many many scholars; many many politicians in Islamic world have been killed because of these ideas. Why? Because simply they are against the Koran. They rejected the Koran. Why they rejected the Koran? Because they did elect. VO: Ayman Zawahiri was now based with bin-Laden on this farm in the Sudan. He used it as a base for his group, Islamic Jihad, to launch attacks on politicians in Egypt. But as one of the leading ideologues of the revolution, he also traveled throughout the Arab world, advising other groups on their strategy. But the revolutionaries soon found that the masses did not rise up and follow them. The regimes stayed in power, and the radical Islamists were hunted down.

Faced by this, the Islamists widened their terror. Their logic was brutal: it was not just those who were involved with politics who should be killed, but the ordinary people who supported it. Their refusal to rise up showed that they, too, had become corrupted, and so had condemned themselves to death. Dr. AZZAM TAMIMI , Institute of Islamic Political Thought: There was definitely a logic. The logic is that you assault the leaders, you assault those who are associated with them, and eventually you assault the people who have consented to the presence of such a despotic leader, even if they are passively supportive through their silence. And then you start attacking economic institutions, you start attacking the tourists, because the tourists bring money to the country, and that money goes into the pockets of the corrupt elite. So, it is an endless process. VO: In Algeria, this logic went completely out of control. The Islamist revolutionary groups killed thousands of civilians, because they believed that all these people had become corrupted. MAN (speaking in Arabic, subtitled): All these innocents, what did they ever do? Legs blown off! Such horror! Even the French extremists never did things like this. Why? What have we done? What have our children done? Leave me alone! I want to die! VO: In turn, the generals running Algeria infiltrated the revolutionary groups. They told their agents to persuade the Islamists to push the logic even further, to kill even more people. This would create such horror that the groups would lose any remaining support, and the generals could use the fear and revulsion to increase their grip on power. ANAS : The generals infiltrated the jihad ideas, the jihad groups, to put the society under fear.

The massacre shocked the Egyptian people, and the leaders of the revolutionary groups agreed to call a cease-fire. In Algeria, a few groups held out. But they began to tear each other apart, as they followed the logic that had driven their revolution to its ultimate-and logical-end: they started to kill each other. TAMIMI : It led to their own destruction. A group that believes in 100% pure Muslim will not see that purity in anybody else but themselves. So whoever disagrees with them becomes the enemy, becomes out of the House of Islam, and then if they happen to disagree with each other themselves, then they will start liquidating each other. And they keep fighting each other; there will be infighting. Eventually it ends in suicide. VO: The main Islamist group in Algeria, the GIA, ended up being led by a Mr. Zouabri, a chicken farmer, who killed everyone who disagreed with him. He issued a final communiqué, declaring that the whole of Algerian society should be killed, with the exception of his tiny remaining band of Islamists. They were the only ones who understood the truth. [ TITLE : AMERICA 1996 ] VO: By the mid-'90s, politics in Washington was dominated by one issue: the moral character of the President of the United States. WOMAN IN TV COMMERCIAL : If you believe you've been a victim of sexual harassment by the President, we want to help. VO: Behind this were an extraordinary barrage of allegations against Clinton that were obsessing the media. These included stories of sexual harassment; stories that Clinton and his wife were involved in Whitewater, a corrupt property deal; stories that they had murdered their close friend Vince Foster; and stories that Clinton was involved in smuggling drugs from a small airstrip in Arkansas. But none of these stories were true. All of them had been orchestrated by a young group of neoconservatives, who were determined to destroy Clinton. The campaign was centered on a small right-wing magazine called the American Spectator, which had set up what was called the \"Arkansas Project\" to investigate Clinton's past life.

DAVID BROCK : She was dressed in a raincoat and a hat, and came in at 5:15 in the morning, and had a liaison with Clinton in the game room in the bottom floor of the Governor's mansion. CROSSFIRE HOST : David, this is getting a little bizarre. Next thing, we're gonna see... Jane Fonda's gonna... BROCK : It's bizarre! But hey, Bill Clinton is a bizarre guy. HOST : Wait a sec. VO: Since then, Brock has turned against the neoconservative movement. He now believes that the attacks on Clinton went too far, and corrupted conservative politics. INTERVIEWER (off-camera): Was Whitewater true? BROCK : No! I mean, there was no criminal wrongdoing in Whitewater. Absolutely not. It was a land deal that the Clintons lost money on. It was a complete inversion of what happened. INTERVIEWER : Was Vince Foster killed? BROCK : No. He killed himself. INTERVIEWER : Did the Clintons smuggle drugs? BROCK : Absolutely not. INTERVIEWER : Did those promoting these stories know that this was not true, that none of these stories were true? BROCK : They did not care. INTERVIEWER : Why not? BROCK : Because they were having a devastating effect. So why stop? It was terrorism. Political terrorism. INTERVIEWER : But you were one of the agents. BROCK : Absolutely. Absolutely. VO: The stories began to grip America, and despite Clinton's denials, the Republicans in Congress seized on the scandals and began to press for investigations into this immorality at the heart of government. President BILL CLINTON : Basically, the press has editorialized and pressured the politicians into saying, \"Here's a guy that as far as we know hasn't done anything wrong, nobody's accused him of doing anything wrong, there's no evidence that he's done anything wrong, but we think the presumption of guilt almost should be on him. You should somehow prove his innocence.\" VO: Out of this pressure, Clinton was forced to agree to an independent investigation into Whitewater. It was headed by a senior judge in Washington called Kenneth Starr. But what was not widely known was that Starr was a member of a right-wing group of lawyers called the Federalist Society, that had financial and ideological links to the neoconservatives. And like the neoconservatives, they saw Clinton as a danger to the country, and they were determined to prove this to the American people.

Judge ROBERT BORK , Senior member, Federalist Society: In the Merck manual-Merck is a pharmaceutical company-they have a manual listing various disorders, and they listed \"sociopath.\" And if you look at \"sociopath,\" it describes Clinton exactly. Somebody who's charming, who has no particular feeling at all for the people he's charming, unable to resist instant gratification, and so on and so on. Goes right down the list. We had a very dysfunctional man in the Presidency. That was very dangerous, both as a model and as, if a crisis had arisen, I had no confidence that he would meet it. VO: But despite all his efforts, Kenneth Starr could find no incriminating evidence in Whitewater. Nor could he find any evidence to support any of the sexual scandals that had come from the Arkansas Project. Until finally, his committee stumbled upon Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, which Clinton denied. And in that lie, the neoconservative movement believed they had found what they had been looking for: a way to make the American people see the truth about the liberal corruption of their country. A campaign now began to impeach the President. And in the hysteria, the whole conservative movement portrayed Clinton as a depraved monster who had to be removed from office. But yet again, the neoconservatives had created a fantasy enemy by exaggerating and distorting reality. JOE CONASON , Author 'The Hunting of the President' : They were trapped by a mythological person that they had constructed, or persons-the Clintons, these scheming, terrible people who they, the noble pursuers, were going to vanquish. I think, in the leadership of conservatism, during the Clinton era there was an element of corruption. There was an element of a willingness to do anything to achieve the goal of bringing Clinton down. There was a way in which the people who perceived Clinton as immoral behaved immorally themselves. They ended up behaving worse than the people who they were attacking. VO: But all the moral fury, and the deception, came to nothing. The impeachment failed because the polls consistently showed that Americans still did not care about these moral issues. One leading neoconservative, William Bennett, wrote a book called The Death of Outrage, which blamed the people. He accused the public of making a deal with the devil. Their failure, he said, to support the impeachment, was evidence of their moral corruption.

[ TITLE : AFGHANISTAN 1997 ] VO: By 1997, bin-Laden and Ayman Zawahiri had returned to Afghanistan, where they had first met ten years before. Back then, it had seemed as if Islamism might succeed as a popular revolutionary movement. But now, they were facing failure. All attempts to topple regimes in the Arab world had not succeeded. The people had turned against them because of the horrific violence, and Afghanistan was the only place they had left to go. GILLES KEPEL , Historian of the Islamist Movement: Well, 1997 was their failure. Egypt, Algeria; it worked nowhere. It went wrong because populations would not back them. Because even people who were sympathetic to them in the beginning were frightened away by their violence, by their incapacity to communicate and to have access to the people, and this was very clear in Zawahiri's book Knights under the Prophet's Banner, where he sort of goes back from this experiment, and laments over their incapacity to raise the consciousness of the masses, and feels that, you know, as a vanguard they did not manage to communicate. They remained isolated, and this is why they failed. And this is when they started this new strategy. VO: In May, 1998, bin-Laden and Zawahiri invited a group of journalists to this press conference, where they announced a new jihad. Zawahiri was convinced that it was not their theories that were to blame for the failure; it was the fault of the Muslim masses. Their minds had been corrupted by the liberal ideas from the West. But rather than give up, they believed that the solution was to attack the source of the corruption directly. The new jihad would be against America itself. MAN (reading from paper): As I mentioned before, we focus our efforts to fight against the Jews and Christians or Americans. We have no objection against any party or any person who fights Americans all over the world. And we want to carry it out within the war against Americans. America will be defeated. Americans know our power, and... VO: This was a strategy of desperation, born out of failure by a small group whose revolution had failed. And the anger that came from that failure was about to be directed at the United States. What Zawahiri and bin-Laden were about to do would dramatically affect the future of the neoconservative movement. By 1998, all their attempts to transform America by creating a moral revolution had failed.

And in their reaction to the attacks, the neoconservatives would transform the failing Islamist movement into what would appear to be the grand revolutionary force that Zawahiri had always dreamed of. But much of it would exist only in people's imaginations. It would be the next phantom enemy. **Finding Balance: WantToKnow.info Inspiration Center** WantToKnow.info believes it is important to balance disturbing cover-up information with inspirational writings which call us to be all that we can be and to work together for positive change.

Corrections from those with better hearing, audio equipment, or sensitivity to Arabic accents are welcome. VO: In the past, politicians promised to create a better world. They had different ways of achieving this. But their power and authority came from the optimistic visions they offered to their people. Those dreams failed. And today, people have lost faith in ideologies. Increasingly, politicians are seen simply as managers of public life. But now, they have discovered a new role that restores their power and authority. Instead of delivering dreams, politicians now promise to protect us from nightmares. They say that they will rescue us from dreadful dangers that we cannot see and do not understand. And the greatest danger of all is international terrorism. A powerful and sinister network, with sleeper cells in countries across the world. A threat that needs to be fought by a war on terror. But much of this threat is a fantasy, which has been exaggerated and distorted by politicians. It's a dark illusion that has spread unquestioned through governments around the world, the security services, and the international media. VO: This is a series of films about how and why that fantasy was created, and who it benefits. At the heart of the story are two groups: the American neoconservatives, and the radical Islamists. Last week's episode ended in the late '90s with both groups marginalized and out of power. But with the attacks of September 11th, the fates of both dramatically changed. The Islamists, after their moment of triumph, were virtually destroyed within months, while the neoconservatives took power in Washington. But then, the neoconservatives began to reconstruct the Islamists. They created a phantom enemy. And as this nightmare fantasy began to spread, politicians realized the newfound power it gave them in a deeply disillusioned age. Those with the darkest nightmares became the most powerful.

For 20 years, Zawahiri had struggled to create revolutions in the Arab world, but all attempt had ended in bloody failure. [ EXCERPT , CNN EXCLUSIVE VIDEO ] INTERVIEWER (in Arabic, English subtitles): We haven't had any information about your whereabouts for some time. Where were you? AYMAN ZAWAHIRI: {?} I was just home and clubs. INTERVIEWER: Not in Afghanistan? Somewhere else? ZAWAHIRI: Everywhere, everywhere. INTERVIEWER : Everywhere? ZAWAHIRI: I am a Muslim.

INTERVIEWER: {?} Yes, but isn't what you do not to do with arms? ZAWAHIRI: {?} It's aggressive but ask Allah, and he is greater than superpower. VO: Zawahiri was a follower of the Egyptian revolutionary, Sayyed Qutb, who had been executed in 1966. Qutb's vision had been of a new type of modern state. It would contain all of the benefits of Western science and technology, but it would use Islam as a moral framework to protect people from the culture of Western liberalism. Qutb believed that this culture infected the minds of Muslims, turning them into selfish creatures who threatened to destroy the shared values that held society together. Throughout the 80s and 90s, Zawahiri had tried to persuade the masses to rise up and topple the rulers who had allowed this corruption to infect their countries. [ EXCERPT , VIDEOTAPE OF SADAT ASSASSINATION ] [ CUT TO AYMAN ZAWAHIRI IN EGYPTIAN COURTROOM CELL ] ZAWAHIRI [haranguing courtroom]: We want to speak to the whole world. Who are we? VO: But the revolutionaries became trapped in a horrific escalation of violence, because the masses refused to follow them. Islamism failed as a mass movement, and Zawahiri now came to the conclusion that a new strategy was needed. GILLES KEPEL , HISTORIAN OF ISLAMIST MOVEMENT: They had no revolution at all. I mean, they had failed in their takeover, they had failed to topple the powers that be, and, you know, they became more and more interested in this idea that only a small vanguard could be successful. I mean, they had lost confidence in the spontaneous capacity of the masses to be mobilised.

[ TITLE : NAIROBI , AUGUST 1998 ] VO: Zawahiri and bin Laden began implementing this new strategy in August, 1998. Two huge suicide bombs were detonated outside American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing more than 200 people. The bombings had a dramatic effect on the West. For the first time, the name \"bin Laden\" entered the public consciousness as a terrorist mastermind. [ CUT TO AFGHANISTAN ] VO: The suicide bombers had been recruited by bin Laden from the Islamist training camps in Afghanistan. But his and Zawahiri's operation was very much on the fringes of the Islamist movement. The overwhelming majority of the fighters in these camps had nothing at all to do with bin Laden or international terrorism. They were training to fight regimes in their own countries, such as Uzbekistan, Kashmir, and Chechnya. Their aim was to establish Islamist societies in the Western world, and they had no interest in attacking America. Bin Laden helped fund some of the camps, and in return was allowed to look for volunteers for his operations. But a number of senior Islamists were against his new strategy, including members of Zawahiri's own group, Islamic Jihad. [ EXCERPT , CNN EXCLUSIVE VIDEO : BIN LADEN, SURROUNDED BY ARMED , MASKED SOLDIERS ] VO: Even bin Laden's displays of strength to the Western media were faked. The fighters in this video had been hired for the day and told to bring their own weapons. For beyond this small group, bin Laden had no formal organisation-until the Americans invented one for him. [ CUT TO MANHATTAN CITYSCAPE ] [ TITLE : MANHATTAN , JANUARY 2001 ] VO: In January, 2001, a trial began in a Manhattan courtroom of four men accused of the embassy bombings in east Africa. But the Americans had also decided to prosecute bin Laden in his absence. But to do this under American law, the prosecutors needed evidence of a criminal organisation because, as with the Mafia, that would allow them to prosecute the head of the organisation even if he could not be linked directly to the crime. And the evidence for that organisation was provided for them by an ex-associate of bin Laden's called Jamal al-Fadl. JASON BURKE , AUTHOR, \"AL QAEDA\" : During the investigation of the 1998 bombings, there is a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__power_of_nightmares_transcript_3.txt:2:700ed9ab018d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15363, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__power_of_nightmares_transcript_3.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__power_of_nightmares_transcript_3", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "his absence. But to do this under American law, the prosecutors needed evidence of a criminal organisation because, as with the Mafia, that would allow them to prosecute the head of the organisation even if he could not be linked directly to the crime. And the evidence for that organisation was provided for them by an ex-associate of bin Laden's called Jamal al-Fadl. JASON BURKE , AUTHOR, \"AL QAEDA\" : During the investigation of the 1998 bombings, there is a walk-in source, Jamal al-Fadl, who is a Sudanese militant who was with bin Laden in the early 90s, who has been passed around a whole series of Middle East secret services, none of whom want much to do with him, and who ends up in America and is taken on by-uh-the American government, effectively, as a key prosecution witness and is given a huge amount of American taxpayers' money at the same time. And his account is used as raw material to build up a picture of Al Qaeda. The picture that the FBI want to build up is one that will fit the existing laws that they will have to use to prosecute those responsible for the bombing. Now, those laws were drawn up to counteract organised crime: the Mafia, drugs crime, crimes where people being a member of an organisation is extremely important. You have to have an organisation to get a prosecution. And you have al-Fadl and a number of other witness, a number of other sources, who are happy to feed into this. You've got material that, looked at in a certain way, can be seen to show this organisation's existence. You put the two together and you get what is the first bin Laden myth-the first Al Qaeda myth. And because it's one of the first, it's extremely influential. VO: The picture al-Fadl drew for the Americans of bin Laden was of an all-powerful figure at the head of a large terrorist network that had an organised network of control. He also said that bin Laden had given this network a name: \"Al Qaeda.\" It was a dramatic and powerful picture of bin Laden, but it bore little relationship to the truth. [ EXCERPT, CNN EXCLUSIVE VIDEO : BIN LADEN AND SOLDIERS ] VO: The reality was that bin Laden and Ayman Zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned Islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy. But there was no organisation. These were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and assistance. He was not their commander. There is also no evidence that bin Laden used the term \"Al Qaeda\" to refer to the name of a group until after September the 11th, when he realized that this was the term the Americans have given it.

[ CUT TO MANHATTAN SKYLINE ] VO: In reality, Jamal al-Fadl was on the run from bin Laden, having stolen money from him. In return for his evidence, the Americans gave him witness protection in America and hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many lawyers at the trial believed that al-Fadl exaggerated and lied to give the Americans the picture of a terrorist organisation that they needed to prosecute bin Laden. SAM SCHMIDT , DEFENCE LAWYER EMBASSY BOMBINGS TRIAL: And there were selective portions of al-Fadl's testimony that I believe was false, to help support the picture that he helped the Americans join together. I think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organisation was. It made Al Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with Al Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden-who talked a lot. BURKE : The idea-which is critical to the FBI's prosecution-that bin Laden ran a coherent organisation with operatives and cells all around the world of which you could be a member is a myth. There is no Al Qaeda organisation. There is no international network with a leader, with cadres who will unquestioningly obey orders, with tentacles that stretch out to sleeper cells in America, in Africa, in Europe. That idea of a coherent, structured terrorist network with an organised capability simply does not exist. VO: What did exist was a powerful idea that was about to inspire a single, devastating act that would lead the whole world into believing the myth that had begun to be constructed in the Manhattan courtroom.

It was Ayman Zawahiri's new strategy, implemented in a brutal and spectacular way. But neither he nor bin Laden were the originators of what was called the \"Planes Operation.\" It was the brainchild of an Islamist militant called Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who came to bin Laden for funding and help in finding volunteers. But in the wake of panic created by the attacks, the politicians reached for the model which had been created by the trial earlier that year: the hijackers were just the tip of a vast, international terrorist network which was called, \"Al Qaeda.\" [ CUT TO INTERIOR, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, UNITED STATES CONGRESS ] GEORGE W BUSH , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES [ ON SPEAKER'S PODIUM ] : Al Qaeda is to terror what the Mafia is to crime.

VO: And the attacks had another dramatic effect: they brought the neoconservatives back to power in America. When George Bush first became president, he had appointed neoconservatives like Paul Wolfowitz, and their allies like Donald Rumsfeld, to his administration. But their grand vision of America's role in the world was largely ignored by this new regime.

VO: But now, the neoconservatives became all-powerful, because this terror network proved that what they had been predicting through the 1990s was correct: that America was at risk from terrifying new forces in a hostile world. A small group formed that began to shape America's response to the attacks. At its heart were Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz, along with the vice-president, Dick Cheney, and Richard Perle, who was a senior advisor to the Pentagon. The last time these men had been in power together was 20 years before, under President Reagan. Back then, they had taken on and, as they saw it, defeated a source of evil that wanted to take over America: the Soviet Union. And now they saw this new war on terror in the same epic terms. RICHARD PERLE , CHAIRMAN PENTAGON DEFENSE POLICY BOARD 2001-2003: The struggle against Soviet totalitarianism was a struggle between fundamental value questions. \"Good\" and \"evil\" is about as effective a shorthand as I can imagine in this regard, and there's something rather similar going on in the war on terror. It isn't a war on terror, it's a war on terrorists who want to impose an intolerant tyranny on all mankind, an Islamic universe in which we are all compelled to accept their beliefs and live by their lights, and in that sense this is a battle between good and evil. VO: But, as previous episodes have shown, the neoconservatives distorted and exaggerated the Soviet threat. They created the image of a hidden, international web of evil run from Moscow that planned to dominate the world, when, in reality, the Soviet Union was on its last legs, collapsing from within. Now, they did the same with the Islamists. They took a failing movement which had lost mass support and began to reconstruct it into the image of a powerful network of evil, controlled from the center by bin Laden from his lair in Afghanistan. They did this because it fitted with their vision of America's unique destiny to fight an epic battle against the forces of evil throughout the world. VINCENT CANNISTRARO , HEAD OF COUNTER - TERRORISM , CIA , 1988-90: What the neoconservatives are doing is taking a concept that they developed during the competition with the Soviet Union, i.e., Soviet Communism was evil, it wanted to take over our country, wanted to take over our people, our classrooms, our society. It was that kind of concept of evil that they took-an exaggerated one, to be sure-and then apply it to a new threat, where it didn't apply at all, and yet it was layered with the same kind of cultural baggage.

[ TITLE: AFGHANISTAN, NOVEMBER 2001 ] [ CUT TO DESOLATE TERRAIN , MOUNTAINS IN BACKGROUND , SHOOTING IN FOREGROUND ] VO: To do this, the Americans allied themselves with a group called the Northern Alliance. They were a loose collection of warlords, fighting a war of resistance against the Taliban, the Islamists who controlled Afghanistan. The Taliban's best troops were the thousands of foreign fighters from the training camps who the Northern Alliance hated. [ NORTHERN ALLIANCE TROOPS RETRIEVE IDENTITY PAPERS FROM DEAD TALIBAN FIGHTERS . ONE HOLDS AN IDENTITY CARD UP TO THE CAMERA ] NORTHERN ALLIANCE SOLDIER : Pakistan, eh! Pakistan! Pakistan! VO: And now, they took their revenge on the foreign fighters. The Americans believed that these men were Al Qaeda terrorists, and the Northern Alliance did nothing to disabuse them of this, because they were paid by the Americans for each prisoner they delivered. But the majority of these fighters had never had anything to do with bin Laden or international terrorism. Both they and the Taliban were radical nationalists who wanted to create Islamist societies in their own countries. But now, they were either killed or taken off to Guantánamo Bay and Islamism, as an organised movement for changing the Muslim world, was obliterated in Afghanistan. But as it disappeared, it was replaced by ever more extravagant fantasies about the power and reach of the Al Qaeda network.

In the past 24 hours, United States law enforcement has identified and disrupted an Al Qaeda-trained terrorist cell on American soil. VO: The arrests were announced proudly by Washington as another sleeper cell plotting an attack. But it soon became clear that there was no evidence for this at all, other than the E-mail. COLE : And the best the government can point to as a sleeper cell are these, you know, young men in Lackawanna, in New York, who, yes, went to Afghanistan, trained in an Al Qaeda training camp, but to all appearances had no intention to ever take any action on the basis of that. One of them faked an injury to try to get out early. They came back to the United States. We had them under intensive surveillance and we found no evidence-not one shred of evidence-that they ever planned or intended to engage in any kind of criminal, much less terrorist, act. That's the best they can show for a sleeper cell. VO: Faced with the fact that there was no evidence, the government quietly dropped any charges of their being a terrorist cell. Instead, they were prosecuted simply for having gone to the training camp, and for having bought uniforms there. And all the other cases were even flimsier: A group of students who supported the liberation of Kashmir were found paint-balling in the woods of Virginia.

[ CUT TO POLICE OFFICERS AT CRIME SCENE ] VO: But, yet again, there is very little evidence for this. Of the 664 people arrested under the Terrorism Act since September the 11th, none of them have been convicted of belonging to Al Qaeda. Only 3 people have so far been convicted of having any association with any Islamist groups, and none of those convictions were for being involved in a terror plot; they were for fundraising, or possessing Islamist literature. The majority of people convicted under the Terrorism Act since September the 11th have actually been members of Irish terrorist groups like the UVF or the Real IRA. And many of the arrests that were dramatically announced as being part of a hidden Al Qaeda network were, in reality, as absurd as the cases in America. For example, the London police swooped on a Mr Zain ul-Abedin who they said was running an international network for terrorist training. It turned out to be a self-defence course for bodyguards.

No one was ever arrested for planning gas attacks on the London tubes; it was a fantasy that swept through the media.

There are dangerous and fanatical groups around the world who've been inspired by the extreme Islamist theories, and they are prepared to use the techniques of mass terror on civilians. The bombings in Madrid showed this only too clearly. But this is not a new phenomenon. What is new is the way the American and other governments have transformed this complex and disparate threat into a simplistic fantasy of an organised web of uniquely powerful terrorists who may strike anywhere and at any moment. But no one questioned this fantasy because, increasingly, it was serving the interests of so many people. For the press, television, and hundreds of terrorism experts, the fact that it seemed so like fiction made it irresistible to their audiences. And the Islamists, too, began to realise that by feeding this media fantasy they could become a powerful organisation-if only in people's imaginations. The prime mover in this was one of bin Laden's associates, who had been captured by the Americans. He was called Abu Zubaydah. He began to tell his interrogators of terrifying plots that Al Qaeda was preparing, some of which, he said, they had copied from Hollywood movies like Godzilla, which they had watched in Afghanistan. [ CUT TO INTERIOR, BRIEFING ROOM ] DR JOHN PRADOS , NATIONAL SECURITY ARCHIVE , WASHINGTON DC : Zubaydah told the interrogators a set of stories based on what he thought would alarm us.

VO: And the media took the bait. They portrayed the dirty bomb as an extraordinary weapon that would kill thousands of people, and, in the process, they made the hidden enemy even more terrifying. But, in reality, the threat of a dirty bomb is yet another illusion. Its aim is to spread radioactive material through a conventional explosion, but almost all studies of such a possible weapon have concluded that the radiation spread in this way would not kill anybody because the radioactive material would be so dispersed, and, providing the area was cleaned promptly, the long-term effects would be negligible. In the past, both the American army and the Iraqi military tested such devices and both concluded that they were completely ineffectual weapons for this very reason. [ CUT TO INTERIOR , LIVING ROOM ] INTERVIEWER : How dangerous would a dirty bomb be? DR THEODORE ROCKWELL , NUCLEAR SCIENTIST AND RADIATION RISK EXPERT : The deaths would be few, if any, and the answer is, probably none. INTERVIEWER : Really? ROCKWELL : Yes. And that's been said over and over again, but then people immediately say after that, \"But, you know, people won't believe that, and they'll panic.\" And then all the people working on this project, you know, the defence and so forth, breathe a big sigh of relief because they got their problem back: you know, we're gonna all panic. I don't think it would kill anybody and I think you'll have trouble finding a serious report that would claim otherwise. The Department of Energy actually set up such a test and they actually measured what happened. And they-they-the measurements were extremely low. They calculated that the most exposed individual would get a fairly high dose-not life-threatening, but fairly high-and I checked into how the calculation was done, and they assume that after the attack, no one moves for one year.

I may be wrong in believing it, but I do believe it. [ CUT , EXTERIOR , MOONLIT , DARK CITY SKYLINE ] VO: What Blair argued was that faced by the new threat of a global terror network, the politician's role was now to look into the future and imagine the worst that might happen and then act ahead of time to prevent it. In doing this, Blair was embracing an idea that had actually been developed by the Green movement: it was called the \"precautionary principle.\" Back in the 1980s, thinkers within the ecology movement believed the world was being threatened by global warming, but at the time there was little scientific evidence to prove this. So they put forward the radical idea that governments had a higher duty: they couldn't wait for the evidence, because by then it would be too late; they had to act imaginatively, on intuition, in order to save the world from a looming catastrophe. [ CUT , INTERIOR , MEETING ROOM ] DURODIE : In essence, the precautionary principle says that not having the evidence that something might be a problem is not a reason for not taking action as if it were a problem. That's a very famous triple-negative phrase that effectively says that action without evidence is justified. It requires imagining what the worst might be and applying that imagination upon the worst evidence that currently exists. [ CUT , INTERIOR , HALL ; ANGLE ON TONY BLAIR ADDRESSING STATE FUNCTION ] BLAIR : Would Al Qaeda buy weapons of mass destruction if they could? Certainly. Does it have the financial resources?

The American attorney general explained this shift to what he called the \"paradigm of prevention.\" [ CUT , INTERIOR , HEARING ROOM , UNITED STATES CONGRESS ] ASHCROFT : We had to make a shift in the way we thought about things, so being reactive, waiting for a crime to be committed, or waiting for there to be evidence of the commission of a crime didn't seem to us to be an appropriate way to protect the American people. [ CUT , INTERIOR , OFFICE ] DAVID COLE : Under the preventive paradigm, instead of holding people accountable for what you can prove that they have done in the past, you lock them up based on what you think or speculate they might do in the future. And how-how can a person who's locked up based on what you think they might do in the future disprove your speculation? It's impossible, and so what ends up happening is the government short-circuits all the processes that are designed to distinguish the innocent from the guilty because they simply don't fit this mode of locking people up for what they might do in the future. VO: The supporters of the precautionary principle argue that this loss of rights is the price that society has to pay when faced by the unique and terrifying threat of the Al Qaeda network. But, as this series has shown, the idea of a hidden, organised web of terror is largely a fantasy, and by embracing the precautionary principle, the politicians have become trapped in a vicious circle: they imagine the worst about an organisation that doesn't even exist. But no one questions this because the very basis of the precautionary principle is to imagine the worst without supporting evidence, and, instead, those with the darkest imaginations become the most influential.

And a society that believes in nothing is particularly frightened by people who believe in anything, and, therefore, we label those people as fundamentalists or fanatics, and they have much greater purchase in terms of the fear that they instill in society than they truly deserve.

This article investigates how [US agencies allowed the Sinaloa drug cartel](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/10/us-agencies-financing-el-chapo-drug-war) to carry out its operations from 2000 to 2012 in exchange for intel on rival cartels while also pumping billions into Mexican law enforcement and military to fight organized crime. In Mexican territory, agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and prosecutors from the Department of Justice secretly met and negotiated with members of drug cartels to obtain information on rival organizations, a situation that escalated violence across the country, according to an investigation by EL UNIVERSAL. The DEA, the Department of Justice, and other U.S. agencies contacted about these meetings with drug traffickers declined to comment. For a year, this newspaper obtained official and judicial documents from Mexico and the United States, interviewed over a hundred active and retired officials from both countries, as well as detainees, their families, and specialists, though only those who agreed to be identified are included here. No Mexican authority reported these meetings to Congress, and no investigation has been opened in Mexico regarding these meetings on Mexican soil. Judicial documents, which this outlet possesses, indicate that the U.S. government was aware of and authorized the meetings and negotiations with members of Mexican cartels, particularly the Sinaloa cartel, to gather information on their rivals. This led to the seizure of shipments and arrests, triggering violence in Mexico during the administrations of Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón. During these two PAN administrations, U.S. prosecutors such as Steve Fraga, and DEA agents including Manuel Castañón, David Herrod, and Carlos Mitchem, who was an assistant regional director, met with drug traffickers in Mexico. David Gaddis, then the DEA Regional Director based in Mexico City, and other agency officials in the U.S. authorized their agents to meet with cartel members without informing the Mexican government and allowed, under written agreements, for the traffickers to continue their operations. \"In large part because we are there [in Mexico] to collect intelligence to support investigations in the United States. In that sense, I have interviewed several cartel members and drug traffickers like Zambada-Niebla in Mexico. It's not like interviewing a fugitive who walks into my office in San Diego.

In response, Rusty Payne, a spokesperson for the DEA, stated that \"the DEA will not comment on these ongoing reports. Mr. (David) Gaddis no longer works for the DEA.\" In Colombia, the DEA, along with other U.S. agencies, gathered information on rival organizations against Pablo Escobar, working closely with Colombian police. This work was described as highly important and a great success by Myles Frechette, former U.S. Ambassador to Colombia. \"The drug trafficking problem continues in Colombia, but there has been a reduction in cocaine and other drug trafficking,\" Frechette added in an interview with this outlet. The DEA has operated similarly in Colombia since the 1980s, as well as in Cambodia, Thailand, and for over ten years in Afghanistan; it is the agency's standard modus operandi, explained Edgardo Buscaglia, a professor at Columbia University. \"Of course, this modus operandi involves a violation of public international law, and it adds more fuel to the fire of violence, with violations of due process and human rights,\" Buscaglia highlighted. He added that the DEA's actions violate the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime \"since it requires that all transnational investigations by one state within the sovereign territory of another state always adhere to the legal framework in the territory where the investigative techniques are implemented.\" In this regard, criminal lawyer Juan Velázquez noted that international treaties signed by Mexico and other countries allow foreign agents to be in Mexico, subject to Mexican authorities, and simply act as information gatherers without acting independently. \"Neither bilateral cooperation agreements nor other 'things' override the Constitution, which is the supreme law. If our authorities allow otherwise, they act illegally and are subject to accountability, but how can they be held accountable if such agreements and actions are secret and therefore nothing is known about them?\" he said. The Secret War At the beginning of Enrique Peña Nieto's presidency, there were growing concerns in the U.S. about the new PRI administration potentially negotiating with drug cartels to curb violence. However, the U.S. government had already been engaged in such negotiations. Between 2000 and 2012, particularly during Felipe Calderón's presidency from 2006 to 2012, the U.S. government established unprecedented collaboration agreements with Mexico to combat drug trafficking. Simultaneously, it orchestrated a covert war in Mexico through its agents who met directly with cartel members. DEA agents, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, and Department of Justice prosecutors were authorized by the U.S. to meet with drug traffickers in Mexico, according to judicial documents. In June 2009, an agreement between the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security granted DEA and ICE agents authority to investigate drug trafficking suspects both at the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico.txt:1:2a8987413add", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15388, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "to combat drug trafficking. Simultaneously, it orchestrated a covert war in Mexico through its agents who met directly with cartel members. DEA agents, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, and Department of Justice prosecutors were authorized by the U.S. to meet with drug traffickers in Mexico, according to judicial documents. In June 2009, an agreement between the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security granted DEA and ICE agents authority to investigate drug trafficking suspects both at the border and internationally, resolving a long-standing dispute between these agencies. Without Mexican authorities present, as required by bilateral agreements, and without informing the Mexican government, DEA agents met with cartel members in Mexico to gather information on rival organizations. They also established a network of informants among drug traffickers, who signed cooperation agreements based on results, which included potential benefits like dropping charges in the U.S. Occasionally, DEA or U.S. government-provided information from these meetings was shared with the Mexican government, without citing the source, to facilitate arrests by Mexican police or military. During Calderón's presidency, 12 significant drug trafficker arrests were attributed to the DEA, according to the agency's reports. One case revealing these negotiations occurred in late November 2006, at the end of Vicente Fox's term, when the body of a man was found in \"El Chamizal\" park near the Córdoba-Las Américas International Bridge connecting Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua with El Paso, Texas. On the man's face were taped the business cards of ICE narcotics agents Raúl Bencomo and Tod Johnson, as well as an index finger in the deceased's mouth. The two ICE agents were implicated during the trial in the U.S. of Guillermo Eduardo Ramírez Peyro, identified as a paid informant for ICE and a member of the Juárez cartel. Ramírez Peyro led authorities to a residence in the Las Acequias neighborhood of Ciudad Juárez where 12 bodies were found in January 2004, a location that became known as \"the house of death,\" as previously reported. In March 2010, Jesús Manuel Fierro Méndez, a member of the Sinaloa cartel and former captain of the Ciudad Juárez police, testified in El Paso that he acted as a spokesperson for \"El Chapo\" Guzmán during numerous phone conversations and personal meetings with ICE agents. \"There were two of us who were, let's say, spokespeople. We passed all the information. But we obviously received this information from higher levels,\" Fierro Méndez stated, claiming that \"El Chapo\" authorized him to meet with ICE and report on rival cartels' activities. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office launched an investigation into the improper handling of sources by ICE agents who met and negotiated with Sinaloa cartel members for information on rival groups. The names of the agents involved were not made public.

Between 2009 and 2011, DEA agents in the Houston office established direct contacts with key members of the Gulf cartel and \"Los Zetas\" to gather information on rival organizations, but the names of the agents and informants have not been released. \"The U.S. government and its various agencies have a long history of providing benefits, permits, and immunity to criminals and their organizations to commit crimes, including murder, in exchange for information against other criminals and organizations,\" stated Zambada Niebla's defense in document 94. This tactic, the defense notes, has been extensively used by the Department of Justice and its various agencies in the \"war on drugs\" with little concern for the loss of lives in both Mexico and the U.S., or for the ongoing drug trafficking into the U.S. or its consumption. \"This strategy, which they call 'Divide and Conquer' by using one drug trafficking organization against another, is exactly what the Department of Justice and its various agencies have implemented in Mexico,\" the defense added. According to Edgardo Buscaglia, an intelligence strategy where a country uses one criminal group to eliminate another is not inappropriate as long as the strategy is implemented by a state with relatively effective judicial, asset, and political corruption controls. \"But if the United States tries to apply this strategy in a country like Mexico, where these three types of controls are glaringly absent, the result will be that the 'used' criminal group will de facto become the primary concentration of power. I fear that this may be the case with the Sinaloa criminal organization,\" he emphasized. The case that has detailed the DEA agents' tactics for meeting and negotiating with cartel members in Mexico is the judicial process involving Vicente Zambada Niebla, son of Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, one of the leaders of the Sinaloa cartel, in a court in Chicago, Illinois. Statements and documents presented since 2009 in the trial against Zambada Niebla have led to pressure from U.S. authorities on their main informant, requests for information about DEA agents' meetings with drug traffickers in Mexico, the agreements reached, a deeper investigation by the U.S. Congress into the \"Fast and Furious\" operation, and the U.S. government's refusal to disclose details about operations in Mexico. It has become clear that DEA agents met with high-level members of the Sinaloa cartel more than 50 times in Mexican territory, according to court documents that include statements from the agents and U.S. officials themselves.

Secret Agreements On March 18, 2009, at 12:05 a.m. in a room at the Sheraton Hotel, DEA agents Manuel Castañón and David Herrod met for 30 minutes with Vicente Zambada Niebla and attorney Humberto Loya-Castro, who were identified as members of the Sinaloa cartel in the U.S. and Mexico. The meeting, planned three months in advance and last-minute canceled by David Gaddis, the DEA regional director based at the U.S. embassy in Mexico due to a leak to a newspaper, could not be avoided by the drug agents when Vicente Zambada arrived with Loya Castro. Five hours later, Zambada Niebla was arrested by the Mexican Army. But the story began years earlier when, in 1995, the U.S. government initiated a case in the Southern District of California against Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán Loera and the lawyer of the \"Sinaloa Cartel,\" Humberto Loya Castro. By the late 1990s, in an effort to resolve the charges against him, lawyer Loya Castro met in Monterrey, Nuevo León, with U.S. agents, according to defense and prosecution documents in the case against Vicente Zambada. \"Chapo gave his approval, and Mr. Loya-Castro began to provide information he received from El Chapo to the agents,\" stated lawyer Fernando A. Gaxiola in his declaration on October 24, 2011, who served as a legal interpreter for Vicente Zambada-Niebla's defense. Loya-Castro refused to provide information about the Sinaloa cartel but continued to provide information on rival cartels. By the mid-2000s, he met with DEA agents to discuss the charges against him. \"The agents also advised Mr. Loya-Castro to be careful when talking on the phone with El Chapo because they might be overheard by Mexican authorities, and he should be particularly cautious about the information he conveyed to El Chapo over the phone,\" revealed Gaxiola. However, the first formal collaboration agreement between Loya-Castro and the DEA was recorded in mid-2005 through DEA agent Manuel Castañón, who would later identify Loya-Castro in various documents as a \"cooperating source\" or CS, for its English abbreviation. \"In 2005, when I started working in Hermosillo, one of my first tasks assigned by my supervisor was to finalize an agreement with an information source who had been providing intermittent information to the DEA and ICE for several years,\" detailed Agent Castañón in his written declaration dated December 2, 2011, and submitted to the Chicago court in the Zambada-Niebla case. On June 3, 2005, Loya-Castro signed a \"Confidential Cooperation Agreement\" with the U.S. Department of Justice through the DEA,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico.txt:4:2ba75115321c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15391, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "\"In 2005, when I started working in Hermosillo, one of my first tasks assigned by my supervisor was to finalize an agreement with an information source who had been providing intermittent information to the DEA and ICE for several years,\" detailed Agent Castañón in his written declaration dated December 2, 2011, and submitted to the Chicago court in the Zambada-Niebla case. On June 3, 2005, Loya-Castro signed a \"Confidential Cooperation Agreement\" with the U.S. Department of Justice through the DEA, with agents Manuel Castañón, David Herrod, and Greg Garza as signatories. In document 109 presented by the U.S. prosecution on September 9, 2011, it is noted that Loya-Castro signed multiple confidential cooperation agreements with the DEA between 2005 and 2011. The confidential cooperation agreements, copies of which are held by this outlet, specify that Loya-Castro committed unconditionally to provide information, act under U.S. government supervision, perform illicit activities specifically authorized by his controlling investigator, and all without expecting anything in return. \"Loya continued his activities with the Sinaloa cartel, with the knowledge of the U.S. government, without being arrested or prosecuted,\" highlighted Zambada-Niebla's defense in document number 94, a 16-page document dated July 29, 2011, in the case against Ismael Zambada's son, case number 09-CR-00383. Mr. Loya-Castro \"testified that he provided significant information to the agents that he relayed from El Chapo, El Mayo, and Mr. Zambada-Niebla, which resulted in numerous arrests of key figures from rival narcotic organizations,\" explained Gaxiola. According to lawyer Gaxiola, Zambada-Niebla provided information to Loya-Castro about a leading narcotrafficker from a rival cartel, for Loya-Castro to pass on to DEA agents, which helped in the apprehension of that individual. \"Mr. Loya-Castro stated that under this agreement with the government, the charges against him were dismissed in 2008,\" noted lawyer Gaxiola, who was an interpreter during meetings between U.S. attorneys for Zambada and Loya at the \"Four Seasons\" hotel in Mexico City on March 9 and July 14, 2010. In this regard, DEA agent Manuel Castañón confirmed that in 2008 his DEA supervisors recommended to the U.S. Attorney that the charges against Loya-Castro be dropped. \"I supported dismissing the charges due to the extraordinary cooperation that the CS (Loya-Castro) had provided over many years and because the CS was not an operational narcotrafficker (as opposed to someone like Zambada-Niebla, whom I view differently),\" stated Agent Castañón. Additionally, he mentioned that he knew the final decision to recommend dismissing the charges was up to his boss David Gaddis, and the decision to act to dismiss the charges was made by the U.S. Attorney's office. \"After dismissing the charges, the CS continued to provide me with information. I continued to work with him/her,\" said Agent Castañón, who in his statements tried to avoid giving details that would identify Loya-Castro as a person. Meanwhile, Loya-Castro informed the Sinaloa cartel that he was still in regular contact with Manuel Castañón", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico.txt:5:936708a4cf7c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15392, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "recommend dismissing the charges was up to his boss David Gaddis, and the decision to act to dismiss the charges was made by the U.S. Attorney's office. \"After dismissing the charges, the CS continued to provide me with information.

Meanwhile, Loya-Castro informed the Sinaloa cartel that he was still in regular contact with Manuel Castañón and the DEA, and continued to provide information about rival groups. \"He stated that he met with U.S. agents at least 50 times, made hundreds of phone calls, and sent numerous emails to agents,\" mentioned lawyer Gaxiola. Subsequent to the agreement, Loya-Castro arranged for Vicente Zambada-Niebla to meet with U.S. agents around March 2009 so that he could directly provide information to the DEA and secure a cooperation agreement with the U.S. government similar to the one Loya-Castro had, which led to the dismissal of the charges against him. DEA-Zambada In January 2009, Loya-Castro met with DEA agents to discuss the possibility of introducing Vicente Zambada-Niebla, who was interested in cooperating with the U.S. government, according to U.S. Prosecutor's document 109. The meeting with Zambada-Niebla originated from a contact made by DEA agent Manuel Castañón with Loya-Castro on January 30, 2009, in Mexico City, according to Castañón's own statement. \"During the meeting with CS (Loya-Castro), I believe agent Herrod and Carlos Mitchem, the regional director's assistant, were also present. CS told me that he/she had been instructed by Joaquín Guzmán Loera to meet with Zambada-Niebla. Guzmán Loera had informed CS that Ismael Zambada-García was interested in having his son, Zambada-Niebla, cooperate with the DEA,\" explained Castañón. At that time, agent Castañón learned that Zambada-Niebla had been indicted in the District Court of Columbia, so he told Loya-Castro that he would look into the possibility of a meeting with Zambada, but he could not make any promises about the value of the cooperation. Additionally, DEA agent Castañón mentioned that he was aware that the assistant U.S. attorney and agent Steve Fraga from the District Court of Columbia advised against making promises to Zambada-Niebla but suggested listening to what he had to say. \"From then on, I contacted my boss, the resident agent in charge at the Tijuana office. Agent Herrod also contacted his supervisor. Ultimately, DEA management authorized an initial meeting between the agents, CS (Loya-Castro), and Zambada-Niebla to assess the information he might provide,\" Castañón noted. Based on his discussions with agent Fraga and DEA management, Castañón said the initial meeting with Vicente Zambada-Niebla would be standard, aimed at exploring potential cooperation. \"It is common in an initial meeting with potential cooperating defendants that we attempt to obtain admissions of most of their possible criminal conduct, explore what types of information they might provide about the criminal conduct of others,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico.txt:6:134519eaca70", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15393, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "between the agents, CS (Loya-Castro), and Zambada-Niebla to assess the information he might provide,\" Castañón noted. Based on his discussions with agent Fraga and DEA management, Castañón said the initial meeting with Vicente Zambada-Niebla would be standard, aimed at exploring potential cooperation. \"It is common in an initial meeting with potential cooperating defendants that we attempt to obtain admissions of most of their possible criminal conduct, explore what types of information they might provide about the criminal conduct of others, make no promises to them, and speak as little as possible while listening as much as possible,\" Castañón specified. On March 10, 2009, Castañón spoke with Loya-Castro, saying, \"We discussed several locations for the meeting, but I insisted that any meeting should be held in Mexico City.\" Loya confirmed that Zambada-Niebla agreed, and March 15 was set for the meeting to take place on March 18. \"DEA agents in Mexico sought and obtained permission from DEA agents and prosecutors in Washington, DC, to conduct an introductory preliminary meeting with the defendant (Zambada-Niebla) to determine his interest in cooperating with the U.S. government and his viability. The agents arranged to meet with Loya-Castro and Zambada-Niebla in Mexico City on March 18, 2009,\" detailed the prosecution. On the afternoon of March 17, 2009, DEA agents Manuel Castañón and David Herrod flew to Mexico City and met with DEA agents from Washington D.C. and the U.S. embassy in Mexico to make arrangements for the meeting with Loya-Castro and Vicente Zambada-Niebla, it added. \"On March 17, 2009, around 3:30 p.m., I arrived in Mexico City with agent Herrod. We then met with agent Fraga (who I believe was with another agent) and DEA agents operating outside of Mexico City,\" reported agent Castañón. During the meeting, he recalled, \"One of the supervisors in Mexico City asked us if we had seen a recently published article in the Mexican newspaper 'El Porvenir' about DEA agents traveling to Mexico to meet with high-ranking members of drug traffickers. I warned them that I had not seen it.\" The prosecution stated that once at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico, David Gaddis, the director of the DEA's North and Central America region, met with agents Castañón and Herrod, expressing concern about U.S. agents meeting with a high-ranking member of the Sinaloa cartel like Zambada-Niebla, and instructed them not to meet until authorization was granted. According to Loya-Castro's statement to Zambada's defense, Manuel Castañón called him on the agreed day to inform him that the meeting was canceled \"because an article published in a newspaper indicated a possible leak related to the meeting.\" The article Gaddis referred to was from Friday, March 13, 2009, in the newspaper \"El Porvenir,\" which reported that a special DEA team had been sent to Mexican territory to seek meetings with drug lords from various cartels to negotiate their voluntary surrender to U.S. authorities.

The article cited \"high-level military and governmental sources\" who participated a week earlier in a meeting in Mexico City with Admiral Mike Mullen, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Mexican officials. The article went further to state that the Felipe Calderón government had authorized 62 U.S. anti-narcotics agents to operate in Mexico without Mexican authorities' oversight and without needing to report their activities to the Mexican government. It also mentioned that information about the cartels they met with was considered confidential and deemed national security by the U.S. government. While Agent Castañón insisted on canceling the meeting, Loya-Castro requested to address the matter personally and went to the Sheraton Hotel to explain that Zambada-Niebla had put himself at risk by traveling to Mexico City. The Sheraton Meeting At 11 p.m. on March 17, 2009, Agents Castañón and Herrod waited in the lobby of the Sheraton Hotel in Mexico City for Loya-Castro and then escorted him to their room, where they showed him the published article, reiterating that they could not meet with Zambada-Niebla without authorization. Loya-Castro became nervous and insisted that the meeting take place, as he was personally responsible for Zambada-Niebla and had committed to this with Ismael Zambada-García, according to Agent Castañón's statement. Subsequently, Loya-Castro told Castañón and Herrod that he would need to inform Zambada-Niebla of the change in plans and left the room at 12:15 a.m. on March 18, promising to return in 20 minutes. \"At approximately 12:30, Agent Herrod returned to the room, accompanied by Loya-Castro and Zambada-Niebla. Agent Herrod said that instead of having a discussion in the lobby (and because Agent Herrod does not speak Spanish), he went to the elevator followed by Loya-Castro and Zambada-Niebla,\" stated Castañón. Inside the Sheraton Hotel room, both Agent Herrod and Agent Castañón searched Loya-Castro and Zambada-Niebla for weapons and confiscated their cell phones, according to Agent Castañón's statement. \"On March 17, 2009, I met for about 30 minutes in a hotel room in Mexico City with Vicente Zambada-Niebla and two others-DEA Agent David Herrod and a cooperating source (CS) whom I have worked with since 2005. During the meeting on March 17, 2009, I spoke on behalf of the DEA. Agent Herrod does not speak Spanish,\" detailed Agent Castañón.

Initially, the drug agent informed Loya-Castro and Zambada-Niebla that he could not meet with them until he had approval from DEA Headquarters and showed them the newspaper article. \"Zambada-Niebla told me that he had driven from Guadalajara and that no one knew about the meeting except his father, Loya-Castro, and Guzmán Loera. He wanted to personally convey that he was serious about cooperating and was willing to do whatever it took to reach an agreement with the U.S. government,\" mentioned Castañón. In the following minutes, they discussed the charges against Zambada-Niebla in Washington, D.C., the legal process involving being a cooperating source in the United States, a potential future meeting in another country or the U.S., and that Agent Castañón could not make any promises or guarantees, the agent explained in his court testimony. \"Toward the end of the approximately 30 minutes, we returned to the fact that I was not supposed to have met with him, which could cause me problems. I was concerned about the repercussions with the DEA because I was not supposed to be meeting with Zambada-Niebla. I told him I would contact the CS (Loya-Castro) if we wanted to arrange a meeting. Then I told Zambada-Niebla and the CS that they should leave, and the meeting ended,\" added Agent Castañón. Hours after that meeting, the drug agent learned of Vicente Zambada-Niebla's arrest by Mexican army personnel in the Jardines del Pedregal neighborhood in Mexico City. \"The next day, three other DEA agents and I met with Zambada-Niebla in the prison where he was held. He reiterated his desire to cooperate. He said he did not want to be in Mexico. That was the last time I spoke with him,\" recounted Agent Castañón. For the agent, it was clear that with the authorization to meet with Zambada-Niebla in March 2009, and even before the appointment was canceled, \"we were tasked with having an initial meeting with him, listening to him, and not promising him anything.\" \"The only thing I authorized regarding Zambada-Niebla was that if Agent Steve Fraga went to Mexico in March 2009 in an attempt to interview Zambada-Niebla and obtain admissions from him,\" stated Patrick H. Hearn, then Assistant U.S. Attorney, Criminal Division, Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Section (NDDS). Prosecutor Hearn said in his Chicago court testimony that he regarded Zambada-Niebla as \"a significant drug trafficker and an important member of the Sinaloa cartel.\" The authorization for the meeting was partly because Agent Fraga informed Prosecutor Hearn that Loya-Castro \"had provided information that led to the seizure of 23 tons", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico.txt:9:82776f5db76f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15396, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "March 2009 in an attempt to interview Zambada-Niebla and obtain admissions from him,\" stated Patrick H.

The U.S. attorneys were warned by DEA Agent Manuel Castañón, via Loya-Castro, that if they proceeded, \"many people would be exposed, potentially causing harm to Loya-Castro, his family, Mayo, El Chapo, and even the U.S. attorneys would be at risk,\" according to attorney Gaxiola's statement. Additionally, they were informed that if Castañón's \"relationship with the Sinaloa Cartel, and with the U.S. government was exposed, and if Mr. Loya-Castro's activities of providing information about other rival cartels were exposed, it would not only be bad for him but for the U.S. government as well, as they did not want anyone to know about their relationship with the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel,\" mentioned Gaxiola. The use of members of criminal organizations against others by U.S. authorities is done more frequently than it should be, explained Robert Mazur, a retired DEA agent who participated undercover in a financial operation against the Medellín cartel. \"We need to be very careful when using high-level individuals against other criminal organizations,\" Mazur said, referring to the case of Whitey Bulger, the Boston mafia boss who manipulated U.S. federal agents by providing information about rival Italian mafia organizations. At the beginning of the current administration, the number of DEA agents in Mexico decreased, as did the number of Mexican police assigned to \"Sensitive Investigation Units\" (SIU) operating in Mexican territory and directed by drug agents. However, it is unclear whether the DEA still maintains contacts with drug cartels in search of sensitive information.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__secret-war-of-dea-in-mexico.txt:10:3a40ba358014", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15397, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__sneak-preview-military-intelligence-information-center.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__sneak-preview-military-intelligence-information-center", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Sneak Preview of the New Military-Intelligence Corruption Information Center *When scientific power outruns moral power, we end up with guided missiles and misguided men*. - Martin Luther King Jr. Over the last 20+ years, WantToKnow.info has summarized over a thousand news articles on deep corruption within our military and intelligence systems. Going deeper, we have gathered a comprehensive collection of verifiable resources, videos, books, and declassified government documents.** Next week, we'll be launching the WantToKnow.info Military-Intelligence Corruption Information Center!** Tasked with ensuring public safety and national security, the US military and intelligence apparatus receives billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars each year. Yet too often, many national security decisions aren't in the best interests of American society or global populations. The Department of Defense (DoD) is America's largest government agency with a trillion dollar defense budget, yet it's never passed a single audit mandated by Congress. Meanwhile, the US military industrial complex continues to grow and surge with ever larger budgets, more expansive missions, and increasingly sophisticated technologies. Conflict, war, and perceived national security threats provide a common focus for military and CIA partnership. Military activity is heavily informed by CIA intelligence, and public support for this activity is secured by pro-war narratives and voices flooding our media system. What we hear in the news is often quite different than what is really going on behind closed doors and on the battlefields. The mainstream press often downplays how ineffective, harmful, and wasteful our current national security strategy is. Sadly, much of the massive defense budget doesn't go to those fighting on the battlegrounds. The Pentagon has spent billions of dollars on complicated weapons systems that [don't work, are unproven, or don't have enough humans to power them](https://www.pogo.org/issue/enhancing-military-effectiveness). Over the past century, the CIA's covert actions have led to countless deaths, human rights abuses, and the undemocratic toppling of numerous foreign governments. While entrenched bureaucracy may be responsible for some of these government agency failings, deeper covert actions within our government have led to chaos and suffering in America and all over the world. Major cover-ups and horrific crimes within the military-intelligence complex continue to remain largely hidden from public awareness. In this information center, we'll present a sobering investigation into the US war machine: what it is, who benefits, and who pays the price. The true impacts of US military-intelligence activities in countries all over the world are examined, from World War II to our present moment in time. **We have identified 16 key areas of focus to understanding military-intelligence corruption: ** Unaccountable Military Spending Arms Industry Corruption Human Rights Abuses and the Murder of Innocent Civilians Environmental Harms Emerging Warfare Technology Non-Lethal Weapons Harms Mission Creep Torture Programs Throughout History Media and Government Lies to Justify War Wikileaks War as a Tool for Economic Interests Rise of the CIA MKUltra Program Who's Behind the War on Drugs?

Yet this didn't reflect the shocking reality that the CIA was covertly protecting drug traffickers while profiting enormously from the drug trade. Consider this excerpt of a statement from [25-year veteran of the DEA Michael Levine](https://www.wanttoknow.info/massmedia#levine): *The CIA and the Department of State were protecting more and more politically powerful drug traffickers around the world: the Mujihadeen in Afghanistan, the Bolivian cocaine cartels, the top levels of Mexican government, Nicaraguan Contras, Colombian drug dealers and politicians, and others. **Media's duties, as I experienced firsthand, were twofold: first, to keep quiet about the gush of drugs that was allowed to flow unimpeded into the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__sneak-preview-military-intelligence-information-center.txt:1:b1dbd207a8d0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15399, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__sneak-preview-military-intelligence-information-center.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__sneak-preview-military-intelligence-information-center", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "this excerpt of a statement from [25-year veteran of the DEA Michael Levine](https://www.wanttoknow.info/massmedia#levine): *The CIA and the Department of State were protecting more and more politically powerful drug traffickers around the world: the Mujihadeen in Afghanistan, the Bolivian cocaine cartels, the top levels of Mexican government, Nicaraguan Contras, Colombian drug dealers and politicians, and others. **Media's duties, as I experienced firsthand, were twofold: first, to keep quiet about the gush of drugs that was allowed to flow unimpeded into the US; second, to divert the public's attention by shilling them into believing the drug war was legitimate by falsely presenting the few trickles we were permitted to indict as though they were major \"victories,\" when in fact we were doing nothing more than getting rid of the inefficient competitors of CIA assets.*** When the CIA was experimenting drugs on people in its [MKULTRA program](https://www.wanttoknow.info/050626mkultra), it enlisted a former federal narcotics agent named George White to run [Operation Midnight Climax](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/cia-lsd-sex-climax). In a letter to his former employer reflecting on his career, [White is quoted](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/mission_mind_control_documentary) as saying, **\"It was fun, fun, fun.

[**Webb's courageous reporting**](https://www.wanttoknow.info/massmedia#webb)** drew a straight line from the crack cocaine epidemic in California to a Latin American guerrilla army run by the CIA**. Using recently declassified documents, FBI reports, and DEA undercover tapes, he uncovers how covert elements within our government wreaked havoc on American society, especially African-American communities, in the form of rampant drug addiction that the War on Drugs has failed to address. In fact, the War on Drugs has been considered to be a \"[trillion dollar failure](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--war-drugs-trilliondollar-failure)\" that has led to mass incarceration and [thousands of murders and human rights abuses](https://www.newsweek.com/global-war-drugs-has-been-spectacular-failure-1181831). Behind closed doors, the CIA saw Webb's landmark reporting [as a \"nightmare.\"](https://theintercept.com/2014/09/25/managing-nightmare-cia-media-destruction-gary-webb/) But they didn't have to do much damage control directly, as the mainstream press ferociously went after Webb's reporting. *Thanks in part to what author Nicholas Dujmovic, a CIA Directorate of Intelligence staffer at the time of publication, describes as \"a ground base of already productive relations with journalists,\" the CIA's Public Affairs officers watched with relief as the largest newspapers in the country rescued the agency from disaster, and, in the process, destroyed the reputation of an aggressive, award-winning reporter.* - Excerpt from *The Intercept*, \"[How the CIA Watched Over", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__sneak-preview-military-intelligence-information-center.txt:2:4cb650d0770e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15400, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__sneak-preview-military-intelligence-information-center.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__sneak-preview-military-intelligence-information-center", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "the mainstream press ferociously went after Webb's reporting. *Thanks in part to what author Nicholas Dujmovic, a CIA Directorate of Intelligence staffer at the time of publication, describes as \"a ground base of already productive relations with journalists,\" the CIA's Public Affairs officers watched with relief as the largest newspapers in the country rescued the agency from disaster, and, in the process, destroyed the reputation of an aggressive, award-winning reporter.* - Excerpt from *The Intercept*, \"[How the CIA Watched Over the Destruction of Gary Webb](https://theintercept.com/2014/09/25/managing-nightmare-cia-media-destruction-gary-webb/)\" Once his reputation was destroyed, Gary Webb died.

Whether he took his own life or not, the powers that be were clearly allied against him. Using 9/11 as a pretext for invasion, the US government transformed Afghanistan from a place where heroin production was banned by the Taliban into a [total narco state](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/afghanistan-the-making-of-a-narco-state-48475/) that became the world's biggest source of heroine. *Afghanistan's transformation into a preeminent narco-state owes a significant debt to Washington's actions. Poppy cultivation in the 1970s was relatively limited. However, the tide changed in 1979 with the inception of Operation Cyclone, a massive infusion of funds to Afghan Mujahideen factions aimed at exhausting the Soviet military. The U.S. directed billions toward the insurgents, yet their financial needs persisted. Consequently, the Mujahideen delved into the illicit drug trade. By the culmination of Operation Cyclone, Afghanistan's opium production had soared twentyfold.* - Excerpt from *MintPress News*, \"[Taliban's Massively Successful Opium Eradication Raises Questions About What US Was Doing All Along](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-talibans-massively-successful-opium-eradication-raises-questions-about-what-us-was-doing-all-along)\" **The War on Drugs is a racket designed in part to increase the price of drugs so intelligence agencies can fund black budget projects. **The illicit drug trade fueled by the US government will likely create serious blowback in the coming years as the deadly drug addiction epidemic marches, impacting millions of lives across the country.

That is a huge amount of cocaine. But it was hardly a first. **The agency has never been above using individuals or organizations with known links to drug trafficking.

Nowhere, however, was the CIA more closely tied to drug traffic than it was in Pakistan during the Afghan War. As its principal conduit for arms and money to the Afghan guerrillas, the agency chose the Pakistan military's Inter-Services Intelligence Bureau. The ISI in turn steered the CIA's support toward [an Islamic fundamentalist who] received almost half of the agency's financial support during the war. But many of his commanders were also major heroin traffickers. Soon the trucks that delivered arms to the guerrillas in Afghanistan were coming back ... full of heroin. The heroin traffic blossomed in the shadows of a CIA-sustained guerrilla war. The conflict and its aftermath have given the world another Golden Triangle: the Golden Crescent, sweeping through Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of the former Soviet Union.

Titled \"Dark Alliance\"...the three-part series by reporter Gary Webb linked the CIA and Nicaragua's Contras to the crack cocaine epidemic that ripped through South Los Angeles in the 1980s. Most of the nation's elite newspapers at first ignored the story. A public uproar, especially among urban African Americans, forced them to respond. What followed was one of the most bizarre, unseemly and ultimately tragic scandals in the annals of American journalism. Top news organizations closed ranks to debunk claims Webb never made, ridicule assertions that turned out to be true and ignore corroborating evidence when it came to light. The whole shameful cycle was repeated when Webb committed suicide in December 2004.

He resigned a few months later. **Meanwhile, spurred on by Webb's story, the CIA conducted an internal investigation that acknowledged in March 1998 that the agency had covered up Contra drug trafficking for more than a decade.** History will tell if Webb receives the credit he's due for prodding the CIA to acknowledge its shameful collaboration with drug dealers. **Note: **Many thanks to the *Los Angeles Times* for the courage to report this story.

But his central thesis - that the CIA, having participated in narcotics trafficking in central America, had, at best, turned a blind eye to the activities of drug dealers in LA - has never been in question. [A 1998] CIA Inspector General's report, commissioned in response to the allegations in \"Dark Alliance\" ... found that CIA officials ignored information about possible Contra drug dealing; that they continued to work with Contra supporters despite allegations that they were trafficking drugs, and further asserted that officials from the CIA instructed Drug Enforcement Agency officers to refrain from investigating alleged dealers connected with the Contras. **Note: **For those interested in the Gary Webb story, this article is possibly the best single summary out there.

For years, García Luna was the U.S. government's most trusted ally in the war on drugs**. As public security secretary, he wielded incredible power, overseeing Mexico's Federal Police, the prison network, and a vast intelligence-gathering infrastructure, while working with the Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, CIA, and Department of Homeland Security in the fight against Mexican cartels. The case portrayed García Luna and his network of corrupt officials as a handful of bad apples, and what U.S. officials knew about García Luna's illicit activities went mostly unexplored, despite the government's role in providing funding, equipment, and training that has fueled drug-related violence. García Luna was found guilty of all five charges, including drug trafficking and continuing a criminal enterprise. Prosecutors alleged that he received around [$274 million in bribes](https://www.milenio.com/policia/defensa-garcia-luna-insiste-falta-evidencia-fisica) from the cartel from 2001 to 2012, first as head of the Federal Investigative Agency, the Mexican equivalent of the FBI, and then as secretary of public security.

To even raise the question amid all the officially inspired hysteria is heretical. Yet a brilliant new BBC film produced by one of Britain's leading documentary filmmakers systematically challenges this. \"The Power of Nightmares: The Rise of the Politics of Fear\" ... argues coherently that much of what we have been told about the threat of international terrorism \"is a fantasy that has been exaggerated and distorted by politicians. It is a dark illusion that has spread unquestioned ... around the world.\" Why have we heard so much frightening talk about \"dirty bombs\" when experts say it is panic rather than radioactivity that would kill people? Why did Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld claim on \"Meet the Press\" in 2001 that Al Qaeda controlled massive high-tech cave complexes in Afghanistan, when British and U.S. military forces later found no such thing? **The film ... directly challenges the conventional wisdom by making a powerful case that the Bush administration, led by a tight-knit cabal of Machiavellian neoconservatives, has seized upon the false image of a unified international terrorist threat to replace the expired Soviet empire in order to push a political agenda.** \"The nightmare vision of a uniquely powerful hidden organization waiting to strike our societies is an illusion. Wherever one looks for this Al Qaeda organization, from the mountains of Afghanistan to the 'sleeper cells' in America, the British and Americans are chasing a phantom enemy.\" **Note:** If above link fails, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050111latimes).

The plans were developed as ways to trick the American public and the international community into supporting a war to oust Cuba's ... Fidel Castro. America's top military brass even contemplated causing U.S. military casualties, writing: \"We could blow up a U.S. ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba,\" and, \"casualty lists in U.S. newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation.\" The plans had the written approval of all of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and were presented to President Kennedy's defense secretary, Robert McNamara, in March 1962. But they apparently were rejected by the civilian leadership and have gone undisclosed for nearly 40 years. The Joint Chiefs even proposed using the potential death of astronaut John Glenn during the first attempt to put an American into orbit as a false pretext for war with Cuba. Should the rocket explode and kill Glenn, they wrote, \"the objective is to provide irrevocable proof ... that the fault lies with the Communists.\" The scary thing is none of this stuff comes out until 40 years after. **Note:** Many military and political leaders tend to look at the world as a [chess board](https://www.WantToKnow.info/brzezinskigrandchessboard).

The declassified document is called \"Information Operations Roadmap\". It was obtained by the [National Security Archive](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB177/index.htm) at George Washington University using the Freedom of Information Act. Officials in the Pentagon wrote it in 2003. The Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, signed it. The operations described in the document include a surprising range of military activities: public affairs officers who brief journalists, psychological operations troops who try to manipulate the thoughts and beliefs of an enemy, computer network attack specialists who seek to destroy enemy networks. The military's psychological operations, or [Psyops](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060123psyops), is finding its way onto the computer and television screens of ordinary Americans. \"Psyops messages will often be replayed by the news media for much larger audiences, including the American public. Strategy should be based on the premise that the Department [of Defense] will 'fight the net' as it would an enemy weapons system,\" it reads. The document recommends that the United States should seek the ability to \"provide maximum control of the entire electromagnetic spectrum\". **US forces should be able to \"disrupt or destroy the full spectrum of globally emerging communications systems, sensors, and weapons systems dependent on the electromagnetic spectrum\".** The fact that the \"Information Operations Roadmap\" is approved by the Secretary of Defense suggests that these plans are taken very seriously indeed in the Pentagon. **Connections And Then Some** **2003-03-14, *Washington Post*** [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A25...](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A25406-2003Mar14) The Carlyle Group [is] an investment house famous as one of the most well-connected companies anywhere.

Former secretary of state James Baker is senior counselor, former White House budget chief Richard Darman is a partner, former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt is senior adviser -- the list goes on. Those associations have brought Carlyle enormous success. The Washington-based merchant bank controls nearly $14 billion in investments, making it the largest private equity manager in the world. It buys and sells whole companies the way some firms trade shares of stock. But the connections also have cost Carlyle. It has developed a reputation as the CIA of the business world -- omnipresent, powerful, a little sinister. Media outlets from the Village Voice to [BusinessWeek](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_07/b4021001.htm) have depicted Carlyle as manipulating the levers of government from shadowy back rooms. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) even suggested that Carlyle's and Bush's ties to the Middle East made them somehow complicitous in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. **It didn't help that as the World Trade Center burned on Sept. 11, 2001, the news interrupted a Carlyle business conference at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel here attended by a brother of Osama bin Laden.

Goss, the former Republican House member (and chairman of the Intelligence Committee) who recently was appointed CIA chief. The official stressed that the report was more blunt and more specific than the earlier bipartisan reports produced by the Bush-appointed Sept. 11 commission and Congress. \"The report found very senior-level officials responsible.\" By law, the only legitimate reason the CIA director has for holding back such a report is national security. None of this should surprise us given the Bush administration's great determination since 9/11 to resist any serious investigation. The president fought against the creation of the Sept. 11 commission, for example, agreeing only after enormous political pressure was applied by a grass-roots movement led by the families of those slain. And then Bush refused to testify to the commission under oath. Instead he deigned only to chat with the commission members, with Vice President Dick Cheney present, in a White House meeting in which commission members were not allowed to take notes. **Note: ** If the above link fails, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/cia911secret).

The identities of four of the 19 suspects accused of having carried out the attacks are now in doubt. Saudi Arabian pilot Waleed Al Shehri was one of five men that the FBI said had deliberately crashed American Airlines flight 11 into the World Trade Centre on 11 September. His photograph was released, and has since appeared in newspapers and on television around the world. He told journalists there that he had nothing to do with the attacks. He has contacted both the Saudi and American authorities. **He acknowledges that he attended flight training school at Daytona Beach in the United States, and is indeed the same Waleed Al Shehri to whom the FBI has been referring. But, he says, he left the United States in September last year** [and] became a pilot with Saudi Arabian airlines. Abdulaziz Al Omari, another of the Flight 11 hijack suspects ... says he is an engineer with Saudi Telecoms, and that he lost his passport while studying in Denver. Meanwhile ... a London-based Arabic daily says it has interviewed Saeed Alghamdi. He was listed by the FBI as a hijacker in the United flight that crashed in Pennsylvania. And there are suggestions that another suspect, Khalid Al Midhar, may also be alive.

In the past 24 hours, however, a handful of intelligence and counter-terrorism officials have briefed Reuters and *The New York Times* on the decision. The authorisation ... and the decision to make it public is a high-risk strategy. Tina Foster, of the US-based [International Justice Network](http://www.ijnetwork.org/), told The Times: \"It is shocking that our Government would go to these extremes, even depriving someone of their life without a legal process.\" The policy of targeted killings is controversial. President Ford issued an order in 1976 banning political assassinations. Yet Congress approved the use of force against al-Qaeda after the September 11 attacks. **Note:** Obama is the first president to publicly order the assassination an American citizen. Neither George W. Bush nor Dick Cheney asserted such a power on the part of the president. **David Kelly death evidence 'to be kept secret for 70 years'** **2010-01-25, *Telegraph* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7066383/David-Kelly-death-evidence-to-...](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7066383/David-Kelly-death-evidence-to-be-kept-secret-for-70-years.html) A highly unusual ruling by Lord Hutton, who chaired the inquiry into Dr Kelly's death, means medical records including the post-mortem report will remain classified until after all those with a direct interest in the case are dead. And a 30-year secrecy order has been placed on written records provided to Lord Hutton's inquiry which were not produced in evidence.

But ... the inquiry focused more on the question of how the BBC report came to be broadcast than on the medical explanation for Dr Kelly's death. Lord Hutton's report in 2004 concluded that Dr Kelly killed himself by cutting an artery in his wrist. But the finding has been challenged by doctors who claim that the weapons inspector's stated injuries were not serious enough. **Note:** For a cache of illuminating reports on government secrecy, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secrecynewsarticles). **Meet Mikey, 8: U.S. Has Him on Watch List** **2010-01-14, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/nyregion/14watchlist.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/nyregion/14watchlist.html) The Transportation Security Administration ... has on its web site a \"mythbuster\" that tries to reassure the public. Myth: The No-Fly list includes an 8-year-old boy. Buster: No 8-year-old is on a T.S.A. watch list. \"Meet Mikey Hicks,\" said Najlah Feanny Hicks, introducing her 8-year-old son, a New Jersey Cub Scout and frequent traveler who has seldom boarded a plane without a hassle because he shares the name of a suspicious person. \"It's not a myth.\" Hicks's mother initially sensed trouble when he was a baby and she could not get a seat for him on their flight to Florida at an airport kiosk; airline officials explained that his name \"was on the list,\" she recalled. **The first time he was patted down, at Newark Liberty International Airport, Mikey was 2.** He cried. After years of long delays and waits for supervisors at every airport ticket counter, this year's vacation to the Bahamas badly shook up the family. Mikey was frisked on the way there, then more aggressively on the way home. **\"Up your arms, down your arms, up your crotch - someone is patting your 8-year-old down like he's a criminal,\"** Mrs. Hicks recounted. It is true that Mikey is not on the federal government's \"no-fly\" list, which includes about 2,500 people, less than 10 percent of them from the United States.

This specially designed secret weapon is a pistol which shoots a small poison dart to cause a heart attack, as explained in Congressional testimony in a short video clip below from the powerful documentary *[Secrets of the CIA](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/secrets_cia)*. The dart from this secret CIA weapon penetrates clothing and leaves nothing but a tiny red dot on the skin. **On penetration of the deadly dart, the individual targeted for assassination may feel as if bitten by a mosquito, or they may not feel anything at all.** The poisonous dart completely disintegrates upon entering the target. To watch a one-minute video on this top secret weapon with testimony taken both from a CIA employee and at a Congressional investigation, click below. [**Click here for one-minute video of top secret dart gun**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/cia_secret_weapon) On penetration of the dart, the lethal poison rapidly enters the bloodstream causing a heart attack. Once the damage is done, the poison denatures quickly, so that an autopsy is very unlikely to detect that the heart attack resulted from anything other than natural causes. Sounds like the perfect James Bond weapon, doesn't it? Yet all of this is verifiable in Congressional testimony. The astonishing information about this top secret weapon of the CIA comes from U.S. Senate testimony in 1975 on rogue activities of the CIA. **This weapon is only one of many James Bond-like discoveries of the [Church Committee hearings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee), officially known as the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities.** Could this or a similar secret weapon have been used, for instance, in the death of 52-year-old Mark Pittman, a reporter who predicted the 2008 financial crisis and exposed Federal Reserve misdoings?

Yet his 1934 testimony to Congress on this was squelched. As reported in [*Harper's*Magazine](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-1934-plot-against-america) in 2007: \"A story in the [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/1934/11/21/archives/gen-butler-bares-fascist-plot-to-seize-government-by-force-says.html) and several other newspapers reported on [Butler's alleged coup], and a special Congressional committee was created to conduct an investigation. The records of this committee were scrubbed and sealed away in the National Archives, where they have only recently been made available.\" Why isn't this part of what we study in history books? Could it be because Gen. Butler, once an ardent supporter of war, eventually exposed major war corruption he personally experienced in his highly esteemed, yet little-known book *War is a Racket*?

It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.** In the World War [World War I] a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict. At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the World War. That many admitted huge gains in their income tax returns. How many other war millionaires falsified their tax returns no one knows. *[Please note these are 1935 U.S. dollars. To adjust for inflation, multiply all figures [X 20 or more](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm)]* **WHO MAKES THE PROFITS?** The World War cost the United States some $52 billion. That means $400 [*over $6,000 in today's dollars*] to every American man, woman, and child. **The normal yearly profits of a business concern in the U.S. are 6 to 12%. But war-time profits, that is another matter - 60, 100, 300, and even 1,800% - the sky is the limit.** Uncle Sam has the money. Let's get it. Of course, it isn't put that crudely in war time. It is dressed into speeches about patriotism, love of country, and \"we must all put our shoulders to the wheel,\" but the profits jump, leap, and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-corruption.txt:0:c75052a804cf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15424, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-corruption", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "child. **The normal yearly profits of a business concern in the U.S. are 6 to 12%.

It is dressed into speeches about patriotism, love of country, and \"we must all put our shoulders to the wheel,\" but the profits jump, leap, and skyrocket - and are safely pocketed. Take our friends the du Ponts, the powder people. The average pre-war earnings of the du Ponts for the period 1910 to 1914 were $6 million a year. Now let's look at their average yearly profit during the war years, 1914 to 1918. $58 million a year profit we find! Nearly ten times that of normal times, and the profits of normal times were pretty good. An increase in profits of more than 950%. Take one of our steel companies. Their 1910-1914 yearly earnings averaged $6 million. Then came the war. And, like loyal citizens, Bethlehem Steel promptly turned to munitions making. Did their profits jump? Well, their 1914-1918 average was $49 million a year! Or, let's take United States Steel. The normal earnings during the five-year period prior to the war were $105 million a year. Then along came the war and up went the profits. The average yearly profit for the period 1914-1918 was $240 million. Not bad. **They sold your Uncle Sam 20 million mosquito nets for the use of the soldiers overseas. Well, not one of these mosquito nets ever got to France!** There were pretty good profits in mosquito netting, even if there were no mosquitoes in France. When the war was over some 4 million sets of equipment - knapsacks and the things that go to fill them - crammed warehouses on this side. Now they are being scrapped because the regulations have changed the contents. But the manufacturers collected their wartime profits on them. If anyone had the cream of the profits it was the bankers. Being partnerships rather than incorporated organizations, they do not have to report to stockholders. Their profits were as secret as they were immense. **How the bankers made their millions and their billions I do not know, because [those little secrets](https://www.WantToKnow.info/financialbankingcoverup) never become public - even before a Senate investigatory body.** It has been estimated that the war cost your Uncle Sam $52 billion [*over $1 trillion in today's dollars*]. Of this sum, $39 billion was expended in the actual war itself. This expenditure yielded $16 billion in profits. That is how the 21,000 billionaires and millionaires got that way. This $16 billion in profits is not to be sneezed at. It is quite a tidy sum.

And it went to a very few. **WHO PAYS THE BILLS?** Who provides these nice little profits of 20, 100, 300, 1,500 and 1,800 per cent? We all pay them - in taxation. But **the soldier pays the biggest part of the bill**. If you don't believe this, visit the American cemeteries on the battlefields abroad. Or visit any of the veteran's hospitals in the United States. On a tour of the country, I visited 18 government hospitals for veterans. In them are a total of about 50,000 destroyed men - men who were the pick of the nation 18 years ago. Mortality among veterans is three times as great as those who stayed at home. Boys with a normal viewpoint were taken out of the offices, factories, and classrooms and put into the ranks. There they were remolded. **They were made to \"about face,\" to regard murder as the order of the day.** They were put through mass psychology and entirely changed. We trained them to think nothing at all of killing or of being killed. Then, suddenly, we discharged them and told them to make another \"about face!\" This time they had to do their own readjustment. We didn't need them any more. Many of these fine young boys are eventually destroyed, mentally, because they could not make that final \"about face\" alone. Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die. **This was the \"war to end all wars.\" This was the \"war to make the world safe for democracy.\"** No one mentioned to them that their going and their dying would mean huge war profits. No one told these American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their own brothers here. No one told them that their ships might be torpedoed by submarines built with United States patents. They were just told it was to be a \"glorious adventure.\" **HOW TO SMASH THIS RACKET!** Well, it's a racket, all right. A few profit - and the many pay. But there is a way to stop it. You can't end it by disarmament conferences. You can't eliminate it by peace parleys at Geneva. Well-meaning but impractical groups can't wipe it out by resolutions. Steps must be taken to smash the war racket. **We must take the profit out of war**. And we must limit our military forces to home defense purposes.

I am not a fool as to believe that war is a thing of the past. I know the people do not want war, but there is no use in saying we cannot be pushed into another war. **Woodrow Wilson was re-elected president in 1916 on a platform that he had \"kept us out of war.\" Yet, five months later he asked Congress to declare war on Germany.** In that five-month interval the people had not been asked whether they had changed their minds. Then what caused our government to change its mind so suddenly? Money. An allied commission came over shortly before the war declaration and called on the President. The President summoned a group of advisers. The head of the commission spoke. Stripped of its diplomatic language, this is what he told the President and his group: \"There is no use kidding ourselves any longer. The cause of the allies is lost. We now owe you (American bankers, American munitions makers, American manufacturers, American speculators, American exporters) five or six billion dollars. If we lose (and without the help of the US we must lose) we, England, France and Italy, cannot pay back this money. So...\" **Had secrecy been outlawed as far as war negotiations, and had the press been invited to be present at that conference, America never would have entered the war.** But this conference, like all war discussions, was shrouded in utmost secrecy. When our boys were sent off, they were told it was a \"war to make the world safe for democracy\" and a \"war to end all wars.\" Very little has been accomplished to assure us that the World War was really the war to end all wars. Disarmament conferences don't mean a thing. At all these conferences, lurking in the background are the sinister agents of those who profit by war. They see to it that these conferences do not seriously limit armaments. So ...

A full transcript is included on this page with links to verify the claims made. [**https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/war/war-lies**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/war/war-lies) One of the most decorated generals in American history, Smedley Butler, learned how he had been grossly deceived after serving in World War I. He went on to write the landmark treatise *War is a Racket*, which details the incredible lies and deception he uncovered.

[**Declassified documents on Operation Northwoods**](https://www.wanttoknow.info/010501operationnorthwoods)** from the early 1960s further show that the Pentagon's top generals were willing to blow up their own warship and orchestrate terrorist attacks in U.S. cities only to then blame these heinous acts on Cuba as a pretext for going to war.** These are but two among countless examples not included in the video of how the public is duped into supporting the military-industrial complex.

From false flag attacks to dehumanization of the \"enemy,\" here are all the examples you'll need to help debunk a century of war lies. This is The Corbett Report. **World War I** In 1915, the RMS Lusitania, a British ocean liner en route from New York to Liverpool, was sunk by a German U-boat 11 miles off the coast of Ireland. The ship's sinking, which resulted in the death of 128 of the 139 Americans aboard, became a symbol of German evil and helped psychologically prepare the US public for their country's eventual entry into WWI. But **every facet of the story of the Lusitania as it has been presented to the public was a deliberate lie or a lie by omission.** The boat was *not* a purely civilian vessel carrying 3,813 40-pound (unrefrigerated) containers of \"cheese\" and 696 containers of \"butter,\" as the [official manifest](http://www.rmslusitania.info/downloads/crossing202_supplementary_cargo_manifest.pdf) held, but guncotton, in keeping with the shipment's [stated destination](http://www.lusitania.net/deadlycargo.htm): the Royal Navy's Weapons Testing Establishment. It was *not* sunk by the German torpedo boat but by secondary explosions from [the munitions the ship was (illegally) carrying](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97350149). It was *not* the victim of a cowardly German surprise attack (the German Embassy placed a [warning notice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lusitania_warning.jpg) about the Lusitania in 50 American newspapers right next to Cunard's own listings). And **the American ambassador to England at the time, Walter Hines Page, wrote to his son five days before the ship was sunk, [asking](https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=m70fBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA95&dq=%22%E2%80%9CIf+a+British+liner+full+of+American+passengers+be+blown+up,+what+will+Uncle+Sam+do?%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIkI38h7_cAhWKVLwKHSNsD_EQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=%22%E2%80%9CIf%20a%20British%20liner%20full%20of%20American%20passengers%20be%20blown%20up%2C%20what%20will%20Uncle%20Sam%20do%3F%22&f=false): \"If a British liner full of American passengers be blown up, what will Uncle Sam do? That's what's going to happen.\"** So what did the official cover-up of the incident conclude? That the dastardly Germans had waged a perfidious sneak attack on an innocent peace boat, of course. And the rest, as they say, is history. **World War II** A little over two decades later, America's entry into WWII came when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, killing over 2,400 American servicemen and civilians. But far from an unprovoked sneak attack, as the official government-approved history would have you believe, **Pearl Harbor is best understood as a conspiracy to motivate the American public for war by first provoking and then allowing a Japanese strike on American targets.** This is not even a controversial idea; it was commonly understood and discussed by many in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-lies-century.txt:1:c7428666c6d8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15430, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-lies-century.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-lies-century", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "America's entry into WWII came when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, killing over 2,400 American servicemen and civilians.

In late 1940, Roosevelt ordered the United States Fleet to be [relocated from San Pedro to Pearl Harbor](https://12-7-9-11.blogspot.com/2009/03/by-special-request-move-to-hawaii_11.html). The order incensed Admiral James Richardson, Commander-in-Chief of the US Fleet, who complained bitterly to FDR about the nonsensical decision: It left the fleet open to attack from every direction, it created a 2,000-mile-long supply chain that was vulnerable to disruption, and it packed the ships in together at Pearl Harbor, where they would be sitting ducks in the event of a bombing or torpedo raid. FDR, unable to counter these objections, went ahead with the plan and relieved Richardson of his command. Then in June 1941, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes wrote [a memo](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/trachtenberg/methbk/ickes.pdf) advising FDR to embargo Japanese oil in order to goad them into war: \"There might develop from the embargoing of oil to Japan such a situation as would make it, not only possible but easy, to get into this war in an effective way.\" Roosevelt followed through weeks later with an order seizing Japanese assets in America and effectively [preventing Japan from purchasing much-needed American oil](https://www.salon.com/2013/12/05/oil_led_to_pearl_harbor/), which at that time accounted for [four-fifths of Japanese oil imports](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3638003?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). The provocations had their intended effect, and the Americans listened in on Japanese war preparations via radio. They received warnings of an imminent attack from diplomatic officials and military attachés. **The attack was even predicted by the *Honolulu Advertiser* days before it happened. But all of these warnings were ignored. Even today, nearly 80 years after the events, new documents and memos [continue to be found](https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2011/11/29/declassified-memo-hinted-of-1941-hawaii-attack-) showing more warnings that Roosevelt and his administration deliberately ignored in the run-up to the attack.** FDR got his wish.

The Japanese attack was successful: 2,400 Americans died, and the nation, outraged, responded by rallying around the flag and jumping enthusiastically into war. But the Japanese themselves were no innocents when it came to lying their way into war. Ten years before Pearl Harbor, in 1931, Japan was looking for a pretext to invade Manchuria. On September 18th of that year, a lieutenant in the Imperial Japanese Army detonated a small amount of TNT along a Japanese-owned railway in the Manchurian city of Mukden. The act was blamed on Chinese dissidents and used to [justify the invasion and occupation of Manchuria](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D9VZH5Fi_4). When the lie was later exposed, Japan was diplomatically shunned and forced to withdraw from the League of Nations. **The Korean War ** The League of Nations fell apart precisely for its inability to prevent World War II. Its successor organization, the United Nations, engaged in its own war lies shortly after its creation to ensure that it would not meet the same fate. The Korean War, waged under the UN flag and sold to the public as a virtuous mission to save the South from the North's communist aggression, was on its face a war that should never have happened. **The division of Korea into North and South was not the organic decision of the Korean people, but a plan that originated in [an article](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/1944-04-01/korea-postwar-world) in 1944 in *Foreign Affairs*, the journal of the Council on Foreign Relations, which suggested dividing the country up and putting its administration in the hands of the Allies, including the Soviets. **When the newly-founded UN put that plan into action in 1945, Korea was arbitrarily divided along the 38th parallel, with the US administering the South and the Soviet Union administering the North. Neither was the war itself the organic result of decisions taken by the Korean people. In 1949, Owen Lattimore, a member of the Carnegie and Rockefeller-funded Institute for Pacific Relations and an advisor to the State Department on East Asian issues, [wrote](https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=ds5VAAAAYAAJ&q=%22The+thing+to+do+is+let+South+Korea+fall,+but+not+to+let+it+look+as+if+we+pushed+it%22&dq=%22The+thing+to+do+is+let+South+Korea+fall,+but+not+to+let+it+look+as+if+we+pushed+it%22&hl=ja&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj91t3bjr7cAhVKEbwKHUhUCZUQ6AEINjAC): \"The thing to do is let South Korea fall, but not to let it look as if we pushed it.\" In a [speech at the National Press Club](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/1950-01-12.pdf) the following year, Secretary of State Dean Acheson placed Korea outside of the US' \"defensive perimeter of the Pacific,\" stating that any attack that took place outside of that perimeter would have to be dealt with \"under the Charter of the United Nations.\" Taking this as a green light, the North Koreans, heavily fortified and equipped", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-lies-century.txt:3:b06164682bf4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15432, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-lies-century.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-lies-century", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "is let South Korea fall, but not to let it look as if we pushed it.\" In a [speech at the National Press Club](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/1950-01-12.pdf) the following year, Secretary of State Dean Acheson placed Korea outside of the US' \"defensive perimeter of the Pacific,\" stating that any attack that took place outside of that perimeter would have to be dealt with \"under the Charter of the United Nations.\" Taking this as a green light, the North Koreans, heavily fortified and equipped with Soviet military aid, invaded the South. **The war began on June 27, 1950, when the UN Security Council passed [a resolution](https://undocs.org/S/RES/83(1950)) calling for members to provide military assistance \"to restore international peace and security in the area.\" The Soviet Union, being a veto-wielding member of the Council, could have vetoed the resolution and prevented the UN from engaging in the war, but they abstained from the vote altogether.** When General MacArthur, leading the UN forces, managed to repel the North right to the Chinese border, he was prevented from completing the mission by Truman, who [would not authorize](http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/116194.pdf) any operations north of the Soviet-held 38th parallel unless there was no chance of confrontation with either Chinese or Soviet forces. MacArthur, shocked by this development, [wrote in a letter](https://archive.org/stream/untoldstoryofdou001220mbp/untoldstoryofdou001220mbp_djvu.txt) years later: \"Such a limitation upon the utilization of available military force to repel an enemy attack has no precedent either in our own history or, so far as I know, in the history of the world. ... To me it clearly foreshadowed the tragic situation which has since developed and left me with a sense of shock I had never before experienced in a long life crammed with explosive reactions and momentous hazards.\" In the end, the bloody Korean conflict ended not with a peace deal but a cease fire. Not with the reunification of the Korean peninsula but with the establishment of a demilitarized zone to keep them separated. Nearly three million civilians died during the fighting, and the country was torn to pieces, all in the name of a military action under the UN flag that should never have escalated into war in the first place. **The Vietnam War** In August of 1964, President Johnson was preoccupied in finding an excuse to justify a formal escalation of American military involvement in Vietnam. That excuse came on August 2nd when the *USS* *Maddox*, a destroyer supposedly on a peaceful mission in international waters, reported a surprise attack from North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. Just two days later it reported another attack. Johnson responded by launching retaliatory strikes and signing the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, thus formally launching the Vietnam War. **Years later, it was revealed that the story of the *Maddox*, too, had been [a tissue of lies](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB132/essay.htm).

The *Maddox* was not peacefully drifting near Vietnamese waters, minding its own business; it was part of a covert electronic warfare campaign assisting the South Vietnamese in launching attacks on the North. It had not been attacked out of the blue on August 2nd, as originally reported, but in fact had fired first. And, as even [the NSA's own internal publication](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB132/relea00012.pdf), made [available to the public](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB132/press20051201.htm) for the first time 40 years after the incident, concluded, the second attack on August 4th had never taken place at all.** But these were mere details, and, just like the facts about the *Lusitania* and Pearl Harbor, these details were suppressed long enough for the event to have its intended effect: rallying the public for war. **The Six-Day War** The Six-Day War in 1967 between Israel and Egypt, Syria and Jordan is yet another example of a war which was justified for reasons that were later exposed as lies. When Israel launched an attack on Egypt's airfields on the morning of June 5th, they initially claimed that it was a defensive strike and that Egypt had struck first. But this was an easily proven lie, and the claim was quickly dropped. **Next they claimed that the attack was \"preemptive self defense\" and that Egypt and its Arab allies had been preparing to strike Israel. But multiple Israeli officials, including Yitzhak Rabin, [later admitted](https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=VaUvqHNd6m0C&pg=PA164&dq=Israel+1967+Strait+of+War+existence+in+danger&sig=6GkdFAkh39zp1qRkmfpC__nxobg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) that Egypt had not been preparing a war, or even interested in one.** **And then, in the most outrageous incident of all, Israel attempted to get America involved in the war by [attacking the*USS Liberty*](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-new-revelations-attack-american-spy-ship),** a US technical research ship collecting electronic intelligence just outside Egypt's territorial waters at the time of the war. The attack, carried out by Israeli fighter jets and torpedo boats, was relentless. The Liberty was [strafed and torpedoed](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-did-lbj-cover-israel) repeatedly, with the crew sending distress messages and even hoisting a large American flag so there could be no doubt as to their identity. The Israeli attack was finally called off an hour and a half into the assault. Israel, caught in a blatant attempt to sink an American ship, offered an \"apology\" for \"mistaking\" the identity of the vessel. But it was no mistake. **In 2007 the NSA declassified intercepts [confirming](http://www.globalresearch.ca/new-revelations-on-1967-incident-uss-liberty-attacked-by-israeli-fighter-jets/7009) that the Israelis knew they were attacking an American ship, not an Egyptian ship as their cover story has maintained.** Even mainstream historians [now characterize](http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/06_june/08/uss_liberty.shtml) Israel's attack on the Liberty as \"a daring ploy by Israel to fake an Egyptian attack on", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-lies-century.txt:5:f5a370d8b2d7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15434, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-lies-century.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-lies-century", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "a half into the assault.

And so it was that in 1990, when the politicians and their deep state controllers required the American public to be motivated to wage war against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait, they hired a literal PR firm to sell an even more brazen set of lies to Joe Sixpack and Jane Soccermom. The most famous of these lies revolved around Nayirah, a \"young Kuwaiti girl\" who sparked international headlines for her shocking testimony before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus in October 1990. In a [tear-stained speech](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4516044/nayirah-testimony&start=7101) she told a harrowing story of the horrors she witnessed being committed by Iraqi soldiers at a Kuwaiti hospital where she was volunteering. **NAYIRAH:** I volunteered at the Aladein hospital with 12 other women who wanted to help as well. I was the youngest volunteer. The other women were from 20 to 30 years old. While I was there, I saw the Iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with guns. They took the babies out of the incubators . . . took the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor! ***SOURCE: C-SPAN - [Human Rights Violations in Kuwait](https://www.c-span.org/video/?14441-1/human-rights-violations-kuwait)*** It is difficult today to understand just how important this testimony was in setting the tone of the debate about whether America should commit military forces to defend Kuwait. It was reported breathlessly on the evening news, and it was repeated by President Bush on not one or two occasions, but six separate times in the lead up to war. **GEORGE H. W. BUSH**: ... babies pulled from incubators and scattered like firewood across the floor... ***SOURCE: Nayirah Episode of 60 Minutes*** **GEORGE H. W.

The vote passed and combat operations formally began in January 1991. **The only problem? \"Nayirah\" was not some anonymous Kuwaiti girl, but, as a [subsequent CBC investigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaR1YBR5g6U) discovered, she was Nayirah Al-Sabah, daughter of Saud Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti Ambassador to the United States. Her testimony had been written for her by Hill & Knowlton, a PR agency hired by the [Kuwaiti government-supported](https://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0906/p25s02-cogn.html) astroturf organization, the \"Citizens For A Free Kuwait,\" to help sell the Gulf War. And the \"Congressional Human Rights Caucus\" that held the hearing where Nayirah gave her testimony? It was [later found](https://www.prwatch.org/books/tsigfy10.html) to be a [Hill & Knowlton front](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/15/opinion/deception-on-capitol-hill.html) itself.** **Gulf War II** As everyone knows by now, the second Gulf War, in 2003, was also built on lies. We all remember the lies about Saddam's WMDs and the way that story was sold to the public by Colin Powell at the UN. But this time the media took the driver seat in the campaign to sell the war to the public. *The New York Times* led the way with [Judith Miller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Miller_%28journalist%29)'s now-infamous reporting on the Iraqi WMD story, now known to have been based on false information from untrustworthy sources, but the rest of the media quickly [fell into line](https://fair.org/extra/the-great-wmd-hunt/), with the NBC Nightly News asking \"what precise threat Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction pose to America\" and *Time* debating whether Hussein was \"making a good-faith effort to disarm Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\" **Reports about chemical weapons stashes were reported on before they were confirmed, although headlines boldly asserted their existence as indisputable fact.

But for the would-be controllers of public opinion, a valuable lesson was learned: \"Human rights\" and \"protecting the innocent\" is a more effective lie to sell to the public to motivate them for war. So when it came time to sell the war on Libya to the public, the UN-backed, NATO-led aggressors once again donned the cloak of \"human rights\" by turning to none other than the UN's Human Rights Council. **The process that launched the intervention was begun by a coalition of 70 non-governmental organizations, which issued a [joint letter](https://web.archive.org/web/20110305005449/http://www.unwatch.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=bdKKISNqEmG&b=1330815&ct=9135143) urging the UN to suspend Libya from the Human Rights Council and for the Security Council to invoke the so-called \"[responsibility to protect](https://www.corbettreport.com/r2p-or-how-the-left-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-embrace-wars-of-imperial-aggression/)\" principle in protecting the Libyan people from alleged atrocities being committed by the Libyan government.** **In a [special session](https://web.archive.org/web/20110226103202/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/15/index.htm) on the issue on February 25th, 2011, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution affirming the NGOs' recommendations. The resolution was adopted without a vote.** The Security Council immediately passed resolutions [1970](https://www.un.org/sc/suborg/en/s/res/1970-%282011%29) and [1973](https://www.un.org/sc/suborg/en/s/res/1973-%282011%29), authorizing the establishment of a \"no-fly zone on Libyan military aviation\" for the \"protection of civilians\" and the \"delivery of humanitarian assistance.\" Three days later, using the resolution as its justification, the US, UK and France began bombing the population of Libya. Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, began working on the legal basis for the invasion. He drafted the request for the Court's judges to issue an arrest warrant for Gaddafi for crimes against humanity. Although NATO forces were already engaged in an invasion of the country on the basis of undocumented allegations by a group of NGOs, Moreno-Ocampo's request was not issued until May 16th. On June 28th, the day after the judges agreed to issue the warrant, Moreno-Ocampo participated in a press conference in which one reporter asked about the evidence that Gaddafi had ever engaged in the atrocities he was accused of. **LUIS MORENO-OCAMPO**: I advise you to read the application of the prosecutor's office. Many pages. I think it was 77 pages. We describe in detail the facts. Most of it is public and the judges also decided on the evidence.

No one involved in this charade cared about the well-being of the Libyan people. Not the press, not the politicians, not the ICC prosecutors. And as a result, today, **seven years after the destruction of Libya at the hands of the United Nations-sanctioned NATO \"saviours,\" [open-air slave markets](https://www.newsweek.com/humans-sale-libyan-slave-trade-continues-while-militants-kill-and-torture-855118) are running in the country that the human rights crusaders once pretended to care about.** **Conclusion** False flags. Provocateured conflicts. Fake news and fake human rights crusades. Throughout the last century, a host of methods have been employed to keep the public playing the military-industrial complex's game. And over that century, the blood of untold millions has flowed as a direct result of these war lies. **Truth is the first casualty of war, as they say. But if we desire peace, then we must confront the liars with our knowledge of these war lies. And armed with *this* truth, the public finally stands a chance of stopping the next war before the warmongers can conjure it into existence.** **Note:** This documentary was compiled and narrated by investigative journalist James Corbett of the Corbett Report.

If this is the case, it would certainly align with the deceptive history of the major wars of the last century, in which enemies were manufactured in order to justify and sell the idea of war to the public. One of the most decorated generals in American history, Smedley Butler, learned how he had been flagrantly deceived after serving in World War I. He went on to write the landmark treatise *War is a Racket*, which details the massive lies and deception he uncovered.

For those interested in a more nuanced and honest look into what's behind the current wars, WantToKnow.info has identified an excellent independent journalist who specializes in geopolitical analysis: Brian Berletic from [The New Atlas](https://www.youtube.com/@TheNewAtlas). **Berletic investigates the historical context leading up to the U.S. proxy war against Russia through Ukraine in an excellent [15-minute overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7-TV7E4ztg&list=PLkhlYgGXRhhxHzOmBH10Cp0nGBWjLATjc&index=7), challenging the official narrative portrayed by Western media that Russia is the aggressor.** This includes the decades-long US campaign to overthrow governments across Europe via U.S.-funded radical militia groups, as part of efforts to maintain control over other nations and the world's resources. About a year ago, Berletic posted a [9 minute overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTG9uZytIsU&list=PLkhlYgGXRhhy9IRm0qHdbVYFreJYsX1HY&index=28) that concisely explains the overt efforts to get the public accustomed to the idea of war with China, uniting Democrats and Republicans over the [greatest threat](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-worldwide-threats-hearing/) to U.S. national security: China. However, Berletic reveals a larger story in which** China isn't necessarily a threat to U.S. national security, but a massive threat to U.S. hegemony.** China is predicted to surpass the U.S. economically, including China's drive to establish its own [microchip industry](https://truthout.org/articles/bidens-chip-war-with-china-is-an-imperial-struggle-for-high-tech-supremacy/). *At the center of [the U.S.-China] conflict are microchips, which are as important to global capitalism today as oil.

While we're being told the fight is about Taiwanese independence from China's oppressive regime, he makes a solid case for the fight being about American hegemony over the Asia Pacific, as Taiwan currently dominates the chip industry. As economic historian and geopolitical expert Chris Miller says, **\"Taiwan isn't simply the source of the advanced chips that both countries' militaries are betting on. It's also the most likely battleground.\"** *The U.S. left must forge bonds with the [new Chinese left](https://anticapitalistresistance.org/chinas-new-left-the-revival-of-lost-traditions/) to oppose the militarism of both Washington and Beijing.

The ship's sinking, which resulted in the death of 128 of the 139 Americans aboard, became a symbol of German evil and helped psychologically prepare the US public for their country's eventual entry into WWI. But **every facet of the story of the Lusitania as it has been presented to the public was a deliberate lie or a lie by omission.** The boat was *not* a purely civilian vessel carrying 3,813 40-pound (unrefrigerated) containers of \"cheese\" and 696 containers of \"butter,\" as the [official manifest](http://www.rmslusitania.info/downloads/crossing202_supplementary_cargo_manifest.pdf) held, but guncotton, in keeping with the shipment's [stated destination](http://www.lusitania.net/deadlycargo.htm): the Royal Navy's Weapons Testing Establishment. It was *not* sunk by the German torpedo boat but by secondary explosions from [the munitions the ship was (illegally) carrying](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97350149). It was *not* the victim of a cowardly German surprise attack (the German Embassy placed a [warning notice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lusitania_warning.jpg) about the Lusitania in 50 American newspapers right next to Cunard's own listings). And **the American ambassador to England at the time, Walter Hines Page, wrote to his son five days before the ship was sunk, [asking](https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=m70fBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA95&dq=%22%E2%80%9CIf+a+British+liner+full+of+American+passengers+be+blown+up,+what+will+Uncle+Sam+do?%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIkI38h7_cAhWKVLwKHSNsD_EQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=%22%E2%80%9CIf%20a%20British%20liner%20full%20of%20American%20passengers%20be%20blown%20up%2C%20what%20will%20Uncle%20Sam%20do%3F%22&f=false): \"If a British liner full of American passengers be blown up, what will Uncle Sam do? That's what's going to happen.\"** So what did the official cover-up of the incident conclude? That the dastardly Germans had waged a perfidious sneak attack on an innocent peace boat, of course. And the rest, as they say, is history. **World War II** A little over two decades later, America's entry into WWII came when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, killing over 2,400 American servicemen and civilians. But far from an unprovoked sneak attack, as the official government-approved history would have you believe, **Pearl Harbor is best understood as a conspiracy to motivate the American public for war by first provoking and then allowing a Japanese strike on American targets.** This is not even a controversial idea; it was commonly understood and discussed by many in the Roosevelt administration at the time. **Henry Stimson, the US Secretary of War, [noted in his diary](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Henry_L._Stimson#cite_note-1) that just the week before the attack President Roosevelt had told him \"we were likely to be attacked perhaps (as soon as) next Monday\" and then solicited Stimson's advice on \"how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.\"** Around the same time, Roosevelt [sent a message](http://www.independent.org/issues/article.asp?id=408) to all military commanders stating that \"The United States desires that Japan commit the first overt act.\" So how did FDR and his administration provoke the Japanese into attacking?

In late 1940, Roosevelt ordered the United States Fleet to be [relocated from San Pedro to Pearl Harbor](https://12-7-9-11.blogspot.com/2009/03/by-special-request-move-to-hawaii_11.html). The order incensed Admiral James Richardson, Commander-in-Chief of the US Fleet, who complained bitterly to FDR about the nonsensical decision: It left the fleet open to attack from every direction, it created a 2,000-mile-long supply chain that was vulnerable to disruption, and it packed the ships in together at Pearl Harbor, where they would be sitting ducks in the event of a bombing or torpedo raid. FDR, unable to counter these objections, went ahead with the plan and relieved Richardson of his command. Then in June 1941, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes wrote [a memo](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/trachtenberg/methbk/ickes.pdf) advising FDR to embargo Japanese oil in order to goad them into war: \"There might develop from the embargoing of oil to Japan such a situation as would make it, not only possible but easy, to get into this war in an effective way.\" Roosevelt followed through weeks later with an order seizing Japanese assets in America and effectively [preventing Japan from purchasing much-needed American oil](https://www.salon.com/2013/12/05/oil_led_to_pearl_harbor/), which at that time accounted for [four-fifths of Japanese oil imports](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3638003?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). The provocations had their intended effect, and the Americans listened in on Japanese war preparations via radio. They received warnings of an imminent attack from diplomatic officials and military attachés. **The attack was even predicted by the *Honolulu Advertiser* days before it happened. But all of these warnings were ignored. Even today, nearly 80 years after the events, new documents and memos [continue to be found](https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2011/11/29/declassified-memo-hinted-of-1941-hawaii-attack-) showing more warnings that Roosevelt and his administration deliberately ignored in the run-up to the attack.** FDR got his wish. The Japanese attack was successful: 2,400 Americans died, and the nation, outraged, responded by rallying around the flag and jumping enthusiastically into war. But the Japanese themselves were no innocents when it came to lying their way into war. Ten years before Pearl Harbor, in 1931, Japan was looking for a pretext to invade Manchuria. On September 18th of that year, a lieutenant in the Imperial Japanese Army detonated a small amount of TNT along a Japanese-owned railway in the Manchurian city of Mukden. The act was blamed on Chinese dissidents and used to [justify the invasion and occupation of Manchuria](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D9VZH5Fi_4). When the lie was later exposed, Japan was diplomatically shunned and forced to withdraw from the League of Nations. **The Korean War ** The League of Nations fell apart", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-lies-ukraine-russia-china.txt:4:4e2a57972f96", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15445, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-lies-ukraine-russia-china.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-lies-ukraine-russia-china", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "a pretext to invade Manchuria.

When the lie was later exposed, Japan was diplomatically shunned and forced to withdraw from the League of Nations. **The Korean War ** The League of Nations fell apart precisely for its inability to prevent World War II. Its successor organization, the United Nations, engaged in its own war lies shortly after its creation to ensure that it would not meet the same fate. The Korean War, waged under the UN flag and sold to the public as a virtuous mission to save the South from the North's communist aggression, was on its face a war that should never have happened. **The division of Korea into North and South was not the organic decision of the Korean people, but a plan that originated in [an article](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/1944-04-01/korea-postwar-world) in 1944 in *Foreign Affairs*, the journal of the Council on Foreign Relations, which suggested dividing the country up and putting its administration in the hands of the Allies, including the Soviets. **When the newly-founded UN put that plan into action in 1945, Korea was arbitrarily divided along the 38th parallel, with the US administering the South and the Soviet Union administering the North. Neither was the war itself the organic result of decisions taken by the Korean people. In 1949, Owen Lattimore, a member of the Carnegie and Rockefeller-funded Institute for Pacific Relations and an advisor to the State Department on East Asian issues, [wrote](https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=ds5VAAAAYAAJ&q=%22The+thing+to+do+is+let+South+Korea+fall,+but+not+to+let+it+look+as+if+we+pushed+it%22&dq=%22The+thing+to+do+is+let+South+Korea+fall,+but+not+to+let+it+look+as+if+we+pushed+it%22&hl=ja&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj91t3bjr7cAhVKEbwKHUhUCZUQ6AEINjAC): \"The thing to do is let South Korea fall, but not to let it look as if we pushed it.\" In a [speech at the National Press Club](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/1950-01-12.pdf) the following year, Secretary of State Dean Acheson placed Korea outside of the US' \"defensive perimeter of the Pacific,\" stating that any attack that took place outside of that perimeter would have to be dealt with \"under the Charter of the United Nations.\" Taking this as a green light, the North Koreans, heavily fortified and equipped with Soviet military aid, invaded the South. **The war began on June 27, 1950, when the UN Security Council passed [a resolution](https://undocs.org/S/RES/83(1950)) calling for members to provide military assistance \"to restore international peace and security in the area.\" The Soviet Union, being a veto-wielding member of the Council, could have vetoed the resolution and prevented the UN from engaging in the war, but they abstained from the vote altogether.** When General MacArthur, leading the UN forces, managed to repel the North right to the Chinese border, he was prevented from completing the mission by Truman, who [would not authorize](http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/116194.pdf) any operations north of the Soviet-held 38th parallel unless there was no chance of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-lies-ukraine-russia-china.txt:5:eecf8caef430", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15446, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-lies-ukraine-russia-china.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-lies-ukraine-russia-china", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "and security in the area.\" The Soviet Union, being a veto-wielding member of the Council, could have vetoed the resolution and prevented the UN from engaging in the war, but they abstained from the vote altogether.** When General MacArthur, leading the UN forces, managed to repel the North right to the Chinese border, he was prevented from completing the mission by Truman, who [would not authorize](http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/116194.pdf) any operations north of the Soviet-held 38th parallel unless there was no chance of confrontation with either Chinese or Soviet forces. MacArthur, shocked by this development, [wrote in a letter](https://archive.org/stream/untoldstoryofdou001220mbp/untoldstoryofdou001220mbp_djvu.txt) years later: \"Such a limitation upon the utilization of available military force to repel an enemy attack has no precedent either in our own history or, so far as I know, in the history of the world. ... To me it clearly foreshadowed the tragic situation which has since developed and left me with a sense of shock I had never before experienced in a long life crammed with explosive reactions and momentous hazards.\" In the end, the bloody Korean conflict ended not with a peace deal but a cease fire. Not with the reunification of the Korean peninsula but with the establishment of a demilitarized zone to keep them separated. Nearly three million civilians died during the fighting, and the country was torn to pieces, all in the name of a military action under the UN flag that should never have escalated into war in the first place. **The Vietnam War** In August of 1964, President Johnson was preoccupied in finding an excuse to justify a formal escalation of American military involvement in Vietnam. That excuse came on August 2nd when the *USS* *Maddox*, a destroyer supposedly on a peaceful mission in international waters, reported a surprise attack from North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. Just two days later it reported another attack. Johnson responded by launching retaliatory strikes and signing the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, thus formally launching the Vietnam War. **Years later, it was revealed that the story of the *Maddox*, too, had been [a tissue of lies](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB132/essay.htm). The *Maddox* was not peacefully drifting near Vietnamese waters, minding its own business; it was part of a covert electronic warfare campaign assisting the South Vietnamese in launching attacks on the North. It had not been attacked out of the blue on August 2nd, as originally reported, but in fact had fired first. And, as even [the NSA's own internal publication](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB132/relea00012.pdf), made [available to the public](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB132/press20051201.htm) for the first time 40 years after the incident, concluded, the second attack on August 4th had never taken place at all.** But these were mere details, and, just like the facts about the *Lusitania* and Pearl Harbor, these details were suppressed long enough for the event to have its intended effect: rallying the public for war. **The Six-Day War** The Six-Day War in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-lies-ukraine-russia-china.txt:6:f607760bc5bc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15447, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-lies-ukraine-russia-china.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-lies-ukraine-russia-china", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "had fired first.

When Israel launched an attack on Egypt's airfields on the morning of June 5th, they initially claimed that it was a defensive strike and that Egypt had struck first. But this was an easily proven lie, and the claim was quickly dropped. **Next they claimed that the attack was \"preemptive self defense\" and that Egypt and its Arab allies had been preparing to strike Israel. But multiple Israeli officials, including Yitzhak Rabin, [later admitted](https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=VaUvqHNd6m0C&pg=PA164&dq=Israel+1967+Strait+of+War+existence+in+danger&sig=6GkdFAkh39zp1qRkmfpC__nxobg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) that Egypt had not been preparing a war, or even interested in one.** **And then, in the most outrageous incident of all, Israel attempted to get America involved in the war by [attacking the*USS Liberty*](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-new-revelations-attack-american-spy-ship),** a US technical research ship collecting electronic intelligence just outside Egypt's territorial waters at the time of the war. The attack, carried out by Israeli fighter jets and torpedo boats, was relentless. The Liberty was [strafed and torpedoed](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-did-lbj-cover-israel) repeatedly, with the crew sending distress messages and even hoisting a large American flag so there could be no doubt as to their identity. The Israeli attack was finally called off an hour and a half into the assault. Israel, caught in a blatant attempt to sink an American ship, offered an \"apology\" for \"mistaking\" the identity of the vessel. But it was no mistake. **In 2007 the NSA declassified intercepts [confirming](http://www.globalresearch.ca/new-revelations-on-1967-incident-uss-liberty-attacked-by-israeli-fighter-jets/7009) that the Israelis knew they were attacking an American ship, not an Egyptian ship as their cover story has maintained.** Even mainstream historians [now characterize](http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/06_june/08/uss_liberty.shtml) Israel's attack on the Liberty as \"a daring ploy by Israel to fake an Egyptian attack on the American spy ship, and thereby provide America with a reason to officially enter the war against Egypt.\" But the incident was soon memory-holed, and to this day the Six-Day War is portrayed as an act of \"preemptive self defense\" by the valiant Israelis against the dastardly Arab aggressors. **Gulf War I** By the 1990s, the post-Vietnam public was growing increasingly wary of calls for war in far-flung corners of the world in countries many had never heard of. And so it was that in 1990, when the politicians and their deep state controllers required the American public to be motivated to wage war against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait, they hired", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-lies-ukraine-russia-china.txt:7:24c1f709e373", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15448, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-lies-ukraine-russia-china.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-lies-ukraine-russia-china", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "as an act of \"preemptive self defense\" by the valiant Israelis against the dastardly Arab aggressors. **Gulf War I** By the 1990s, the post-Vietnam public was growing increasingly wary of calls for war in far-flung corners of the world in countries many had never heard of. And so it was that in 1990, when the politicians and their deep state controllers required the American public to be motivated to wage war against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait, they hired a literal PR firm to sell an even more brazen set of lies to Joe Sixpack and Jane Soccermom. The most famous of these lies revolved around Nayirah, a \"young Kuwaiti girl\" who sparked international headlines for her shocking testimony before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus in October 1990. In a [tear-stained speech](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4516044/nayirah-testimony&start=7101) she told a harrowing story of the horrors she witnessed being committed by Iraqi soldiers at a Kuwaiti hospital where she was volunteering. **NAYIRAH:** I volunteered at the Aladein hospital with 12 other women who wanted to help as well. I was the youngest volunteer. The other women were from 20 to 30 years old. While I was there, I saw the Iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with guns. They took the babies out of the incubators . . . took the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor! ***SOURCE: C-SPAN - [Human Rights Violations in Kuwait](https://www.c-span.org/video/?14441-1/human-rights-violations-kuwait)*** It is difficult today to understand just how important this testimony was in setting the tone of the debate about whether America should commit military forces to defend Kuwait. It was reported breathlessly on the evening news, and it was repeated by President Bush on not one or two occasions, but six separate times in the lead up to war. **GEORGE H. W. BUSH**: ... babies pulled from incubators and scattered like firewood across the floor... ***SOURCE: Nayirah Episode of 60 Minutes*** **GEORGE H. W.

We all remember the lies about Saddam's WMDs and the way that story was sold to the public by Colin Powell at the UN. But this time the media took the driver seat in the campaign to sell the war to the public. *The New York Times* led the way with [Judith Miller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Miller_%28journalist%29)'s now-infamous reporting on the Iraqi WMD story, now known to have been based on false information from untrustworthy sources, but the rest of the media quickly [fell into line](https://fair.org/extra/the-great-wmd-hunt/), with the NBC Nightly News asking \"what precise threat Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction pose to America\" and *Time* debating whether Hussein was \"making a good-faith effort to disarm Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\" **Reports about chemical weapons stashes were reported on before they were confirmed, although headlines boldly asserted their existence as indisputable fact. And any media personality that showed skepticism about the claims being made-even wildly popular ones like Phil Donahue, host of MSNBC's then highest-rated program-were summarily removed from the air.** **PHIL DONOHUE:** Scott Ritter is here and so is Ambassador . . . **BILL MOYERS:** You had Scott Ritter, former weapons inspector, who was saying that if we invade, it will be a historic blunder. **DONOHUE:** Yes. You didn't have him alone. He had to be there with someone else who supported the war. In other words, you couldn't have Scott Ritter alone. You could have Richard Perle alone. **MOYERS:** You could have the conservative. **DONOHUE:** You could have the supporters of the President alone. And they would say why this war is important.

The president didn't. And it's become kind of folklore that that's what's happened. The president went- **BOB SCHIEFFER**: You're saying that nobody in the administration said that- **RUMSFELD**: I can't speak for nobody- . . . and everybody in the Administration and say nobody said that. **SCHIEFFER**: The Vice-President didn't say that? **RUMSFELD**: If you have any citations I'd like to see them. **THOMAS FRIEDMAN**: \"Some have argued that the nu-\" this is you speaking \"some have argued that the nuclear threat from Iraq is not imminent, that Saddam is at least five to seven years away from having nuclear weapons. I would not be so certain.\" **RUMSFELD**: Mm-hmm. **FRIEDMAN**: That's close to \"imminent.\" **RUMSFELD**: Well, I've tried to be precise and I've tried to be accurate. Sometimes- **FRIEDMAN**: \"No terror state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people and the stability of the world than the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iran.\" **RUMSFELD**: Mm-hmm. ***SOURCE: CBS Face the Nation - [Rumsfeld Busted on Iraq Immediate Threat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLERW7snUQ)*** **The Libya Intervention** The WMD story blew up in the neocons' face shortly after the war, but by that time they had already succeeded in their plan to reshape the Middle East. But for the would-be controllers of public opinion, a valuable lesson was learned: \"Human rights\" and \"protecting the innocent\" is a more effective lie to sell to the public to motivate them for war. So when it came time to sell the war on Libya to the public, the UN-backed, NATO-led aggressors once again donned the cloak of \"human rights\" by turning to none other than the UN's Human Rights Council. **The process that launched the intervention was begun by a coalition of 70 non-governmental organizations, which issued a [joint letter](https://web.archive.org/web/20110305005449/http://www.unwatch.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=bdKKISNqEmG&b=1330815&ct=9135143) urging the UN to suspend Libya from the Human Rights Council and for the Security Council to invoke the so-called \"[responsibility to protect](https://www.corbettreport.com/r2p-or-how-the-left-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-embrace-wars-of-imperial-aggression/)\" principle in protecting the Libyan people from alleged atrocities being committed by the Libyan government.** **In a [special session](https://web.archive.org/web/20110226103202/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/15/index.htm) on the issue on February 25th, 2011, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution affirming the NGOs' recommendations.

Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, began working on the legal basis for the invasion. He drafted the request for the Court's judges to issue an arrest warrant for Gaddafi for crimes against humanity. Although NATO forces were already engaged in an invasion of the country on the basis of undocumented allegations by a group of NGOs, Moreno-Ocampo's request was not issued until May 16th. On June 28th, the day after the judges agreed to issue the warrant, Moreno-Ocampo participated in a press conference in which one reporter asked about the evidence that Gaddafi had ever engaged in the atrocities he was accused of. **LUIS MORENO-OCAMPO**: I advise you to read the application of the prosecutor's office. Many pages. I think it was 77 pages. We describe in detail the facts. Most of it is public and the judges also decided on the evidence. So of course we are prosecutors and judges, so we rely on facts, so we prove the crimes. That's what we did. ***SOURCE: [Lies behind the \"Humanitarian War\" in Libya: There is no evidence!

Have you noticed that when the government declares a war on something, it tends to get worse and not better? President Nixon declared war on drugs in the early 70s, yet since then the number of people incarcerated for drug crimes has [risen dramatically](http://www.bjs.gov/content/dcf/enforce.cfm#arrtot). And since President G.W. Bush declared war on terror after 9/11, terrorism has grown and spread worldwide. Is there a deeper agenda behind all of this? Is it possible that covert groups are manipulating the War on Terror to create more war, knowing that this helps to fill the coffers of the multinationals and those who benefit from them? **A highly decorated U.S. general who discovered how he had been manipulated went so far as to write a book titled \"[War is a Racket](https://www.WantToKnow.info/war/war-corruption).\" Another U.S. general stated, \"[we helped build ISIS](https://www.WantToKnow.info/war/isis-islamic-state-origins).\"** **The essay below uses easily verified facts to show many ways in which the War on Terror is a fraud.

First, the United States began a troop surge in Afghanistan designed to deliver the final blow to the Taliban insurgency.3Then the United States provided a $7.5 billion aid package to Pakistan.4 Around the same time, the Carnegie Foundation published a study which revealed a majority of Pakistan aid goes to the intelligence agency ISI and the military.5The problem with these three events is that earlier in the year, U.S. officials revealed to the *New York Times *that the ISI was funding the Taliban, and was responsible for providing direct assistance and helping with some of their strategic strikes.6 The press did cover these stories, but independent of one another. **Not one media institution connected the dots that the United States was actively funding the harm that its armed forces were simultaneously fighting. **Following the official narrative of the war, it certainly doesn't make any sense that the United States was indirectly prolonging the quagmire. Perhaps such mistakes are the inevitability of a bloated war bureaucracy, or that U.S. officials simply didn't realize the connection. Unfortunately, a collection of evidence points to a more sinister explanation: **the United States and its allies had been deliberately proliferating radical Islam for decades, only to later spend trillions fighting the enemy they created, thus generating huge war profits for Wall Street moguls.** Just days after the July 7, 2005 London terror attack, and less than a month before his untimely death, the Right Honorable Robin Cook, former UK Foreign Secretary, wrote a scathing and emotional review of the War on Terror in *The Guardian*. \"Bin Laden was, though, a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies.

I warned them that we were creating a monster.\" - Scholar Selig Harrison8 The story begins in 1978 shortly after the Saur Revolution, which resulted in the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan gaining control of the Afghanistan government. The CIA immediately initiated a program known as Operation Cyclone and began funding militant Islamic groups favored by the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI, to the tune of $7.5 billion.9**The money went to producing, training, and arming militant Islamic radicals who were directed towards fighting the secular communist government. ** At the time, the Mujahideen was composed of many different, loosely organized groups encompassing a broad spectrum of ideologies, with widely varying perspectives on religion, society and state. Seven major Afghan factions began receiving aid, three of them Islamic moderates and four of them Islamic fundamentalists as defined by the military. In addition to native Afghans, they were composed of many foreigners who traveled to fight the invasion, such as Osama bin Laden himself.10 **To understand the scope of the funding, the *BBC *stated that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-on-terror-fraud.txt:2:a709f7fc9007", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15457, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-on-terror-fraud.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-on-terror-fraud", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "was composed of many different, loosely organized groups encompassing a broad spectrum of ideologies, with widely varying perspectives on religion, society and state.

Many were high tech, such as Stinger Anti-Aircraft missiles,12 provided with the intention of demoralizing Soviet commanders and soldiers.13 **The majority of the funding was funneled through Pakistan's ISI, which acted as an arm of CIA interests** and began setting up religious schools known as Madrassas in Pakistan cities and frontier areas, churning out tens of thousands of students who would join the Mujahideen.14(Note: Madrassas are not inherently negative institutions, however the ones who received funding from the CIA were particularly radical). All of this began before the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. A full six months, according to Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's National Security Advisor, who recalled his involvement to a French news magazine in 1998: \"We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would... That secret operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Soviets into the Afghan trap.

It was also a major arms and medical depot for the Mujahideen in the Peshawar mountains near Pakistan which was later used by Al-Qaeda.19 Fifteen years later, the Western Media would describe Al-Qaeda as hiding out in caves, but the truth is a little more complex: there were intricate tunnels connecting hundreds of different caves, a majority of them man-made, equipped with irrigation systems, accommodation for trucks and even tanks, hotels, mosques, arms depots, medical and radio centers, and kitchens.20In short, it is more accurate to call them mountain fortresses. Al-Qaeda was formed sometime between 1987-88, with the radical elements of MAK joining after their group split. It is apparent that the CIA had no plan to deal with the tunnel complex after the conclusion of Operation Cyclone, though surely that must have been aware that the cadre of radicals they were instrumental in producing would not simply disappear or de-radicalize. **Perhaps long term destabilization of the country was their plan all along.** 16 Information taken from [GlobalSecurity.org](http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/osama_bin_laden.htm), a respected institution in the intelligence community. 17 David Helms and Norm Dixon, \"[Behind the US War in Afghanistan.](http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=6qAiFbGFE-IC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=bin%2BLaden%2Bwere%2Bbringing%2B%2420-%2425%2Bmillion%2Ba%2Bmonth%2Bfrom%2Bother%2BSaudis%2Band%2BGulf%2BArabs%2Bto%2Bunderwrite%2Bthe%2Bwar.%2BAnd%2Bthat%2Bis%2Ba%2Blot%2Bof%2Bmoney.%2BIt&redir_esc=y%23v%3Donepage&q=bin%20Laden%20were%20bringing%20%2420-%2425%20million%20a%20month%20from%20other%20Saudis%20and%20Gulf%20Arabs%20to%20underwrite%20the%20war.%20And%20that%20is%20a%20lot%20of%20money.%20It&f=false)\" 18 *New York Times, *\"[The Most Wanted Face of Terrorism](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/world/02osama-bin-laden-obituary.html?pagewanted=all)\", May 2, 2011. 19 *The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, *\"[How a Holy War Against the Soviets Turned Against the US](http://s3.amazonaws.com/911timeline/2001/pittsburghpostgazette092301.html),\" September 23, 2001.

They suggest that the ISI has members on the Taliban leadership council, though they expressed fear of assassination if they went into to much depth on this topic.25 **It's not hard to establish that the United States has allied itself with one of the biggest funders of terrorism in the Middle East, a fact which blatantly clashes with the official narrative of Western involvement in the region. It makes much more sense when understood in the context that the goal of the United States in the Middle East is not the prevention of terrorism, but rather for political, military and economic hegemony.** 21 Diplomatic cable [http://books.google.com/books?id=QPzWeWSXVV8C&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=%E2%80%9CTaliban%2Bleader%2BMullah%2BOmar%2Blashed%2Bout%2Bat%2Bthe%2BU.S.%2Basserting%2Bthat%2Bthe%2B%2B%2BTaliban%2Bwill%2Bcontinue%2Bto%2Bprovide%2Ba%2Bsafe%2Bhaven%2Bto%2Bbin%2BLaden%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=dU3ZfssLgD&sig=SfbzuKgTIZwRIuXsDOiCSkoffzQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GjjNUfjSAaWdyAGip4CQBQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA%23v%3Donepage&q=%E2%80%9CTaliban%20leader%20Mullah%20Omar%20lashed%20out%20at%20the%20U.S.%20asserting%20that%20the%20%20%20Taliban%20will%20continue%20to%20provide%20a%20safe%20haven%20to%20bin%20Laden%E2%80%9D&f=false](http://books.google.com/books?id=QPzWeWSXVV8C&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=%E2%80%9CTaliban%2Bleader%2BMullah%2BOmar%2Blashed%2Bout%2Bat%2Bthe%2BU.S.%2Basserting%2Bthat%2Bthe%2B%2B%2BTaliban%2Bwill%2Bcontinue%2Bto%2Bprovide%2Ba%2Bsafe%2Bhaven%2Bto%2Bbin%2BLaden%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=dU3ZfssLgD&sig=SfbzuKgTIZwRIuXsDOiCSkoffzQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GjjNUfjSAaWdyAGip4CQBQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA%23v%3Donepage&q=%E2%80%9CTaliban%20leader%20Mullah%20Omar%20lashed%20out%20at%20the%20U.S.%20asserting%20that%20the%20%20%20Taliban%20will%20continue%20to%20provide%20a%20safe%20haven%20to%20bin%20Laden%E2%80%9D&f=false)[available here](http://books.google.com/books?id=QPzWeWSXVV8C&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=%E2%80%9CTaliban%2Bleader%2BMullah%2BOmar%2Blashed%2Bout%2Bat%2Bthe%2BU.S.%2Basserting%2Bthat%2Bthe%2B%2B%2BTaliban%2Bwill%2Bcontinue%2Bto%2Bprovide%2Ba%2Bsafe%2Bhaven%2Bto%2Bbin%2BLaden%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=dU3ZfssLgD&sig=SfbzuKgTIZwRIuXsDOiCSkoffzQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GjjNUfjSAaWdyAGip4CQBQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA%23v%3Donepage&q=%E2%80%9CTaliban%20leader%20Mullah%20Omar%20lashed%20out%20at%20the%20U.S.%20asserting%20that%20the%20%20%20Taliban%20will%20continue%20to%20provide%20a%20safe%20haven%20to%20bin%20Laden%E2%80%9D&f=false). 22 *BBC, *\"[Pakistani agents 'funding and training Afghan Taliban'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10302946),\" June 13, 2010 23 *New York Times, *\"[Threats and Responses: Afghanistan](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/13/world/threats-and-responses-afghanistan-terror-aid-from-pakistan-concerns-senators.html),\" February 13, 2002 24 *BBC, *\"[Pakistan Helping Afghan Taliban - NATO](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16821218),\" February 1, 2012 25 London School of Economics report [http://www.lse.ac.uk/internationalDevelopment/research/crisisStates/Home.aspx](http://www.lse.ac.uk/internationalDevelopment/research/crisisStates/Home.aspx)[available here](http://www.lse.ac.uk/internationalDevelopment/research/crisisStates/Home.aspx). * * * * Osama Runs Wild \"I do not profess a broad expertise in international affairs, but between January 1996 and June 1999 I was in charge of running operations against Al-Qaeda from Washington.

Regardless, there have been some astonishing revelations of terrorists trained within the US borders. **One specifically alarming case is that of Egyptian Ali Muhammed. He was a part of the fundamentalist military unit that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. In 1984, he was hired by the CIA, though they claim that the relationship was short-lived.34****He would soon join the military and become a member of the Green Berets, and serve as a drill sergeant at Fort Bragg while providing clandestine training to jihadists such as Mahmud Abaouhalima, convicted perpetrator of the 1993 World Trade Center bombings.35** He would take a short leave from his military duties and travel to Afghanistan in 1988 to assist the Mujahideen, returning just months later.36Such an act is completely unheard of, entirely unprecedented and raises all sorts of red flags. Who was allowing Muhammed to circumvent the law and what type of special privileges and protections was he receiving? In the early 1990's, he would return to Afghanistan and began training jihadists with the skills he had learned at Fort Bragg. **According to former FBI special agent Jack Cloonan in an interview with *PBS*, Muhammed's first training session included Osama bin Laden, as well as Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current leader of Al-Qaeda.37** Former Directors of Counter-terrorism at the National Security Council have alleged that Muhammed took maps and training materials from Fort Bragg and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-on-terror-fraud.txt:7:adc34820fb25", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15462, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-on-terror-fraud.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-on-terror-fraud", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "and protections was he receiving?

Col. Robert Anderson, has stated: \"I think you or I would have a better chance of winning the Powerball lottery, than an Egyptian major in the unit that assassinated Sadat would have getting a visa, getting to California, getting into the Army and getting assigned to a Special Forces unit. That just doesn't happen.\"39 Elsewhere he stated: \"It was unthinkable that an ordinary American GI would go unpunished after fighting in a foreign war,\" and that he assumed that Muhammed was sponsored by the CIA.40 **In the year 2000, Muhammed plead guilty to involvement in the 1998 embassy bombings that killed 224 people including 12 Americans.41He admitted during the trial that he was a part of a broader plot to attack any Western target in the Middle East, as well as admitting that he helped transfer Osama bin Laden from Pakistan to Sudan.** 33 *The Guardian, *\"[Blowback Chronicles](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/15/afghanistan.highereducation)\", September 15, 2001 34 *New York Times, *\"[The Plot Against America](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/books/review/06filkins.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0),\" August 6, 2006 35 [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Abouhalima) on Mahmud Abouhalima 36 *San Francisco Chronicle*, \"[Al Qaeda terrorist worked with FBI / Ex-Silicon Valley resident plotted embassy attacks](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Al-Qaeda-terrorist-worked-with-FBI-Ex-Silicon-2861719.php),\" November 4, 2001 37 *PBS Frontline *Interview with Jack Cloonan, [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline//////torture/interviews/cloonan.html](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline//////torture/interviews/cloonan.html)[available here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline//////torture/interviews/cloonan.html). 38 Daniel Benjamin and Steve Simon, \"[Age of Sacred Terror](http://www.amazon.com/The-Age-Sacred-Terror-Radical/dp/0812969847).\" 39 Article written by five time Emmy Award recipient Peter Lance, hosted at BoilingFrogsPost.com, [http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2009/11/29/fort-hood-the-ksm-trial-part-i-what-do-these-terrorism-stories-have-in-common/](http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2009/11/29/fort-hood-the-ksm-trial-part-i-what-do-these-terrorism-stories-have-in-common/)[available here](http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2009/11/29/fort-hood-the-ksm-trial-part-i-what-do-these-terrorism-stories-have-in-common/). 40 *San Francisco Chronicle, *\"[Al Qaeda terrorist worked with FBI / Ex-Silicon Valley resident plotted embassy attacks](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Al-Qaeda-terrorist-worked-with-FBI-Ex-Silicon-2861719.php),\" November 4, 2001 41 *BBC, *\"[Ex US Soldier Admits to Embassy Bombings,](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/982069.stm)\" October 20, 2000 * * * * United States and Al-Qaeda Have The Same Agenda In 2011, NATO, led by Barack Obama and the United States, initiated military action against Libya by enforcing a No Fly Zone.

Their presence is still a factor of instability today.51It is of significance that all of these associations occurred after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, when Al-Qaeda first became widespread in the American lexicon.

They have been an important factor in the radicalization of Islam ever since. As of 2008, there are some 750 madrassas in Pakistan that teach jihad and radicalism, about 10% of all madrassas in the country (and I want to emphasize that this section is referring to specific radical iterations of Madrassas, not simply applying a blanket generalization to the religious style of education).56U.S. diplomatic cables released by *Wikileaks *revealed that the funding for these radical schools now comes from Saudi Arabia, the United States' biggest ally in the region.57 The radical madrassa network exploits impoverished areas by recruiting children for what essentially amounts to indoctrination camps. In exchange, families receive upwards of $6,500 per son for their 'sacrifice to Islam', and during schooling, contact with families is forbidden. After graduation, many are funneled into terrorist training camps in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, the cables stated. *PBS Frontline *did a story on a 16 year old who was recruited to a Pakistan Wahabi Islam madrassa from an impoverished area in East Africa.58A few years later, he was instrumental in a terror plot, blowing up the US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. The *PBS *website hosts a letter he wrote to his brother, in which he says he spent two years on a military base learning warfare, including the usage of Israeli arms.59 **Is the CIA still involved? The House of Saud has given at least $1.474 billion dollars to the Bush family,60 and the United States sold Saudi Arabia $60 billion worth of arms in 2010, the biggest arms sale in American history.61Before he was president, George H.W. Bush was the Director of the CIA. As recently as June 25th, 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that Saudi Arabia is 'one of our closest partners'.62** At the very least we can establish complicity.

The same statement can be applied to the relationship with Pakistan, which is instrumental in the operations of the Taliban. 56 Naval Postgraduate Thesis, by Paul Bell, titled \"Pakistan's Madrassas: Weapons of Mass Instruction?\" [Available here](http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ada467143).

According to the Cato Institute, the United States spent a total of $6 trillion on military and intelligence in just four decades during the Cold War, a staggering sum. **After the Soviet Union was defeated, the Military Industrial Complex experienced a steady decline, accounting for just 3.7% of GDP in the year 2000. This changed on 9/11, when the MIC [Military-Industrial Complex] found that they could turn their old friends into new enemies to fight, and their percentage of GDP has more than doubled in the last decade.74** Congress has officially authorized more than $1.3 trillion to fight the war on terror, and a Brown University study says this is just the tip of the iceberg: Even if the War on Terror were to begin de-escalating now, it would end up costing a total of $3.9 trillion between domestic spending, veterans costs, and interest.75The money comes from the taxpayers of the United States, whether directly or indirectly, and goes into the deep pockets of defense contractors and banks. 73 Math and Charts [http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/defense_spending](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/defense_spending)[available here](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/defense_spending) at USGovernmentSpending.com. 74 [More Charts.](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/downchart_gs.php?title=Military_Industrial_Complex&year=1960_2013&units=p&chart=30-total) 75 Brown.edu \"Cost of War Project\", [http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2013/03/warcosts](http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2013/03/warcosts)[available here](http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2013/03/warcosts). * * * * Al-Qaeda Today In 2003, Donald Rumsfeld wrote a memo to the Joint Chiefs of Staff where he stated that \"We need to stop populating Guantanamo Bay with low-level enemy combatants.\"76The memo was uncovered in 2011.

The result is endless war: Politicians, military and media shine the light just right to make the shadow of the mouse look huge and monstrous to justify endless profits. The media is not even connecting the most basic of dots to reveal the tremendous deception.** The evidence is a repeated policy of the destabilization of Central Asia and the development of Islamic radicals that spans decades. The result is a new global enemy without borders or diplomatic representation that can be fought indefinitely. Unless significant changes are made, we are looking at a future with an endless war on 'terrorism' where more terrorists are created daily by the very policies that are meant to be fighting them, and a foreign policy dictated by the whims of war profiteering. And what kind of influence are we having in the Middle East? The rhetoric of 'bringing democracy to the peoples of Iraq and Afghanistan' would be laughable were it not such a grandiose and destructive lie. The impact of American intervention in these two countries has been disastrous. **\"The biggest source of corruption in Afghanistan,\" one American official said, \"was the United States.\" - *New York Times*80** This *New York Times *article describes how the CIA routinely funneled millions of dollars without oversight in unmarked bags to the offices of President Hamid Karzai, while simultaneously denouncing the Iranian policy of doing the exact same thing. U.S. officials are quoted as saying that instead of buying the loyalty of the Afghan President, the payments instead proliferated into a vast web of corruption while Karzai became increasingly defiant of U.S. interests. In Iraq, the country has devolved into near anarchy with monthly death tolls from terrorism sometimes reaching the thousands. In 2004, the *New York Times *reported that there was a massive assassination campaign targeting intellectuals and professionals, with between 500 and 1,000 urban professionals killed in just a nine-month span.81From drive by shootings to stealth murders in the victims home, officials in Iraq agree that there is", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-on-terror-fraud.txt:14:9893063b3cd9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15469, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-on-terror-fraud.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-on-terror-fraud", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "a vast web of corruption while Karzai became increasingly defiant of U.S. interests.

In 2004, the *New York Times *reported that there was a massive assassination campaign targeting intellectuals and professionals, with between 500 and 1,000 urban professionals killed in just a nine-month span.81From drive by shootings to stealth murders in the victims home, officials in Iraq agree that there is a massive campaign to silence the capable and educated. \"'They are going after our brains,' said Lt. Col. Jabbar Abu Natiha, head of the organized crime unit of the Baghdad police. 'It is a big operation. Maybe even a movement.' These white-collar killings, American and Iraqi officials say, are separate from - and in some ways more insidious than - the settling of scores with former Baath Party officials, or the singling-out of police officers and others thought to be collaborating with the occupation. Hundreds of them have been attacked as well in an effort to sow insecurity and chaos. But by silencing urban professionals, said Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, a spokesman for the occupation forces, the guerrillas are waging war on Iraq's fledgling institutions and progress itself. The dead include doctors, lawyers and judges.\" **In other words, Iraq is being left without the very people who could have been future leaders of democracy, and whom could have established a functioning society. And note that shortly after the George W. Bush invaded Iraq, a corporate friendly government was established.** Furthermore, it is not empty rhetoric to say that the Iraq invasion was based on lies. In 2012, the Iraqi defector responsible for the 'evidence' of chemical weapon production in Iraq which was presented to the United Nations by Colin Powell, who portrayed his evidence as \"facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence\", confessed to BBC that his claims were entirely fabricated.82Clearly there is an agenda that does not mesh with the rhetoric! **Will the War on Terror ever end? Who truly has the incentive to scale back the operation? Not clandestine agencies or the military, who are seeing their budgets increase year by year. Certainly not any of the major influences in politics, banks and corporations, who are seeing massive profits from government contracts and resource exploitation. And most certainly not the politicians in Washington, who virtually rely on the lobbying of these organizations to keep their jobs.** Journalist Glenn Greenwald put it succinctly: \"But what one can say for certain is that there is zero reason for US officials to want an end to the war on terror, and numerous and significant reasons why they would want it to continue. It's always been the case that the power of political officials is at its greatest, its most unrestrained, in a state of war.

It's always been the case that the power of political officials is at its greatest, its most unrestrained, in a state of war. Cicero, two thousand years ago, warned that \"In times of war, the law falls silent\". John Jay, in Federalist No. 4, warned that as a result of that truth, \"nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it ... for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans.\" If you were a US leader, or an official of the National Security State, or a beneficiary of the private military and surveillance industries, why would you possibly want the war on terror to end? That would be the worst thing that could happen. It's that war that generates limitless power, impenetrable secrecy, an unquestioning citizenry, and massive profit.\" - Glenn Greenwald, writing for *The Guardian*83 Greenwald also notes the hopelessness of combating terrorism with further violence. **\"Indeed, virtually every person accused of plotting to target the US with terrorist attacks in last several years has expressly cited increasing US violence, aggression and militarism in the Muslim world as the cause. There's no question that this 'war' will continue indefinitely. There is no question that US actions are the cause of that, the gasoline that fuels the fire.\"** But the notion that the US government is even entertaining putting an end to any of this is a pipe dream, and the belief that they even want to is fantasy. They're preparing for more endless war; their actions are fueling that war; and they continue to reap untold benefits from its continuation. Only outside compulsion, from citizens, can make an end to all of this possible.\" 80 *New York Times, *\"[With Bags of Cash, C.I.A.

I told her I have the sensation of watching a slow-motion car crash. I used to believe that collapse would save us; that we would stop destroying nature, each other, and our own bodies because we would *have* to stop. I no longer believe that, any more than hitting bottom can rescue an addict. \"Bottom\" is the moment when the addict makes a different choice. The collapse of first one dimension of his life then another, then another-his work, his marriage, his family, his health, his freedom-offers him a series of invitations. These are moments when a choice is available, when the momentum pauses and he is asked whether he is ready to take a different path. Our society is approaching just such a moment, just such a choice point. **Of our many collective and individual addictions, the one I will speak of now is the addiction to the habits of war.** War mentality isn't a thirst for violence nor a lust for fighting. **War mentality is a pattern of thinking and a habit of seeing. It organizes the world into us and them, friend and foe, hero and villain. It poses solutions in terms of victory and success in terms of winning. It traffics in punishment and blame, deterrence and justification, right and wrong. It is addictive, because when it fails to solve a problem, the solution is to up the dose.** It escalates to new enemies and new battles. If there is no obvious foe to blame for the worsening situation, it looks harder to find one, or creates one instead. The solution that war mentality offers", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-polarization.txt:0:dc72afa94690", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15474, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-polarization.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-polarization", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "villain.

It is addictive, because when it fails to solve a problem, the solution is to up the dose.** It escalates to new enemies and new battles. If there is no obvious foe to blame for the worsening situation, it looks harder to find one, or creates one instead. The solution that war mentality offers for every problem is to find the bad thing and eradicate it. That solution applies to diverse areas of human activity: agriculture (kill the pests); medicine (find a pathogen); speech (censor bad ideas); political conflict (kill the terrorists); public safety (lock up the criminals). Complex problems, such as mass fentanyl addiction in America or industrial decline, collapse into simple but futile solutions as soon as someone can be found on which to pin the blame. The Chinese! The Mexican cartels! There is a kind of relief in this formula, even though it rarely succeeds. The public health response to Covid drew on war mentality. After decades of declining health and rising chronic disease, for which no single external culprit could be identified, finally here was a threat that could be identified and controlled. So, all of the public's anxiety was projected onto the new scary bad guy. The habit of find-the-enemy thinking is what made the public so susceptible to policies that ranged from the foolish to the absurd to the tyrannical. **Our leaders construct a narrative that locates evil in a certain person, nation, or group, and the habit of war thinking does the rest. Soon the public is ready to support war, censorship, lockdown, suspension of civil liberties and the rule of law, and crimes against humanity.** The same basic pattern of thought also drives conspiracy narratives. If we can locate the cause of the world's injustices and horrors on a discrete set of bad actors, a psychopathic cabal, then in theory our problems are easy to solve. Any theory that holds that nefarious powers are orchestrating world events necessarily imputes near-omnipotence to those powers. Just as, if a disease is caused by a pathogen, killing the germ cures the disease, so also can we cure society's malady by removing the pathocrats from power. Even in cases where a pathogen is the direct cause, we still have to ask what conditions make the organism vulnerable to that pathogen. Some of my readers think me naive for understating the influence of a satanic cabal within the power elite orchestrating world events. For me though, the most important question isn't whether such a cabal exists. It is the psychosocial patterning that allows it to maintain control whether it exists or not. That patterning is, again, war mentality. It is us-versus-them thinking. It is dehumanization and othering, the division of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-polarization.txt:1:17d2bf192722", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15475, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-polarization.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-polarization", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "ask what conditions make the organism vulnerable to that pathogen.

That patterning is, again, war mentality. It is us-versus-them thinking. It is dehumanization and othering, the division of the world into the full human and the subhuman. The latter category can adopt the form of racism, sexism, homophobia, and so forth, or just simple contempt for an opposing opinion tribe. **Once two sides are locked into war thinking, it escalates like an addiction until all else is consumed.** Hate and contempt have spiraled out of control in American politics. Trigger warning: it is impossible to write about this while remaining faithful to the narrative of either side. If you are fully convinced either (1) that Trump represents a fascist oligarchic takeover of democracy drawing on the worst racist, misogynistic, xenophobic elements of the American psyche to destroy everything good and humane about America, or (2) that the MAGA revolution will restore freedom and sanity to a system that had been taken over by a deep state that used environmentalism and social justice as excuses to implement a totalitarian control system, or (3) any other narrative that cleaves the world into Team Good and Team Evil, then, well, you will shake your head in consternation that Eisenstein has taken leave of his senses. You will feel frustration, even rage, that I'm making any argument that does not include a full-throated denunciation of the bad guys. How simple things would be then. How easy to be the hero of the story. The paramount goal in war is, of course, to defeat the opponent. The difference between war and games, sports, market competition, and, in normal times, politics, is that in the these latter arenas both sides hold something higher than winning; namely, the rules of the game. Football teams normally do not attempt to poison their opponents. The game itself is more sacred to them than winning it. In a functioning democracy in which all parties believe in a constitution or in a set of norms and values, there are certain taboos they will not violate for victory's sake. **Politics in the United States and many other countries is veering closer and closer to war-inevitable when each side sees the other as the embodiment of evil. Today in my country, both left and right are quite certain that the other side is a \"threat to democracy itself.\"** **In that certainty, each becomes exactly what the other fears.** It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The old political elite and the Trumpian usurpers are locked in a vicious spiral. If either side stints in its all-out pursuit of power, curtailing its ruthlessness out of respect for democratic principles, the other side will exploit this as a weakness. Once one side dispenses with scruples, all sides must. When one team in a football match cheats, the other can win only if it cheats too. When you are fighting evil, all means are justified. You might need to destroy democracy in order to save it, suppress free speech in order to preserve free speech, cancel elections in order to defend elections. War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. It is no longer enough merely to defeat one's opponents in an election; they must be imprisoned as well. The United States, Turkey, France, Brazil, and Romania have all prosecuted opposition politicians during the last year on specious charges, signaling a reversion to the historical mean. In the United States the opposition politician, Donald Trump, survived the lawfare and won the election. The question is, is that a victory for democracy, or is it just a victory for Donald Trump? Will he end the political weaponization of federal agencies like the Justice Department, the IRS, the State Department, CISA, the CIA, and the FBI, or will he merely direct them at new targets? Will he restore free speech and civil liberties, or will he apply the tools of censorship and surveillance to new enemies? Will Donald Trump throw the Ring of Power into the cracks of doom? Or has the Ring merely changed hands, even as technology further magnifies its powers (censorship, propaganda, surveillance, debanking)? I'm sorry, but it isn't looking good. To take one example, \"antisemitism\" (defined as any criticism of the state of Israel) has replaced \"combating misinformation\" as the pretext for violating freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures (surveillance) and the right to due process. The arrests of Rumeysa Ozturk and Mahmoud Khalil for \"supporting Hamas\" (i.e. opposing Israel's slaughter, starvation, and ethnic cleansing of Gaza), and the pressure on universities to shut down student protests, set a chilling precedent. Meanwhile, although Trump is, thank goodness, turning the country away from the warpath with Russia, he is not turning the country away from war's path. War mentality suffuses the upper echelons of his administration. Instead of Russia, the warpath leads now to Iran and China. **War mentality always requires an enemy. If no enemy presents itself, war mentality", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-polarization.txt:3:9b7b1ef7d0ad", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15477, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-polarization.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-polarization", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "Israel's slaughter, starvation, and ethnic cleansing of Gaza), and the pressure on universities to shut down student protests, set a chilling precedent.

War mentality suffuses the upper echelons of his administration. Instead of Russia, the warpath leads now to Iran and China. **War mentality always requires an enemy. If no enemy presents itself, war mentality creates one. The hero nation requires a villain.** The winner requires a loser. If I expect you are seeking to profit at my expense, and treat you accordingly, then you will probably fulfill my expectation. See a world full of enemies, and legions of enemies will appear. To be fair, Donald Trump is by no means an aberration in believing that everyone is trying to get the best deal. That's a basic principle of classical economics, even of evolutionary biology, in which our genes program us to maximize reproductive self-interest. Those paradigms, however, are long obsolete. The discrete-and-separate self is a prism that reveals one wavelength of the rainbow of life, but obscures what we urgently need to recognize today. **Because the world is so much more than a collection of separate competing entities, but is interconnected and interdependent, policies that draw on us-versus-them thinking will inevitably harm \"us\" as well as \"them.\" **War abroad brings tyranny at home. Domestic violence arises to mirror foreign violence. Environmental degradation engenders human illness. And any economic policy that ignores the interconnectedness of the modern economy will backfire on its creator. From what I have observed through my friends and acquaintances on the \"inside,\" Trump's team genuinely believe themselves to be upholding the rule of law, prosecuting their political opponents for real criminality, and defunding corrupt NGOs (that also happen to be run by their political opponents). Indeed, incumbent institutions are profuse with criminality. The agencies that Trump is destroying, like USAID, the NED, and the USIP, were instrumental in maintaining the neoliberal world order and applying the neoconservative program of full spectrum dominance. Trump's team see themselves as reformers restoring honor and prosperity to the nation. \"Drain the swamp\" and \"Make America Great Again\" are not cynical slogans. **Intoxicated with heady ideals, Team Trump cannot see that their program equally fits another description: seizing power.** Confronted with that assessment, some in Trump's circle would probably agree with it. They might respond: \"What choice do we have, faced with a ruthless and corrupt deep state?\" Similarly, his opponents might, in a moment of honesty, admit that yes, they did weaponize the courts, the FBI, etc. against Trump and his allies, and engage in various kinds of cheating, but what choice did they have, when a neo-fascist movement was about to take over the country? **What both sides believe is that the other side", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-polarization.txt:4:1435706f72d5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15478, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-polarization.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-polarization", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "circle would probably agree with it.

If you are convinced the other side will cheat, you must cheat too. No doubt many on each side believe these are temporary \"extraordinary measures\"; that when they have finally triumphed over the anti-democratic forces on the other side, they will cede power back to the people. That is never how it works. Each side believes, with good reason, that victory by the other side will be permanent. Thus, the escalating fight-to-the-death, the vicious spiral, the inevitable car crash. * * * **What has alarmed me the most in my last decade of pleading for peace is not the actions and attitudes of politicians, but the infiltration of war mentality into the general public, the rising level of ambient hate. That is the energy that feeds the most psychopathic elements of the oligarchy. It is its lifeblood. It is its power source. It is how it rules-by turning their subjects against each other.** (I say \"it\" [the oligarchy] and not \"they\" [the oligarchs], because the latter are puppets of system dynamics that are independent of the individuals who occupy their roles.) The key trick in its toolbox of psychopolitical legerdemain is to redirect the primal anger of the dispossessed toward a false target; essentially, to transmute anger into hate. Paradoxically, even when the elites themselves are the objects of the hate, the system that elevates them still flourishes. One elite can be switched out for another, new wine in an old skin. In preparing this essay, I sought some personal stories of the impact of the DOGE cuts to illuminate and humanize the damage. A friend introduced me to some small farmers in a certain left-leaning back-to-the-land region. They were unwilling to speak with me. One of them, a queer person, expressed fear that they would be put in danger (I assume by my frothing transphobic MAGA audience). Another, who described herself as being on the autism spectrum, was concerned by my association with people who promote deranged theories that vaccines have a causal link to autism. I assured them that no harm would come to them, even if someone might read my essay who harbors fear and hatred toward queer", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__war-polarization.txt:5:bb87a6f5484d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15479, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__war-polarization.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__war-polarization", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "to speak with me.

I assured them that no harm would come to them, even if someone might read my essay who harbors fear and hatred toward queer people, since I had no reason to identify them by name or mention their gender identity when discussing the impact of funding freezes on regenerative farmers. As for the vaccine issue, well, OK, I do actually believe that the childhood vaccines are partly to blame for the explosion in autism and childhood chronic disease. But that is no reason to shame the autistic or other neurodivergent people. On the contrary: these people carry gifts that are crucial for the metamorphosis of our society. But I digress. **What was really going on here was that my associations and opinions on certain politicized topics marked me as a member of the opposing side, the bad side, the untouchable side. **In a sense, it *is* \"unsafe\" to associate with me. I have cooties, you see, and anyone who associates with me might catch them. During the McCarthy era, merely to be seen in the company of a communist could devastate your career. To associate with Jews under Hitler was to risk imprisonment or worse yourself. For a Caucasian to be friendly with dark-skinned people in the Jim Crow era South was to risk ostracism or even lynching. It is scary, to associate with the socially unacceptable, because that status is contagious. The fact that my intention was to showcase some stories that might wake people up from Trump Adulation Syndrome (the mirror-image of Trump Derangement Syndrome), doubtless a worthy goal in the eyes of my correspondents, was insufficient to overcome the taboo of associating with a socially unacceptable person. This widening gulf within our society also tends to feed on itself. Once it gains enough momentum, it proceeds inexorably toward civil war or genocide. I have pleaded with the drivers of these vehicles for many years to steer in a different direction. Now I am done pleading. The drama will play itself out. Why am I done? A feeling of futility and weariness. Well, I guess I am not quite done-I'm writing about it right now. **I can already anticipate the hate I will generate by violating the narrative of both sides, my \"failure to consider X,\" my \"white privilege blinding me to Y,\" my \"unwillingness to accept the reality of evil,\" or that I have fallen for Trump, or wimped out and betrayed him, or am a cowardly fence-sitter, or indulging the luxury of both-sides-ism...

It isn't so much that I take personal offense at these accusations, but they are an alarming sign of the times. If I, a peace evangelist, am so easily cast into the ranks of the untouchable, what hope is there for understanding or reconciliation among society's warring factions?** **Yet I do not feel hopeless.** Last week I consulted a wise man, one of my spiritual guides. I won't reveal his name, so as not to infect him with my cooties. I'll just say he is of African descent, and a high initiate in south and west African wisdom lineages as well as the Western hermetic tradition. His fixed me with a penetrating, kind gaze, and told me that my adrenal and blood sugar issues are because my public work has made me a projection figure. The attacks land on my body, he said. I asked him what can I do when society seems to have gone mad. He said, \"Wait.\" That injunction, \"Wait,\" is not a call to passivity. It is to recognize when it is time to act, and when action is futile or counterproductive. It is to recognize as well that there are powers operating in the world far beyond our own. And it is to accept that **certain dramas must play out to their conclusion before a new act can begin. Now is perhaps not the time, at least for me, to urge warring parties to reconcile. The urging falls on deaf ears. Each side sees the peace proponent as a traitor to the cause, since to humanize the other side or acknowledge that it too has a sincere worldview based on its own set of experiences, dampens war fever. Hate is a necessary tool of war-and of politics too, when politics becomes war.** That is a heartbreaking proposition, because the human cost is enormous. The kind of violence suffered in places like Palestine, Rwanda, Yugoslavia, the DRC, Iraq, Yemen, Uganda, Cambodia, or Vietnam has long spared my homeland, but we are not immune. Something primal and terrifying lurks behind civilization's thin veneer. It does not take much for murderous impulses to erupt. They bubble already in social media.

In a sense it has long been underway in covert form. How many millions have died or suffered interminably from incarceration, violence, domestic abuse, child abuse, addiction, depression, and chronic disease? Through long and tortuous pathways, all of these originate in the same root cause as overt war and genocide. They source from the reduction of human beings to something less than sacred. Yet all of them proceed under a facade of normalcy. That facade will drop over the next three years. The disintegration of normalcy is ultimately a good thing. When the dust clears, we will stand amid the wreckage of our prison, full of new questions. **Then we may see that cleaving the world into us and them, and the blame diagnostic that accompanies that cleavage, has failed. We will see that war has failed to bring peace, hate has failed to bring justice, domination has failed to bring security, and control has failed to bring freedom. ** **Those failures of purpose will mirror a deeper failure, a failure of understanding. The ways we *made sense* of the world will no longer *make sense*. Will we have the fortitude to abide in bewilderment long enough for new understanding to grow? Or will we jump fearfully into a new variation on an old story, substituting a new set of villains for the old, a new us and a new them, to enact the same drama once more?** **Note: **The above is a shortened version of Eisenstein's full essay available at [this link](https://charleseisenstein.substack.com/p/when-politics-becomes-war-wait).

The plans were developed as ways to trick the American public and the international community into supporting a war to oust Cuba's ... Fidel Castro. America's top military brass even contemplated causing U.S. military casualties, writing: \"We could blow up a U.S. ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba,\" and, \"casualty lists in U.S. newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation.\" The plans had the written approval of all of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and were presented to President Kennedy's defense secretary, Robert McNamara, in March 1962. But they apparently were rejected by the civilian leadership and have gone undisclosed for nearly 40 years. The Joint Chiefs even proposed using the potential death of astronaut John Glenn during the first attempt to put an American into orbit as a false pretext for war with Cuba. Should the rocket explode and kill Glenn, they wrote, \"the objective is to provide irrevocable proof ... that the fault lies with the Communists.\" The scary thing is none of this stuff comes out until 40 years after. **Note:** Why was ABC the only major news source to report on this highly revealing story?

Not on foreign terrorists, \"the adversary's closer to home. It's the Pentagon bureaucracy.\" He said money wasted by the military poses a serious threat. Rumsfeld promised change but the next day-Sept. 11-the world changed and in the rush to fund the war on terrorism, the war on waste seems to have been forgotten. Just last week President Bush announced, \"my 2003 budget calls for more than $48 billion in new defense spending.\" More money for the Pentagon ... while its own auditors admit the military cannot account for 25 percent of what it spends. **\"According to some estimates we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions,\" Rumsfeld admitted. $2.3 trillion-that's $8,000 for every man, woman and child in America.** A former Marine turned whistle-blower is risking his job by speaking out ... about the millions he noticed were missing from one defense agency's balance sheets.

To even raise the question amid all the officially inspired hysteria is heretical. Yet a brilliant new BBC film produced by one of Britain's leading documentary filmmakers systematically challenges this. \"The Power of Nightmares: The Rise of the Politics of Fear\" ... argues coherently that much of what we have been told about the threat of international terrorism \"is a fantasy that has been exaggerated and distorted by politicians. It is a dark illusion that has spread unquestioned ... around the world.\" Why have we heard so much frightening talk about \"dirty bombs\" when experts say it is panic rather than radioactivity that would kill people? Why did Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld claim on \"Meet the Press\" in 2001 that Al Qaeda controlled massive high-tech cave complexes in Afghanistan, when British and U.S. military forces later found no such thing? **The film ... directly challenges the conventional wisdom by making a powerful case that the Bush administration, led by a tight-knit cabal of Machiavellian neoconservatives, has seized upon the false image of a unified international terrorist threat to replace the expired Soviet empire in order to push a political agenda.** \"The nightmare vision of a uniquely powerful hidden organization waiting to strike our societies is an illusion.

Another of the alleged hijackers may have been trained in strategy and tactics at the Air War College in Montgomery, Ala**., said another high-ranking Pentagon official. The fifth man may have received language instruction at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Tex. Both were former Saudi Air Force pilots who had come to the United States, according to the Pentagon source. The five men were on a list of 19 people identified as hijackers by the FBI on [September 14]. The three foreign nationals training in Pensacola appear to be Saeed Alghamdi and Ahmad Alnami, who were among the four men who allegedly commandeered United Airlines Flight 93. That flight [ended in] rural Pennsylvania. The third man who may have trained in Pensacola, Ahmed Alghamdi, allegedly helped highjack United Airlines Flight 75, which hit the south tower of the World Trade Center. Military records show that the three used as their address 10 Radford Boulevard, a base roadway on which residences for foreign-military flight trainees are located. **Note:** For more on this vitally important news, see the *Washington Post* news article [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/010916post) and the *Los Angeles Times* news article [here](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-sep-15-mn-46069-story.html).

As far back as 1975, Henry Kissinger, then secretary of state, said America was prepared to wage war over oil. Separate plans advocating US conquest of Saudi oilfields were published in the '70s. So it should come as little surprise that ... **four months before the terrorist attacks on Washington and New York - a battle plan for Afghanistan was already being reviewed by the US Command that would carry it out after September 11. **Military strategists were highlighting the energy wealth of the Caspian Sea and Central Asia and its importance to America's \"security\". The Indian media and Jane's Intelligence Review reported that the US was fighting covert battles against the Taliban, months before the \"war on terrorism\" was declared. Over several months beginning in April last year a series of military and governmental policy documents was released that sought to legitimise the use of US military force in the pursuit of oil and gas. A spring 2001 article by Jeffrey Record in the War College's journal, Parameters, argued the legitimacy of \"shooting in the Persian Gulf on behalf of lower gas prices\". Mr Record [is] a former staff member of the Senate armed services committee (and an apparent favourite of the Council on Foreign Relations). **[He] advocated the acceptability of presidential subterfuge in the promotion of a conflict. Mr Record explicitly urged painting over the US's actual reasons for warfare with a nobly high-minded veneer, **seeing such as a necessity for mobilising public support for a conflict**.** **Note:** This highly revealing report on the military planning of wars for oil is well worth reading in its entirety, at the link above.

During a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., seven former Air Force officers once stationed at nuclear bases around the country said that not only have UFOs visited Air Force bases, some have succeeded in disabling nuclear missiles stationed there. \"I want the government to acknowledge that this phenomenon exists,\" said [Robert Salas](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufos/ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown), a former U.S. Air Force Nuclear Launch Officer. **Salas said he doesn't think the UFOs he claims to have encountered had any offensive intent, but he believes they wanted to leave an impression.** **\"They wanted to shine a light on our nuclear weapons and just send us a message,\" he said. \"My interpretation is the message is get rid of them because it's going to mean our destruction.\"** Other former officers recounted similar stories of unexplained moving lights and odd-shaped flying objects during their time in the service. Leslie Kean, an investigative journalist and author of the new book \"[UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record](http://www.amazon.com/UFOs-Generals-Pilots-Government-Officials/dp/0307716848/ref=sr_1_1?s=gateway&ie=UTF8&qid=1285786705&sr=8-1),\" said thousands of pages of documentation support the officers' accounts. She spent the last 10 years researching UFOs and combing through thousands of pages of declassified government material.

The declassified document is called \"Information Operations Roadmap\". It was obtained by the [National Security Archive](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB177/index.htm) at George Washington University using the Freedom of Information Act. Officials in the Pentagon wrote it in 2003. The Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, signed it. The operations described in the document include a surprising range of military activities: public affairs officers who brief journalists, psychological operations troops who try to manipulate the thoughts and beliefs of an enemy, computer network attack specialists who seek to destroy enemy networks. The military's psychological operations, or [Psyops](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060123psyops), is finding its way onto the computer and television screens of ordinary Americans. \"Psyops messages will often be replayed by the news media for much larger audiences, including the American public. Strategy should be based on the premise that the Department [of Defense] will 'fight the net' as it would an enemy weapons system,\" it reads. The document recommends that the United States should seek the ability to \"provide maximum control of the entire electromagnetic spectrum\". **US forces should be able to \"disrupt or destroy the full spectrum of globally emerging communications systems, sensors, and weapons systems dependent on the electromagnetic spectrum\".** The fact that the \"Information Operations Roadmap\" is approved by the Secretary of Defense suggests that these plans are taken very seriously indeed in the Pentagon. **Note:** For other revealing news articles on government corruption, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/governmentcorruptionnewsarticles). **Mind Games** **2007-01-14, *Washington Post*** [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR20070110013...](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011001399.html) A community of people who believe the government is beaming voices into their minds ... may be crazy, but the Pentagon has pursued a weapon that can do just that.

Yet ... the military's use of weapons that employ electromagnetic radiation to create pain is well-known. In 2001, the Pentagon declassified one element of this research: the Active Denial System, a weapon that uses electromagnetic radiation to heat skin and create an intense burning sensation. While its exact range is classified, Doug Beason, an expert in directed-energy weapons, puts it at about 700 meters, and the beam cannot penetrate a number of materials, such as aluminum. Given the history of America's clandestine research, it's reasonable to assume that if the defense establishment could develop mind-control or long-distance ray weapons, it almost certainly would. And, once developed, the possibility that they might be tested on innocent civilians could not be categorically dismissed. **Note:** For lots more reliable, verifiable information on the little-known, yet critical topic of nonlethal weapons, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol10pg#nonlethal).

In the 1950s, Army researchers dispersed Serratia on Panama City, Fla., and Key West, Fla., with no known illnesses resulting. They also released fluorescent compounds over Minnesota and other Midwestern states to see how far they would spread in the atmosphere. The particles of zinc-cadmium-sulfide -- now a known cancer-causing agent -- were detected more than 1,000 miles away in New York state, the Army told the Senate hearings. In New York, military researchers in 1966 spread Bacillus subtilis variant Niger, also believed to be harmless, in the subway system by dropping lightbulbs filled with the bacteria onto tracks in stations in midtown Manhattan.

Those who have not served on the battlefield will never know the changes that happen in the minds of soldiers on the battlefield.** The below *New York Times* article and a shocking video give but a harrowing glimmer of the lives of those living in the world of war.** The 18-minute video [available at this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-Video-US-military-kills-Reuters-staff-Iraq) shows how soldiers trained to treat war like a game can end up killing innocent civilians and even laughing about it. The Pentagon fought hard to keep you from ever seeing this disturbing video. Many years ago, the highly decorated General Smedley Butler of the US Marines wrote an incredibly revealing essay entitled *War is a Racket*.

But people kept asking him about Iraq. And he had many photos, some of them extremely difficult to look at, that were permanent reminders of events that are likely to stay with him for a lifetime. There are pictures of children who were wounded and barely clinging to life, and some who appeared to be dead. There was a close-up of a soldier who was holding someone's severed leg. There were photos of Iraqis with the deathlike stare of shock, stunned by the fact that something previously unimaginable had just happened to them. There were photos of G.I.'s happily posing with the bodies of dead Iraqis. **This is what happens in war. It's the sickening reality that is seldom seen in the censored, sanitized version of the conflict that Americans typically get from the government and the media. ** Americans' attitude toward war in general and this war in particular would change drastically if the censor's veil were lifted and the public got a sustained, close look at the agonizing bloodshed and other horrors that continue unabated in Iraq. If that happened, support for any war that wasn't an absolute necessity would plummet. Mr. Delgado, 23, is a former Army reservist who was repelled by the violence and dehumanization of the war. He completed his tour in Iraq. But he sought and received conscientious objector status and was honorably discharged last January. Some of the most disturbing photos in his possession were taken after G.I.'s at Abu Ghraib opened fire on detainees who had been throwing rocks at guards during a large protest. Four detainees were killed. The photos show American soldiers posing and goofing around with the bodies of the detainees. **In one shot a body bag has been opened to show the gruesome head wound of the corpse. In another, a G.I. is leaning over the top of the body bag with a spoon in his right hand, as if he is about to scoop up a portion of the dead man's wounded flesh. ** **\"These pictures were circulated like trophies,\" Mr. Delgado said. ** **Some were posted in command headquarters.** He said it seemed to him that the shooting of the prisoners and the circulation of the photos were viewed by enlisted personnel and at least some officers as acceptable - even admirable - behavior.

Mr. Delgado said that when his unit was first assigned to Abu Ghraib, he believed, like most of his fellow soldiers, that the prisoners were among the most dangerous individuals in Iraq. He said: \"Most of the guys thought, 'Well, they're out to kill us. These are the ones killing our buddies.' \" **But while at work in a headquarters office, he said, he learned that most of the detainees at Abu Ghraib had committed only very minor nonviolent offenses, or no offenses at all. **(Several investigations would subsequently reveal that vast numbers of completely innocent Iraqis were seized and detained by coalition forces.) Several months ago Mr. Delgado gave a talk and presented a slide show at his school, New College of Florida in Sarasota. To his amazement, 400 people showed up. He has given a number of talks since then in various parts of the country. **His goal, he said, is to convince his listeners that the abuse of innocent Iraqis by the American military is not limited to \"a few bad apples,\" as the military would like the public to believe. \"At what point,\" he asked, \"does a series of 'isolated incidents' become a pattern of intolerable behavior?\"** The public at large and especially the many soldiers who have behaved honorably in Iraq deserve an honest answer to that question. It took many long years for the military to repair its reputation after Vietnam. Mr. Delgado's complaints and the entire conduct of this wretched war should be thoroughly investigated. **Note:** To see the original of this article on the harsh reality of war on the *New York Times* website, [click here](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E5DD1730F936A35756C0A9639C8B63). **What you can do:** Read other powerful, reliable articles on war and the war machine at [this link](http://www.examiner.com/us-intelligence-in-national/fred-burks~topic134534-war).

When the contents of this report are combined with [information from the now closed HAARP facility](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/haarp_weather_modification_electromagnetic_warfare_weapons) jointly run by the US Air Force and Navy, a disturbing picture of large scale manipulation of weather phenomenon arises. How much of this incredible, yet disturbing technology has been developed and implemented in the decades since this report was issued in 1996? **All of the deepest research on these projects is classified for reasons of \"national security.\"** They don't want the public to know about the very disturbing and damaging capabilities they have developed.

A number of methods have been explored or proposed to modify the ionosphere, including injection of chemical vapors and heating or charging via electromagnetic radiation or particle beams (such as ions, neutral particles, x-rays, MeV particles, and energetic electrons).** It is important to note that many techniques to modify the upper atmosphere have been successfully demonstrated experimentally.** (from page 21) **Excerpts from entire paper** In 2025, US aerospace forces can \"own the weather\" by capitalizing on emerging technologies and focusing development of those technologies to war-fighting applications. The purpose of this paper is to outline a strategy for the use of a future weather-modification system to achieve military objectives rather than to provide a detailed technical road map. A high-risk, high-reward endeavor, weather-modification offers a dilemma not unlike the splitting of the atom. **While some segments of society will always be reluctant to examine controversial issues such as weather-modification, the tremendous military capabilities that could result from this field are ignored at our own peril.** From enhancing friendly operations or disrupting those of the enemy via small-scale tailoring of natural weather patterns to complete dominance of global communications and counterspace control, weather-modification offers the war fighter a wide-range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary. Some intervention tools exist today and others may be developed and refined in the future. Current technologies that will mature over the next 30 years will offer anyone who has the necessary resources the ability to modify weather patterns and their corresponding effects, at least on the local scale. **In this paper we show that appropriate application of weather-modification can provide battlespace dominance to a degree never before imagined.** \"The technology is there, waiting for us to pull it all together;\" in 2025 we can \"Own the Weather.\" A global, precise, real-time, robust, systematic weather-modification capability would provide war-fighting CINCs [Commander in Chiefs] with a powerful force multiplier to achieve military objectives. **In 1957, the president's advisory committee on weather control explicitly recognized the military potential of weather modification, warning in their report that it could become a more important weapon than the atom bomb.** How will the military, in general, and the USAF, in particular, manage and employ a weather modification capability? We envision this will be done by the weather force support element (WFSE), whose primary mission would be to support the war-fighting CINCs [Commander in Chiefs] with weather-modification options, in addition to current forecasting support. **Conceivably, with enough lead time and the right conditions, you could get \"made-to-order\" weather.** One method we propose would further maximize the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__weather_modification_owning_weapon.txt:1:551d6e37052c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15500, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__weather_modification_owning_weapon.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__weather_modification_owning_weapon", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "weapon than the atom bomb.** How will the military, in general, and the USAF, in particular, manage and employ a weather modification capability?

To date, much work has been done on UAVs [Uninhabited Aerospace Vehicle] which can closely (if not completely) match the capabilities of piloted aircraft. If this UAV technology were combined with stealth and carbon dust technologies, the result could be a UAV aircraft invisible to radar while en route to the targeted area, which could spontaneously create carbon dust in any location. Recent army research lab experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of generating fog. They used commercial equipment to generate thick fog in an area 100 meters long. Weather-modification technologies might involve techniques that would increase latent heat release in the atmosphere, provide additional water vapor for cloud cell development, and provide additional surface and lower atmospheric heating to increase atmospheric instability. Critical to the success of any attempt to trigger a storm cell is the pre-existing atmospheric conditions locally and regionally. In summary, the ability to modify battlespace weather through storm cell triggering or enhancement would allow us to exploit the technological \"weather\" advances of our 2025 aircraft. Exploitation of \"NearSpace\" for Space Control **This section discusses opportunities for control and modification of the ionosphere and near-space environment for force enhancement; specifically to enhance our own communications, sensing, and navigation capabilities and/or impair those of our enemy.** Communications Dominance via Ionospheric Modification Modification of the ionosphere to enhance or disrupt communications has recently become the subject of active research. A number of methods have been explored or proposed to modify the ionosphere, including injection of chemical vapors and heating or charging via electromagnetic radiation or particle beams (such as ions, neutral particles, x-rays, MeV particles, and energetic electrons). It is important to note that many techniques to modify the upper atmosphere have been successfully demonstrated experimentally. It should be emphasized that this list is not comprehensive; modification of the ionosphere is an area rich with potential applications and there are also likely spin-off applications that have yet to be envisioned. [Another capability] is ionospheric modification to disrupt an enemy's communication or radar transmissions. VHF, UHF, and super-high frequency (SHF) satellite communications could be disrupted by creating artificial ionospheric scintillation. **The ionosphere could potentially be artificially charged or injected with radiation at a certain point so that it becomes inhospitable to satellites or other space structures. The result could range from temporarily disabling the target to its complete destruction via", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:war__weather_modification_owning_weapon.txt:2:023c7a777b2e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15501, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "war__weather_modification_owning_weapon.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "war__weather_modification_owning_weapon", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "are also likely spin-off applications that have yet to be envisioned.

The result could range from temporarily disabling the target to its complete destruction via an induced explosion.** Nanotechnology also offers possibilities for creating simulated weather. A cloud, or several clouds, of microscopic computer particles, all communicating with each other and with a larger control system could provide tremendous capability. Interconnected, atmospherically buoyant, and having navigation capability in three dimensions, such clouds could be designed to have a wide-range of properties. They might exclusively block optical sensors or could adjust to become impermeable to other surveillance methods. **They could also provide an atmospheric electrical potential difference, which otherwise might not exist, to achieve precisely aimed and timed lightning strikes. Even if power levels achieved were insufficient to be an effective strike weapon, the potential for psychological operations in many situations could be fantastic.** According to J. Storrs Hall, a scientist at Rutgers University conducting research on nanotechnology, production costs of these nanoparticles could be about the same price per pound as potatoes. Efforts are already under way to create more comprehensive weather models primarily to improve forecasts, but researchers are also trying to influence the results of these models by adding small amounts of energy at just the right time and space. **Weather-modification is a force multiplier with tremendous power that could be exploited across the full spectrum of war-fighting environments. From enhancing friendly operations or disrupting those of the enemy via small-scale tailoring of natural weather patterns to complete dominance of global communications and counter-space control, weather-modification offers the war fighter a wide-range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary.** **Note: **How much of this has become reality since this paper was published, in 1996? Remember that all of the deepest research on these projects is classified for reasons of \"national security.\" Many researchers suspect those who control these technologies can even influence major events like earthquakes, hurricanes, and tsunamis (see [this revealing article](https://www.wanttoknow.info/050307tsunamibombweapon)).

Below, we explore how the governments of both the US and Iran have co-created decades of collective trauma, and why only a more whole, nuanced perspective can move us forward. To begin, we invite you to pause and reflect on a powerful quote by historian and poet Aurora Levins Morales on the deeper work of transformation in the face of the destructive war machine. * There are people who believe this is human nature. It is not difficult to find a nearly endless supply of such historical repetitions: emancipated slaves turned slaveholders; persecuted religious minorities from England who burned, hanged and crushed heretics and witches; newly independent colonies creating their own categories of the economically and culturally suppressed second class. I watch my relatives reenact the horrors of holocaust, insist they are fighting for their survival against ruthless conspirators, live increasingly militarized lives, believe they have no choices, **become more and more like their wounds.** What are we to do? It is not enough to feel shame. It is not enough to point out the \"ironies\" and use them to condemn the atrocities of a new generation of perpetrators.

Below is an engaging two-page summary.** **WAR IS A RACKET - by General Smedley Butler ** **War is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.** In the World War [World War I] a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict. At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the World War. That many admitted huge gains in their income tax returns. How many other war millionaires falsified their tax returns no one knows. *[Please note these are 1935 U.S. dollars. To adjust for inflation, multiply all figures [X 20 or more](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm)]* **WHO MAKES THE PROFITS?** The World War cost the United States some $52 billion. That means $400 [*over $6,000 in today's dollars*] to every American man, woman, and child. **The normal yearly profits of a business concern in the U.S. are 6 to 12%. But war-time profits, that is another matter - 60, 100, 300, and even 1,800% - the sky is the limit.** Uncle Sam has the money. Let's get it. Of course, it isn't put that crudely in war time. It is dressed into speeches about patriotism, love of country, and \"we must all put our shoulders to the wheel,\" but the profits jump, leap, and skyrocket - and are safely pocketed. Take our friends the du Ponts, the powder people. The average pre-war earnings of the du Ponts for the period 1910 to 1914 were $6 million a year. Now let's look at their average yearly profit during the war years, 1914 to 1918. $58 million a year profit we find! Nearly ten times that of normal times, and the profits of normal times were pretty good. An increase in profits of more than 950%. Take one of our steel companies. Their 1910-1914 yearly earnings averaged $6 million. Then came the war. And, like loyal citizens, Bethlehem Steel promptly turned to munitions making. Did their profits jump? Well, their 1914-1918 average was $49 million a year! Or, let's take United States Steel. The normal earnings during the five-year period prior to the war were $105 million a year. Then along came the war and up went the profits. The average yearly profit for the period 1914-1918 was $240 million. Not bad. **They sold your Uncle Sam 20 million mosquito", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:warcoverup.txt:0:b8253bb4463f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15511, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "warcoverup.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "warcoverup", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "came the war.

The average yearly profit for the period 1914-1918 was $240 million. Not bad. **They sold your Uncle Sam 20 million mosquito nets for the use of the soldiers overseas. Well, not one of these mosquito nets ever got to France!** There were pretty good profits in mosquito netting, even if there were no mosquitoes in France. When the war was over some 4 million sets of equipment - knapsacks and the things that go to fill them - crammed warehouses on this side. Now they are being scrapped because the regulations have changed the contents. But the manufacturers collected their wartime profits on them. If anyone had the cream of the profits it was the bankers. Being partnerships rather than incorporated organizations, they do not have to report to stockholders. Their profits were as secret as they were immense. **How the bankers made their millions and their billions I do not know, because [those little secrets](https://www.WantToKnow.info/financialbankingcoverup) never become public - even before a Senate investigatory body.** It has been estimated that the war cost your Uncle Sam $52 billion [*over $1 trillion in today's dollars*]. Of this sum, $39 billion was expended in the actual war itself. This expenditure yielded $16 billion in profits. That is how the 21,000 billionaires and millionaires got that way. This $16 billion in profits is not to be sneezed at. It is quite a tidy sum. And it went to a very few. **WHO PAYS THE BILLS?** Who provides these nice little profits of 20, 100, 300, 1,500 and 1,800 per cent? We all pay them - in taxation. But **the soldier pays the biggest part of the bill**. If you don't believe this, visit the American cemeteries on the battlefields abroad. Or visit any of the veteran's hospitals in the United States. On a tour of the country, I visited 18 government hospitals for veterans. In them are a total of about 50,000 destroyed men - men who were the pick of the nation 18 years ago. Mortality among veterans is three times as great as those who stayed at home. Boys with a normal viewpoint were taken out of the offices, factories, and classrooms and put into the ranks. There they were remolded. **They were made to \"about face,\" to regard murder as the order of the day.** They were put through mass psychology and entirely changed. We trained them to think nothing at all of killing or of being killed.

We trained them to think nothing at all of killing or of being killed. Then, suddenly, we discharged them and told them to make another \"about face!\" This time they had to do their own readjustment. We didn't need them any more. Many of these fine young boys are eventually destroyed, mentally, because they could not make that final \"about face\" alone. Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die. **This was the \"war to end all wars.\" This was the \"war to make the world safe for democracy.\"** No one mentioned to them that their going and their dying would mean huge war profits. No one told these American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their own brothers here. No one told them that their ships might be torpedoed by submarines built with United States patents. They were just told it was to be a \"glorious adventure.\" **HOW TO SMASH THIS RACKET!** Well, it's a racket, all right. A few profit - and the many pay. But there is a way to stop it. You can't end it by disarmament conferences. You can't eliminate it by peace parleys at Geneva. Well-meaning but impractical groups can't wipe it out by resolutions. Steps must be taken to smash the war racket. **We must take the profit out of war**. And we must limit our military forces to home defense purposes. I am not a fool as to believe that war is a thing of the past. I know the people do not want war, but there is no use in saying we cannot be pushed into another war. **Woodrow Wilson was re-elected president in 1916 on a platform that he had \"kept us out of war.\" Yet, five months later he asked Congress to declare war on Germany.** In that five-month interval the people had not been asked whether they had changed their minds. Then what caused our government to change its mind so suddenly? Money. An allied commission came over shortly before the war declaration and called on the President. The President summoned a group of advisers. The head of the commission spoke. Stripped of its diplomatic language, this is what he told the President and his group: \"There is no use kidding ourselves any longer. The cause of the allies is lost. We now owe you (American bankers, American munitions makers, American manufacturers, American speculators, American exporters) five or six billion dollars. If we lose (and without the help of the US we must lose)", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:warcoverup.txt:2:aeb7aa73ee43", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15513, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "warcoverup.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "warcoverup", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "called on the President.

If we lose (and without the help of the US we must lose) we, England, France and Italy, cannot pay back this money. So...\" **Had secrecy been outlawed as far as war negotiations, and had the press been invited to be present at that conference, America never would have entered the war.** But this conference, like all war discussions, was shrouded in utmost secrecy. When our boys were sent off, they were told it was a \"war to make the world safe for democracy\" and a \"war to end all wars.\" Very little has been accomplished to assure us that the World War was really the war to end all wars. Disarmament conferences don't mean a thing. At all these conferences, lurking in the background are the sinister agents of those who profit by war. They see to it that these conferences do not seriously limit armaments. So ... I say, TO HELL WITH WAR! **For an engaging 10-page summary of this landmark book, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warisaracket) For other powerful, reliable information on war cover-ups and manipulations, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warinformation) For a History Channel video on how Butler stopped a plot to overthrow FDR, [click here](http://www.google.com/search?q=the plot to overthrow fdr&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbo=u&tbs=vid:1&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wv)**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:warcoverup.txt:3:27da858c9399", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15514, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "waremail.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "waremail", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "War **War What You Can Do** ** We now have the opportunity to work together to strengthen democracy and to build a better world by spreading the news on the war manipulations far and wide.** As we develop a critical mass of concerned citizens who demand to know the truth about war, the media will be forced to cover this issue more thoroughly.

The normal earnings during the five-year period prior to the war were $105 million a year. The average yearly profit for the period 1914-1918 was $240 million. Not bad. **If anyone had the cream of the profits it was the bankers.** Being partnerships rather than incorporated organizations, they do not have to report to stockholders. Their profits were as secret as they were immense. How the bankers made their millions and their billions I do not know, because those little secrets never become public - even before a Senate investigatory body. It has been estimated that the war cost your Uncle Sam $52 billion. Of this sum, $39 billion was expended in the actual war itself. This expenditure yielded $16 billion in profits. That is how the 21,000 billionaires and millionaires got that way. **Who provides these nice little profits of 20, 100, 300, 1,500 and 1,800 per cent? We all pay them - in taxation. But the soldier pays the biggest part of the bill.** If you don't believe this, visit the American cemeteries on the battlefields abroad. Or visit any of the veteran's hospitals in the United States. On a tour of the country, I visited 18 government hospitals for veterans. In them are a total of about 50,000 destroyed men - men who were the pick of the nation 18 years ago.

Boys with a normal viewpoint were taken out of the offices, factories, and classrooms and put into the ranks. There they were remolded. They were made to \"about face,\" to regard murder as the order of the day. They were put through mass psychology and entirely changed. **We trained them to think nothing at all of killing or of being killed. Then, suddenly, we discharged them and told them to make another \"about face!\"** This time they had to do their own readjustment. We didn't need them any more. Many of these fine young boys are eventually destroyed, mentally, because they could not make that final \"about face\" alone. **Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die. This was the \"war to make the world safe for democracy.\"** No one mentioned to them that their going and their dying would mean huge war profits. No one told these American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their own brothers here. No one told them that their ships might be torpedoed by submarines built with United States patents. They were just told it was to be a \"glorious adventure.\" Well, it's a racket, all right. A few profit - and the many pay. But there is a way to stop it. Three steps must be taken to smash the war racket: 1) We must take the profit out of war; 2) We must permit the youth of the land who would bear arms to decide whether or not there should be war; and 3) We must limit our military forces to home defense purposes. I am not a fool as to believe that war is a thing of the past. I know the people do not want war, but there is no use in saying we cannot be pushed into another war. Woodrow Wilson was re-elected president in 1916 on a platform that he had \"kept us out of war.\" Yet, five months later he asked Congress to declare war on Germany. In that five-month interval the people had not been asked whether they had changed their minds. Then what caused our government to change its mind so suddenly? Money. **When our boys were sent off, they were told it was a \"war to end all wars.\" Very little has been accomplished to assure us that the World War was really the war to end all wars.** There is only one way to disarm with any semblance of practicability.

They present themselves as the good guys on a mission to make the world a better place and stop corrupt governments across the globe. Yet too often, many national security decisions aren't in the best interests of American society or global populations. Over the last 20+ years, [WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/) has summarized over a thousand news articles on deep corruption within our military and intelligence systems. Going deeper, we have gathered a comprehensive collection of verifiable resources, videos, books, and declassified government documents. **In this information center, we'll present a sobering investigation into the US war machine: what it is, who benefits, and who pays the price.** The true impacts of US military-intelligence activities in countries all over the world are examined, from World War II to our present moment in time. Conflict, war, and perceived national security threats provide a common focus for military and CIA partnership. Military activity is heavily informed by CIA intelligence, and public support for this activity is secured by pro-war narratives and voices flooding our media system. What is really going on behind closed doors and on the battlefields is rarely covered in the news, if only for a brief glimpse. The mainstream press often downplays how ineffective, harmful, and wasteful our current national security strategy is. Over the past century, the CIA's covert actions have led to countless deaths, human rights abuses, and the undemocratic toppling of numerous foreign governments. While entrenched bureaucracy may be responsible for some of these government agency failings, deeper covert actions within our government have led to chaos and suffering in America and all over the world. **Major cover-ups and horrific crimes within the military-intelligence complex continue to remain largely hidden from public awareness.** What is presented in this information center will likely be challenging, sad, and shocking for those who want to know. **Yet real information can be empowering.** It helps us understand the root causes of human and environmental suffering: the money, players, and belief systems that drive the machine. It invites us to question authority in healthy ways, across political differences. Yet most importantly, challenging information can paradoxically remind us of the greater good. It is the courage of the people and the love for the common good that bring these injustices to light-fueling open dialogue and constructive action.

Some of the world's biggest banks [fund the deadly cluster bomb trade](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-Big-banks-profit-cluster-bomb-trade), even as more than 100 countries have banned the unethical use of cluster bombs. ** These powerful financial entities are top shareholders of weapons manufacturers like [Lockheed Martin](https://www.wanttoknow.info/lockheedmonopoly) and Boeing.

In 2022, Lockheed Martin [received $106 from the average taxpayer](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-lockheed-martin-got-106-from-average-taxpayer-while-renewables-got-just-6), which is four times more than what taxpayers spent on primary and secondary education. Few Americans would support these war profiteers if they knew where their tax money was going. Roughly two-thirds of current conflicts - 34 out of 46 - involve one or more parties armed by the United States. In some cases U.S. arms sales to combatants in these wars are modest, while in others they play a major role in fueling and sustaining the conflict. **Of the U.S.-supplied nations at war, 15 received $50 million or more worth of U.S. arms between 2017 and 2021. **This contradicts the longstanding argument that U.S. arms routinely promote stability and deter conflict.

There is a pronounced lack of transparency about the role of U.S. arms in many of these wars, but the fact that U.S. weapons are going to so many conflict zones is a concern in its own right, and demands better tracking of the precise role of U.S.-supplied equipment. Washington needs to take steps to ensure that the financial interests of a handful of weapons contractors do not drive critical U.S. arms export policy decisions. Of the $101 billion in major arms offers since the Biden administration took office, over 58 percent involved weapons systems produced by four companies: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, and General Dynamics. The concentrated lobbying power of these companies - including a \"revolving door\" from the Pentagon's arms sales agency and the leveraging of weapons export-related jobs into political influence - has been brought to bear in efforts to expand U.S. weapons exports to as many foreign clients as possible, often by helping to exaggerate threats. - Excerpt from Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, \"[Promoting Stability or Fueling Conflict?

Over the course of 5 years, the Senate Intelligence Committee reviewed over 6 million pages of CIA records, including but not limited to: operational cables, internal memos, emails, letters, briefing materials, classified testimony, and summaries of over 100 CIA inspector general interviews with CIA personnel. **Most of the report remains classified.** The public was never meant to see any of these horrific war crimes, which caused profound damage to hundreds of people, many of them innocent.

To this day, the government has never brought any charges against him, presumably because he has committed no crime. During one 20-day period, [Abu Zubaydah] was waterboarded 83 times, 24 hours a day. During that period, the suspected terrorist was also slammed against walls, put in a coffin-like box for hours at a time to simulate live burial, and subjected to something the government called \"rectal rehydration.\" **In the end, the two CIA contractors who supervised Zubaydah's interrogation concluded that they had the wrong man. ** - excerpt from NPR, \"[Supreme Court rules against disclosure in torture case](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-supreme-court-rules-against-disclosure-torture-case)\" War as a Tool for Hidden Agendas [Oil](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-secret-us-plans-iraqs-oil).

I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916.

[**The Afghan War Papers**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/afghan-papers-reveal-us-public-were-misled-about-unwinnable-war) revealed a series of confidential interviews with key military insiders regarding the Afghanistan war, in which high-ranking military officials [knew the war was unwinnable](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--us-set-up-afghan-army-fail) while keeping that view [hidden from the public](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/world/asia/afghanistan-war-documents.html). What was exposed were deliberate attempts to manipulate statistics so that the American public perceived military success in Afghanistan. \"Every data point was altered to present the best picture possible,\" said Bob Crowley, an army colonel who served as a senior counterinsurgency adviser to US military commanders in 2013 and 2014.** Worst off, an interview with one official estimated that [40% of US aid to Afghanistan](https://theworld.org/stories/2019-12-11/us-spending-afghanistan-fueled-rampant-corruption-reports-says) had been pocketed by officials, gangsters, warlords, drug lords and insurgents. ** Although US efforts in Afghanistan did pave the way for successes in health, education, and women's rights, billions of dollars [haven't improved safety or the economy](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-billions-dollars-havent-improved-safety-or-economy-afghanistan) in Afghanistan.

The possible presence of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq dominated the airwaves to justify going to war with Iraq, which gave rise to these war atrocities. Yet now, we know that no WMD's were ever found.

We've grown acclimated to the implicit assumptions wrapped in daily news, punditry, and pronouncements from government officials. What happens at the other end of American weaponry has remained almost entirely a mystery, with only occasional brief glimpses before the curtain falls back into its usual place.

When reading about these challenging topics on war corruption, it may be tempting to blame the US government as a whole for these crimes. However, most people in government, including the President and Congress, are largely unaware of these abuses. In fact, most people in our government wouldn't allow such atrocities to occur.

This network consists of defense contractors, law enforcement contractors, private security contractors that hire spies and mercenaries, Wall Street, the elite banking establishment, asset management firms, oil companies, Washington think tanks, and other powerful corporate interests. **What these factions have in common is immensely profiting from war and human suffering, like big banks [raking in billions](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-Big-banks-profit-cluster-bomb-trade) from the deadly cluster bomb trade. **Meanwhile, Congress members tasked with shaping military policy often [own and trade defense stocks](https://truthout.org/articles/meet-the-congress-members-trading-defense-stocks-while-shaping-military-policy/). When the uninitiated think of the \"Deep State,\" they tend to imagine a group of men getting together in a room, smoking cigars and plotting world domination. But the Deep State is not one coordinated network of people controlling the government from the shadows. Instead, it refers to individuals and groups that have the resources to shape the direction of the world to their benefit and don't hesitate to make use of them. At times, the interests of different factions of the Deep State collide. - [Excerpt from an essay by Peter Dale Scott](https://whowhatwhy.org/politics/government-integrity/donald-j-trump-deep-state-part-1/), former Canadian diplomat, professor and co-founder of the Peace and Conflict Studies program at University of California, Berkeley **Since 9/11, private contractors have played an increasingly large role in the Deep State. **Although payments to outside contractors are not made public, it was found back in 2007 that the DoD paid [more than $1 billion](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-defense-dept-pays-1b-outside-analysts) to private contractors to collect and analyze intelligence for the entire military system.

Over the past five years (some say almost a decade), there has been a revolution in the intelligence community toward wide-scale outsourcing. Private companies now perform key intelligence-agency functions, to the tune ... of more than $42 billion a year. **Intelligence professionals [say] that more than 50 percent of the National Clandestine Service (NCS) - the heart, brains and soul of the CIA - has been outsourced to private firms such as Abraxas, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.

Draganovic was hired as a spy for US Army intelligence. Perhaps the most disturbing US-Nazi alliance was the employment of **Reinhard Gehlen**, a close confidant of Adolf Hitler and head of the German Army Intelligence on the Eastern Front. Given Gehlen's knowledge of the Soviets during WWII, US intelligence officials allowed Gehlen to maintain his vast intelligence network. This gave rise to the [Gehlen Organization](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB146/), which functioned as a \"semi-autonomous intelligence unit for the United States and West Berlin, and employed over 100 former Gestapo and SS officers.

However, the 1998 Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act provided a glimpse into the disturbing relationship between the CIA and Nazis. Investigative journalist and author Annie Jacobsen uncovered dark secrets in her book available online for free, [*Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program That Brought Nazi Scientists to America*](https://avalonlibrary.net/ebooks/Annie%20Jacobsen%20-%20Operation%20Paperclip.pdf). The book reveals unsettling truths of American history, using primary sources consisting of general's desk diaries, postwar interrogation reports, army intelligence security dossiers, Nazi Party paperwork, personal papers and unpublished writings of Nazi scientists given to Jacobsen by their children and grandchildren, and much more. Operation Paperclip would flip the moral script in astounding ways. Nazi physicians and chemists worked with the CIA, the army, and the navy to test and develop various nerve agents, interrogation techniques, and extensive mind control programs under the code names of [Bluebird](https://www.wanttoknow.info/bluebird10pg), [Artichoke](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-mindcontrol-studies-had-origins-trial-mindszenty), [MKUltra](https://www.wanttoknow.info/050626mkultra), and more. Nazi chemist Richard Kuhn, who developed the deadly soman nerve agent, would be part of these secret projects, which mirrored the testing done on concentration camp victims and violated codes enacted after the Nuremburg trials. Full access to hundreds of thousands of government documents remains hidden from the public. It's also estimated that the cleanup of the weapons developed during Operation Paperclip costed $30 billion as of 2013: Nixon reinstated the \"retaliation-only\" policy, which meant no new chemical weapons would be developed and produced. Over the next few years, Congress worked with the military to determine the best way to destroy this entire group of weapons. The original plan was to dispose of some twenty-seven thousand tons of chemical-filled weapons in the deep sea. But upon investigation, it turned out that many of the sarinand VX-filled bombs stored at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal were already leaking nerve agent.

The Pentagon also had thirteen thousand tons of nerve agent and mustard gas stored in secret on its military base in Okinawa, Japan, which now needed to be disposed of. In 1971, these munitions were brought to an American-owned atoll in the South Pacific called Johnston Island in an operation called Red Hat. The plan was to store the sarin-and VX-filled bombs in bunkers on the atoll until scientists figured out how best to destroy them. But as it turned out, the sarin and VX bombs were not made to ever be dismantled. So the army had a massive new scientific endeavor on its hands, for which it created the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System, the world's first \"full-scale chemical weapons disposal facility.\" It took another thirty-four years for America's arsenal of chemical weapons to be destroyed. \"The numbers speak volumes,\" says the army. \"More than 412,000 obsolete chemical weapons-bombs, land mines, rockets and projectiles-all destroyed.\" - Excerpt from *Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program That Brought Nazi Scientists to America*, [free online version here](https://avalonlibrary.net/ebooks/Annie%20Jacobsen%20-%20Operation%20Paperclip.pdf) Rise of the CIA This is the house the Cold War built - the CIA.

MKULTRA Program [Project MK-ULTRA](https://www.wanttoknow.info/050626mkultra) was a top secret CIA program beginning in the 1950s with the mission to develop a variety of methods to control the human mind and behavior. US mind control programs resulted in extensive political abuse of psychiatry. According to the [US Department of Energy](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-cia-dod-human-subjects-research-scandals), these programs were largely motivated by alleged Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean uses of mind-control and brainwashing techniques. The US would then embark on a \"mind control arms race\" to close the gap, engaging in experiments that involved drugs, hypnosis, electroshock, lobotomy, and more. The CIA would use the basic science of mind control perfected by Nazi scientists through disturbing WWII experiments in concentration camps. From the end of World War II well into the 1970s, the Atomic Energy Commission, the Defense Department, the military services, the CIA and other agencies used prisoners, drug addicts, mental patients, college students, soldiers, even bar patrons, in a vast range of government-run experiments to test the effects of everything from radiation, LSD and nerve gas to intense electric shocks and prolonged \"sensory deprivation.\" Some of the human guinea pigs knew what they were getting into; many others did not. - Excerpt from *U.S. News & World Report*, \"[The Cold War Experiments](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--cold-war-experiments)\" Declassified documents prove that young women were [hypnotized and trained](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/bombers-assassins-controlled-cia-government) to plant bombs and kill people. **Ordinary people [became super spies](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse) programmed to carry out assassination, terrorist acts, sexual favors, and more without conscious knowledge of what they were doing. **Aerosol tests of LSD [were sprayed](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-did-cia-test-lsd-the-new-york-city-subway-system) inside the New York City subway system.

Before the rollout of the MKUltra program, covert programs like [Operation Artichoke](https://www.paperlessarchives.com/FreeTitles/ARTICHOKECIAFiles.pdf) (formerly known as [Operation Bluebird](https://www.wanttoknow.info/bluebird10pg)) were already focused on the use of hypnosis, forced morphine addiction and withdrawal, and other techniques.

In the wake of President Richard Nixon's announcement on the War on Drugs in 1971, many were led to believe that drugs were an enemy that could be fought and defeated. Yet this didn't reflect the shocking reality that the CIA was covertly protecting drug traffickers while profiting enormously from the drug trade. Consider [this statement](https://www.wanttoknow.info/massmedia#levine) from 25-year veteran of the DEA [Michael Levine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Levine_(DEA)): When Nixon first declared war on drugs in 1971, there were fewer than 500,000 hard-core addicts in the nation, most of whom were addicted to heroin. Three decades later, despite the expenditure of $1 trillion in tax dollars, the number of hard-core addicts is shortly expected to exceed five million. The CIA and the Department of State were protecting more and more politically powerful drug traffickers around the world: the Mujihadeen in Afghanistan, the Bolivian cocaine cartels, the top levels of Mexican government, Nicaraguan Contras, Colombian drug dealers and politicians, and others. Media's duties, as I experienced firsthand, were twofold: first, to keep quiet about the gush of drugs that was allowed to flow unimpeded into the US; second, to divert the public's attention by shilling them into believing the drug war was legitimate by falsely presenting the few trickles we were permitted to indict as though they were major \"victories,\" when in fact we were doing nothing more than getting rid of the inefficient competitors of CIA assets. - Michael Levine When the CIA was experimenting drugs on people in its [MKULTRA program](https://www.wanttoknow.info/050626mkultra), it enlisted a former federal narcotics agent named George White to run [Operation Midnight Climax](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/cia-lsd-sex-climax). In a letter to his former employer reflecting on his career, [White is quoted](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/mission_mind_control_documentary) as saying, **\"It was fun, fun, fun.

But the public didn't get a glimpse into the full scope of government drug trafficking until 1996, when award-winning investigative reporter Gary Webb's [Dark Alliance series](https://web.archive.org/web/20230329231924/https://s171.podbean.com/pb/67eb3441ebb0d57ccedf808dad733bf4/6424a781/data4/fs182/2863195/uploads/GaryWebbSJMNDarkAlliance.pdf?pbss=b4a4ec7f-3f1b-5886-be66-298e20be5527) was published by the *San Jose Mercury News*. [**Webb's reporting**](https://www.wanttoknow.info/massmedia#webb)** drew a straight line from the crack cocaine epidemic in California to a Latin American guerilla army outfitted by the CIA.** Using recently declassified documents, FBI reports, and DEA undercover tapes, he uncovered how covert elements within our government wreaked havoc on American society, especially African-American communities, in the form of rampant drug addiction that the War on Drugs has failed to address. In fact, the War on Drugs has been considered to be a \"[trillion dollar failure](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--war-drugs-trilliondollar-failure)\" that has led to [mass incarceration and thousands of murders and human rights abuses](https://www.newsweek.com/global-war-drugs-has-been-spectacular-failure-1181831). Behind closed doors, the CIA saw Webb's landmark reporting as a \"[nightmare](https://theintercept.com/2014/09/25/managing-nightmare-cia-media-destruction-gary-webb/).\" But they didn't have to do much damage control directly, as the mainstream press ferociously went after Webb's reporting. Thanks in part to what author Nicholas Dujmovic, a CIA Directorate of Intelligence staffer at the time of publication, describes as \"a ground base of already productive relations with journalists,\" the CIA's Public Affairs officers watched with relief as the largest newspapers in the country rescued the agency from disaster, and, in the process, destroyed the reputation of an aggressive, award-winning reporter. - Excerpt from The Intercept, \"[How the CIA Watched Over the Destruction of Gary Webb](https://theintercept.com/2014/09/25/managing-nightmare-cia-media-destruction-gary-webb/)\" Once his reputation was destroyed, Gary Webb died. His death was reported as a suicide, which many people found dubious, because he'd been shot twice in the head. Whether he took his own life or not, the powers that be were clearly allied against him. Using 9/11 as a pretext for invasion, the US government transformed Afghanistan from a place where heroin production was banned by the Taliban into a [total narco state](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/afghanistan-the-making-of-a-narco-state-48475/) that became the world's biggest source of heroin.

However, the tide changed in 1979 with the inception of Operation Cyclone, a massive infusion of funds to Afghan Mujahideen factions aimed at exhausting the Soviet military. The U.S. directed billions toward the insurgents, yet their financial needs persisted. Consequently, the Mujahideen delved into the illicit drug trade.

The Mighty Wurlitzer was a metaphor coined by one of the founding officers of the CIA, [Frank Wisner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wisner). The phrase described the CIA's substantial power in engineering public opinion in support of the US Cold War and anti-communist ideologies. Just as the Wurlitzer organ was used as the background soundtrack of silent films to illustrate what was going on in a movie, the Wurlitzer metaphor was the CIA's self-proclaimed propaganda machine to shape what was going on in the world. We look back and are like: 'Of course the Berlin Wall was going to fall, of course the Soviet Union was going to collapse. But people in the CIA at the time didn't take that for granted at all.

The agency even went so far as to use [American modern art as a weapon](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-modern-art-was-cia-weapon). The CIA paid a vast network of intellectuals, writers, historians, poets, and artists to denounce Russian art and promote American abstract art for subtle Cold War propaganda purposes. Although [American Abstract Expressionist art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism) was relatively unpopular at the time, a former CIA case officer confirmed that promoting this style of American art would be an effective means of discrediting [Socialist Realism art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism), which was rigid and confined in its style. Congress for Cultural Freedom, a CIA Propaganda Assets Inventory Division campaign born in the 1950s, influenced hundreds of museums, newspapers and magazines all over the world.

The CIA also engaged covertly in the [international promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/rockers-and-spies-how-the-cia-used-culture-to-shred-the-iron-curtain) of top rock, jazz and blues artists. *The New York Times* [wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/1955/11/06/archives/united-states-has-secret-sonic-weaponjazz-secret-weapon-a-long-blue.html), \"America's secret weapon is a blue note in a minor key.

Investigative reporter Yasha Levine traces the origins of the internet to a Pentagon counterinsurgency surveillance project, Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPANET). In America's fight against the perceived global spread of communism, military interests didn't see the Internet as the new frontier of freedom and liberating technology. They saw the Internet as a tool for surveillance-collecting and sharing intelligence, and analyzing people and political movements. Here is an excerpt from Levine's book, [*Surveillance Valley: The Secret Military History of the Internet*](http://surveillancevalley.com/): In the course of my investigation, I was genuinely shocked to discover that as early as 1969, the first year that the ARPANET came online, a group of students at MIT and Harvard attempted to shut down research taking place at their universities under the ARPANET umbrella. They saw this computer network as the start of a hybrid private-public system of surveillance and control-\"computerized people-manipulation\" they called it and warned that it would be used to spy on Americans and wage war on progressive political movements. They understood this technology better than we do today. More importantly, they were right. In 1972, almost as soon as the ARPANET was rolled out on a national level, the network was used to help the CIA, the NSA, and the US Army spy on tens of thousands of antiwar and civil rights activists. It was a big scandal at the time, and the ARPANET's role in it was discussed at length on American television, including NBC Evening News. This episode, which took place forty-five years ago, is a vital part of the historical record, important to anyone who wants to understand the network that mediates so much of our lives today.

What was uncovered was deep CIA influence on over 400 journalists all over the world and major news outlets in order to shape American views of the Soviet Union. Some of the best-known, award-winning journalists secretly carried out tasks for the CIA, including recruiting foreigners as agents and planting false information with officials of foreign governments. Canadian Broadcasting Company, *Newsweek*, *Associated Press*, *The Miami Herald*, *Reuters*, and ABC News were just some of the media outlets that conspired with the CIA. The term \"brainwashing\" was first introduced to the American public by Edward Hunter, a propaganda expert, journalist and CIA operative. In a 1950 article for Miami News, he warned the world that China was a huge threat, converting and forcing people into believing communist ideology. The \"brainwashing scare\" was the impetus for the CIA to get more involved in mind control research. CIA director [Allen Dulles](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--new-biography-traces-pathology-allen-dulles-his-appalling-cabal) announced a \"brain warfare\" front against America's enemies, which paved the way for the unethical activities of the CIA's MKUltra program. *The New York Times *was the CIA's greatest asset, as it maintained the largest foreign news operation in American journalism. What also came to light in Bernstein's [investigation](https://www.carlbernstein.com/the-cia-and-the-media-rolling-stone-10-20-1977) was that the publisher of *The Times*, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, had cozy ties to CIA Director [Allen Dulles](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--new-biography-traces-pathology-allen-dulles-his-appalling-cabal). Sydney Gruson, a renowned New York Times correspondent, did [extensive coverage of Guatemala](https://www.salon.com/2015/02/19/our_embarrassing_servile_media_does_the_new_york_times_just_print_everything_the_government_tells_it/) in the early 1950s. This was around the time that the CIA, under the leadership of the Dulles brothers, was secretly executing a violent coup in Guatemala to bring down democratically-elected president Jacobo Arbenz for nationalizing Guatemalan land owned by United Fruit Company, a giant American firm. Gruson would write of Washington's hypocrisy of supporting oppressive dictatorships in Latin America while boasting of its democratic values. The CIA had been spying on Gruson and his journalistic work, building a case that he was sympathetic to communism and therefore had to go. *The Times* publisher", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:warinformation2.txt:30:69b13d95d0d1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15553, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "warinformation2.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "warinformation2", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "leadership of the Dulles brothers, was secretly executing a violent coup in Guatemala to bring down democratically-elected president Jacobo Arbenz for nationalizing Guatemalan land owned by United Fruit Company, a giant American firm.

The CIA had been spying on Gruson and his journalistic work, building a case that he was sympathetic to communism and therefore had to go. *The Times* publisher Sulzberger would agree with Dulles to [keep Gruson out of Guatemala](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/07/us/role-of-cia-in-guatemala-told-in-files-of-publisher.html). **With little public awareness about US meddling in Latin American affairs, the coup was successful. The coup began a bloody period of military dictatorship, civil war, and genocide that killed hundreds of thousands of people. Many suspect that there were many more deaths not accounted for. ** Given the program's obvious abuses of power, Operation Mockingbird was so covert that full knowledge of the program would be restricted to Allen Dulles and a few of his chosen deputies. The investigative committee of Frank Church, officially titled \"Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities\", uncovered a lot of evidence concerning Operation Mockingbird and came to the conclusion that: The CIA currently maintains a network of several hundred foreign individuals around the world who provide intelligence for the CIA and at times attempt to influence opinion through the use of covert propaganda. These individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of newspapers and periodicals, scores of press services and news agencies, radio and television stations, commercial book publishers, and other foreign media outlets. In examining the CIA's past and present use of the U.S. media, the Committee finds two reasons for concern. The first is the potential, inherent in covert media operations, for manipulating or incidentally misleading the American public. The second is the damage to the credibility and independence of a free press which may be caused by covert relationships with the U.S. journalists and media organizations. - Senator Frank Church The CIA's claims that it shut the program down in 1976 are undoubtedly a further deception. There is plenty of evidence that the techniques developed and used under Operation Mockingbird continue to be common practice. **Military and intelligence interests continue to shape society, from influencing the [entertainment industry](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-washington-dcs-role-behind-scenes-hollywood-goes-deeper-than-you-think), [Amazon Web Services](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--details-about-cias-deal-with-amazon), [Google](https://www.mintpressnews.com/national-security-search-engine-google-ranks-cia-agents/281490/), [Wikipedia](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-wikipedia-the-militaryintelligence-complex-how-free-encyclopedia-feeds-national-security-state-from-which-it-emerged), [social media platforms](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-tiktok-chinese-trojan-horse-run-state-department-officials), and other public spheres.

The joint force attacks and exploits information, information networks, and systems to affect the ability of relevant actors to leverage information in support of their own objectives. **This includes the manipulation, modification, or destruction of information or disruption of the flow of information for the purpose of gaining a position of military advantage. ** - excerpt from the [Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States](https://irp.fas.org/doddir/dod/jp3_0.pdf) The open flow of information is crucial to a democratic society. Silencing alternative voices and views through [media manipulation](https://www.wanttoknow.info/008/080916_mass_media_manipulations) and censorship makes it easy for the powerful to hide exploitation and injustice. The suppression of dissent creates the \"illusion of consensus,\" leading to a society that unquestioningly trusts official narratives which have historically been dishonest and manipulative. In a democratic society, there is always a struggle between the machinery of national security and press freedom, and the public's right to know is usually the loser.

This is especially important in a time where the US military industrial complex continues to grow and surge with ever larger budgets, more expansive missions, and increasingly sophisticated technologies.

Given all the money fueling the US war machine, has our global society gotten any more safe, stable, or peaceful?

Butler ** **That war is a racket has been told us by many, but rarely by one of this stature. Though he died in 1940, the highly decorated [General Butler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smedley_Butler) (two esteemed Medals of Honor) deserves to be heralded for his timeless message, which rings true today more than ever. His riveting 1935 book *War is a Racket* merits inclusion as required reading for every high school student, and for every member of our armed forces today. Below is a ten-page summary of the best of this powerful exposé. For a concise, two-page version, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/war/war-corruption). ** **Foreword** **Excerpt from a speech delivered in 1933 by General Smedley Butler, USMC** War is just a racket. There are only two things we should fight for. One is the defense of our homes and the other is the Bill of Rights. War for any other reason is simply a racket. It may seem odd for me, a military man to adopt such a comparison. Truthfulness compels me to. I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country's most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. I suspected I was just part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure of it. Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service. ** I helped make Mexico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested.** During those years, I had, as the boys in the back room would say, a swell racket. Looking back on it, I feel that I could have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents. **CHAPTER ONE: War Is A Racket ** **War is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious.

It is international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.** A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small \"inside\" group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes. In the World War [I] a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict. **At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the World War.** That many admitted their huge blood gains in their income tax returns. How many other war millionaires falsified their tax returns no one knows. *[Please note these are 1935 U.S. dollars. To adjust for inflation, multiply all figures [X 20](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1913-)]* How many of these war millionaires shouldered a rifle? How many of them dug a trench? How many of them knew what it meant to go hungry in a rat-infested dug-out? How many of them spent sleepless, frightened nights, ducking shells and shrapnel and machine gun bullets? How many of them were wounded or killed in battle? Out of war nations acquire additional territory, if they are victorious. They just take it. This newly acquired territory promptly is exploited by the few - the selfsame few who wrung dollars out of blood in the war. The general public shoulders the bill. And what is this bill? This bill renders a horrible accounting. Newly placed gravestones. Mangled bodies. Shattered minds. Broken hearts and homes. Economic instability. Depression and all its attendant miseries. Back-breaking taxation for generations and generations. **For a great many years, as a soldier, I had a suspicion that war was a racket; not until I retired to civil life did I fully realize it. Now that I see the international war clouds gathering, as they are today, I must face it and speak out.** ** Again they are choosing sides. France and Russia met and agreed to stand side by side. Italy and Austria hurried to make a similar agreement. Poland and Germany cast sheep's eyes at each other. All of them are looking ahead to war. Not the people - not those who fight and pay and die - only those who foment wars and remain safely at home to profit.** There are 40,000,000 men under arms in the world", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:warisaracket.txt:1:0aa25ee52bdc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15562, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "warisaracket.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "warisaracket", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "and speak out.** ** Again they are choosing sides.

All of them are looking ahead to war. Not the people - not those who fight and pay and die - only those who foment wars and remain safely at home to profit.** There are 40,000,000 men under arms in the world today, and our statesmen and diplomats have the temerity to say that war is not in the making. Hell's bells! Are these 40,000,000 men being trained to be dancers? Not in Italy, to be sure. Premier Mussolini knows what they are being trained for. He, at least, is frank enough to speak out. The publication of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: \"And above all, Fascism... believes neither in the possibility nor the utility of perpetual peace... War alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the people who have the courage to meet it.\" Undoubtedly Mussolini means exactly what he says. His well-trained army, his great fleet of planes, and even his navy are ready for war. His recent stand at the side of Hungary in the latter's dispute with Yugoslavia showed that. And the hurried mobilization of his troops on the Austrian border after the assassination of Dollfuss showed it too. There are others in Europe too whose sabre rattling presages war, sooner or later. Herr Hitler, with his rearming Germany and his constant demands for more and more arms, is an equal if not greater menace to peace. Yes, all over, nations are camping in their arms. The mad dogs of Europe are on the loose. The trend is to poison us against the Japanese. What does the \"open door\" policy to China mean to us? Our trade with China is about $90,000,000 a year. Or the Philippine Islands? We have spent about $600,000,000 in the Philippines in thirty-five years and we (our bankers and industrialists and speculators) have private investments there of less than $200,000,000. Then, to save that China trade of about $90,000,000, or to protect these private investments of less than $200,000,000 in the Philippines, we would be all stirred up to hate Japan and go to war - a war that might well cost us tens of billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of lives of Americans, and many more hundreds of thousands of physically maimed and mentally unbalanced men. Of course, for this loss, there would be a compensating profit - fortunes would be made. Millions and billions of dollars would be piled up. By a few. Munitions makers. Bankers. Ship builders. Manufacturers. Meat packers. Speculators. They would fare well. Yes, they are getting ready for another war. Why shouldn't they?

Manufacturers. Meat packers. Speculators. They would fare well. Yes, they are getting ready for another war. Why shouldn't they? It pays high dividends. But what does it profit the men who are killed? What does it profit their mothers and sisters, their wives and their sweethearts? What does it profit their children? What does it profit anyone except the very few to whom war means huge profits? Yes, and what does it profit the nation? ** Take our own case. Until 1898 we didn't own a bit of territory outside the mainland of North America. At that time our national debt was a little more than $1,000,000,000. Then we became \"internationally minded.\" We forgot, or shunted aside, George Washington's warning about \"entangling alliances.\" We went to war. We acquired outside territory. At the end of the World War period, as a direct result of our fiddling in international affairs, our national debt had jumped to over $25,000,000,000.** It would have been far cheaper (not to say safer) for the average American who pays the bills to stay out of foreign entanglements. For a very few this racket, like bootlegging and other underworld rackets, brings fancy profits, but the cost of operations is always transferred to the people - who do not profit. **CHAPTER TWO: Who Makes The Profits? ** The World War cost the United States some $52,000,000,000. Figure it out. That means $400 *[over $8,000 in today's dollars]* to every American man, woman, and child. And we haven't paid the debt yet. We are paying it, our children will pay it, and our children's children probably still will be paying the cost of that war. **The normal profits of a business concern in the United States are 6, 8, 10, and sometimes 12%. But war-time profits - ah! that is another matter - 20, 60, 100, 300, and even 1,800% - the sky is the limit. All that traffic will bear. Uncle Sam has the money. Let's get it. Of course, it isn't put that crudely in war time. It is dressed into speeches about patriotism, love of country, and \"we must all put our shoulders to the wheel,\" but the profits jump and leap and skyrocket - and are safely pocketed. Let's just take a few examples.** ** Take our friends the du Ponts, the powder people - didn't one of them testify before a Senate committee recently that their powder won the war? Or saved the world for democracy? How did they do in the war? Well,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:warisaracket.txt:3:526737f28cf5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15564, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "warisaracket.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "warisaracket", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "It is dressed into speeches about patriotism, love of country, and \"we must all put our shoulders to the wheel,\" but the profits jump and leap and skyrocket - and are safely pocketed. Let's just take a few examples.** ** Take our friends the du Ponts, the powder people - didn't one of them testify before a Senate committee recently that their powder won the war? Or saved the world for democracy? How did they do in the war? Well, the average earnings of the du Ponts for the period 1910 to 1914 were $6,000,000 a year. It wasn't much, but the du Ponts managed to get along on it. Now let's look at their average yearly profit during the war years, 1914 to 1918. Fifty-eight million dollars a year profit we find! Nearly ten times that of normal times, and the profits of normal times were pretty good. An increase in profits of more than 950 per cent.** Take one of our little steel companies that patriotically shunted aside the making of rails and girders and bridges to manufacture war materials. Well, their 1910 - 1914 yearly earnings averaged $6,000,000. Then came the war. And, like loyal citizens, Bethlehem Steel promptly turned to munitions making. Did their profits jump - or did they let Uncle Sam in for a bargain? Well, their 1914 - 1918 average was $49,000,000 a year! Or, let's take United States Steel. The normal earnings during the five-year period prior to the war were $105,000,000 a year. Not bad. Then along came the war and up went the profits. The average yearly profit for the period 1914 - 1918 was $240,000,000. Not bad. There you have some of the steel and powder earnings. Let's look at something else. A little copper, perhaps. That always does well in war times. Anaconda, for instance. Average yearly earnings during the pre-war years 1910 - 1914 of $10,000,000. During the war years 1914 - 1918 profits leaped to $34,000,000 per year. Or Utah Copper. Average of $5,000,000 per year during the 1910 - 1914 period. Jumped to an average of $21,000,000 yearly profits for the war period. Let's group these five, with three smaller companies. The total yearly average profits of the pre-war period 1910 - 1914 were $137,480,000. Then along came the war. The average yearly profits for this group skyrocketed to $408,300,000. A little increase in profits of approximately 200 per cent. Does war pay? It paid them. But they aren't the only ones. There are still others. Let's take leather. For the three-year period before the war the total profits of Central Leather Company were $3,500,000. That was approximately $1,167,000 a year. Well, in 1916 Central Leather returned a profit of $15,000,000, a small increase of 1,100 per cent. That's all. The General Chemical Company averaged a profit for the three years before the war of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:warisaracket.txt:4:27fc9a57635e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15565, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "warisaracket.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "warisaracket", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "of approximately 200 per cent.

The General Chemical Company averaged a profit for the three years before the war of a little over $800,000 a year. Came the war, and the profits jumped to $12,000,000 - a leap of 1,400 per cent. International Nickel Company - and you can't have a war without nickel - showed an increase in profits from a mere average of $4,000,000 a year to $73,000,000 yearly. Not bad? An increase of more than 1,700 per cent. American Sugar Refining Company averaged $2,000,000 a year for the three years before the war. In 1916 a profit of $6,000,000 was recorded. Listen to Senate Document No. 259. The Sixty-Fifth Congress, reporting on corporate earnings and government revenues. Considering the profits of 122 meat packers, 153 cotton manufacturers, 299 garment makers, 49 steel plants, and 340 coal producers during the war. Profits under 25 per cent were exceptional. For instance the coal companies made between 100 per cent and 7,856 per cent on their capital stock during the war. The Chicago packers doubled and tripled their earnings. ** And let us not forget the bankers who financed the great war. If anyone had the cream of the profits it was the bankers. Being partnerships rather than incorporated organizations, they do not have to report to stockholders. And their profits were as secret as they were immense. How the bankers made their millions and their billions I do not know, because [those little secrets](https://www.WantToKnow.info/financialbankingcoverup) never become public - even before a Senate investigatory body.** Here's how other patriotic industrialists and speculators chiseled their way into war profits. Take the shoe people. They like war. It brings business with abnormal profits. They made huge profits on sales abroad to our allies. Perhaps, like the munitions manufacturers and armament makers, they also sold to the enemy. For a dollar is a dollar whether it comes from Germany or from France. But they did well by Uncle Sam too. **They sold Uncle Sam 35,000,000 pairs of hobnailed service shoes. There were 4,000,000 soldiers. Eight pairs, and more, to a soldier. My regiment during the war had only one pair to a soldier. Some of these shoes probably are still in existence. They were good shoes. But when the war was over Uncle Sam has a matter of 25,000,000 pairs left over. Bought - and paid for. Profits recorded and pocketed.** There was still lots of leather left. So the leather people sold your Uncle Sam hundreds of thousands of McClellan saddles for", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:warisaracket.txt:5:df15ca870fa6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15566, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "warisaracket.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "warisaracket", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "soldiers.

But when the war was over Uncle Sam has a matter of 25,000,000 pairs left over. Bought - and paid for. Profits recorded and pocketed.** There was still lots of leather left. So the leather people sold your Uncle Sam hundreds of thousands of McClellan saddles for the cavalry. But there wasn't any American cavalry overseas! Somebody had to get rid of this leather, however. Somebody had to make a profit in it - so we had a lot of McClellan saddles. And we probably have those yet. Also somebody had a lot of mosquito netting. They sold your Uncle Sam 20,000,000 mosquito nets for the use of the soldiers overseas. I suppose the boys were expected to put it over them as they tried to sleep in muddy trenches - one hand scratching cooties on their backs and the other making passes at scurrying rats. Well, not one of these mosquito nets ever got to France! Anyhow, these thoughtful manufacturers wanted to make sure that no soldier would be without his mosquito net, so 40,000,000 additional yards of mosquito netting were sold to Uncle Sam. There were pretty good profits in mosquito netting in those days, even if there were no mosquitoes in France. I suppose, if the war had lasted just a little longer, the enterprising mosquito netting manufacturers would have sold your Uncle Sam a couple of consignments of mosquitoes to plant in France so that more mosquito netting would be in order. ** Airplane and engine manufacturers felt they, too, should get their just profits out of this war. Why not? Everybody else was getting theirs. So $1,000,000,000 - count them if you live long enough - was spent by Uncle Sam in building airplane engines that never left the ground! Not one plane, or motor, out of the billion dollars worth ordered, ever got into a battle in France. Just the same the manufacturers made their little profit of 30, 100, or perhaps 300%.** Undershirts for soldiers cost 14¢ [cents] to make and uncle Sam paid 30¢ to 40¢ each for them - a nice little profit for the undershirt manufacturer. And the stocking manufacturer and the uniform manufacturers and the cap manufacturers and the steel helmet manufacturers - all got theirs. When the war was over some 4,000,000 sets of equipment - knapsacks and the things that go to fill them - crammed warehouses on this side. Now they are being scrapped because the regulations have changed the contents. But the manufacturers collected their wartime profits on them - and they will do it all over again the next time.

There were lots of brilliant ideas for profit making during the war. **One very versatile patriot sold Uncle Sam twelve dozen 48-inch wrenches. Oh, they were very nice wrenches. The only trouble was that there was only one nut ever made that was large enough for these wrenches. That is the one that holds the turbines at Niagara Falls.** Well, after Uncle Sam had bought them and the manufacturer had pocketed the profit, the wrenches were put on freight cars and shunted all around the United States in an effort to find a use for them. When the Armistice was signed it was indeed a sad blow to the wrench manufacturer. He was just about to make some nuts to fit the wrenches. Then he planned to sell these, too, to your Uncle Sam. The shipbuilders felt they should come in on some of it, too. They built a lot of ships that made a lot of profit. More than $3,000,000,000 worth. Some of the ships were all right. But $635,000,000 worth of them were made of wood and wouldn't float! The seams opened up - and they sank. We paid for them, though. And somebody pocketed the profits. It has been estimated by statisticians and economists and researchers that the war cost your Uncle Sam $52,000,000,000. Of this sum, $39,000,000,000 was expended in the actual war itself. This expenditure yielded $16,000,000,000 in profits. That is how the 21,000 billionaires and millionaires got that way. This $16,000,000,000 profits is not to be sneezed at. It is quite a tidy sum. And it went to a very few. The Senate committee probe of the munitions industry and its wartime profits, despite its sensational disclosures, hardly has scratched the surface. Even so, it has had some effect. The State Department has been studying \"for some time\" methods of keeping out of war. The War Department suddenly decides it has a wonderful plan to spring. The Administration names a committee - with the War and Navy Departments ably represented under the chairmanship of a Wall Street speculator - to limit profits in war time. To what extent isn't suggested. Hmmm. Possibly the profits of 300 and 600 and 1,600 per cent of those who turned blood into gold in the World War would be limited to some smaller figure. Apparently, however, the plan does not call for any limitation of losses - that is, the losses of those who fight the war.

Or to limit the loss of life. There is nothing in this scheme, apparently, that says not more than 12 per cent of a regiment shall be wounded in battle, or that not more than 7 per cent in a division shall be killed. Of course, the committee cannot be bothered with such trifling matters. **CHAPTER THREE: Who Pays The Bills? ** **Who provides the profits - these nice little profits of 20, 100, 300, 1,500 and 1,800 per cent? We all pay them - in taxation. We paid the bankers their profits when we bought Liberty Bonds at $100.00 and sold them back at $84 or $86 to the bankers. These bankers collected $100 plus.** It was a simple manipulation. The bankers control the security marts. It was easy for them to depress the price of these bonds. Then all of us - the people - got frightened and sold the bonds at $84 or $86. The bankers bought them. Then these same bankers stimulated a boom and government bonds went to par - and above. Then the bankers collected their profits. **But the soldier pays the biggest part of the bill.** If you don't believe this, visit the American cemeteries on the battlefields abroad. Or visit any of the veteran's hospitals in the United States. On a tour of the country, in the midst of which I am at the time of this writing, **I have visited eighteen government hospitals for veterans. In them are a total of about 50,000 destroyed men - men who were the pick of the nation eighteen years ago.** The very able chief surgeon at the government hospital; at Milwaukee, where there are 3,800 of the living dead, told me that mortality among veterans is three times as great as among those who stayed at home. Boys with a normal viewpoint were taken out of the fields and offices and factories and classrooms and put into the ranks. There they were remolded; they were made over; they were made to \"about face\" to regard murder as the order of the day. They were put shoulder to shoulder and, through mass psychology, they were entirely changed.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:warisaracket.txt:8:cc981f421813", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15569, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "warisaracket.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "warisaracket", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "the living dead, told me that mortality among veterans is three times as great as among those who stayed at home.

There they were remolded; they were made over; they were made to \"about face\" to regard murder as the order of the day. They were put shoulder to shoulder and, through mass psychology, they were entirely changed. We used them for a couple of years and trained them to think nothing at all of killing or of being killed. Then, suddenly, we discharged them and told them to make another \"about face\"! This time they had to do their own readjustment, sans [*without*] mass psychology, sans officers' aid and advice and sans nation-wide propaganda. We didn't need them any more. So we scattered them about without any \"three-minute\" or \"Liberty Loan\" speeches or parades. Many, too many, of these fine young boys are eventually destroyed, mentally, because they could not make that final \"about face\" alone. In the government hospital in Marion, Indiana, 1,800 of these boys are in pens! Five hundred of them in a barracks with steel bars and wires all around outside the buildings and on the porches. These already have been mentally destroyed. These boys don't even look like human beings. Oh, the looks on their faces! Physically, they are in good shape; mentally, they are gone. There are thousands and thousands of these cases, and more and more are coming in all the time. The tremendous excitement of the war, the sudden cutting off of that excitement - the young boys couldn't stand it. That's a part of the bill. So much for the dead - they have paid their part of the war profits. So much for the mentally and physically wounded - they are paying now their share of the war profits. But the others paid, too - they paid with heartbreaks when they tore themselves away from their firesides and their families to don the uniform of Uncle Sam - on which a profit had been made. They paid another part in the training camps where they were regimented and drilled while others took their jobs and their places in the lives of their communities. The paid for it in the trenches where they shot and were shot; where they were hungry for days at a time; where they slept in the mud and the cold and in the rain - with the moans and shrieks of the dying for a horrible lullaby. But don't forget - the soldier paid part of the dollars and cents bill too. Up to and including the Spanish-American War, we had a prize system, and soldiers and sailors fought for money.

During the Civil War they were paid bonuses, in many instances, before they went into service. The government, or states, paid as high as $1,200 for an enlistment. In the Spanish-American War they gave prize money. When we captured any vessels, the soldiers all got their share - at least, they were supposed to. Then it was found that we could reduce the cost of wars by taking all the prize money and keeping it, but conscripting [*drafting*] the soldier anyway. Then soldiers couldn't bargain for their labor, Everyone else could bargain, but the soldier couldn't. Napoleon once said, \"All men are enamored of decorations... They positively hunger for them.\" So by developing the Napoleonic system - the medal business - the government learned it could get soldiers for less money, because the boys liked to be decorated. Until the Civil War there were no medals. Then the Congressional Medal of Honor was handed out. It made enlistments easier. After the Civil War no new medals were issued until the Spanish-American War. **In the World War, we used propaganda to make the boys accept conscription. They were made to feel ashamed if they didn't join the army. So vicious was this war propaganda that even God was brought into it.** With few exceptions our clergymen joined in the clamor to kill, kill, kill. To kill the Germans. God is on our side. It is His will that the Germans be killed. And in Germany, the good pastors called upon the Germans to kill the allies ... to please the same God. That was a part of the propaganda, built up to make people war conscious and murder conscious. ** Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die. This was the \"war to end all wars.\" This was the \"war to make the world safe for democracy.\" No one mentioned to them, as they marched away, that their going and their dying would mean huge war profits. No one told these American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their own brothers here. No one told them that the ships on which they were going to cross might be torpedoed by submarines built with United States patents. They were just told it was to be a \"glorious adventure.\"** Thus, having stuffed patriotism down their throats, it was decided to make them help pay for the war, too.

They were just told it was to be a \"glorious adventure.\"** Thus, having stuffed patriotism down their throats, it was decided to make them help pay for the war, too. So, we gave them the large salary of $30 a month. All they had to do for this munificent sum was to leave their dear ones behind, give up their jobs, lie in swampy trenches, eat canned willy (when they could get it) and kill and kill and kill ... and be killed. But wait! Half of that wage (just a little more than a riveter in a shipyard or a laborer in a munitions factory safe at home made in a day) was promptly taken from him to support his dependents, so that they would not become a charge upon his community. Then we made him pay what amounted to accident insurance - something the employer pays for in an enlightened state - and that cost him $6 a month. He had less than $9 a month left. Then, the most crowning insolence of all - he was virtually blackjacked into paying for his own ammunition, clothing, and food by being made to buy Liberty Bonds. Most soldiers got no money at all on pay days. We made them buy Liberty Bonds at $100 and then we bought them back - when they came back from the war and couldn't find work - at $84 and $86. And the soldiers bought about $2,000,000,000 worth of these bonds! Yes, the soldier pays the greater part of the bill. His family pays too. They pay it in the same heart-break that he does. As he suffers, they suffer. At nights, as he lay in the trenches and watched shrapnel burst about him, they lay home in their beds and tossed sleeplessly - his father, his mother, his wife, his sisters, his brothers, his sons, and his daughters. When he returned home minus an eye, or minus a leg or with his mind broken, they suffered too - as much as and even sometimes more than he. Yes, and they, too, contributed their dollars to the profits of the munitions makers and bankers and shipbuilders and the manufacturers and the speculators made. They, too, bought Liberty Bonds and contributed to the profit of the bankers after the Armistice in the hocus-pocus of manipulated Liberty Bond prices. And even now the families of the wounded men and of the mentally broken and those who never were able to readjust themselves are still suffering and still paying. **CHAPTER FOUR: How To Smash This Racket! ** Well, it's a racket, all right.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:warisaracket.txt:11:95947d23010c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15572, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "warisaracket.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "warisaracket", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "munitions makers and bankers and shipbuilders and the manufacturers and the speculators made.

A few profit - and the many pay. But there is a way to stop it. You can't end it by disarmament conferences. You can't eliminate it by peace parleys at Geneva. Well-meaning but impractical groups can't wipe it out by resolutions. **It can be smashed effectively only by taking the profit out of war.** The only way to smash this racket is to conscript capital and industry and labor before the nations manhood can be conscripted. One month before the Government can conscript the young men of the nation - it must conscript capital and industry and labor.** Let the officers and the directors and the high-powered executives of our armament factories and our munitions makers and our shipbuilders and our airplane builders and the manufacturers of all the other things that provide profit in war time as well as the bankers and the speculators, be conscripted - to get $30 a month, the same wage as the lads in the trenches get.** Let the workers in these plants get the same wages - all the workers, all presidents, all executives, all directors, all managers, all bankers - yes, and all generals and all admirals and all officers and all politicians and all government office holders - everyone in the nation be restricted to a total monthly income not to exceed that paid to the soldier in the trenches! Let all these kings and tycoons and masters of business and all those workers in industry and all our senators and governors and majors pay half of their monthly $30 wage to their families and pay war risk insurance and buy Liberty Bonds. Why shouldn't they? They aren't running any risk of being killed or of having their bodies mangled or their minds shattered. They aren't sleeping in muddy trenches. They aren't hungry. The soldiers are! Give capital and industry and labor thirty days to think it over and you will find, by that time, there will be no war. That will smash the war racket - that and nothing else. Maybe I am a little too optimistic. Capital still has some say. So capital won't permit the taking of the profit out of war until the people - those who do the suffering and still pay the price - make up their minds that those they elect to office shall do their bidding, and not that of the profiteers.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:warisaracket.txt:12:dce11489f769", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15573, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "warisaracket.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "warisaracket", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "will find, by that time, there will be no war.

Another step necessary in this fight to smash the war racket is the limited plebiscite to determine whether a war should be declared. A plebiscite not of all the voters but merely of those who would be called upon to do the fighting and dying. There wouldn't be very much sense in having a 76-year-old president of a munitions factory or the flat-footed head of an international banking firm or the cross-eyed manager of a uniform manufacturing plant - all of whom see visions of tremendous profits in the event of war - voting on whether the nation should go to war or not. They never would be called upon to shoulder arms - to sleep in a trench and to be shot. Only those who would be called upon to risk their lives for their country should have the privilege of voting to determine whether the nation should go to war. It would be a simple matter each year for the men coming of military age to register in their communities as they did in the draft during the World War and be examined physically. Those who could pass and who would therefore be called upon to bear arms in the event of war would be eligible to vote in a limited plebiscite. They should be the ones to have the power to decide - and not a Congress few of whose members are within the age limit and fewer still of whom are in physical condition to bear arms. Only those who must suffer should have the right to vote. **A third step in this business of smashing the war racket is to make certain that our military forces are truly forces for defense only.** At each session of Congress the question of further naval appropriations comes up. The swivel-chair admirals of Washington (and there are always a lot of them) are very adroit lobbyists. And they are smart. They don't shout that \"We need a lot of battleships to war on this nation or that nation.\" Oh no. First of all, they let it be known that America is menaced by a great naval power. Almost any day, these admirals will tell you, the great fleet of this supposed enemy will strike suddenly and annihilate 125,000,000 people. Just like that. Then they begin to cry for a larger navy. For what? To fight the enemy? Oh my,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:warisaracket.txt:13:4d5fed35f55e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15574, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "warisaracket.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "warisaracket", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "smart.

For what? To fight the enemy? Oh my, no. Oh, no. For defense purposes only. Then, incidentally, they announce maneuvers in the Pacific. For defense. Uh, huh. The Pacific is a great big ocean. We have a tremendous coastline on the Pacific. Will the maneuvers be off the coast, two or three hundred miles? Oh, no. The maneuvers will be two thousand, yes, perhaps even thirty-five hundred miles, off the coast. The Japanese, a proud people, of course will be pleased beyond expression to see the United States fleet so close to Nippon's shores. Even as pleased as would be the residents of California were they to dimly discern through the morning mist, the Japanese fleet playing at war games off Los Angeles. **The ships of our navy, it can be seen, should be specifically limited, by law, to within 200 miles of our coastline. Had that been the law in 1898 the Maine would never have gone to Havana Harbor. She never would have been blown up. There would have been no war with Spain with its attendant loss of life.** Two hundred miles is ample, in the opinion of experts, for defense purposes. Our nation cannot start an offensive war if its ships can't go further than 200 miles from the coastline. Planes might be permitted to go as far as 500 miles from the coast for purposes of reconnaissance. And the army should never leave the territorial limits of our nation. ** To summarize: Three steps must be taken to smash the war racket: 1.) We must take the profit out of war; 2.) We must permit the youth of the land who would bear arms to decide whether or not there should be war; 3.) We must limit our military forces to home defense purposes. ** **CHAPTER FIVE : To Hell With War!** I am not a fool as to believe that war is a thing of the past. I know the people do not want war, but there is no use in saying we cannot be pushed into another war. Looking back, **Woodrow Wilson was re-elected president in 1916 on a platform that he had \"kept us out of war\" and on the implied promise that he would \"keep us out of war.\" Yet, five months later he asked Congress to declare war on Germany.** In that five-month interval the people had not been asked whether they had changed their minds.

The 4,000,000 young men who put on uniforms and marched or sailed away were not asked whether they wanted to go forth to suffer and die. Then what caused our government to change its mind so suddenly? Money. An allied commission, it may be recalled, came over shortly before the war declaration and called on the President. The President summoned a group of advisers. The head of the commission spoke. Stripped of its diplomatic language, this is what he told the President and his group: **\"There is no use kidding ourselves any longer. The cause of the allies is lost. We now owe you (American bankers, munitions makers, American manufacturers, speculators, American exporters) five or six billion dollars. If we lose (and without the help of the United States we must lose) we, England, France and Italy, cannot pay back this money ... and Germany won't. So.....\"** ** Had secrecy been outlawed as far as war negotiations were concerned, and had the press been invited to be present at that conference, or had radio been available to broadcast the proceedings, America never would have entered the World War.** But this conference, like all war discussions, was shrouded in utmost secrecy. When our boys were sent off to war they were told it was a \"war to make the world safe for democracy\" and a \"war to end all wars.\" Well, eighteen years after, the world has less of democracy than it had then. Besides, what business is it of ours whether Russia or Germany or England or France or Italy or Austria live under democracies or monarchies? Whether they are Fascists or Communists? Our problem is to preserve our own democracy. And very little, if anything, has been accomplished to assure us that the World War was really the war to end all wars. Yes, we have had disarmament conferences and limitations of arms conferences. They don't mean a thing. One has just failed; the results of another have been nullified. We send our professional soldiers and our sailors and our politicians and our diplomats to these conferences. And what happens? The professional soldiers and sailors don't want to disarm. No admiral wants to be without a ship. No general wants to be without a command. Both mean men without jobs. They are not for disarmament. They cannot be for limitations of arms. **And at all these conferences, lurking in the background", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:warisaracket.txt:15:5a233381f4b6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15576, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "warisaracket.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "warisaracket", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "just failed; the results of another have been nullified.

They see to it that these conferences do not disarm or seriously limit armaments. **The chief aim of any power at any of these conferences has not been to achieve disarmament to prevent war but rather to get more armament for itself and less for any potential foe. There is only one way to disarm with any semblance of practicability. That is for all nations to get together and scrap every ship, every gun, every rifle, every tank, every war plane. So ... I say, TO HELL WITH WAR! **Note:** Imagine if we took General Butler's advice and in wartime forced corporations to join our soldiers in making sacrifices for their country. **We could pass laws which guarantee that corporate profits decrease during war rather than increase.** Do you think that wars would still drag on for years as in Vietnam and Iraq?

Democratic Senate candidate Mel Carnahan died in a private plane crash on Oct. 16, 2000, just three weeks before the 2000 elections. **Mr. Carnahan went on to win the race as a dead man against his rival John Ashcroft (who went on to become appointed the U.S. Attorney General!).** [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/election2000/races/mo-senate.html](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/election2000/races/mo-senate.html) Carnahan's wife was appointed to fill his position, but as she was appointed rather than elected, her Senate term was limited to two years rather than the normal six. She lost her 2002 race to her Republican opponent.

His wife died with him. Wellstone had been projected to win the election.** [http://www.thenation.com/thebeat/index.mhtml?bid=1&pid=562](http://www.thenation.com/thebeat/index.mhtml?bid=1&pid=562) His Republican rival went on to take the Senate seat. [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,69286,00.html](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,69286,00.html) **There are many suspicious circumstances surrounding Wellstone's death. **(See media article below and watch this revealing [15-minute video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Jpz9UkPK_hc) of eye witness testimony). The balance in the Senate for years 2002 to 2004 was 51 Republicans, 48 Democrats, and one independent. If both Wellstone and Carnahan had not been killed, and Wellstone had gone on as projected to win his race, the balance would have been 50 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and one independent. This would have significantly changed what happened in Congress and in the US, where the presidency and both houses of Congress were Republican controlled over those two years. **Isn't it quite a coincidence that these two Democratic candidates both died in plane crashes only two years apart, both just weeks before the elections? It's even more of a coincidence that both were very progressive Democrats.** Wellstone was often labeled the most progressive member of Senate. As a *National Review *article stated, \"Probably no other member of the Senate had been on the losing side of more 99-1 or 98-2 votes. None had voted more consistently against the Bush administration*.*\" [http://www.nationalreview.com/miller/miller102502a.asp](http://www.nationalreview.com/miller/miller102502a.asp) And even more strange is the fact that no one in the media has discussed these highly strange coincidences.

With very best wishes, Fred **Note:** On October 16, 1972, just weeks before national elections, two other Democratic Congressmen were killed in a mysterious plane crash. [Thomas Hale Boggs, Sr.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hale_Boggs) was the Majority leader of the House of Representatives at the time. Congressman [Nick Begich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Begich) of Alaska was with him in the plane. Their bodies were never found. Congressman Boggs had been involved with the Warren Commission investigating the Kennedy assassination. To read about the crash, [click here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hale_Boggs#Death).

Paul Wellstone was a serious man who cared profoundly about his fellow citizens. He took courageous stands against an administration that he viewed with profound suspicion, arguing eloquently against tax cuts for the rich, the subversion of the Constitution, and violating international accords. He would have led the opposition to the war in Iraq if only he had had the chance. Everyone knew it and he may have died because of it. For nearly a year now, evidence has been accumulating about the event that ended the life of this magnificent human being. Whatever caused the crash was not the plane, the pilots or the weather. In spite of what you may have heard, the plane was exceptional, the pilots well-qualified and the weather posed no significant problems. Even the National Transportation Safety Board's own simulations of the plane, the pilots and the weather were unable to bring the plane down.

Even the National Transportation Safety Board's own simulations of the plane, the pilots and the weather were unable to bring the plane down. This means we have to consider other, less palatable alternatives, such as small bombs, gas canisters or electromagnetic pulse, radio frequency or High Energy Radio Frequency weapons designed to overwhelm electrical circuitry with an intense electromagnetic field. An abrupt cessation of communication between the plane and the tower took place at about 10:18 a.m., the same time an odd cell phone phenomenon occurred with a driver in the immediate vicinity. This suggests to me the most likely explanation is that one of our new electromagnetic weapons was employed. [see [www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol10pg#nonlethal](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol10pg#nonlethal) for more] The politics of the situation were astonishing. The senator was pulling away from the hand-picked candidate of the Bush machine. Its opportunity to seize control of the U.S. Senate was slipping from its grasp. Its vaunted \"invincibility\" was being challenged by an outspoken critic of its most basic values. Targeted for elimination, he was going to survive. Here's one man's opinion: Under such conditions, the temptation to take him out may have been irresistible. Among the striking indications that something was wrong with the NTSB in its inquiry into the causes of the crash is that Carol Carmody, a former employee with the CIA, the head of the team, announced the day after that the FBI had found no indications of terrorist involvement. Yet it is the responsibility of the NTSB to ascertain the cause of the crash, which has yet to be determined to this very day. So how could the FBI possibly know? The FBI's prompt arrival was peculiar. As Christopher Bollyn of American Free Press reported ([www.rumormillnews.net](http://www.rumormillnews.net), Oct. 29, 2002), \"According to Rick Wahlberg, then St. Louis County sheriff, a team of FBI agents was quickly on the crash site about noon, less than an hour after (assistant manager Gary) Ulman and the (fire) chief had first located the site and found a way to access the wreck. This FBI team had come from the distant Twin Cities in record time!\" When Bollyn \"asked Ulman if he had notified the FBI about the accident, Ulman said he had not spoken with the bureau at any time. Asked how the FBI got to the site so quickly, Ulman said that he assumed they had come from Duluth. AFP contacted the Duluth office of the FBI and was told that the team of 'recovery' agents had not come from Duluth but had traveled from the FBI office in Minneapolis.\" I calculate that this team would", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wellstonecarnahan.txt:2:354f62940678", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15583, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wellstonecarnahan.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wellstonecarnahan", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "\"asked Ulman if he had notified the FBI about the accident, Ulman said he had not spoken with the bureau at any time.

AFP contacted the Duluth office of the FBI and was told that the team of 'recovery' agents had not come from Duluth but had traveled from the FBI office in Minneapolis.\" I calculate that this team would have had to have left the Twin Cities at about the same time the Wellstone plane was taking off. Gary Ulman confirmed to me that the FBI had been on the scene no later than 1 p.m. I have reviewed the log books maintained by the Sheriff's Department at Eveleth and have discovered that they are grossly incomplete and cannot confirm when the FBI showed up. The FAA has told me that its records of private aircraft arriving in Duluth that morning have been destroyed, even though they might verify the FBI's early arrival. And the NTSB has canceled sessions where it would ordinarily take input from the public. Michael Ruppert ([http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/110102_wellstone.html](http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/110102_wellstone.html), Nov. 1, 2002) has reported, \"The day after the crash I received a message from a former CIA operative who has proven extremely reliable in the past and who is personally familiar with these kinds of assassinations. The message read, 'As I said earlier, having played ball (and still playing in some respects) with this current crop of reinvigorated old white men, these clowns are nobody to screw around with. There will be a few more strategic accidents. You can be certain of that.' \" If you think that's a stretch, consider: Hundreds of young Americans have been put in harm's way by a war that was promoted on the basis of lies about weapons of mass destruction, collaboration with Osama bin Laden, and Sept. 11. Some 3,000 Americans were killed when the Twin Towers collapsed, and yet the president and the vice president of the United States have done everything they can to obstruct a open and honest investigation of the causes of that traumatic event. And when a leak from his own administration leads to the exposure of a CIA operative concerned with weapons of mass destruction, the President tells us \"we may never know.\" This is a corrupt administration. One of the oddest events since the election is that Wellstone's successor in the U.S. Senate, Norm Coleman, has been placed in charge of the Senate Investigations Committee. That is an extraordinarily sensitive responsibility to be placed upon a freshman senator with no previous experience. My guess would be that it has never happened before. But the reasoning behind it may not be that difficult to fathom: Would anyone be less inclined to pursue the Wellstone death?

An investigation by the St. Louis County prosecutor would be most welcome.

On my resignation,\nI felt an obligation for the good of the nation and the world to reveal some\nof what I had seen.\n\nAs a result of\na *Washington Post* article covering my resignation because of excessive\nsecrecy requirements, I found myself two months later testifying in the highest\nprofile terrorism trial in Southeast Asia on the manipulations I witnessed in\nregards to the abused, manipulations which were repeatedly denied by top US\nauthorities.

For all citizens who care about the future of our world, this is a must-watch video. This riveting documentary digs deep into the roots of the war on terror, only to find that much of the widespread fear in the post 9/11 world has been fabricated by those in power for their own interests. The intrepid BBC team presents highly informative interviews with top officials and experts in combating terrorism who raise serious questions about who is creating the fear.

Compelling video footage shows U.S. citizens, from law-abiding store clerks to a U.S. Olympian, who have been the victims of unconstitutional policies established under the Patriot Act. Members of Congress describe the replacement of the previously agreed upon Patriot Act by another version quietly slipped into its place just hours before the final vote in Congress, leaving no one time to read the many devastating changes inserted at the last moment.

Each individual on Earth is exploring in a physical body new ways of experiencing life. Through this process of discovery, each of us is developing a deeper level of understanding of life and a greater ability to express our divine essence. This divine essence is the fullest expression of each individual's soul, and most closely exemplifies the Divine's capabilities therein. Divine essence is a level of divine awareness that was \"seeded\" within each soul when it was initially conceived by the Divine. It is also the natural state of the soul that has removed itself from the controlling aspects of hierarchical belief systems through the complete awakening of its sacred intentions. All souls are in various stages of transformation, and all are destined to attain a level of conscious awareness of divine essence as their sacred intentions are fully awakened. **Profound personal transformation is initiated by the realization that you are capable of direct access to the Divine.** This is the realization that the wisdom of the Divine can be discovered deep within your own soul. In other words, your body, complete with its physical, emotional, and mental capabilities, is not the repository of your sacred intentions. Nor is it able to reach out and access this divine inner calling which tirelessly beckons, inviting you towards the glorious joy of ever deeper connection with All That Is. It is the soul that is the harbor of your divine essence. And it is the soul that is the vehicle of access to the awakening of your sacred intentions, which opens the door to profound transformation through the integration of your body, mind, heart, and soul. Through opening to meaningful connection not only with your own divine essence, but with that of all living beings, the experience of profound personal transformation eventually triggers the realization that perceived reality is the Divine personified in the form of individual preferences. Thus when your sacred intentions are fully awakened, divine reality and your perception of reality become inseparable as the wind and the air. This confluence is only completely realized through the full transformation experience, which is unlike anything known within human experience. There have been those upon Earth who have experienced a shallow breath of wind from this powerful tempest. Some have called it ascension; others have attributed names like illumination, enlightenment, nirvana, and cosmic consciousness. While these experiences are profound by human standards, they are only the initial stirrings of divine essence as it becomes increasingly adept at touching and awakening the remote edges of its existence. What most would define as the ultimate bliss is merely an impression of their divine essence whispering to its outposts of form and nudging them to look within to the roots of existence, and to unite", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakers.txt:0:b6782fd0fe1e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15619, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakers", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "ascension; others have attributed names like illumination, enlightenment, nirvana, and cosmic consciousness. While these experiences are profound by human standards, they are only the initial stirrings of divine essence as it becomes increasingly adept at touching and awakening the remote edges of its existence. What most would define as the ultimate bliss is merely an impression of their divine essence whispering to its outposts of form and nudging them to look within to the roots of existence, and to unite with the formless and limitless divine intelligence that pervades all. The full transformation experience is far beyond the scope of the human drama, much like the stars in the sky are beyond the touch of Earth. We can see the stars with our human eyes, but we will never touch them with our human hands. Similarly, we can dimly foresee the transformation experience, but we cannot fully experience it as humans. It is accessed through the wholeness of the soul, for it is only in wholeness that the soul's sacred intentions and their catalytic effect of divine perception can be fully experienced. This level of wholeness is attained only when the individual consciousness has separated from time and is able to view its existence in timelessness. Nevertheless, the human experience is essential in facilitating personal transformation and causing it to trigger - like a metamorphosis - the integration of your formful identities into divine essence. Self-mastery through personal transformation is the next stage of perception and expression for your soul. It is initiated when you choose to design your life based upon principles that are symbolic of the Divine. **As you become increasingly responsive to the Divine, you naturally gravitate towards life principles that symbolically express the formative principles of divine creation. ** The below principles are divine templates of creation. They are designed to help you experience life from the perspective of divine essence. They are principles that construct opportunities for the integration of your formless and formful identities. They are bridges through which you can access the experience of wholeness by perceiving with your divine essence. There is a wide range of means that can facilitate self-mastery through personal transformation and disengage the soul from external controls. Inasmuch as the means may vary, the intent behind the means is quite narrowly defined as the intent to expand into a state of integration whereby all aspects of your conscious self become increasingly aligned with your divine essence. **There are three particular life principles that help to align your perspective with the perspective of divine essence and thus inspire profound transformation. ** They are: **1) Seeing the Divine in all 2) Nurturance of life ** ** 3) Gratitude** When you apply these principles, a deeper meaning will be revealed to the seemingly random events of your life experience - both in the personal and universal contexts. **Seeing the Divine in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakers.txt:1:118b952dd609", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15620, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakers", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "self become increasingly aligned with your divine essence. **There are three particular life principles that help to align your perspective with the perspective of divine essence and thus inspire profound transformation. ** They are: **1) Seeing the Divine in all 2) Nurturance of life ** ** 3) Gratitude** When you apply these principles, a deeper meaning will be revealed to the seemingly random events of your life experience - both in the personal and universal contexts. **Seeing the Divine in All** This is the principle that the Divine is present and can be seen everywhere and in all manifestations of life. It is interwoven in all things like an intricate mosaic whose pieces adhere to the same wall, and are thus unified. However, it is not the picture that unifies the mosaic, but the underlying wall upon which its pieces adhere. Similarly, the Divine paints a picture so diverse and seemingly unrelated that there appears to be no unification. Yet it is not the outward manifestations that unify. It is the inward center of divine energy upon which the pieces of diversity are layered that unifies all life. This centerpiece of divine energy is the collective storehouse of all life within the universe. It is the full expression of the Divine, which invests itself in all forms through the projection of its divine intelligence into all manifestations of life. Thus, divine intelligence - acting as an extension of the Divine - is the unifying energy that is the \"wall\" upon which all the pieces of life's mosaic adhere. **Seeing the Divine in all is the principle that all manifestations of life convey an expression of All That Is.** It does not matter how far the unifying energy has been distorted or corrupted; the Divine can be observed. It is the action of perceiving the unification of energy even when the outward manifestations appear random, distorted, or chaotic. It is the realization that all life flows from one divine energy source that links one to All and all to One. When every manifestation of life can be genuinely perceived as a fragmentary expression of All That Is, the vibration of equality that underlies all life becomes perceptible to you. You realize that life initially emerges as an extension of the Divine, and then, as an individuated energy frequency invested within a form. This individuated energy vibrates, in its pure, timeless state, precisely the same for all manifestations of life. This is the common ground that all life shares. This is the tone or vibration of equality that can be observed within all life forms that unifies all expressions of diversity to the very foundation of existence. If you are able to look upon any and all forms of life with the outlook of equality, then you are seeing the Divine in all.

This is the tone or vibration of equality that can be observed within all life forms that unifies all expressions of diversity to the very foundation of existence. If you are able to look upon any and all forms of life with the outlook of equality, then you are seeing the Divine in all. While this may seem like an abstract concept, it is actualized through the practice of looking for both the outward and inward manifestations of the Divine. In a very real sense, you expect to observe the workings of divine intelligence in every facet of your experience. The principle of seeing the Divine in all is the unassailable expectation that everything is in its rightful position, performing its rightful function, and serving its purpose to activate the fullest expression of its life in the present moment. It is the outlook that all life is in a state of optimal realization and experience regardless of condition or circumstance. It is the perception that life is perfect in its expression because it flows from perfection, and that no matter how divergent its manifestations are, all life is an extension of the Divine. In light of the obvious turmoil and destruction that are apparent on Earth, this is an outlook or perception that may seem naive. How can life - in all its forms and expressions - be perceived as optimal or perfect? This is the great paradox of life, and it cannot be reconciled with your mental or emotional capabilities. It can only be understood in the context of the soul, which is deathless, timeless, limitless, and sovereign. Paradoxes exist because the human drama is too limited in scope and scale to allow a perception of wholeness to illuminate how the pieces of the puzzle are perfectly interconnected in the ever-unfolding divine cosmic dance. The human drama is circumscribed by the dimensions of time and space and the elements of energy and matter. It is played out upon the stages of survival and dysfunctional behavior because of the methods of controlling information and manipulating conditions used by those operating within the [hierarchical paradigm](https://www.WantToKnow.info/divinewisdomunderstanding). The soul within the human body is largely unexpressed and underutilized in this human drama, and therefore, life's apparent perversions and imperfections are seen in isolation as impediments to perfection rather than perfection itself. **Life is perfect in its resolve to expand and express an intelligence that is limitless. This is the fundamental purpose of life in all its diverse manifestations. ** The presence of the Divine expressing itself as a vibration of equality can be seen in all things.

Sensory input derived from the human body is limited to frequencies in specific ranges that only convey an echo of this divine vibration. **The divine resonance of all life is understood only through deliberate and focused contemplation of the equality inherent in all things, and through the ability to penetrate beyond the image of a thing to the origin of the image. ** These insights stimulate a new sensory system beyond the five senses that rule the physical world. These new senses are an outgrowth of the awakening of your sacred intentions. They are manifestations of the first stage of personal transformation. **With this new perceptual ability, you will be capable of sensing not only the presence of the Divine, but also the timeless divine essence within all life that is individualized and uniquely separate from the Divine. ** Calling forth the divine perceptions of the soul within your own being is the ideal method to access lasting sensitivity to the divine vibration. This is how you develop the ability to see the Divine in all. It is not only that the Divine is found within you and within every individual manifestation of life; it is also in itself the wholeness of all life. Thus, this principle calls for seeing the Divine in all its diverse forms of manifestation, as well as in the wholeness of life itself. **Nurturance of Life** Life, in this definition, is an individual's sovereign reality. It is subjective and impressionable. Life is the wholeness of experience flowing past the individual's field of perception in the present moment. There is never a closure to life, nor a final chapter written. It is eternal, not so much in the abstract sense of never ending or beginning, but rather in the real sense that life is ever expanding in order to express divine intelligence in all realities within the universe. Nurturance of life is the principle whereby an individual is in alignment with the natural expansion of intelligence inherent within all life. This alignment enhances the life energy that flows past the individual with the clear intent of gentle support.** It is the action of opening to the highest motive in all people and in all life and supporting the flow of this highest intention towards its ultimate expression. **In so doing, the action is performed without judgment, analysis, or attachment to outcome. It involves simply nurturing the highest energy that flows from all people and all beings, and thus supporting the fullest expression of their deepest essence. This is a departure from the normal perception that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakers.txt:4:21fab861f453", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15623, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakers", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "of gentle support.** It is the action of opening to the highest motive in all people and in all life and supporting the flow of this highest intention towards its ultimate expression. **In so doing, the action is performed without judgment, analysis, or attachment to outcome. It involves simply nurturing the highest energy that flows from all people and all beings, and thus supporting the fullest expression of their deepest essence. This is a departure from the normal perception that nurturing support can only be granted when others are in alignment with your personal will and desires. When, instead, you view everything in your life as an integrated energy flowing as an expression of ever-expanding divine intelligence, all life is honored as an extension of the Divine. In this context, there is no energy that is misdirected or unworthy of support and nurturance. While this may seem contrary to the evidence of abusive energy upon the Earth, even energy that is laden with \"evil intent\" is nevertheless energy that is flowing outward in search of a higher expression. All people and all forms of life can be nurtured and supported to their highest expression. This is the fundamental purpose of this principle. It is greatly facilitated by the intention to perceive the original motive and ultimate expression of life energy as it passes through your field of awareness. **Energy is an element of life that is so subtly interwoven with form that it is one, in much the same manner as space and time are inextricably linked in union.** Energy is a motive. It is intelligent beyond the mind's ability to reason. While it is a force that can be subject to applications that deny its highest expression, energy is always imbuing life with the motive to expand and evolve. Life energy is always in a state of becoming. It is never static or regressive in its natural state. You are very capable of nurturing this natural expansion of energy to forge new channels of expression and experience. In fact, **it is your primary purpose to expand the life energy that encircles your personal reality, and to transform it to new levels of expression that more clearly reflect the perspective of divine essence. ** There are many specific actions that can be taken to nurture life. Each soul has the innate ability to transform energy through a tremendous variety of means. Working through your body, your soul is able to collect and store energy and redirect its purpose or application. This transformation of energy can occur on both personal and universal levels of expression. That is, within an individual's field of awareness, energy can be transformed at any time to conform more to a vision of personal welfare, or aligned with a vision of universal welfare and goodwill.

That is, within an individual's field of awareness, energy can be transformed at any time to conform more to a vision of personal welfare, or aligned with a vision of universal welfare and goodwill. One of the best methods to transform energy is through exploring one's belief system. **All beliefs have energy systems that act like birthing chambers for the manifestation of your perceived reality. **Within these energy systems are currents that direct life experience. Your soul is aware of these currents either consciously or unconsciously and allows them to carry you into realms of experience that engage your core belief system. By cultivating beliefs that expand and transform energy, you are more able to explore energy systems that are nurturing to life in all its myriad forms. When your beliefs are clearly defined as intentions - as preferred states of being - your life energy engages more fully in the present moment. Your energy system becomes inseparable from your being and woven into your spirit like a thread of light. **[Clarity of intention](https://www.WantToKnow.info/lifepurposeintentions) is essential to engaging the energy system of your core beliefs, and to allowing the nurturance of life to prevail in all activities. ** The nurturance of life is essential to both personal and collective realities within the universe, which contains all realities that are interlinked like threads of an infinitely expanding fabric. Thus, as you awaken to your own creative power to transform life energy outside of yourself and enhance it with the clear intent of gentle support, you naturally experience ever-unfolding transformation within yourself as well. You become an increasingly clear beacon of the Divine and the architect of a new paradigm based upon the intention to nurture all life in the universe. **Gratitude ** This principle is based on the understanding that the universe represents a collective intelligence that can be personalized as a single universal soul - a composite expression of the Divine. Thus, in this perspective, there are only two souls in the entire cosmos: the individual soul and the universal soul. Inasmuch as the individual is impressionable and constantly changing to adapt to new information, so is the universal soul, which is a dynamic, living template of potential energies and experiences that are coherent and as knowable as a friend's personality and behavior. The universal soul is responsive to the individual soul and its beliefs and perceptions. It is like a composite omni-personality that is imbued with divine intelligence and responds to the perceptions and belief systems of the individual like a pool of water mirrors the image that overshadows it. **Everyone is indeed, at their innermost core, a sovereign soul that can transform themselves into", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakers.txt:6:3a4736b87875", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15625, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakers", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "of potential energies and experiences that are coherent and as knowable as a friend's personality and behavior.

It is like a composite omni-personality that is imbued with divine intelligence and responds to the perceptions and belief systems of the individual like a pool of water mirrors the image that overshadows it. **Everyone is indeed, at their innermost core, a sovereign soul that can transform themselves into an instrument of divine essence.** However, this transformation is dependent on whether the individual chooses to project an image of divine essence upon the \"mirror\" of the universal soul, or to project a lesser image that is a distortion of its essential state of being. The principle of gratitude is primarily concerned with consciously designing your self-image through an appreciation of the universal soul's supportive mirror. In other words, the universal soul is a partner in shaping reality's expression in your life. If you choose to project a transformed image upon the mirror of the universal soul, reality gradually becomes an internal process of creation that is increasingly free of external controls and conditions. This process involves an interchange of supportive energy between the individual and the universal soul. This energy is best applied through an appreciation of how perfect and exacting this interchange occurs in every moment of life. If you are aware - or at least interested in having the awareness - of how perfectly the Divine, as expressed in the form of the universal soul, supports your sovereign reality, there is a powerful and natural sense of gratitude that flows from you to the Divine. **It is this wellspring of gratitude that opens wide the channel of support from the Divine to the individual and establishes a collaboration of purpose to transform the individual soul into a pure expression of divine essence. ** It is principally gratitude - which arises naturally through appreciation of how the relationship between the individual and the universal soul operates - that opens you to connection with your divine essence, and to your eventual transformation into the state of perception and expression of divine essence. The relationship of the individual with the universal soul is essential to cultivate and nurture, because this relationship, more than anything else, determines how accepting each individual is of life's myriad forms and manifestations. When you accept changes in your sovereign reality as the shifting persona of the universal soul, you live in greater harmony with life itself. Life becomes an exchange of energy between you and the universal soul that is allowed to play out without judgment, and is experienced without fear. **This is the underlying meaning of unconditional love: to experience life in all its manifestations as a single, unified intelligence that responds perfectly to the projected image of each soul. ** It is for", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakers.txt:7:14e60fdbd8f4", "wtk_id": NaN}]
