Its use against individuals that pose no violent threat may seem surprising, but it is noted by Krishnan that this was used against peace activists in the 1980s in Great Britain by the British Intelligence services (Krishnan 2017, 120), which practiced their craft in Northern Ireland such as Operation Clockwork Orange. As one researcher has noted: According to statements made by captured and deserting Iraqi soldiers, however, the most devastating and demoralizing programming was the first known military use of the new, high-tech, type of subliminal messages referred to as ultra-high frequency ‘silent sounds’ or ‘silent subliminal.’ Although completely silent to the human ear, the negative voice messages placed on the tapes alongside the audible programming by PSY-OPS psychologists were clearly perceived by the subconscious minds of the Iraqi soldiers and the silent messages completely demoralized them and instilled a perpetual feeling of fear and hopelessness in their minds. (Krishnan 2017, 132) CIA engineer, Dr. Robert Duncan, who worked on these projects has stated that during the war neuroweapon technology was also used to mimic the voices of Iraqi generals to create confusion in Iraqi Command and Control by giving conflicting orders and repositioning troops into positions for easy capture and defeat, which is supported by Dr. Begich: …armed violence will assume a secondary position in the future as different forms and methods of adversely influencing a state, a society, or an individual will appear. Such developments include changing the technogenic shell of civilization, making a distinction between living and nonliving things uncertain. Here the real issue is cyber life, he notes. New gene combinations will be designed that do not currently exist, while nanobots will alter the characteristics of an organism. New conflicts will, in Burenko’s opinion, not be so much “wars between people as wars of artificial intellects and the equipment and virtual reality created by this kind of intellect.” (Krishnan 2017, 190-1) …biotechnology and nanotechnology could be employed for remaking human life and reshaping human civilization as a method of war. The Russian strategist also seems to believe that military decision-making will be largely delegated to AI, turning warfare in[to] a contest of competing military AI systems. (Krishnan 2017, 191) The Asian Human Rights Commission released a statement on neuroweapons in 2013: The threat is real… [there are] many indications that brain technology for neuroweapons is scientifically possible. Additionally, some say such technologies have been used systematically against select people in various jurisdictions. (Krishnan 2017, 206) he history of Neuroweapons begins around the 1920s in the new Soviet Union. It was an early Soviet scientist that first formulated conceptions of ‘Biological Radio’ or what we would now call Synthetic Telepathy.

It was the Soviets and Germans that developed a dual institute: ‘The Brain Institute’ with one located in Berlin and a sister institution in Moscow. As mentioned previously the secret agreement between Soviet Russia and the Reichswehr of the German Government facilitated the exchange of technology between the two. Jochen Richter notes about this collaboration: Of the many interwar connections between Germany and Russia, one of the most unusual - and least explored - is medicine and public health. Between 1922 and 1932, with high-level political support and government funding, Soviet and German physicians and public health specialists collaborated in joint research expeditions, published joint articles, launched a bi-lingual journal, and established joint research institutions. Surprisingly, students of Soviet-German relations have all but ignored this medical collaboration; while historians of science have treated it as political history, an exercise in cultural diplomacy designed to mitigate the impact of the postwar exclusion of both nations from the international science. (Solomon 2006) The founder of the dual Brain Institute was Oskar Vogt, whose early research was underwritten by the German Armaments producer Krupp. Vogt, being a socialist, was later replaced by the Nazi regime, after which his new institution again was underwritten by the Krupps[1]. Already, we see an interest in weapons developers in Brain research and underwriting such research from the very beginnings. The Berlin Brain Institute eventually became the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research (Kaiser Institut für Hirnforschung), whose building was financed by the Rockefeller Foundation. Vogt was also interested in hypnotism; a famous collaborator of his was Korbinian Brodmann, for whom different areas of the brain are referred to as Brodmann areas. The early research into telepathy was conducted by several Russian researchers. In 1919 V.M. Bekhterev, who also worked with the Brain Institute in Moscow and a research center in Leningrad, began research into the scientific understanding of telepathy. A Defense Intelligence Agency document from 1978 notes about Bekhterev: In 1919, V. M. Bekhterev, a noted physiologist at the Institute of Brain Research of the University of Leningrad, began investigations into unusual psychological and physiological effects associated with the hypnotic state, including cases of apparent telepathic experiences. Pavlov had also made reference to unusual abilities sometimes observed in animals and man and was open to such investigations. Bekhterev organized a special group (Commission for the Study of Mental Suggestion) to continue and elaborate on his early work. L. L. Vasil’yev, a research physiologist who joined this instutie in 1921, was part of this commission.

Vasil’yev, a research physiologist who joined this instutie in 1921, was part of this commission. Vasil’yev’s initial work was on effects of magnetic fields on psychological state, eventually he became the prime researcher in the area termed ‘mental suggestion.’ In addition to laboratory experiments with hypnotized people, Vasil’yev also began to collect and evaluate naturally occurring incidents (i.e. spontaneous cases) that were suggestive of telepathic processes. He also established contact with researchers in other countries, particularly with the noted French physiologist, Charles Richet, who also conducted psychic experiments with hypnotized people. (DoD, 1978) In 1926 Vasil’yev published results of this early research and postulated electromagnetic radiation from the brain as a possible explanation. In the same year a special board was established at the Brain Research Institute to duplicate his findings, but its study did not yield definite results. However, later experiments with a different test person (subject) were stated to be positive and supportive of Vasil’yev’s initial observations. In 1932 the Institute was given an assignment to initiate an experimental study of telepathy with the aim of determining, if possible, a physical basis for its explanation. Vasil’yev was selected to direct this investigation. This work continued until 1938 when World War II interrupted activities. After that, Vasil’yev continued to collect evidence of spontaneous cases and pursued unofficial investigations on his own. The main orientation of his research during this period was on telepathic induction of specific motor acts, on transmission of visual images from one person (sender) to another (receiver), and remotely induce sleep or awakening in a hypnotized subject. His initial subjects were easily suggestible or hypnotizable hysteric or neurasthenic patients [highly hypnotizable type]. Later, Vasil’yev found certain normal people appeared to have repeatable psychic aptitude without being hypnotized. Some of these experiments involved attempts at transmission of black or white targets and also specific drawings. Vasil’yev found a few cases where results were far greater than chance expectancy (10^( − 7)) , and he also reported data showing high correlation between some of the complex drawings used as targets. Tsiolkovskiy, interestingly, draws a connection between telepathy and space travel, which presages the work of Heim and Dubrov, who posited a gravitational effect for psi phenomena and field propulsion. Tsiolkovskiy also had the fascinating idea that there was an Intelligence that governed humans as “marionettes, mechanical puppets, machines, movie characters.” This Intelligence is remarkably similar to the ideal of neuroweapons, or ‘thought injection’, yet decades before any known such system ever existed. Another researcher in telepathy that was influenced by Tsiolkovskiy was Chizhevskiy, Vasiliev also wrote the article “Critical Evaluation of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:54:bbd4e8d3a3ee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2407, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 55, "text": "presages the work of Heim and Dubrov, who posited a gravitational effect for psi phenomena and field propulsion.

Another researcher in telepathy that was influenced by Tsiolkovskiy was Chizhevskiy, Vasiliev also wrote the article “Critical Evaluation of the Hypnogenic Method” concerning the work of Dr. I. F. Tomashevsky on experiments in remote control of the brain. Also, the early work of B.B. Kazhinsky is of note, one of the few working in this area whose work is not classified, as he did his research outside the control of the Soviet Security State. Kazhinsky, being a publicly known researcher, even had his research in Biological Radio (биологической радиосвязи) popularized at an early point through a fictitious account of his research in the Science Fiction novel, The Ruler of the World (Властелин мира: роман Беляева — Википедия) by Alexander Belyaev (1926) which told the story of a German banker who used remote telepathy or transcommunication to seize control of a financial empire with what would be later termed “mind control.” The novel’s fantastic idea goes back to the research of Hans Berger, who studied the electrical activity of the brain. Many characters of the novel have real prototypes. A remote prototype of Stirner carries the individual features of A. L. Chizhevsky. The image of Dugov is associated with the trainer Vladimir Leonidovich Durov. The prototype of Kaczynski was Bernard Bernardovich Kazhinsky (the author of the book Transmission of thoughts. Factors that create the possibility of electromagnetic oscillations radiating out (1923) and Biological radio communication in the nervous system (1926). Following the example of P. I. Gulyayev, Doctor of Biological Science, the author refers to the bio-electromagnetic and radiation wave as telepathema finding it to be a very appropriate name. However, the term “telepathy” (inasmuch as it is associated with the wrong and distorted interpretation of the phenomena of thought transference over distances [deep correlation, i.e. Persinger]) should be expressed by a new term such as “biological radio communication,” for example, which offers a clearer depiction of the natural capacity of man (and animals) to intercept mental information and sensations (through a physical medium) as one of the brain functions performed by the nerve cells, the biophysical apparatuses. (Kazhinsky, 1963, 14) Investigations in this area were initiated back in 1919. Forty-two years have elapsed since the author developed and publicized his hypothesis of the existence of “ganglions” or “apparatuses” [microtubules, etc] in the central nervous system which are similar to the known electrical systems in structure and purpose: simple current generators, condensers, amplifiers, radio transmitting and receiving devices, etc. That hypothesis, in turn, was based on the assumption that the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:55:f41038cadf7d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2408, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 56, "text": "performed by the nerve cells, the biophysical apparatuses.

Three years later (1922), following a number of experiments in the department of physics of the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy in Moscow, the author, succeeded in finding in isolated preparations of an animal’s nervous system certain nerve elements structurally resembling solenoid loops and paired capacitor plates similar to the well- known elements of the closed Thompson oscillation circuit, a vibrator of discrete currents and electromagnetic waves. Also in 1922, Kazhinsky gave a presentation at the 2nd Russian Congress of the Association of Naturalists entitled “Human Thought: Electricity.” This was two years before the German scientist Hans Berger created the first known in the west Electroencephalograph (EEG) of the human mind, although Russian researchers in 1914 had performed this on animals. Later, Kazhinsky’s research in 1943 postulated a connection to the organ of hearing, perhaps first discovering the key to silent subliminals: A further study of the physical characteristics of the organ of hearing, from the point of view of the nascent theory of biological radio communications, made it possible (in 1943) to adopt an entirely new viewpoint on that organ as an analyzer of a heretofore unknown stimulant reaching the brain, a bio-electromagnetic wave of acoustical frequency. An investigation of the structure of the organ of hearing in the light of the new experimental-data suggested (in 1952) a working hypothesis: the eye not only “sees” but also emits into space electromagnetic waves of a certain frequency capable of producing an effect over a distance on a human being (and on animals in general) on whom the gaze is focused. These waves can influence his behavior, induce him to do certain things and generate various emotions, images and thoughts in his mind. Such an emission of electromagnetic waves of a certain frequency by the eye is called a bio-radiation “ray of vision,” also see Chapter 7 for information on the eyes as radar receivers and transmitters.

Kazhinsky ideals of thought transference originated from his work with the Zoologist Durov who conducted experiments with Kazhinsky on dogs to remotely give them orders to elicit behaviors. At this time, 1924, he also began studies on sending orders between an emitter and receiver, where the receiver was located in a protected room, hypnotized to open up suggestibility. In the years 1922-1926 in Moscow, in the Practical Laboratory of Zoopsychology of V. L. Durov of the Main Department of Scientific Institutions of the People’s Commissariat of Education, B. B. Kazhinsky conducted a series of experiments. Kazhinsky designed and built a room with more advanced screening ability. The percipient was placed in the chamber, and TV Gurshtein, who hypnotized him, was outside. The hypnotist, standing close to the door of the chamber, opens the cork of the bottle with strong perfume and asks many suggestive questions like, “What do I smell? What smell do you feel?” And so on. The reaction of the percipient after a relatively large gap: “Flower scent, cologne.” The hypnotist takes on the tongue the powder of salt and asks: “What taste do you feel on the tongue?” The reaction of the percipient after a long silence: “Sweet.” The hypnotist tries tongue sugar. Percipient reaction - quick response: “Sweet.” The hypnotist pours pepper on his tongue. Percipient reaction - answer: “Bitter.” The tingling of the hypnotist’s left palm is performed. To the question: “What and where do you feel?” - the percipient responds: “The pain … in the left hand.” Important methodological innovations were introduced into the experiment: mental suggestion was transmitted by Gurshtein from another room, while he did not know whether the door of the chamber was closed or open (that is, whether it shields or not). The assistant, who was under the hypnotized subject, did not know the time and nature of the mental impact, that is, the task that the subject had to mentally perceive and perform. The task concerned the performance of various movements: raising", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:57:13617818bdf4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2410, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 58, "text": "Important methodological innovations were introduced into the experiment: mental suggestion was transmitted by Gurshtein from another room, while he did not know whether the door of the chamber was closed or open (that is, whether it shields or not).

The task concerned the performance of various movements: raising a hand or a leg, clenching a hand into a fist, etc. Of the ten mental suggestions, their fulfillment or non-fulfillment did not contradict the electromagnetic hypothesis in nine cases and only in one case the subject, with the open door of the shielded chamber, did not exactly fulfill suggestion. Similar works, but at a somewhat better level of methodological and technical support, were carried out in 1932–1937 in Leningrad by Professor L. L. Vasiliev. In 1932, the Brain Institute’s Director Academician V. M. Bekhterev “was assigned the task of starting an experimental study of telepathy with the aim, if possible, of clarifying its physical nature.” Scientific research leadership was entrusted to L. L. Vasiliev. He worked at the Brain Institute since the fall of 1921 and was directly involved in the research of telepathic phenomena conducted by the Institute’s Bekhterev. After his death in 1927, Vasilyev continued this work on his own initiative, and in 1932 he was offered to head the scientific leadership of the topic. Research was conducted for almost five and a half years, from 1932 to 1937 inclusive. In these large-scale works, the mental suggestion of motor acts, visual images and sensations, sleep and awakening were investigated. To study the physical nature of the carrier, shielding (with metal) of a mentally inspiring inductor or a percipient perceiving mental suggestion, as well as increasing the distance between the inductor and the percipient (from 25 meters to 1700 kilometers) was used (by metal). The result, Vasiliev writes, was unexpected even for the performers: neither the screening nor the distance worsened the telepathic transmission in all those cases when it was clearly manifested without screening or at a short distance. (Kazhinsky 1963) As previously mentioned Kazhinsky’s work was not classified. He did not work directly for the Soviet security state; however, others did, such as Bekhterev who was supervised by Bokia, Bokia later being executed during the Stalinist purges. Kernbach, as previously noted, talks about how research in this subject is still classified in Russia some 100 years later. In 1934, the Soviet security state OGPU-NKVD, set up secret labs ‘neuro-energetic’ laboratory initially with the Moscow Power Engineering Institute, after 1935 in a building of the Institute of Experimental Medicine.

Meanwhile the Soviet military set up its labs as well, From 1932-37 USSR’s Commissar of Defense studied transfer of information in biological ways. In Leningrad at Bechterev’s Brain Institute, led by Prof. LL. Vasilyev; in Moscow the Laboratory of Biophysics, Academy of Science, led by P.P. Lazarev and S.Y. Turlygin. As Kernbach notes: It can be assumed that a, more or less, coordinated Soviet program began in 1924, when the Commissar (Minister) of Education A.V.Lunacharskiy А.В.Луначарский) formed the Russian Committee for Psychical Research at the International Committee of the Psychical Research. Many authors point to a program of the USSR’s Commissar of Defense in 1932-1937, related to transfer of information in a biological way. These works were conducted in two places: in Leningrad at the Bechterev’s Brain Institute, led by Prof. L.L.Vasilyev (Л.Л.Васильев) and in Moscow at the laboratory of biophysics, Academy of Science, led by Prof. P.P.Lazarev (Director of Laboratory) and Prof. S.Y.Turlygin (П.П.Лазарев, С.Я.Турлыгин). The Biophysics laboratory was asked to investigate the physical nature of telepathy. For instance, in Moscow’s laboratory the first results of biological emission from humans were obtained. In Leningrad, the Brain Institute was requested to perform more psychologically oriented works, such as transferring visual images and remotely influencing the percipient. Both research organizations did not know about the works of each other. (Kernbach, 2013, 4) One should note that many scientists concerned in this edge of scientific research eventually found their way onto the receiving end of the Stalinist purges, with the execution of Bokia and the imprisonment of other researchers in the Siberian gulags, effectively taking them out of the research area, although a scientist like Kozyrev was able to continue his theoretical work in Cosmology while in the Gulag. The Stalinist purges beginning in 1937 effectively eliminated research in this area, at least as far as is publicly known. Soviet research did not begin again until after Stalin died, in an attempt to catch up to the Americans and British which were the beneficiaries of receiving German scientists as spoils of war, ostensibly. Project Paperclip brought many German researchers to the United States; however the Soviets also captured many leading researchers in this area and took them as prisoners to the Soviet Union.

It is also worthwhile to keep in mind that the Weimar German Military (Reichswehr) during this entire time had a secret agreement on cooperation of military technology since 1922 with the Soviet Union, for instance Pascual Jordan lectured at joint conferences of German and Soviet scientists at conferences in the Soviet Union. And as noted before there was cooperation directly between the two countries in all forms of technology. Another area that is of interest regarding early Russian research is that in the field of microwaves. According to Kernbach, In the 1930s B.G. Michaylovskiy studied the microwave radiation effects on higher nervous activity, using medium/short EM waves modulated by low-frequency signals on separate areas of the brain which are responsible for emotional state and functionality of different organs. S. J. Turlygin also did studies in the field of human microwave radiation. (See Kernbach 2013) In the 1960s later experiments went back into research done in the 1920s and 30s. Following the work of Michailovskiy and others, it was found that the EM field, with certain parameters, can cause a variety of bio-physical and mental effects. Kernbach states: “It can be assumed that the psycho-physiological effects of microwave emission were actively investigated during the NS [National Socialist, ‘Nazi’] regime in Germany, and after 1945 the technology was adopted by the countries-winners [i.e. USA, UK, France, Soviet Union].” (Kernbach, 2013) One of the main stumbling blocks to researching Nazi involvement in Neuroweapons is that most documen-tation was either purposefully destroyed by Nazi scientists, destroyed in bombings, taken by the Soviets, or by the secret intelligence in the West. Locating primary sources remains a difficult task in documenting their development. However, we can discern from what is known about Nazi medical experiments and scientific research some of the areas they were involved in. Whether from the German Navy’s secret Pendel Research division, a form of early Remote Viewing, to medical experiments under Verschuer which included the likes of Mengele, there are enough pathways of evidence to investigate what they were researching and for what purposes, although sometimes the purposes themselves may be obfuscated. Psychology was begun in Germany with the work of Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920) in the famous Leipzig school of psychology. Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt was a physiologist, philosopher, and professor, known today as one of the founders of modern psychology, specifically experimental psychology based on laboratory experiments.

Americans influenced by him were Granville Stanley Hall, James McKeen Cattrell, Charles Hubbard, Walter Dill Scott, Edward Bradford Titchener, Lightner Witmer, Frank Angell, Edward Wheller Scipture, and James Mark Baldwin. He also influenced visiting student V.M. Bekhterev, Franz Boas, Emile Durkheim, Ferdinand Tonnies. In 1879, at the University of Leipzig, Wundt founded the first formal laboratory for psychological research. This marked psychology as an independent field of study. By creating this laboratory, he was able to establish psychology as a separate science from other disciplines. He also formed the first academic journal for psychological research, Philosophische Studien (from 1881 to 1902). 1. Process theory: Mental phenomena are changing processes of consciousness. 2. Categories: fundamental categories of psychology are: Subject, value assessment, the existence of purpose (teleology), and volitional acts (will). 3. Psychophysical Parallelism: certain mental processes regularly correspond to certain physical processes, figuratively they are ‘parallel to one another’ 4. Causality: Causal explanations in psychology must be content to seek the effects of the antecedent causes without being able to derive exact predictions. Using the example of volitional acts, Wundt describes possible inversion in considering cause and effect, ends and means, and explains how causal and teleological explanations can complement one another to establish a co-ordinated condition. 5. Apperception: based on Leibniz, the process in which the elementary sensory impressions pass into self-consciousness, whereby individual aspirations (striving, volitional acts) play an essential role. Apperception has a range of theoretical assumptions on the integrative process of consciousness. The selective control of attention is an elementary example of such active cognitive, emotional and motivational integration. During his Heidelberg years, when he was a neurophysiologist, Wundt developed work in sensory physiology, including spatial perception, visual perception and optical illusions, similar in outlook to Gestalt (see below). An optical illusion described by him is call the Wundt illusion, a variant of the Hering illusion. It shows how straight lines appear curved when seen against a set of radiating lines. Wundt influenced many psychologists of the Nazi era, though Wundt himself was a life-long liberal democrat. Many conspiracy theories paint him as an evil Illuminati, but there is no evidence for such conclusions. Many of his students, being immersed in the socio-political world of their times, were far-right nationalists like many Germans after WWI, feeling persecuted and betrayed by the political order of the times. After Wundt’s death the Institute for Experimental Psychology at Leipzig University was headed by a Nazi named Felix Krueger (see below for more).

After Wundt’s death the Institute for Experimental Psychology at Leipzig University was headed by a Nazi named Felix Krueger (see below for more). German psychology was also Gestalt Psychology (German: Gestalt “shape, form”) and later found a synthesis with Wundt’s experimental psychology and Gestalt in the likes of Krueger, Sander and others. In 1890, the concept of gestalt was first introduced in philosophy and psychology by Christian von Ehrenfels (a member of the School of Brentano). The idea of gestalt has its roots in theories by David Hume, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Immanuel Kant, David Hartley, and Ernst Mach. Max Wertheimer’s unique contribution was to insist that the “gestalt” is perceptually primary, defining the parts it was composed from, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts, as von Ehrenfels’s earlier Gestalt-Qualität had been. Gestalt psychology or gestaltism is a philosophy of mind of the Berlin School of experimental psychology. Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self-organizing tendencies. Kurt Koffka’s, “The whole is other than the sum of the parts” is often incorrectly translated as “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,” and thus used when explaining gestalt theory, and further incorrectly applied to systems theory. The fundamental principle of gestalt perception is the law of prägnanz[de] (in the German language, pithiness), which says that we tend to order our experience in a manner that is regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simple. Gestalt psychologists attempt to discover refinements of the law of prägnanz, and this involves writing down laws that, hypothetically, allow us to predict the interpretation of sensation, what are often called “gestalt laws.” As Neuroweapons is an interference in gestalt, research in this area is directly related whether by intention or dual purpose with development of Neuroweapons. Later researchers in Neuroweapons, such as John Norseen, worked with ideals of Quantum Consciousness. Similarities between Gestalt phenomena and quantum mechanics have been pointed out by, among others, chemist Anton Amann, who commented that “similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum mechanics are on a level of a parable” yet may give useful insight. Physicist Elio Conte and co-workers have proposed abstract, mathematical models to describe the time dynamics of cognitive associations with mathematical tools borrowed from quantum mechanics; and has discussed psychology experiments in this context, which is similar to Norseen’s Krylov sub-space of the mind.

A similar approach has been suggested by physicists David Bohm, Basil Hiley and philosopher Paavo Pylkkänen with the notion that mind and matter both emerge from an “implicate order.” The models involve non-commutative mathematics; such models account for situations in which the outcome of two measurements performed one after the other can depend on the order in which they are performed—a pertinent feature for psychological processes, as it is obvious that an experiment performed on a conscious person may influence the outcome of a subsequent experiment by changing the state of mind of that person. We begin our survey of Nazi psychologists with the eventual head of the Leipzig school, Felix Krueger, after com-pleting his education under Wundt, Krueger eventually relocated to Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1906 at the Instituto Nacional de Profesorado Secundario (National Institute of Secondary Teaching). He stayed in Argentina until 1908. In 1917, with Wundt’s retirement he became the successor to Wundt’s Institute for Experimental Psychology. From this point on the Institute became identified with far-right nationalist sentiment. Under Krueger: In the 1920s, the institute occupied 34 rooms in the university’s main building as well as a smaller office in the city, huge for the time. Krueger had four regular assistants, each of whom was responsible for his own department: Professor Otto Klemm was responsible for applied psychology and experimental pedagogics; Professor August Kirschmann for measurement methods and psychology of perception; Professor Friedrich Sander for psychology of the higher functions; and Privatdozent Hans Volkelt for developmental psychology, including child psychology (Marx, 2013) Krueger responded to gestalt theory of the Berlin type with his own brand of “holistic psychology” (Ganzheitspsychologie). Instead of patterns (gestalten), he named “complex qualities” (Komplexqualitäten) as the primary perceptual phenomena. These diffuse, quasi-multidimensional perceptions comprised thought processes as well as emotions. However, children were unable to differentiate these complex qualities. Human maturation manifested itself as complex qualities became more structured through experience and reason. This meant that holistic psychology was oriented more towards development and evolution than gestalt psychology. Although Krueger vied with the gestalt psychologists to prove that his own version was the original approach, he was heavily influenced by gestalt theory. Thus, his holistic approach can at least partly be explained by his efforts to outdo his rivals in the new discipline. He conceded that gestalt psychology was a step in the right direction but maintained that a conclusive psychological and philosophical explanation of the psyche could only be provided by the Leipzig school.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:63:e2200c4a1ea1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2416, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 64, "text": "than gestalt psychology.

He conceded that gestalt psychology was a step in the right direction but maintained that a conclusive psychological and philosophical explanation of the psyche could only be provided by the Leipzig school. The focus on the emotions was crucial to the profile of the Leipzig school and was the most important task of psychology from Krueger’s perspective. His student Verwoerd, however, took a completely different view in his doctoral thesis (see below). Verwoerd treated the emotions as phenomena which could be isolated and evoked, rendering them measurable and open to manipulation. This is very far from Krueger’s concept of the complex quality and the “holistic experience,” which emphasized the diffuse and unfathomable nature of emotions. From Krueger’s perspective the emotions formed a tight cluster of complex qualities, in which rational thoughts manifest themselves, but these were so dependent on their emotional environment that it was almost impossible to investigate the complex empirically. Albert Wellek, a student of Krueger’s in the 1930s, explained that feelings lost their intensity when under observation, making it impossible to analyze them. Verwoerd’s own position was rather different, because he states in his thesis that the declining intensity of emotions is measurable and that emotions are open to analysis. He probably didn’t know about Krueger’s approach before he came to Leipzig, since he did not quote any of Krueger’s publications in his doctoral thesis. (Marx 2013) Krueger’s theoretical conceptualization of holistic psychology encouraged the absorption of both volkish ideologies and nationalist ones. Holistic psychology was closely interwoven with an ideological and political undercurrent that operated in the context of wholes and transcended the psychology of the individual through the community perceived as a volk: Although working in different fields, our efforts aimed at an understanding of community life, especially that of the volk.” It comes as no surprise therefore, that both Krueger himself and some of his assistants, such as Volkelt and Dürckheim, were involved in right wing politics as early as the 1920s: “The Psychological Institute was regarded as a ‘völkische Zelle’ (volkish cell).” It was the logic of holistic psychology’s internal dynamics that led Krueger to wave goodbye to empirical research after 1917. Henceforth he devoted his energies to presenting his ideas in a very general philosophical framework that had less and less to do with practical psychological research. In keeping with this view, Krueger dropped the word “experimental” from the name of Wundt’s institute, renaming it the Psychological Institute in 1925. ctualism is a term derived from gestalt psychology.

This refers to the emergence of a perception from more A complex, holistic pre-forms, or the process of the differentiation of perceptual contents. If the term is limited to human perception, the actual fact that a complex object is not immediately captured completely but is recorded in a single step in a process. These steps do not occur deliberately. In a wider sense, one can also describe other psychological processes in this way. For example, the emergence of emotional excitements: from the first impression of a situation, several steps are passed through until one realizes the full experience. The emergence of emotions can take place differently depending on the triggering event and person. The development of envy or jealous feelings of a little boy for the newborn brother runs differently from the frightened reaction while driving, when an obstacle suddenly appears directly in front of the car. At the same time I.G. Farben was creating, in 1925, methamphetamines, heroin, and morphine. Under the work of Otto Freidrich Ranke he introduced methamphetamines into the Wehrmacht, receiving funding from the Rockefeller Foundation; his Ph.D. Dissertation was “The Rectifier Resonance Theory: An extension of the Helhoke resonance theory of hearing by physical examination of the cochlear fluid oscillations, similar to Kazhinsky, in 1931. He was a member of the SA (Sturmabteilung), Storm Troopers. Eventually, in 1939, the widespread use of these drugs would lead the Minister of Health, Leo Conti to declare that the entire German nation seemed addicted. This would be considered to be nootropics by today’s neurowarfare terminology. The goal of this of course was to create a drug induced super soldier of the Blitzkrieg (speed war). Even today, low doses of meth are given to US troops in combat to fight fatigue. In 1926 an interesting student of Krueger’s was Hendrik Verwoerd. After his studies at Leipzig he returned to his native South Africa and became a member of the Fascist, National Party. He was known as the architect of Apartheid. He wrote in 1926 “A method for the experimental production of emotions.” He was later chair of the Applied Psychology and Psycho Technique at the University of Stellenbosch. …Hendrik Verwoerd and the Leipzig School of Psychology.In investigating Moodie’s allegations regarding the formative influence of German intellectuals on Afrikaner nationalism, it makes sense to concentrate on Verwoerd’s time in Leipzig because the Psychological Institute there is the most likely site of the alleged political influence from German scholars.

It was the Leipzig psychologists who exhibited rightist political leanings, unlike their colleagues in Berlin and Hamburg, none of whom were drawn by radical nationalism. (Marx, 2013, 92) Verwoerd studied psychology and philosophy at Stellenbosch and wrote a Masters’ thesis in each of these subjects in 1922. From 1923 he was a lecturer in psychology at Stellenbosch. He wrote his PhD thesis, entitled “Die Afstomping van Gemoedsaandoeninge” (The Blunting of the Emotions) based on laboratory experiments. He received his doctorate cum laude from Stellenbosch University in 1924 and was awarded a £150 Croll & Gray scholarship to study abroad. He spent three semesters in Germany (1926–27) and three months in the USA. (Marx, 2013) While at Leipzig he also studied under Richard Pfeifer (1877-1957) on the “Psycho Pathology of Children and Youth” as well as a course on “Psychological Therapy and Hypnosis,” as well as under Franz Exner (1881-1947) the “Fundamentals of Criminal Psychology,” as well as with August Dollken, professor of medicine on the same topic. (Marx, 2013, 105) In 1926 Volkelt became assistant professor. He and Graf Dürckheim Montmartin were the earliest and most outspoken adherents of National Socialism at the Leipzig School. Volkelt became a member of the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, as early as 1932, one year before Hitler came to power, clear evidence that he joined the party out of conviction rather than opportunism. Under Krueger, the Leipzig Institute adapted very quickly to the new regime and some of its members publicly acclaimed the National Socialist assumption of power. Krueger himself had been an exponent of the radically nationalist and volk-orientated right wing for many years already. In 1935 he became rector of the university but was forced to resign by the Nazis after referring in a public speech to Heinrich Hertz as a “noble Jew.” (Marx, 2013, 103) Freidrich Sander, 1942: assistant to Wundt – he was a member the Nazi Party.

Sander founded the school of genetic holistic psychology with F. Krueger. Based on experimental perceptual investigations, he developed the concept of actual genesis (emotion), which describes the process of inducing a creative experience, and claimed that the Gestalt qualities are preceded by so-called full qualities. Also known was the “Sandersche figure,” an optical illusion (Sander’s illusion). In the period of Nazi rule, Sander saw in holistic psychology a contribution to the so-called reorganization of national life. In 1962 he presented a collection of the works on holistic psychology (holistic psychology, fundamentals, results, applications, edited by H. Volkelt). Later, he was found to have committed fraud in his research and undermined Wohlfart. (Abbey 2008, 40) Otto Klem, whose department focused primarily on the psychology of physical activity. “There are studies of working procedures, fatigue, aptitude tests and related psycho-technical testing. The methods are tested and applied to carefully chosen cases.” Klemm’s department collaborated with industry as well as employment centers in testing applicants for specific jobs so that his research contributed to optimizing workplace conditions. Peter Behrens identifies four main areas of Klemm’s research, namely: “human work, equipment, and control design; human performance and mental functioning; forensic psychology; and mental ability testing and vocational guidance.” (Marx, 2013) In other words, characterology, which is used in profiling targets of neuroweapons. Karlfried Graf Dürckheim-Montmartin, the son of an impoverished aristocratic family, who had taken part in the violent suppression [freikorps] of the short-lived Munich Soviet Republic in 1919. Dürckheim-Montmartin studied psychology and moved to Leipzig after completing his doctorate in Kiel. He worked as a voluntary assistant at the university from 1925 and was given a regular contract at Krueger’s institute two years later. Although Verwoerd did not attend any of the count’s courses, they obviously knew each other. A few years later both of them participated in the 1934 congress of the New Education Fellowship in South Africa, organized by Ernest Malherbe. (Marx, 2013, 102) Wilhelm Wirth-Leipzig, psychophysics (nueroweapons relevant), Nazi party member. In 1897 he received his doctorate. After studying in Leipzig, Wilhelm Wundt offered him an assistant position. Wirth habilitated in 1900 with the work The Fechner-Helmholtz’s Theorem on Negative Afterimages and Its Analogies. He founded in 1902 the Society for Experimental Psychology. In 1940 he became a member of the NSDAP. In 1908 Wirth was appointed professor.

In 1938, he defined: “The entire knowledge of quantitatively comprehensible laws of mental performance vis-à-vis the outside world can be described as psychophysics in the narrower sense.” Starting in 1926, the precision of the coordination between optical perception and subjective movement emerged for Wirth. In 1933 he signed the professors’ confession at the German universities and colleges to Adolf Hitler. Albert Wellek, who was at the institute from the late 1920s onwards and created a legend after the war about the institute’s distance from the National Socialist regime. In his autobiography he took great pains to circumvent his own sympathies with right-wing positions. Wellek was the most prominent psychologist to fight for a continuation of the Leipzig approach of holistic psychology after the Second World War, when he became a professor in Mainz and a highly influential figure in psychological organizations. (Marx, 2013, 103) Johaness Rudert (1894-1980) at Heidelberg, army psychologist. Injured in World War I, losing function of his right arm, which he turned into a dissertation with injury-related left-handedness in his 1925 thesis “Casuistic Contribution to the Theory of the Functional Asymmetry of Cerebral Hemisphere .” After graduation he worked in the army psychology of Reichswehr and participates in the development of diagnostic methods for Officer selection. Assistant to Felix Krueger in 1929 at the Psychological Institute in Leipzig, he began his characterological and expressive psychological studies. In 1935 he applied for habilitation at the Faculty of Philosophy in Leipzig with the thesis “Typology and Characterology – To the problem of characterological classification.” From 1936-1941 he was active as Senior Army Psychologist at the Psychological Testing Offices of the Reichswehr in Brunswick and Wiesbaden. In 1941 he was sent to the University of Leipzig, appointed associate professor of psychology and succeeded Philipp Lersch as the Deputy Head of the Psychological Institute. One area of research that is worthy of note for Rudert was his development in the characterological field. Recruiting young talent for technical special services, he developed what became known as the ‘film method’, originally created by Philipp Lersch, in which a subject was sent to a filming studio to be examined by a team of doctors from behind mirrors, while being surreptitiously filmed.

(Geuter 1982) eipzig was not the only center of psychological research in Nazi Germany. Others engaged in studies related Lto the mind and its inner workings, such as Matthias Heinrich Goring, the cousin of Herman Goering, who founded the German Institute for Psychological Research and Psychotherapy in 1933. The fact that Psychological research was considered a national interest and even secret is witnessed in the redacted notes of some Psychological conferences in Germany. Hartnacke classifies that in science: The highest standing, which is related to securing the existence and raising of the people, whose Daseinssicherung and Erbgutpflege “(S.4) … Psychology should be a servant and Be a leader and show educational boundaries … Ergege for genetic engineering and psychological knowledge to found and strengthen the educational work .” (S.5) There was a concerted effort by someone or org to obfuscate the proceedings of the 1933 Psychology conference, with lines blackened out and entire speeches deleted from the record of the meetings: Completely missing the total lectures “of German kind, LF Clauss,” “the counter type of the German-volkischen movement, ER Jaensch,””The Erbbiologische and genealogische Contribution to the psychology of racial purity, Prince Von Isenburg” and” The problems of Political Psychology, Poppelreuter. (Hachmann-Gleixner, 2019 pg. 49-50) The work of George Muller is of interest, as his findings later went into developing psychological profiles of people based on color (farbe) theory, which Capt. Roader, who we shall read about later, studied in the 1950s in correspondence with Hans Bender. In 1930, George Elias Muller, a founder of psychophysics, Color phenomena (see Verschuer below for continuation of research) Müller retired in 1922. Afterwards he began studying color phenomena; during his study of color phenomena he advanced Ewald Hering’s theory of color and elaborated on the two-stage theory. The first stage involved the retinal receptors and then the signals were transformed into the four opponent primary colors. In 1930 he wrote two summary books that helped define color theory. His student Erich Jaensch further elaborated on this topic. Jaensch, here he put forward further considerations Aubert-Förstersches phenomenon that the perceived size of an object does not coincide with the size of the image on the retina.

Especially the lateral seeing found his attention here. He was at the University of Strasbourg writing ‘about the perception of space’ and receiving a habilitation. His duplicity theory begins here. Jaensch assumed that periodic vibrations were absorbed by the cochlea, while aperiodic vibrations were absorbed by other parts of the ear. Vibrations exhibiting both periodic and aperiodic character, on the other hand, would be perceived by both the cochlea and other organs. Also related to the study of vision is that of Wolfgang Metzger who in the 1930s established that when subjects gazed into a featureless field of vision they consistently hallucinated and their electroencephalograms changed. Ganzfeld was later revisited by Hans Bender (see below). Finally, we have the work in parapsychology, which would become integral to neuroweapons development. Perhaps the most famous parapsychological researcher that was also a Nazi was Hans Bender, also a member of the SS Ahnenerbe, the scientific arm of the Nazi SS. After graduation in 1925, he first studied law in Lausanne and Paris. In 1927 he transferred to the study of psychology, philosophy and Romance languages in Freiburg, Heidelberg and Berlin. From 1929 he studied in Bonn with Erich Rothacker (psychology) and Ernst Robert Curtis (Romance Studies). After the seizure of power by the National Socialists, he was in 1933 a short-term member of the SA, parallel to his position as Assistant Professor at the Psychological Institute of the University of Bonn. Bender was disabled and not eligible to serve in the military. Thus, he became a professor at the University of Bonn. In 1932, Hans Bender’s experiments dealing with “automatic spelling” (“glass tilting”) were performed in 1932 and 1933 at the Psychological Institute of Bonn University under the auspices of Erich Rothacker and were published in 1936 as a PhD. dissertation under the title Psychische Automatismen (Psychic Automatisms). In an interesting development as a student under Kurt Beringer at Bonn University he participated in studies on mescaline, which were a focal point of later pharmacological searches for a ‘truth serum’ in interrogations, notably with the German-CIA program, Project Artichoke. Bender and Jaensch intersect as Jaensch wrote the preface to a work of Bender’s on parapsychology in 1936. In 1939 Bender completed a medical degree, which should give him a greater reputation in view of his controversial research interest.

For his assertion that after his medical state examination and his license in Freiburg in 1939 with a thesis: “The working curve under pervitin (methamphetamines) in medicine” with Kurt Beringer receiving a doctorate. He also writes of starting a Parapsychological Institute, inviting psychics to participate in 1939. After the war Hans Bender was detained but subsequently released. In 1950 he established The Institute for Fringe Areas of Psychology and Mental Health at the University of Freiburg in 1950. From 1942 to 1944, he taught at the Paracelsus Institute studying ESP. Interestingly, after the war he maintained correspondence with Capt. Hans Roeder, who headed up the secret early remote viewing program of the German Navy in Berlin. We shall examine their correspondence shortly. Another development of interest is his work in 1966 with physicist Burkhard Heim, who he hoped to engage in a physical explanation for certain psychic phenomena, most notably trans-communication, or synthetic telepathy. Bender engaged several physicists in pursuit of a physical explanation, such as Rolle. Interestingly, in the development of the Ganzfeld, he conducted a national experiment on television to measure people’s psychic abilities through the medium of television, in 1968, based on research conducted in the 1930s. It should be noted that in 1967 he was contracted by the US National Security Agency to conduct experiments regarding psychic phenomena. A description of one experiment serves as a strong parallel and even perhaps the prototype for the format of a US Military-trained Remote Viewer, where white envelopes with unseen GPS coordinates are written inside the opaque envelope unknown to any that could transmit the information to the viewers. Tischner’s experimental description: Telepathy was used early in the German Police investigations according to Wernet 2013. Its interest to official government offices was not limited to police investigations. During the war a special department developed in German Naval Intelligence to investigate translocation of enemy ships. The staff of this department developed out of earlier ‘Occult’ scientists. This organization was founded in 1919 as the German Okkultistliche Society’ (D.O.G.) under the chairmanship of physicist and mason Dr. Werner Haken, who led until 1923 when it was renamed ‘German Society for Scientific Occultism’ (D.G.W.O.). Its vice president was a scientist of interest and a member of the special Navy department, later known as the ‘SP Department’ (sidereal pendel), Lt. Col. A.D. Konrad Schuppe, who was the recruiter for staff for the department (Walther, 1949). Understandably, the department was recruited from membership of the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur wissenschaftlichen Okkultismus (D.G.W.O). The military interest in occult studies is also attested to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:71:a6b1b9e067de", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2424, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 72, "text": "Haken, who led until 1923 when it was renamed ‘German Society for Scientific Occultism’ (D.G.W.O.).

Understandably, the department was recruited from membership of the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur wissenschaftlichen Okkultismus (D.G.W.O). The military interest in occult studies is also attested to in that Schuppe also briefed the III Army Corps General Command on Occult sciences. In 1939 the society changed to the ‘German Metaphysical Society.’ At this time Schuppe was interested in ganzfeld or Earth’s radiation, electromagnetism and dowsing (remote location of water), theoretically feeling the weak EM fields of water in comparison to solid earth. Another member of the SP Department was the chemist Dr. Fritz Quade. It is important to put developments in parapsychology (okkultisme) in a historical context at this time. Shortly before the founding of the SP department in 1942 it was banned in the Reich to practice Okkultisme things in any way. This developed out of a suspicion that occult practitioners had steered Hess to go to Great Britain in an effort at forming a German-British fascist alliance, or “peace,” allegedly with Lord Hamilton, a British occultist and Nazi sympathizer. In response to the development of Hess being captured the Gestapo banned all occultish practices. At this time Schuppe and Quade were arrested for several months. However, the military became interested in this research, as well as Heinrich Himmler. Another member of the SP Department was Dr. Hans-Hermann Kritzinger, an astronomer who founded the German Association for Solar Observations, previously employed by the Air Force and Army Weapons Office for Ballistics studies. In 1940 he was working for the Propaganda Ministry after Goebbels became interested in the prophecies of Nostradamus about the downfall of England in the end times and wanted to use it as propaganda. Kritzinger had written about this prophecy so was a person of interest to Goebbels. As one who claimed to specialize in dowsing, he became of interest to the military work with the SP Department. One of the most renowned persons researching dowsing and pendel was Ludwig Straniak (1879-1951), who in 1936 started the Society for Scientific Pendulum Research (Gesellschaft für Wissenschaftliche Pendelforschung) which was dedicated to the National Socialist cause. He believed in 8 great forces (GroBe Kraft) in the universe. He wrote a book on Pendel techniques, ‘Das siderische Pendel als Indikator der achten Naturkraft’ (Straniak, 1937). In one chapter of this book, written by Arnold Mannlicher, ‘Biologische Strahlenforschung und Elektrotechnik’, The belief in polar coordinates system is presented, it was also claimed to be able to use the pendel for diagnosis in the human body, he wrote: Zum verstandnis der Angelegenheit mub ich einiges uber die normalen Polaritatsverhaltnisse", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:72:5d7c0b8c7145", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2425, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 73, "text": "He believed in 8 great forces (GroBe Kraft) in the universe.

Es verhalt sich dieser namlich vergleichbar einem richtig aufgeladenen elektrischen Akkumulator, nur handelt es sich im Gegensatz zu letzterem, der nur zwei Pole besitzt, beim menschlichen Korper um deren sechs. Da der Orgnismus des Menschen in jeder der drie Axen eines raumlichen Koordinatensystems (Nord-Sud, West-Ost, Tief-Hoch) in postivem oder natgativem Sinne durchstrahlbar und polarisiert ist, ergeben sich (bie der Orientierung mit dem Rucken nach Norden und dem Gesicht nach Suden und bei “Stromabnahme” uber der Wirbelsaule awischen den beiden Schulterblattern) acht verschiedene “Axungsgruppen,” und zwar: Nord-West-Tief, Nord-West-Hoch, Nord-Ost-Hoch, Nord-Ost-Tief, Sud-Ost-Hoch, Sud-West-Hoch. To understand the matter, I must first state something about the normal polarity relations of the human body. It behaves like a properly charged electrical accumulator, only in contrast to the latter, which has only two poles, the human body has six. Since the organism of the human being can be irradiated and polarized in each of the three axes of a spatial coordinate system (north-south, west-east, low-high) in a positive or natural sense, there are (by the orientation with the back to the north and the face to the south and with “current collection” above the spine between the two shoulder blades) eight different “axis groups,” namely: north-west low, northwest high, north-east high, north-east low, south-east high, Southwest High. (Straniak 1937) I would prepare a few years to the understanding of the matter for the normal polaritics of the human body. It is unable to behave a properly charged electric battery, but it is only contrary to the latter that has only two poles, at the human body of their six. Since the organism of man in each of the three axes of a spacious coordinate system (north-sud, west-east, deep-high) is unbalanced and polarized in postive or negative sense… … eight different “axes groups,” namely: North-West-deep, North-West-high, North-East-high, North-East-deep, South-East-high, South-West-high. (Straniak, 1937) The observation of the body’s polarities is an essential aspect of the Nazi Remote Viewing program, this is also observed by physical experiments where an east-west axis is observed as we shall read in a later chapter in the work of Persinger. In the pendel research it was observed that those were more successful who had a reverse polarity in their fingers than those that were not. It was observed that this was a biological difference where the successful viewers had a polarization abnormality.

It was observed that this was a biological difference where the successful viewers had a polarization abnormality. Also published in Straniak’s work is that of Mannlicher, who was a Swiss physician that believed that the earth ‘radiated’ as related to radionics, and that this earth radiation interfered with human health. This would later be related to the natural earth electromagnetic field and gravity, as gravity is different in different areas of the earth. Indeed, Hitler himself believed in these theories as related by Kurlander: “Hitler himself employed diviners to check the Reich Chancellery for cancer-causing ‘death rays.” (Kurlander, 504) The SP Department operated under a ‘top secret’ rubric. Another member of the team, who later quit, was Gerda Walther. She notes in her letter regarding ‘ESP in the German Navy’ that she was not allowed to refer to the head of the department, Capt. Hans Roeder as “Captain,” just Mr. Roeder (Walther 1949). Another member, the Astrologer Wolff, claims that the activities there had been “strictly confidential” and that the staff members had been under the impression of being constantly supervised [under watch]. (Black et al, 164). The career of Capt. Hans A. Roeder began in WWI as a U-boat commander; he became an engineer after the war, publishing The Technical Computing in 1933. In 1939 he returned to active duty as a Navy Captain assigned as a general consultant for the Inventions und Patentwesen Office of the Navy Main Weapons Office. Interestingly, he was a self-ascribed channeler or what was termed ‘commuter’ [channeler, clairvoyant]. Initially calling this research …the Navy Intelligence Service supported research on ‘Optical Location’; an ‘invisible, active locational method’ was supposed to be developed. See Bundesearchiv-Mlitararchiv Freiburg i. Br. (Anton, 2015, Note 37) Later, it was named the Sidereal Pendel Program. He reported to an Admiral Raeder who was Chief of Naval Operations. Others with knowledge of the program were former Freikorps Marine Group Eberhardt member Adm. Otto Schneiwind and a Rear Admiral Gerhard Wagner (1898-1987), from 1941 to 1944 Chief of the Operations Department in the Naval High Command, who reminisces about the work of Capt. Roeder: R[oeder], the commuter, was known to all of us. His work was from that point of view not so unusual. After all, one constantly thought about new techniques, and when now someone came who declared that he could achieve something by a certain method, then Of course it was natural that they gave him the opportunity (Anton, 2015).

About the exact date of construction of this special group in the Kriegsmarine, the corresponding establishment decisions and their justification as well as the organizational framework conditions are still little known. So far, no relevant documents and sources on these issues. That’s how we in some places, of necessity, rely on assumptions. Most of the following detailed information comes from retrospective eyewitness accounts and are accordingly to judge critically If we follow the remarks of Gerda Walther and Wilhelm Th. H. Wulff, existed the “SP Division” in the spring of 1942, when both first heard about her, already. The other available reports also suggest an emergence at the beginning of the year 1942. Who gave the order to set up the experimental group, who was informed and who was the driving force behind the experiments within the naval line However, this must remain unclear in the current source situation. Wulff mentions that at least the fleet chief Admiral Otto Schniewind [freikorp member of Marine Group Eberhardt] was informed about the experiments. On the other hand, it can be proven that the coordination of the pendulum locomotion tests in naval intelligence (MND) lay in the naval warfare. In cooperation with the MND, the Naval Weapons Main Office and there the General Office worked “Invention and patenting” at the trials. The naval intelligence service had since 1942 several “working groups” on the topic “vibration research for the submarine war ,” in which also the patent department of the navy was also involved in the special border-scientific research in the context of one of these “working groups” of the MND, but there is no clear evidence. About the work of the General Department “Inventions and Patents” in the Naval Weapons Main Office there is almost no information left. With effect from 1 September in 1942, this department became Division IV in the new office group “Research - Inventions - Patent Administration (FEP) .” The new FEP, headed by Rear Admiral Wilhelm Rhein, now comprised four departments: FEP I: General Research Control, FEP II: Research Organization and Reporting, FEP III: Research Division, FEP IV: Inventions and patenting. The bureau should answer all questions for the navy research, inventions and the patent system can provide exhaustive information, maintain contacts with research centers and intensify marine research in general. Their establishment was in response to the increasingly lossy and dogged guided submarine warfare, which the German navy to an extension of the Efforts in research and development.

Their establishment was in response to the increasingly lossy and dogged guided submarine warfare, which the German navy to an extension of the Efforts in research and development. For the year 1943, the Amtsgruppe as an extremely large apparatus with a variety of supervised scientific and technical research projects. Occupied is a huge effort with numerous supervised internal and external projects. In 1943 alone, around 1000 “research tasks” were fulfilled. In 1943, the FEP IV department processed around 13,000 applications for new developments. The work program in the previous year, 1942, cannot be translated into writing sources are hardly anything to be said. In the night from the 22nd to the 23rd of November in 1943, the Berlin office building of the FEP in the Admiral-von-SchröderStraße 31/33, complete with all documents stored there, were destroyed by an air raid. Amtsgruppenchef Rear Admiral Wilhelm Rhein had on 22 December 1943 reported: “All the files in the house were destroyed by the fire.“ This information is confirmed by a later report of March 27, 1944: “As it is Almost 1 year had just been achieved, with a separate service building for the Amtsgruppe. This was due to fire as a result of the bombing of 22.11.1943 completely destroyed.” In this war [of] destruction lies presumably the central one Reason that no written legacies to the border science have been handed down. (Anton et al, 2015, 297) With the almost total destruction of Germany during the war and the self-destruction of important research records, it is almost untraceable to find documentation on these secret programs. Gerda Walther and Wulff ’s accounts are the main sources of information on this project. As stated above the project was begun because the Germans felt they had fallen behind what they believed to be a British optical location project. Capt. Roeder held this belief, although it would later turn out that the main cause of the uptick in sinking of German naval vessels was the Turing team’s work on cracking Enigma with the Bombe computer. It should be noted, however, that Roeder may have been aware of the work of Harold Sherman and Sir Roy Wilkins in Great Britain, “Thoughts Through Space,” that did Remote Viewing experiments for locating ships; thus, being a rationale for German investigations. Another interesting person working on the SP Department project was Dr. Wilhelm Hartmann, who performed characterological or ‘aptitude-tests’ on staff members to assign them, although an astronomer and astrologer, he was a member of the Tattwas Team in the SP Department, studying the aspects of the planets, which seems to be", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:76:20f055412668", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2429, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 77, "text": "work of Harold Sherman and Sir Roy Wilkins in Great Britain, “Thoughts Through Space,” that did Remote Viewing experiments for locating ships; thus, being a rationale for German investigations.

Though the early staff was to be comprised of people attached to the scientific study of the occult, Capt. Roeder was specifically looking for a way to train normal Naval personnel to do this ‘locational’ work. As noted earlier, Walther broke with this work group. The cause being purely physical was investigated through other studies of the group that looked at what materials the pendel should be made and what kind of string to hang the pendel from. They performed many experiments to try and bring the study into a science. In the end, the Navy saw no merit in this attempt at location. Although, it is claimed Straniak was able to demonstrate its use. Ostensibly, it ended with negative results. I said it would now avenge itself psychical research had been neglected to such an extent all these years compared with the Anglo-Saxons countries, it needed years of careful research whether and how ships could be detected and placed by the pendulum and not even the very first preliminaries existed, I doubted whether they did in England or the United States, although they were far ahead of Germany in all these things…(Walther, 1949) Concerning an ‘answer to the problem of the dowsing rod’ and the research field of radiesthesia, for example, the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA) of the SS as well as National Socialist leadership circles made increasing efforts over the course of 1942 to get a better handle on the [technological] foundations and possibilities. (Black et al, 2015, 166) On Dr. Kiendl’s support for Werner Kittler’s “original and useful method, in which he brought together natural scientists and astrologers” in working groups in the Reich Literary Chamber and the Reich Ministry of Propaganda (hereafter RMVP), see BArch, R 58/6206, report from Kiendl to Hörmann, Sept. 2, 1938, 8; BArch, R 9361V/1107, Werner Kittler biography (March 14, 1938), application ( June 13, 1938). It is not without some technical reasons that astrologers were consulted, for instance one of the areas studied by Roeder’s Bio-location project was that of tatwas, or astrological aspects). The issue of the differentiation between charlatanry and real scientific investigations is considered in a correspondence between Himmler and Heydrich, his Intelligence chief before Schellenberg.

The issue of the differentiation between charlatanry and real scientific investigations is considered in a correspondence between Himmler and Heydrich, his Intelligence chief before Schellenberg. Kurlander notes: Himmler was deeply invested in occult and border-scientific thinking and saw no incompatibility between actively policing commercial occultism and selectively appropriating ‘scientific occultism,’ whether for developing military technology, gathering intelligence, or making political prognoses. These differences within the upper echelons of the SS and police administration might explain why Nebe, as head of the Kripo, proposed a middle way that preserved a space for ‘scientific occultism’ while moving against ‘every activity that rests on and exploits superstition. (Kurlander, 506) The new campaign against occultism also failed to dissuade Goebbels’s ‘Expert for Cosmobiology’ in the Reich Literary Chamber, Werner Kittler, from eagerly recruiting dozens of famous astrologers, dossiers, and cosmo-biologists to study the potential benefits of various border sciences. Even the SD and the Gestapo commissioned dozens of reports and peer reviews aimed at differentiating between ‘scientific occultism’ and charlatanry. Himmler himself advocated this policy in a January 1939 letter to Heydrich: Goebbels and Himmler even employed Kisshauer to review the talents of German astrologers and pendulum dossiers [remote viewing, dowsing], the most ‘scientific’ of whom they hired to assist the SS and the Propaganda Ministry in gathering military intelligence and producing propaganda (Kurlander, 519) The operation to locate Mussolini was conducted in what today would be defined as military remote viewing. It is disputed whether real human intelligence led to his release by German special forces commanded by Skorzeny or whether it was intelligence from remote viewing. Skorzeny remarked regarding the use of this NEURINT that: After the war’s end, there is evidence that structured or organized Nazi research in edge science continued. This now brings us to another Pendel researcher during the war, Hans Bender. Indeed, after the war in 1952 there is evidence of Capt. Roeder continuing research in parapsychological areas. He and Bender exchanged letters, although only a couple survive today, of which this seems just a sample of other letters regarding research. In Roeder’s letter he notes he is working on an extensive account of his work at the SP Department, however, this work did not survive or at least is not known in any public archive or publication. Roeder wrote: In the Institute for the Study of Certain Psychophysical Problems, which was set up and managed by the OKM, I have put aside all available material in a treatise which will be published in due course. It has become quite extensive, which was also to be expected from the size of the area worked on in the 7 theses of the institute.

(Roeder, 1952) The color measurements are based on the Oswald colors 2,5,8, 11, 14, 1, 20 and 23 of the na series. The measurements taken at 4 Vp’s, sometimes over one year daily, combine the 8 colors into 2 bundles whose composition individually curves apart (+ − ) , keeping separate for a while (2-3 weeks), then approaching, beating into Opposite to (−+) and strive against each other. These reversal periods are always shorter than the normal periods and end with a return to the original state. The 4 colors in the two buds do not run parallel, but swing back and forth in them. The measurement method that you write to me is of great interest to me, but I had to have some documents to comment on. The psychology of colors is actively cultivated in the Institute for Psychology and Characterology of the University of Freiburg, which is led by Prof. Heiss as you probably know unanimously, the so-called color pyramid test (originally from Pfister, Zurich) given to a diagnostic Do you know the test of Luscher, Basel? he Nazi Remote Viewing project was not the only endeavor that touched on unconventional science during 1 the Nazi Regime. Serge Kernbach argues that the Soviet psychotronic program likely grew out of captured Nazi scientists that led to the use of hypnosis with remote influencing later in the Soviet Union (see Ch.8), but first crafted in the Nazi regime of Germany: For this overview, two of such forced re-settlements in 1945 through 1955 are of interest: the first one is related to the institutes in Sinop and Agudzera (close to Suchumi, Soviet Georgia), which was created for Manfred von Ardenne and Gustav Hertz, and directed by them until 1955. These institutes were primarily related to the Soviet atomic programs. For technological achievements in this area, von Ardenne received the Soviet Stalin Prize twice, in 1947 and 1953, and Hertz got it in 1951. As mentioned by, e.g., Heikin, the topics were not only related to atomic research, but also included a number of other issues, e.g., energy convention, high-frequency technics, applied radiophysics, and others. Employees who worked in Agudzera in the 1950s remembered small research groups, which explored ‘hypnosis and weak emissions from biological organisms.’ We know that Russian specialists who worked in these facilities in the late 1950s were involved in brain-stimulation programs in the 1960s and 1970s, and later", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:79:32a256f85816", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2432, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 80, "text": "in 1951.

It is well-known that von Ardenne also conducted research related to brain EM-emission in his laboratory in the late 1920s. Is it possible that works directed in Soviet Georgia by Manfred von Ardenne, Gustav Hertz, Werner Hartmann, Max Steenback (the developer of the first Betatron), and others inspired (or to some extent were used in) early psychotronic research? (Kernbach 2014) As previously noted in the first part of this work Heinrich Himmler foresaw continuing the war indefinitely but through other means, as the German Reich was now defeated militarily. In 1943 Himmler began a covert war plan that included setting up secret research facilities in German industries, the creation of political front groups that never publicly mentioned Jews or Racial Supremacy. It is also important to remember the attitude of the SS according to head of the Nazi SS Intelligence Office, Amt. VI, Walter Schellenberg, that “if Germany must lose, then let all of Germany die!,” which is eerily reminiscent of the Diplomacy AI in the video game Total War, see on-line Appendix D. Reich Science was overseen by the SS under Heinrich Himmler. What areas of research were they investigating? Surely, they were not reliant on sacred arcs buried in the desert. As we shall read, the ideal of using biology on an industrial scale to re-engineer the world in the Nazi image was constructed by Pascual Jordan. enetic engineering research was conducted by the Wehrmacht and SS. Genetic Engineering is the science Gof using engineering in biology usually associated with augmenting or changing DNA, sometimes through a vector such as a bacteriophage or a virus, to change coding of functions or altering of functions (See Krishnan 2017). During the war the Nazis were interested in bacteriophage research: A bacteriophage, or phage, is a virus that only disinfects bacteria. In Greek, phageton means food/consumption. They are also called bacterial viruses. These are fundamental tools for research and study in molecular genetics. Bacteriophages used among other vectors for cloning and transfer genes. Then Félix d’Hérelle makes the same observation in the stool of patients with bacillary dysentery (bowel disease), isolates the first phages, develops the first therapeutic applications and markets the first bacteriophage drugs. The support of the genetic information (genome) of the bacteriophages can be a DNA or an RNA.

The support of the genetic information (genome) of the bacteriophages can be a DNA or an RNA. Regarding the science in the Reich at this time in this area, Akhim Trunk writes: “Regarding the issue of research, the project was by all means state of the art” (Trunk 2007, 132). The Wehrmacht research was conducted under the auspices of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, a scientific research institute with many branches. It was also conducted under the orders of the Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler (Trunk 2007, 122). As noted above, genetic engineering was touted in a 1933 Nazi science conference as being a vehicle for final victory, although deleted from the archive. In what follows is an account of the genetic research carried out by the Nazi regime. Though some of this research may or may not be directly related to neuroweapons, their military utilization is the prime motivator in carrying out this research, so I note instances of Genetic Engineering below. One final note regarding bacteriophages is the obvious interest of the Nazi military in such technology. In 1943 Nazi’s raided bacteriophage researchers in France, imprisoning Eugene Wollman and his wife Elisabeth Wollman. During the 1920s, Eugène Wollman at the Pasteur Institute in Paris attempted to reconcile the views of D’Hérelle and Bordet on bacteriophagy. Wollman posited that the phenomenon was a trait that bacteria acquired through infection or through inheritance. Wollman claimed that lysogenic bacteria involved a form of what he called paraheredity, whereby traits could transmit both vertically, through the genetic material passed from parent to offspring, and horizontally, through genetic material transmitted by infection within the same generation. To test his theory, Wollman conducted experiments on the bacterium, Bacillus megatherium (B. megatherium), with his wife Elisabeth Wollman. They published several papers on this work between 1925 and 1940. Their work on lysogeny included the experimental replication of bacteriophagy and the production of bacteriophages in non-contaminated bacterial cultures. They also showed that, contrary to d’Hérelle’s theory, there were many distinct species of bacteriophages. (Racine, 2014) The Wollmans’ work ended in 1943 when the Nazis took them to the extermination camp in Auschwitz and executed them. Note this work predates that at Cal Tech under Max Dullbreck (1937), a German immigrant to the United States in 1940. Post-WWII genetic engineering was centered in Cold Springs Harbor, Long Island, NY down the road from Montauk. In 1900, Mendel’s genetics research was rediscovered by three European scientists, Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich von Tschermak.

In 1900, Mendel’s genetics research was rediscovered by three European scientists, Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich von Tschermak. The exact nature of the “re-discovery” has been debated: De Vries published first on the subject, mentioning Mendel in a footnote, while Correns pointed out Mendel’s priority after having read De Vries’ paper and realizing that he himself did not have priority. De Vries may not have acknowledged truthfully how much of his knowledge of the laws came from his own work and how much came only after reading Mendel’s paper. Later scholars have accused Von Tschermak of not truly understanding the results at all. Genetics in the early days was considered a part of Eugenics, which basically amounted to Race Hygiene; the use of sterilization on undesirables was a common practice, the field of Eugenics was primarily founded in America before the Nazis took up the cause during the Third Reich. Verschuer, like many others after the war, was able to steer clear of Race Hygiene and rebrand himself as a genetics researcher primarily studying the effects of radiation on genes, which reminds one of the use of ‘Target-Theory’ in early gene research, such as advocated by Pascual Jordan in his version of Quantum Biology. enetics in Nazi Germany was carried out in terms of scientific research at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes. The GKWI of Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics was founded in 1927, partially funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, taking its origins from America. It’s first director was Eugene Fischer who in 1921 published Principles of Human Heredity and Race Hygiene. In 1927 the director of the Genetics Department was Otmar Freiherr (Baron) von Verschuer (16 July 1896 – 8 August 1969), a Dutch noble, who in 1942 was appointed the director of the Institute. It was Verschuer who directed Josef Mengele in human experiments at Auschwitz. Another of Verschuer’s assistants was Katrin Magnussen, a German-Swede that was a committed National Socialist even after the war. Josef Mengele (1911-1979) joined Verschuer in Jan. 1937 (Weiss, 650). He previously received a Ph.D in Anthropology from the University of Munich in 1935. He became one of four assistants to Verschuer at his Institute in Frankfurt, which worked on categorizing people by race, with ‘racial certificates’, based on ancestry or genes. This was primarily focused on proving or disproving one was an Aryan or a Jew for court cases and other civil matters in the Nazi era. He received a 2nd Ph.D for medicine with the dissertation “Kinship Examination in Cases of Cleft Lip, Jaw, Palate” in 1939.

He received a 2nd Ph.D for medicine with the dissertation “Kinship Examination in Cases of Cleft Lip, Jaw, Palate” in 1939. He was also a captain in the Nazi SS. In 1943 Verschuer encouraged Mengele to be transferred to Auschwitz, where Verschuer used Mengele to acquire specimens for their research from concentration camp victims. He also was responsible for administering Zyklon B in the gas chambers. In one story of his machine-like efficiency, he at one point cleared out an entire barracks of women during a Typhus epidemic, exterminating them all, to make room to move other inmates into the de-sanitized barracks, thus performing a swap of one barracks to the next to create space to sanitize the next barracks. In another example of his machine-like reductive thinking he tried to artificially join two twins together by sewing them together; they eventually died of gangrene from the operation. The twin research was in part intended to prove the supremacy of heredity over environment and thus strengthen the Nazi premise of the superiority of the Aryan race. (Steinbacher, 2005, 114) Nyiszli and others reported that the twin studies may also have been motivated by an intention to increase the reproduction rate of the German race by improving the chances of racially desirable people having twins. (Lifton, 1986, 358-9). At Auschwitz he was involved in the following studies that directly informed Verschuers research goals at the KWI-A: Projekt Augenfarbe (Eye study), Zwillingforschung (Twin Studies), Projekte Eiweißkorper und Tuburkulose (protein study and tuberculosis). It is notable that he escaped detainment after the war under questionable circumstances raising the specter of collaboration with Allied security forces. He eventually resettled in South America, at one point being reunited with his family, and visiting West Germany while being hunted by anti-Holocaust activists, West German Intelligence and Israeli Mossad. While in South America he continued his Twin studies in Candido Gadol in Brazil, creating a number of twins of Germanic ancestry. Another Verschuer assistant was Karin Magnusson. She received her doctorate in 1932 from the University of Gottingen. She studied at the Zoological Institute of the university after receiving her Ph.D. She then became a teacher, a profession she returned to after the war, even though remaining an avowed Nazi. In 1935, she was connected to the Nazi Racial Policy Office for Hanover. In 1936, she wrote Race and Population Policy Tools. In 1941, she stopped teaching after receiving a scholarship to the KWI-A.

There she worked in the Department of Experimental Pathology of Heritage under Hans Nachtsheim. She studied inheritance of eye color in rabbits and humans, drawing the conclusion that eye color is genetically selected and also by hormones; at one point, injecting adrenaline into the eye samples she received from Mengele from Auschwitz to change their eye color (Hesse, 2001, 78), she met Mengele in 1943 at the KWI-A. One area she studied specifically was heterochromia iridium, in which the color is different in each eye. Magnussen’s, completed research was published in 1949, being entitled, “On the relationship between histological distribution of pigment, Iris color and pigmentation of the eyeball of the human eye.” (Schmuhl, 2005, 490). It is not hard to extrapolate why racial supremacists fixated on eye color for genetic research, although there may be more to the eye studies then just simple genetic research. The use of hormones and the attempt to try to change the eye color is an interesting aspect of this research; as noted the study of hormones is not limited to this study but was also involved in other studies by the Nazi scientists. In 1939, von Verschuer was approached by the German biochemist, Adolf Friedrich Johann Butenandt (1903- 1995) who had won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1939 for his work on sex hormones. Adolf Windaus and Walter Schöller advised him to work on hormones extracted from ovaries. This led to the discovery of estrone and other primary female sex hormones. This work was conducted in 1934 in Gdansk at the Chemisches Institut, extracting progesterone and testosterone in 1935. Verscheur as head of the KWI Genetics program was approached by Emil Abderhalden (March 9, 1877 – August 5, 1950) to do blood studies, of which Verschuer would direct Joseph Mengele in lab work for this process among other assistants to Verschuer. Albderhalden did extensive work in the analysis of proteins, polypeptides, and enzymes. His Abwehrfermente (“defensive enzymes”) theory stated that immunological challenge will induce production of proteases. This work was to be used to racially classify people based on serology. In October of 1943, Verschuer, Albderhalden and Butenandt worked on joint projects funded by the Wehrmacht; Verschuer, working with Abderhalden, began studies on Human Blood. Mengele took over 200 blood samples from Auschwitz prisoners, This work was done in conjunction with Butenandt.

Trunk has postulated that the real work here, rather than studying proteases and enzyme reactions, was actually: According to Isabel Heinemann’s estimates- the RuSHA planned to perform race biological examinations on about 2 million people. Thus, seen in the context of its time, the project represented scientific work profoundly relevant for Nazi racial policy- with potentially extensive, destructive consequences for the people affected by this policy. (Trunk, 2007, 142). Irmgard Haase had spent at first three months with Abderhalden in Halle to learn the defense enzyme reaction in order to analyze the blood of ‘gipsy’ twins, Russians, Uzbeks, and Kyrgyzstan. In a first step the involuntary blood donors were racial-anthropologically classified: such anthropometric race determinations were required in order subsequently to be able to connect the desired blood analysis results (that is, the race-specific proteins) to a precise type of ‘race.’ …From this, blood substrates were obtained, as indicated, for instance from Verschuer’s third report to the DFG. (Trunk, 2007, 136) Verschuer: “I think that the whole problem is also connected to my research on the issue of heredity of specific proteins. Plasma substrates have been produced from more than 200 people of the most diverse races, twinpairs and some clans. The Abderhalden method has been exercised and is to be completed with a new method, invented by Hillmann (added on the staff). Hence work on the actual experiment can be started in the near future. My efforts are no longer aimed at establishing the impact of hereditary influence on some infectious diseases, but how it works and what are the processes happening along the way.” (Trunk, 2007, 136) “Everything will end in catastrophe if natural selection is altered to the point that gifted people are overwhelmed by billions of morons,” he warns, predicting that 90 percent of humans will starve due to stupidity and the remaining 10 percent will survive “like reptiles survived. The rest will die, just like the dinosaurs did … we have to prevent the rise of the idiot masses,” he writes. “We know that selection rules all nature by choosing and exterminating … Those who were unfit had to accept the rule of more accomplished human beings, or they were pushed out or exterminated.

Germany created the KWI Division for Virus Research, with funding from Heinrich Horlein of IG Farben. “From 1937 on, Gustav Adolf Kausche, head of the laboratory for experimental virus research on the Reich Bio logical Institute, together with E. Pfankuch carried out mutation experiments by using radiation on a TMV dry specimen from Stanly, on their own TMV specimen, and on the x-potato virus.” (Deichman, 1996, 210-1) In 1943 the SS established its own institute for plant genetics (Deichman, 1996, 217) The basic research in genetics at this Kaiser Wilhelm Institute [Breeding Research] consisted primarily of mutation research, which after Stubbe’s dismissal was carried on by his successor Edgar Knapp. Knapp induced mutations in mosses through X-rays and UV radiation. During the radiation of moss spermatozoids with monochromatic UV light, he discovered in 1939, together with A. Ruess, Otto Risse, and Hans Schreiber, that the radiation showed the greatest mutagenic effect in the range of the spectrum – 265 micrometers Terahertz radiation occupies a middle ground where the ranges of microwaves and infrared light waves overlap - that corresponded to the absorption maximum of DNA…. Knapp and his colleagues merely concluded that thymonucleic acid (the term for DNA at the time) had a decisive importance for genetic and physiological changes through radiation, and that the relationship between “thymonucleic acid and the genetic substance proper” had to be left to further studies. (Deichman, 1996, 219) he KWI Brain Research Genetics Department was established by Timofeeff-Ressovsky in 1925 in Berlin. The T KWI Brain Institute was notably the place where the greats of molecular biology worked together: Delbruck, Zimmer, T-R, and Pascual Jordan, the physicist. It is interesting that America tried to recruit T-R to head up their research in the States, but eventually landed Max Delbruck, who worked at Cold Springs before going to California. “In 1936, after the Reich Education Minister had increased the budget of his department, Timofeeff-Ressovsky turned down an offer from the Carnegie Institution to go to Cold Spring Harbor in the United States.” (Deichman, 1996, 221) The research purpose: “in his working report to the DFG in 1938, Tomofeeff-Ressovsky listed the following as the general research task of the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:86:82e0109ea14d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2439, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 87, "text": "head up their research in the States, but eventually landed Max Delbruck, who worked at Cold Springs before going to California. “In 1936, after the Reich Education Minister had increased the budget of his department, Timofeeff-Ressovsky turned down an offer from the Carnegie Institution to go to Cold Spring Harbor in the United States.” (Deichman, 1996, 221) The research purpose: “in his working report to the DFG in 1938, Tomofeeff-Ressovsky listed the following as the general research task of the department: the phenomenology of gene manifestation, experimental mutation research, and population genetics, with the main focus of the last two fields.” (Deichman, 1996, 221-2) Funds from the RFT and the Philips Company were used in 1938 to set up a biophysical laboratory in the department with apparatuses for radiobiological and radio-physical experiments, among them a powerful neutron generator, a linear accelerator for more effective generation of neutron radiation.” (Deichman, 1996, 222) [see Zimmer neutrino studies: around this time Zimmer is professionally employed by KWI] After Hermann Muller’s discovery in 1927 of the artificial induction of mutations through X-ray radiation, scientists were hoping to get closer to the nature of the gene by analyzing the mechanisms of the induction of mutations. For a number of years mutation research became the most modern, the most strongly funded and most widely pursued field of genetic research. Mutations were induced by X-ray, UV, and neutron radiation. The few experiments that were carried out at this institute with chemicals produced no evidence of chemical mutagenesis.” (Deichman, 1996, 222) Genetic mutation research is of course of interest to supporters of eugenics; as America was the major center of this research it is not surprising research funding came from America and sought to move the most advanced researchers to America. “In 1937 Delbruck received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to carry out genetic research under Thomas Morgan at the California Institute for Technology. Delbruck moved to the United States and in 1939 decided to stay. Shortly thereafter he shifted to genetic research in phage.” (Deichman, 1996, 223) Jordan was an advocate of Target Theory early on; this was also reflected by Zimmer and Delbruck, In their work on gene mutation and gene structure, T-R, Zimmer and Delbruck applied the target theory of the effect of radiation to the action of radiation in genetics. The Target theory was formulated in 1922 by Friedrich Dessauer as a mathematical description of the biological effects of radiation and was given specific form in 1924 by James Crowther. T-R, Zimmer and Delbruck reached the conclusion that a mutation represented a one-hit result that came about through a single, radiation-caused ionization in a hit area, the gene. (Deichman, 1996, 223) Jordan’s belief about molecular resonance: “However, in contrast to Delbruck, Jordan was not planning any experiments but deduced from quantum mechanics theoretical conclusions for biological problems.

(Deichman, 1996, 223) Jordan’s belief about molecular resonance: “However, in contrast to Delbruck, Jordan was not planning any experiments but deduced from quantum mechanics theoretical conclusions for biological problems. Based on quantum mechanics, he posited an attractive power between identical macromolecules (“quantum mechanical resonance attraction,” and with it he tried to explain not only the attraction of homologous chromosomes but also the self-replication of ‘genes and virus molecules.’ He argued that during replication similar molecules were built, the atoms of which were quantum-mechanically in different states.” (Deichman, 1996, 224) There is reason to believe that the intense contact with Jordan contributed to Timofeeff-Ressovsky’s decision to make the analysis of the primary process of mutation into one of his main areas of research. According to Jordan, many biological reactions, especially biological radiation effects (mutations) were microphysical reactions in the quantum-mechanical sense. He saw a phenomenon of quantum mechanics specifically in the movement of the energy released by ionization somewhere in the hit area to the place where it was used for the change of the gene molecule: electrons did not wander in the normal sense of the word but spread over a molecule like a wave (Jordan 1940). (Deichman, 1996, 225) Again, we see how Himmler was influential on this kind of research. “The scientific interests and personality of Heinrich Himmler (1900-1945) largely shaped the goals of the science policy of the SS as well as the practical content of the scientific and medical research it initiated.” (Deichman, 1996, 251) On July 7th, 1942 the Institute for Practical Research in Military Science was set up within SS Das Ahnenerbe. The Dachau experiments of Eduard May were conducted under this institute. Kurt Blome, Project Paperclip scientist brought to America, also worked under this institute. (see Deichman, 1996, 279) and had 5 science divisions and two medical divisions. “The informal working group for the study of biological weapons, established in 1940, was renamed the working group Blitzableiter and given the official responsibility by the high command of the Wehrmacht for research into biological warfare, which by Hitler’s order was intended to be only defensive.” (Deichman, 1996, 279) The biological weapons studied in Posen included plague bacteria. Research into the use of these bacteria as a warfare agent seems to have been one of Himmler’s main interests since 1944. According to investigations by the American secret service, Himmler has ordered that biological warfare research be conducted more offensively and to that end had offered Blome the opportunity of using a concentration camp for studies on the plague.

(Deichman, 1996, 284) “On the Nature of Gene Mutation and Gene Structure” – this was the title of a paper published in June 1935 that was to have a great impact on early molecular genetics. Long known as the “Green Pamphlet” or the “threeman-paper,” it has now attained cult status. The paper originated mainly in Berlin-Buch. The authors of this paper were the geneticist Nikolai Vladimirovich Timoféeff-Ressovsky (1900-1981), the radiation physicist Karl Günther Zimmer (1911-1988) and the theoretical physicist Max Delbrück (1906-1981). Each author was singly responsible for one of the first three parts of the paper (Timoféeff-Ressovsky: Some Facts from Mutation Research), (Zimmer: The Target Theory and Its Relation to the Triggering of Mutations) and (Delbrück: Atomic-Physics Model of Gene Mutation). The fourth part, the conclusion (Theory of Gene Mutation and Gene Structure), was written jointly. In the conclusion the authors stated: “We view the gene as an assemblage of atoms within which a mutation can proceed as a rearrangement of atoms or a dissociation of bonds (triggered by thermal fluctuations or external infusion of energy) and which is largely autonomous in its operations and in relation to other genes.” The remarkable reception the paper received was mainly due to the detailed presentation of it by Erwin Schrödinger (1887- 1961) in his 1944 book What is Life? (Wunderlich, 2011) We view the gene as an assemblage of atoms within which a mutation can proceed as a rearrangement of atoms or a dissociation of bonds (triggered by thermal fluctuations or external infusion of energy [radiation]) and which is largely autonomous in its operations and in relation to other genes. (Wunderlich, 2011) As part of the German scientific war efforts, was required to submit reports to the Reich Research Council, classified as secret. Some of the reports were “Report on studies of the relative effectiveness of X-rays and fast neutrinos with regard to the generation of chromosomal mutations” they were under the Nuclear Physics Research Reports, an internal, top-secret publication series of the German Uranium Society. 1948 – Jordan, Pascual, Karl Günther Zimmer, Nikolai V.

Zeitschrift für Vererbungslehre 82: 67-73. Already in the Green Pamphlet the question was raised about the processes that are initiated by the localized supply of energy in biological material, which is associated with the absorption of radiation. Zimmer had barely arrived back in “normal” research operations, when he succeeded in 1957, together with the brothers Lars and Anders Ehrenberg, in making a spectacular finding: Using electron spin resonance spectroscopy, the researchers for the first time detected the formation of free organic radicals on living material following irradiation. Thus, a new field of research was opened, which Zimmer and his team worked on intensively in the following years in Karlsruhe. First and foremost, bacteriophages were used as biological models. The numerous further studies at the Karlsruhe Institute cannot be discussed further here. Among the approximately 550 publications that have emerged from the Institute of Radiation Biology under Zimmer’s directorship until his retirement in 1979, many were on the effects of radiation on enzymes (using the example of ribonuclease), on the characterization of primary chemical reaction products in irradiated DNA and on the effect of radiation-damage on the matrix function of DNA. Research was also pursued on radiation-induced energy transfer through elastic nuclear collisions. Zimmer rarely appeared as co-author of the original papers of his staff. Instead, he wrote many overview articles that are still worth reading today. (Wunderlich, 2011) 1. Zimmer belonged to the first generation of physicists who sustainably changed biology. The geneticist Guido Pontecorvo (1907-1999) described this as follows: “In the years immediately preceding World War II, something new happened: the introduction of ideas (not techniques) from the realm of physics into the realm of genetics, particularly to the problems of size, mutability, and self-replication of genes. The names of Jordan, Frank-Kamenetski, Friedrich-Freksa, Zimmer, and Delbrück, with Muller and [sic] Timofeef-Ressovsky as their biological interpreters, are linked to this development. […] The debt of genetics to physics, and to physical chemistry, for ideas began to be substantial then, and it has been growing steadily all the time.” Five of the seven scientists mentioned above worked for a time in Berlin-Buch, a sixth (Friedrich-Freksa) worked in Berlin-Dahlem.

Dr. John Norseen was an American weapons designer working on what today would be referred to as Neu-roweapons, he was also a lecturer at George Washington University in DC. When he was employed by outside the deepest of black operation-funded military and defense sectors. Even today, the development of such weapons is a highly classified and compartmentalized affair. Luckily, John Norseen was a bit more candid and conversational than most weapons designers working in classified positions for defense contractors. Late in his career, for a brief time he held conversations with the artist Duncan Laurie who worked in a field of radionic art. Norseen and Laurie’s correspondences were published by Laurie on the internet after Norseen died from a heart attack at age 53. He also left behind two papers still remaining on the internet, and a published piece co-authored with Juri Kropotov. Attempts at finding journal articles and publications from his time as a Navy officer at the Naval War College have come up empty, for instance the Naval War College has no record of his attendance, although it is confirmable that he did attend and was an officer in the US Navy working at one point in Intelligence. His thesis at the War College was on applying Neuroscience research to anti-terrorism investigations (Pasternak 2000). So, we are fortunate that he leaked certain points about his work in his conversations with Duncan Laurie and left behind some unclassified research papers published by a small computer engineering group, ‘American Computer Scientists Association’ (Norseen 1996) The first", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:92:588d17cc2782", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2445, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 93, "text": "his attendance, although it is confirmable that he did attend and was an officer in the US Navy working at one point in Intelligence.

So, we are fortunate that he leaked certain points about his work in his conversations with Duncan Laurie and left behind some unclassified research papers published by a small computer engineering group, ‘American Computer Scientists Association’ (Norseen 1996) The first article I could find on the work of John Norseen dates to a Newsweek article from 2001 he was interviewed for under the title, “Reading your mind and injecting smart thoughts” (Pasternak 2000) in which he talks of being able to read terrorist suspect’s thoughts remotely. In a subsequent article from 2001 in the Washington Times, “NASA plans to read terrorist’s minds at airports,” Norseen notes: Space technology would be adapted to receive and analyze brain wave and heartbeat patterns, then feed that data into computerized programs “to detect passengers who potentially might pose a threat,” according to briefing documents obtained by the Washington Times. NASA wants to use “noninvasive neuro-electric sensors,” imbedded in gates, to collect tiny electric signals that all brains and hearts transmit. Computers would apply statistical algorithms to correlate physiological patterns with computerized data on travel routines, criminal background and credit information from “hundreds to thousands of data sources,” Nasa documents say. (Murray 2002) While it appears the bulk of his work was done at Lockheed-Martin Norseen also had other projects such as working on a team for whole brain emulation in a cybersecurity context with Alert Grid Alliance, Inc., on a product known as ‘CYPHER’, a quantum intelligence cyber security system, which is claimed to have begun with Sanders Associates, who also did early work in video game consoles, later shipped under Magnavox branding. Norseen is associated as well with the Electro-Optics Lab at NOSC in San Diego under the auspices of the Naval Sea Systems Command [2]. Although interesting, the main area to focus on for this research is that related directly to Semiotics or what John Norseen termed in his conversations with Duncan Laurie, the ‘Norseen Semiotic.’ BioFusion is my name for the next generation of biometric security/intelligent inter-netted security systems. Please note that a fundamental basis to BioFusion is that brain structures execute biological functions, and that such functions can be represented and understood as mathematical equations [Kryolov space] existing in biophysical time/space/frequency/phase/quantum state Space, spoken of here as Gabor function (wavelet/ codelet) in Hilbert Space [vector space with a complete metric]. Accordingly, such mathematical representations lend themselves to machine/computational interpretation and cross machine/computational communications, hence the capability for Human-Machine interaction, and prediction of calculated results.

Therefore, if known neurological circuits, reading this page, or silently saying a sequence of numbers, or closing one’s eyes and imagining a picture…let’s say the image of the Mona Lisa…then with the proper sensing techniques, a display based on the underlying mathematical-biophysical space [Krylov space] can be generated which represents the very same neurological functioning. There is vast biomedical evidence of this in PET, MEG, EEG, FMRI, etc. which capture various neurological events faithfully and repeatedly. BioFusion extends the singular look of these various medical diagnostic techniques and merges them into a much more robust hyper-spectral analysis across the electromagnetic spectrum, within which brain function occurs, to correlate and pinpoint with more accurate detail the specific, self-similar regions of the brain engaged in mental processing of the target activity. (Norseen , Laurie, 2002, part 3) Another known way of capturing electric signals in the brain was proposed by Malech using standard Radar in 1974; this is also the method that a former MI-6 agent turned whistleblower, Carl Clark (Gross 2010), noted was used for covert applications of this technology [see Ch.7 ‘Radar and Neuroweapons’ section]. Here is an outline of how a Brain Emulation application works, by taking in biometric data and then applying statistical learning algorithms to that data and formulating a profile and Brain map of the observed target. BioFusion is the increasing complexity of one part of the brain to share, mathematically, its information with other parts of the brain in a common, emergent family of mathematical operations, to which the inverse function, the ability to recreate or trigger stored information by using the inverse mathematics is allowable. Panum’s fusion space, horopter operations, dreams, and the distinct linkage of either end of the invariant versus holistic storage continuum of object recognition in the posterior inferior temporal gyri (ITG) as opposed to the purer prosopopoeia [visual perception] in the fusiform gyrus (FG) are very nice examples of BioFusion in the visual perception modality. The ability to blend vision and verbal modalities in the Temporal Cortex, TC-22 and Broadmann’s Area 44, for example are also fine indications that BioFusion is taking place in more and more complex, adaptive regions of the brain. (Norseen, 2000) BioFusion is a play on another engineering term ‘Sensor Fusion’, but usually reserved for purely mechanical sensors such as on ships or aircraft. In essence, BioFusion is the discretization or quantization of your thoughts into a string represented as a vector in Krylov sub-space.

Alexei Krylov was a Russian mathematician who created a special mathematics for various calculations. With the quantization of neural information, it allows for a computer to process this information and do either deep mining of neural data, such as memories, or insert a new string to be fed into a radar or microwave generator to generate the necessary frequencies to alter brain function and wiring. Norseen writes: Anyways, I was working with the Russian Academy of Science Group in Reflexive Control and we were developing an N-Dimensional Graph, called Krylov Space after the Russian bio-mathematician, Krylov, and we developed this cursory folding map of how the brain can twist and turn Semiotics into Biological Pressures, and in certain regions of the Map, the person would as one would expect under harsh and continuing intense pressures…be pushed and molded into some perverse forms of behavior. In other areas of the Krylov Map, where things were going well, the Map was like a quiet estuary or shallow sea…very mellow…in a KRYLOV SPACE, a matrix dimensional grid of ONE IDENTITY communicating, sharing complete semiotics, with another IDENTITY…” (Norseen, Laurie, 2002, part 12) Well, equally, if you are aware that a person is entering an Alpha State, or better yet, a hypnogogic (falling asleep) or a hypnopompic state (pre-waking state) of a modified Theta-Alpha brain engagement region…you can actually see the subconscious mind at work and interact with it…you can actually inject Semiotics into the mental region and see the Brain Thoughts surround the Semiotic, infuse it, and then act upon it right into the Awake States. In this way, you can DYE INJECT, action potentials…for influencing someone during the day…or you can do the same thing and get Alert Semiotics injected into the sleeping and even into the Life-Death interface of the Delta state…you can probe the deepest depths of the person and see just exactly how deep into the abyss, the db, you can go…You can even affect someone with Semiotic cues down at negative (-) 200 db…down at the very bottom of our semiotic ability to understand information, and right at the zone where Alfven Wave corridors of the brain Magnetite exchange ZPE [zero point energy] in the dendritic neuropil at nanoscale, discrete bandwidth, channels.

Just as you can look into an aquarium or a fish bowl and see the stuff at the bottom work its way up to the surface, you can track the origin of Semiotics from Alfven Wave Interactions with ZPE, from the plumbed depths of the Brain. This is really pretty cool stuff, because it allows us the opportunity to use Radionics to condition or reinforce or direct the destination of the most basic to the most sublime of human thoughts and the HUMAN CONDI-TION. (Norseen, Laurie, 2002, part.6) Semiotics is a discipline (or an attempt to create a science) of combining the theory of signs (representations), symbols (categories), and meaning extraction. Semiotics is an inclusive discipline which incorporates all aspects of dealing with symbols and symbolic systems starting with encoding and ending with the extraction of meaning. (Albus et al, Undated) In the defense industry Semiotics has largely been identified with the work of C.S. Pierce. An American philosopher from a Boston Brahmin family, his wealthy pro-slavery upbringing was later given up for a semi-transcendentalist lifestyle on his farm where he lived in poverty. His affects and influence on the defense industry scientists that use his Semiotics and arguments of Logic is deep. In the appendix of Norseen and Laurie’s communications there is an explanation of Piercean Semiotics that is used by Norseen in his work, along with a scientist we shall read more deeply about, Ed Nozawa later. Semiotics being the study of signs, the definition according to Pierce: Another important element in Pierce’s thought and influence on defense contractor engineering and science is that of the Hypothesis. In many of the logic flows of these weapons designers is the concept of forming a hypothesis, then referencing a knowledge base, then re-running whatever iteration of the task one is involved in. As we shall read later under Nozawa the concept of ‘closed loop’ systems is a prevalent dynamic in such systems engineered under Piercean logic; creating a truly cybernetic system where all decisions potentially could be automated and based on computer algorithms with no human intervention.

In the terminology of Norseen, then the individual whether in a read or write operation to their brains, is the Interpretant, where the object is qualified by a Representatum. So that we understand that a sign can be manipulated by the systems under design and spoken of by Norseen, it can also be used to simply read signs from a human brain. Theoretically, according to Norseen, each thought represents an energy dispersion pattern which can be monitored by mixed electromagnetic sensors and described mathematically as a “Brain Print.” This brain-print can be inverted and retransmitted back into the brain much like an encoded memory. Subsequently, the brain will act upon this inverse signal as if it were a real signal from the environment. The implication was clearly that a command (encrypted as information contained within information), akin to a hypnotic suggestion, can be buried within unrelated visual and auditory information, to be broadcast to the general public. Norseen strongly suggested these techniques were connected to the Columbine murders, as though the killers had been infected from encrypted web sites beforehand, designed intentionally as trial behavior test scenarios. (Norseen, Laurie, 2002, part. 1) [ see Ch. 5, Intelligence infiltrates gaming communities] Although hypnosis is mentioned here, see Chapter 10, Hypnosis in Warfare, for more information. The process of how this works according to Norseen is that he uses ‘BioFusion’ (sensorfusion or datafusion) to collect all the thoughts (semiotes) in one’s head then has the ability to either do deep data mining and profiling to either extract or insert more information, resulting in either a cracked mind or a rewired mind. Now that bio-fusion research has developed beyond the initial stages and the database of what, how and where thoughts occur in the brain is mature, scientists are looking at information injection, a contentious issue, Norseen admits. The concept is based on the fact that human perception consists of certain invariant electromagnetic and biochemical lock-and-key interactions with the brain that can be identified, measured and altered by mathematical operations. If researchers can re-create the inverse function of what has been observed, they gain the ability to communicate or transmit that information back–intact or rearranged–to the individual or someone else, Norseen says. “When you get down to the mathematical properties, information injection is beginning to be demonstrated.” The brain is very susceptible to accepting information that is either real and comes from its own memory mechanisms or from injection from an outside source, Norseen notes. “I am sure you have memories of when the lawn was being cut in late summer and of the smell of the chlorophyll,” he says. “The chlorophyll would then evoke other memories.

I could possibly ping you with a light sequence or with an ELF [extremely low field] radiation sequence that will cause you to think of other things, but they may be in the area that I am encouraging. Those are direct ways in which I can cause the inverse function of something to be fired off in the brain so that you are thinking about it. I have now caused you to think about something you would not have otherwise thought about.” By using information injection, a person could be isolated from a group and made to believe that something is happening, while others in the group are being left alone. Likewise, someone at a command post monitoring information on a screen could be affected. Some experts believe that adversaries now are designing techniques that could affect the brain and alter the human body’s ability to process stimuli. (Berry, 2000) As can be seen, this technology has a very brazen double edge. Of course, it could be used to monitor a criminal to prevent them from committing crime, probably in the context of previous conviction under the law, but it could also be used by criminals of another sort to easily manipulate and control innocent persons, thus being an even greater threat to security than it could potentially prevent. What we are talking about here is the modification and alteration of behaviors. The modification of behavior is understood by Norseen as Reflexive Control, which was pioneered not just by Soviet scientists and Nazi scientists but also has its fair representation in American psychological scientific literature. For instance, several members of the editorial board of a publication dedicated to Reflexive Control in Russia come from the United States and Canada. Biosemiotics and cybernetics are closely related, yet they are separated by the boundary between life and non-life: biosemiotics is focused on living organisms, whereas cybernetics is applied mostly to non-living artificial devices. However, both classes of systems are agents that perform functions necessary for reaching their goals. I propose to shift the focus of biosemiotics from living organisms to agents in general, which all belong to a pragmasphere [Pierce’s Pragmatic Philosophy] or functional universe. Agents should be considered in the context of their hierarchy and origin because their semiosis can be inherited or induced by higher-level agents.

To preserve and disseminate their functions, agents use functional information – a set of signs that encode and control their functions. It includes stable memory signs, transient messengers, and natural signs. The origin and evolution of functional information is discussed in terms of transitions between vegetative, animal, and social levels of semiosis, defined by Kull. Vegetative semiosis differs substantially from higher levels of semiosis, because signs are recognized and interpreted via direct code-based matching and are not associated with ideal representations of objects. Thus, I consider a separate classification of signs at the vegetative level that includes proto-icons, proto-indexes, and proto-symbols. Animal and social semiosis are based on classification, and modeling of objects, which represent the knowledge of agents about their body (Innenwelt) and environment (Umwelt). (Sharov, 2010) Reflexive control is defined as a means of conveying to a partner or an opponent specially prepared information to incline them to voluntarily make the predetermined decision desired by the initiator of the action. It is an interesting point that the usual understanding of reflexive control is a ‘voluntarily’ made decision, but with thought injection we are talking about a reflexive control that is involuntary, even unconscious. Defense researchers from the European Union give the following technical definition of Reflexive Control: According to Russian methodologies, the theory of Reflexive Control (RC) allows an initiator to induce an adversary to take a decision advantageous to the initiator through information manipulation. The RC theory encompasses a methodology where specifically prepared information is conveyed to an adversary, which would lead that adversary to make a decision desired by the initiator. The methodology is generally understood by Russian planners to be applicable in a wide variety of situations and is deeply rooted within Russian Information Warfare concepts. Because theory envelops the Russian understanding of information as both technical data and cognitive content, ‘information resources’ are understood as technological as well as human. In principle, a well-developed (global) cyberspace presents theorists and operators of RC and RC methodology with numerous possibilities to affect their adversaries. This paper explores ways in which RC can be exercised with the help of the cyberspace. ( Jaitner et al, 2016) …I was to discover, a central figure in the field of Reflexive Control was the Russian scientist and distinguished member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Andrej V.

Brushlinsky. Norseen had visited him not so very long before we met. Subsequently, Brushlinsky was found robbed and murdered. Norseen believes he was killed by foreign agents, seeking the scientific protocols he had developed for a type of weaponized “thought insertion” called steganography, or “Stego Bullets” for short. (Norseen, Laurie, 2002, part 1) Of course, one can see the direct application of thought injection whether based on the methods of Norseen or Brushlinsky, in a weaponized space, especially in warfare. So, it is not surprising that there would come some espionage intrigue along with this research area. Thus, it is important to understand what precisely is happening in Reflexive Control that it would be such a high value target in international espionage. Traversing from Reflexive Control engineered through Thought Injection we come to larger issues that affect groups, collectives, and societies as a whole. As the Russian meddling in the US 2016 election clamor has brought to the attention such concepts of Information Operations by hostile forces to the attention of the average citizen, it should be mentioned again that in 2011 British GCHQ sponsored studies on undermining social network perceptions on a mass scale. Yet, there is not much meaningful discussion of these terms. Information operations and warfare, also known as influence operations, includes the collection of tactical information about an adversary as well as the dissemination of propaganda in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent.[4]. Information Operations are used in direct correlation to the methods of Perception Management. Perception Management is: Perception management involves all actions that convey and/or deny selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives and objective reasoning; and to intelligence systems and leaders at all levels to influence official estimates, ultimately resulting in foreign behaviors and official actions favorable to the originators objectives. In various ways, perception management combines truth projection, operations security [OPSEC] cover and deception, and psychological operations [PSYOP]. [5] The key word in understanding Perception Management, whether for selling beer or conducting PSYOP is ‘Expectation.’ Tons of advertising research dollars swirls down the drain getting commercials right and the audience wrong… You have to either match up the right situations or control the expectation level of the target audience – this holds true for either media or PSYOP management. “But imagine if you could actually monitor expectations non-invasively, quietly, garnering sufficient measurement of how ‘Designed Information’ is interacting with the central nervous system of the intended audience. This is what the Science Of Semiotics – signs and symbols – is heading towards, and can be seen", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:100:8013e05bced6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2453, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 101, "text": "right and the audience wrong… You have to either match up the right situations or control the expectation level of the target audience – this holds true for either media or PSYOP management. “But imagine if you could actually monitor expectations non-invasively, quietly, garnering sufficient measurement of how ‘Designed Information’ is interacting with the central nervous system of the intended audience. This is what the Science Of Semiotics – signs and symbols – is heading towards, and can be seen today in forms such as ‘Engagement Indices’ and other biometric techniques of audience attention. This would appear to be the logical extension of Neuro-control into marketing and perception management. (Moore 2003) Norseen replies: “If ‘Information Injection’ pans out – the concept that human perception is made up of certain invariant electromagnetic, and biochemical, lock and key interactions [QSK] with brain structure which can be identified, measured and altered by mathematical/technical operations – then the stage is set to observe, capture, rearrange and play-back human mental functions from one person to another, or into any combination of man-machine system interface. The development of such Cortical Emulation Software, if successful, will rapidly usher in the potential for automated personal diaries – Emotional Recordings, Mental Cameras, and Digital Biographies. Just as we today catalogue millions of people by fingerprints, this strongly suggests the future ability to use Brain-Prints as the key biometric signature identifier in Total Information Awareness.[3]” (Norseen, Laurie 2002 Part 1 ‘Reflexive Control’) The concept of injection of information for Information Operations from one human into another human, or from a machine generation of information into a human, the inverse function is utmost and vital. In order to trigger, or refine, or replace, or sharpen an old perception in the human, or to create brand new perceptions, the exact inverse function must be known, or very close to it, in order to fool the brain into accepting it as real. And this inverse injection must also very closely model the exact E and H fields, the electromagnetic field shapes that the original Gabor-like Function in Hilbert Space occupied. (Norseen, 2000) As can be seen as a weapons designer there is no cloudiness to the intent behind the weapons systems he was designing. In the field of Information Operations in warfare and specifically creating a genre of Neuroweapons capable of such abilities as direct thought injection the ability to undermine an enemy in a battlespace is of unimpeachable value. The Soviet and Russian Armed Forces have long studied the use of reflexive control theory, particularly at the tactical and operational levels, both for maskirovka (deception) and disinformation purposes and, potentially, to control the enemy’s decision-making processes. For example, the Russian Army had a military maskirovka school as early as 1904 that was later disbanded in 1929. This school, the Higher School of Maskirovka, provided the bases for maskirovka concepts and created manuals", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:101:a3b3c357c145", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2454, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 102, "text": "in a battlespace is of unimpeachable value.

This school, the Higher School of Maskirovka, provided the bases for maskirovka concepts and created manuals for future generations. Since the early 1960s, there have been many Russian intellectual “giants” who have emerged in the field of reflexive theory. In the civilian sector, these include G. P. Schedrovitsky, V. E. Lepsky, V. A. Lefebvre (who now lives in the West), D. A. Pospelov, V. N. Burkov, and many others. The foremost theorists in the military sector include V. V. Druzhinin, M. D. Ionov, D. S. Kontorov, S. Leonenko, and several others. (Thomas 2004) As one reads scientific publications on Reflexive Control and Semiotics two names often encountered are V. A. Lefebvre and D.A. Pospelov. Lefebvre, now teaching in the United States, has created an interesting paradigm known as Reflexive Game Theory, see Senglaub below for Semiotic Cybernetics examples. A researcher, Sergey Tarasenko, notes: The Reflexive Game Theory (RGT) has been entirely developed by Lefebvre and is based on the principles of anti-selfishness or egoism forbidenness and human reflexion processes. Therefore, RGT is based on the human-like decision-making processes. The main goal of the theory is to model behavior of individuals in the groups. It is possible to predict choices, which are likely to be made by each individual in the group and influence each individual’s decision-making due to make this individual to make a certain choice. In particular, the RGT can be used to predict terrorists’ behavior. It is important to point out that the anti-Terrorism aspect is a particular application of Reflexive Game Theory while, as Lefebvre writes, in general it can be used for mass applications. It is interesting also that this scientist has sought not only to apply reflexive control to humans but also robots and has mixed them together in his studies in groups. Tarasenko notes regarding the influence of robots on humans in 2010: However, robots are forbidden and should not physically force people, but must convince people on the mental level to refrain from doing a risky action. This method is more effective rather than a simple physical compulsion, because humans make the decisions (choices) themselves and treat these decisions as their own. Such technique is called a reflexive control. The task of finding appropriate reflexive control is closely related with the Inverse task, when we need to find suitable influence of one subject on another one or on a group of subjects on the subject of interest. Therefore, it is needed to develop the framework of how to solve", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:102:f2fcb7a79d67", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2455, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 103, "text": "is more effective rather than a simple physical compulsion, because humans make the decisions (choices) themselves and treat these decisions as their own.

Therefore, it is needed to develop the framework of how to solve the Inverse task. This is the primary goal of this study. (Tarasenko 2010) With the collapse of the Soviet Union many Russian scientists that had previously been employed by the KGB and GRU found themselves in need of funding and sponsorship. Quickly stepping into this sponsorship vacuum came the American secret intelligence agencies seeking to acquire Soviet technology. Norseen, it is known, worked with Russian scientists in the Reflexive Control area of expertise; notable among these is the previously mentioned, murdered scientist Brushlinsky, AI pioneer Dr. Prospolev, and AI designer V.K. Finn, and founder of RGT, Lefebvre. One of them (calling itself a Semiotic Design and Control Group of Russian Academy of Sciences) has recently communicated an interest in working with researchers in the United States. In response to this interest, US government has sponsored, and many other government agencies were involved in, two workshops: one in Columbus, Ohio in June 1995; the other in Monterey, California in August, 1995. (Albus et al, undated) Norseen’s use of Semiotics, Reflexive Control and Thought Injection is not new. In the research corridor of New Mexico largely associated with US Government scientific research, for instance, Sandia Labs is located there. A team was created in the Physical Science Laboratory at New Mexico State University. This team was founded by Russian emigre Vladimir Lefebvre who is cited by Norseen in his research. The commonalities between Norseen’s research and the PSL group is obvious: The theory allows the modeling of high-level value systems. Using the theory, values such as self-esteem, pride, human dignity and willingness to sacrifice may be incorporated into modeling of human agents. Other theories of human behavior do not allow for modeling such non-utilitarian factors. Using a model developed from Reflexive Theory, it will be possible to predict, for example, which of a group of potential terrorists might be susceptible to recruiting by terrorist organizations such as al Queda. Of Piercian Scientific Semiotics and its role in United States national security, I can honestly say that I was part of the inception in the early 1990’s and have watched over the last decade the growth from the first national security working group on scientific semiotics to where it is now a recognized science effort around the world… but with not nearly enough Book elucidation, and still lacking a dedicated National Scientific Philosophy linkage into National Security.

Almost all of the pacing Soviet scholars that I have met are now dead or corrupted… and most of the working semiotics is now under a classified rubric. At least I can edify about the frolicsome years from 1995-2002 where no holds barred and semiotics as the New Occult held sway…try to search on Lycos with the terms NSA PSYOP…there is a link that you need to see…I will get it to you later. The link describes how semiotics and brain communications can be done covertly. Imagine that. [see note 29 of text] (Norseen, Laurie, 2002, part 15) The next time he found himself at the Double Eagle [a bar in New Mexico], it was with a group of Russian semioticians with whom he was collaborating. This eclectic group was formed in the early 1960’s by a Soviet General that set up a secret program of covert reflexive control operations with the KGB and GRU now under the direction of a certain Dr. Pospelov, of extreme interest to Lt. General Ken Minihan, the Director of NSA [National Security Agency] (DIRNSA). Norseen was tired when they arrived. Then, as he walked in, the lights of the saloon went crazy. The one person capable of working the entire bar, physical and non-physical, had arrived. As Norseen worked his way into trance once again, the entities allowed him to enter the minds of his Russian colleagues, probing their thoughts and memories. To their horrified surprise he began casually rattling off the contents of their mind. At the conclusion of the story, Norseen was careful to point out that every one of these Russians (save the general with the gold tooth) is now dead or incapacitated. (Norseen, Laurie, 2002, part 13) Though it is notable that he may have been employing this technology to debrief the Russian scientists in an environment of high suggestibility using alchohol as a trance agent (see THIQ below), the important point in this recollection is the role of the NSA in sponsoring these Russian scientists and in collaboration with American weapons designers working for Lockheed-Martin. The question of Brushlinsky’s murder is an interesting one. Brushlinsky’s research specifically contributed to ‘Activity Theory’, important to the field of Human-Computer Interface. (See also Victor Finn Quasi-Axiomatic Theory). While the public reasoning behind his homicide was simple burglary, it is very provocative that the US was working on the same technology he was working on but for the Russian", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:104:3dd34e05e1cc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2457, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 105, "text": "the role of the NSA in sponsoring these Russian scientists and in collaboration with American weapons designers working for Lockheed-Martin.

(See also Victor Finn Quasi-Axiomatic Theory). While the public reasoning behind his homicide was simple burglary, it is very provocative that the US was working on the same technology he was working on but for the Russian Federation. Adding to the intrigue is the statement of a leading researcher in Russia regarding the murder and theft: In the meantime, the director of the institute for the psychological precautions against terrorism, Professor Viktor Fersht, released a sensational statement. He said that Brushlinsky did not fall the victim of the street robbers. The briefcase contained exclusive documents about the newest, reflexive method of searching for terrorists. The concept was developed at one of the labs of the mentioned institute, and professor Lepsky was in charge of that work. [6] Norseen in his conversations with Laurie notes a sea change in the development of these ideals in research as the technology became tangible and in production. Norseen, rather unwisely, used his work email address to communicate with Laurie regarding this subject. It is not known if an internal security audit picked up on his conversations or not but around 2002, during his active conversations with civilians on this subject he writes of his security clearance and assignment changing: I just found out that my clearances have been updated. I go in for a new Top-Secret indoctrination tomorrow. Also, at work, my computer and my phone and my office were taken down. I enter over the next few weeks, a new office, a new program, and new computer phone identities. Very odd. (Norseen, Laurie, 2002, part 15) side from the Reflexive Control scientists mentioned in the previous section, Norseen has cited the work of Avarious other researchers in the field of consciousness, cybersecurity, etc. In this section I shall review some of the researchers he has cited in his work relating to Consciousness. Norseen is an adherent to the ideal of Quantum Consciousness; this is that consciousness has its origins in the quantum Planck scale of existence, and interacts with the classical world through a molecular construct known as Microtubulin (MT) in the Brain’s neural networks. A well-known proponent of this theory is the anesthetist Dr. Stuart Hameroff of the University of Arizona and the physicist Dr. Sir Roger Penrose. They term their hypothesis the ‘ORCH-OR’ theory, simply known as the Orchestrated Reduction of the quantum wave state. One early researcher in Quantum Consciousness sited by Norseen is Dr. Koruga of the University of Belgrade. Dr. Koruga concluded in a paper with Hameroff that: Encoding discrimination of biologic sensory information is accomplished by quantum shift keying (QSK). QSK originates in the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:105:c0b81089ed65", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2458, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 106, "text": "theory is the anesthetist Dr. Stuart Hameroff of the University of Arizona and the physicist Dr. Sir Roger Penrose.

One early researcher in Quantum Consciousness sited by Norseen is Dr. Koruga of the University of Belgrade. Dr. Koruga concluded in a paper with Hameroff that: Encoding discrimination of biologic sensory information is accomplished by quantum shift keying (QSK). QSK originates in the orchestrated reduction (OR) of quantum entanglement at specific electromagnetic resonating frequency locations in protein micro-tubulin in the neuropil. QSK is then communicated via oscillating and standing waves in the neurosynaptic - dendritic region. This resonating mode is either reinforced or reduced by related binding, non-binding activity in other regions of the brain. At certain frequency and energy thresholds, a combining resonance is established in brain function that binds the various oscillating brain sub-resonances into a cohesive, sentient pattern. Hameroff (90’s) indicates that calpain is a primary neuro-molecule that softens brain protein micro-tubulin (MT), which after an electromagnetic resonance wave interference pattern (holonomic) is presented onto the MT, the calpain is dissipated and a structural imprint of the QSK encoded wavefront interference pattern is thus captured in biologic protein structure. Sufficient memory storage mechanisms would be available in the brain to overcome state cycle limitations, since no synapto-dendritic region physically touches any other in the human brain. This establishes myriad number of switching pathways for random, but QSK coded, information patterns to be stored, with self-similar recall features in place. Access to any part of the lissajous-like distribution pattern would allow eventual reconstruction of the invariant information stored in holonomic memory. Internal stimulation of the resonant frequency modality or the actual physical bandwidth would provide the brain with internal memory recall capability. Cognitive recall is comprised of Gabor Functions in Hilbert Space. (Norseen, 1996) With this finding and knowledge, it is not hard to imagine, as is covered under the Neuroweapons section, how one could use frequencies to insert thoughts at a quantum level; thus, utilizing the calculations of Krylov sub-space to create or extract thoughts in a human brain. Another indicator of Quantum level of consciousness is that many reports of this phenomenon investigated academically have a non-local characteristic (Persinger, 2015) (Norseen Laurie 2002), which in physics is non-local, not just spatially but also temporally. As mentioned, others have found a non-local effect in neuro-warfare techniques. One such technology is known as ‘transcommunication’ or communication between people at great distances that appear to share deep correlations – or what is known as quantum entanglement.

The kind of stuff you may want to research is Program Igloo White from Vietnam; you may have to go into the JMIC vaults for this. You should also re-look at what Colby did at Bien Hoa hospital in Vietnam – he may be gone now but a good source here is the Science Advisor to CENTCOM. I can feed you a bit based on my talks with Colby before he died in his canoe [a heart attack]… about Shadow (MACVSOG) within Phoenix. The future of PSYOP, as I am talking about it, grew out of this period, going way back of course to MKULTRA and the Dulles brothers at Langley under the first stop programs: Artichoke and Bluebird. The legacy for today is still the work of Persinger in the Canadian labs…with neat stuff on training people in near death experiences in New Zealand. I can fill you in on the avante garde work here… it even goes into Dubrov’s work and the work at Kharkov University where KGB Spetsnaz went into flat line conditions to receive their Stego-bullet instruction sets for their dream missions. This, of course, goes to my visits to Moscow where, unfortunately, Brushlinsky was just found murdered in his apartment. He was passionate with me about his ability to use Dream Sequences to prepare for mission rehearsal. So, you may want to search on Brushlinsky. This will take you into the marine mammal experiments with information injection and then back again to our programs within Air Research and Edwin May [Remote Viewing]. There is really juicy stuff here and you will get a charge out of it. But beware; it can bite you very quickly. I know, it bit me too. (Norseen, Laurie, 2002, part 3) We will consider here two researchers as it relates to quantum consciousness, Dubrov and Persinger. In the preceding it was mentioned that Norseen told Laurie to research the areas of Edwin May and the Air Research Institute. Edwin May was a project manager, much debased by normative scholars, in the US Military and Secret Intelligence which conducted experiments in Remote Viewing (see Neuroweapons section, i.e., German Navy experiments). Remote viewing is one example of trans-communication. Many have claimed that such remote viewing can be done using microwaves, which dates back in Soviet research to at least 1938.

Suggesting that trans-communication between consciousnesses at a distance has an electromagnetic component. However, other Soviet researchers suggested it indeed was not electromagnetic, while others suggested it can occur at Extreme Low Frequency (ELF) electromagnetic waves. Dubrov advocated another mechanism in physics for such effects, namely gravitational waves [See fuller discussion in Quantum Mechanics section]. Persinger also recently suggested that gravitons are the mechanism for transcommunication. Many researches have also suggested gravitational-like fields as the mechanism for trans-communication between consciousnesses, such as Burkhard Heim, largely unknown outside of defense contractors (i.e. MBB) in Germany and a small community of German physicists. Kozyrev, a Russian astrophysicist, claimed that what he termed ‘causal fields’ were capable of ESP. Kozyrev has ‘time’ as a particle; it may share analogs with gravitons. Dubrov termed his gravitational explanation for the phenomenon ‘bio-gravitation’, He writes: By the term bio-gravitation, we designate a field-energy system. The bio-gravitational field is universally convertible, i.e., it is capable of transition into any form of field and energy, and therefore a unified field theory must be worked out especially for it. Many facts reported in the literature of psychotronics [paraphysics] give evidence of this property of the bio-gravitational field. The bio-gravitational field thus reflects in microcosm the problem of the unified field, which is the cornerstone of the physics of the future. It will be clear to the unbiased reader that the work published in 1965 by the Soviet physicist K. Stanjukovic on the interdependence of gravitation and elementary particles has made a fundamental contribution to the development of these ideas. This theory has now made great headway, but at the time when it was published there were of course no grounds to suppose that the real solution to this problem could be found primarily in biology on the basis of facts also observable in psycho-tronics (Dubrov 1974, 312) Michael Persinger was a researcher at Laurentian University in Canada that has extensively studied such phenomena as Remote Viewing and Trans-communication. Before his recent death, he released a technology that allowed for trans-communication based on resonating and synchronized magnetic fields. He found the graviton was directly involved in entanglement: On the bases of the calculations and conceptual inferences, entanglement phenomena across the space-time that defines the universe could be mediated by a gravitational field whose quantized component, the mass of a graviton, when expressed as the square of the hypothetical entanglement velocity, is light.

This velocity ⋅ 10²³ m ⋅ s^( − 1), ) is derivable from independent approaches that require the consideration of the universe as a single set. If this inference derived from empirical measurements is valid, then there is additional evidence that “excess correlation” and entanglement of photons anywhere in the universe is mediated by quantized components of a gravitational field that is contained within the total spatial and temporal boundaries (Persinger, 2015) In one area mentioned here by Norseen was the effect of creating a sense of the Divine using magnetic fields, famously known as the ‘God Helmet’ experiments, where magnets are used to create an altered state of consciousness or sense of the Divine, which could also be used for other applications. Norseen also cites the Schumann Resonance; Persinger also did extensive research in this field of inquiry. Clearly Norseen kept up with active research in edge science areas such as paraphysics since such things were directly related to Thought Injection and Bio-fusion. Any movement within a conducting fluid that is in the presence of a magnetic field will generate electrical currents. These currents will then interact with the field to produce mechanical forces which act back on the fluid. In 1942, Hannes Alfven noted that in this scenario “a kind of combined electromagnetic-hydrodynamic wave is produced which so far as I know, has as yet attracted no attention.” Alfven calculated the properties of such waves, suggesting that they could be important in solar physics. Today, Alfven waves and other related magnetohydrodynamic waves take center stage in the study of laboratory, space and astrophysical plasmas. Alfven, H. Nature 150, 405–406 (1942) It is only speculation and there is no direct evidence that this secret military project existed, but in Project Montauk they claimed to have used some grid for ‘trans-communication.’ If this is the Alfven wave grid, then it would be understandable for Norseen’s repeated mentioning of the Alfven wave grid. Returning for a moment to the ideal of field propulsion it is interesting that Norseen was interested in exotic aircraft designs. I believe that Norseen must have been familiar with a book on the subject of ESP, since he also mentions in one section of his conversations with Laurie, the spaceship of Ezekiel, which is also a paper presented in the book, cited on Bio-gravitation of Dubrov. Norseen conducted research in Air related systems for Lockheed Martin, and his funding contract was for aircraft controls while at Lockheed Martin.

Norseen writes: It is just after 0530 and I am already in the office, with a lot of icy roads outside. I am here all alone in probably the world’s largest hangar. Down the street we house the C-5 Jumbo Cargo Plane; three of them in a row under one roof—wild! They look like huge blue-gray air whales. Just standing under them is like looking up into the jaws of Tyrannosaurus Rex or the Vegan Brontosaurus. And then, in our windowless palace of concrete and RF Tempest shielding, I am surrounded by ideas and visions of all kinds of advanced earth and non-earth-based aircraft designs. I keep trying to figure out what kind of craft Ezekiel was describing in the Bible… (Norseen, Laurie, Part 15) Norseen also touches on other aspects of Quantum Mechanics – for instance, it is noted that Gravitational theories are mainly concerned with the study of particle physics, such as Heim’s ability to calculate particle masses with accuracy decades before they were known by exact experiments, Norseen writes: To understand how a super-solid could exist, you have to imagine the realm of quantum mechanics, the modern theory that explains many of the properties of matter. In this realm there are different rules for the two categories of particles: fermions and bosons. Fermions include particles like electrons and atoms with an odd mass number, like helium-3. Bosons include atoms with an even mass number, like helium-4. The quantum-mechanical rule for fermions is that they cannot share a quantum state with other particles of their kind, but for bosons there is no limit to the number that can be in the identical quantum state. This talent that bosons have for Rockettes-style coordination leads to the remarkable properties that Chan and Kim discovered in super cooled helium-4. “When we go to a low-enough temperature, thermal energy is no longer important and this quantum-mechanical effect becomes very apparent,” Chan explains. “In a super solid of helium-4, its identical helium-4 atoms are flowing around without any friction, rapidly changing places — but, because all its particles are in the identical quantum state, it remains a solid even though its component particles are continually flowing.” (Norseen, Laurie, Part 11) The previous quote touches directly on the functioning of a Quantum Computer processor, for instance Quantum Annealing, which operates at super cold temperatures of almost absolute zero Kelvin.

Whether as an intended leak of how their computers might work, or not, the first commercially available Quantum Computer, by D-Wave Systems in Vancouver, uses Helium 3 and 4 solutions to keep its processor super-cooled. To what extent the commercial venture was based on covert science is not known. ybernetics (see more in cybernetics discussion in chapter 5) is the study of control in animals and machines. As was mentioned before, the Piercean Semiotic is not just limited to linguistics but has also had a major impact on control theory and logic of controllers in weapons systems. The American founder of Cybernetics, Norbert Wiener, worked on controllers for radar defense during WW2. As we shall see later Automatic Target Tracking for Radar plays a major part in what we can call Semiotic Cybernetics, the concatenation between Semiotic Logic and Cybernetic controllers. Norseen was at least aware of the lectures of researchers interested in Semiotic Control or Cybernetics at the behest of a U.S. Army-funded gathering (Norseen, 2000)[7]. Early work in this field was actually done by Russian AI researchers, Dimitri Popsolev and V.K. Finn, to name just a couple researchers. In research presentations by Sandia National Labs, owned and managed by Lockheed-Martin, is the consultancy of Dr. Robert Burch (Burch 1997), a professor of Philosophy at Texas A&M University, who studied with V.K. Finn in Moscow at VINITI, specifically reviewing Semiotic Intelligent Systems. So, it is important to understand the influence of Popsolev and Finn on later American weapons system designers. This interest arose, originally, in two ways. First, some thirty years ago in the former Soviet Union, interest in Peirce and Karl Popper had led logicians and computer scientists like Victor Konstantinovich Finn and Dmitri Pospelov to try to find ways in which computer programs could generate Peircean hypotheses (Popperian “conjectures”) in “semiotic” contexts (non-numerical or qualitative contexts). Under the guide in particular of Finn’s intelligent systems laboratory in VINITI-RAN (the All-Russian Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of the Russian Academy of Sciences), elaborate techniques for automatic generation of hypotheses were found and were extensively utilized for many practical purposes. Finn called his approach to hypothesis generation the “JSM Method of Automatic Hypothesis Generation” (so named for similarities to John Stuart Mill’s methods for identifying causes). Among the purposes for which the JSM Method has proved fruitful are sociological prediction, pharmacological discovery, and the analysis of processes of industrial production. Interest in Finn’s work, and through", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:111:6883a4e48f09", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2464, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 112, "text": "Information of the Russian Academy of Sciences), elaborate techniques for automatic generation of hypotheses were found and were extensively utilized for many practical purposes.

Among the purposes for which the JSM Method has proved fruitful are sociological prediction, pharmacological discovery, and the analysis of processes of industrial production. Interest in Finn’s work, and through it in the practical application of Peirce’s philosophy, has spread to France, Germany, Denmark, Finland, and ultimately the United States. (Battele 1996) Pospolev was to become an innovator in the field of Applied Semiotics. The important innovation was using Peirce’s Logic regarding ‘abduction’ to create hypotheses which went on to become a formation for deeper Artificial Intelligence techniques, which also influenced the creator of Genetic Algorithms, John Holland [see below]. In this process the machine intelligence controller forms a ‘loop function.’ It makes a guess, then runs through data to see if the guess fits the model of the data and can repeat this if there is no break clause in the loop. Albus and Meystel note the contributions of Pospelov to Applied Semiotics: Development of the Semiotic Modeling and Situation Analysis area (SSA) is motivated by a strong desire to make the analysis and design of Large Complex Systems, or Intelligent Systems in general, better organized methodologically, more consistent and formally balanced. One of the features of this new methodology is extraction of knowledge from the descriptive information by its consistent analysis based upon well-established algorithms. This should give an opportunity to make the descriptive information a part of the analysis of dynamic processes of control systems theory. It also requires development of new methods of dealing with large (often, multi-resolution) symbolic systems, and use of “symbol grounding” processes. All of this can be considered now a part of Semiotics. Several efforts to accomplish this task are known. They were pioneered by W. Haken in Germany, I. Prigogine in France, researchers from CNLS in Los Alamos National Laboratory and in the Santa Fe Institute in the US. In all of these efforts, the opportunities of a linguistic analysis have not been explored. A. Nerode (Cornell) is moving closer to SSA in his Hybrid Control Systems. D. Pospelov and his team from Russia, made Semiotics a basis for development of a variety of formal methods presently known as SSA, or Applied Semiotics. D. Pospelov, the creator of SSA is definitely a global thinker, he is well prepared in a multiplicity of sciencescomponents. Unlike many prominent scientists who have specialized solely in their own domain, D. Pospelov is a broad-minded multidisciplinary scholar who has demonstrated bold and aggressive thought in constructing concepts and making associations. US scientists have serious and sometimes better results in each of the components of SSA. However,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:112:b87af0c3937d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2465, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 113, "text": "a variety of formal methods presently known as SSA, or Applied Semiotics.

(Albus et al, Undated) Later, Pospelev’s work would inform and contribute to research in America. Where one important theoretician working for Lockheed-Martin and a one-time colleague of Norseen was Ed Nozawa. Nozawa is cited in Norseen and Laurie’s communications as an expert on Peircean Logic. Nozawa’s work is important in the field of controls. He investigated the automation of controllers, from Air Traffic Control (radar) to control of Intelligent Systems. He was the creator of the concept of what is known as the ‘Single Warrior Model’, of which there is little unclassified information in open-source material. His biography: E.T. Nozawa (BSE, MSEE) is an Advanced Systems Engineer with Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems, Marietta, Georgia. He is the Chairman of the Lockheed Martin Data Fusion Working Group. Experience includes research and development of advanced automatic and adaptive military systems including Multi-Sensor Systems, TWS/SWT Tracking Systems, Information Fusion Systems, and Airborne Weapons Systems; Conceptual design of Advanced Airborne Surveillance and Targeting systems; and system definition and design of Advanced Surface Based 3-D Surveillance and Targeting Radar systems and Automatic and Adaptive TWS Tracking systems. He is a member of the IEEE, AAAI, Charles Sanders Peirce Society. (GACIAC Undated) In Nozawa’s work he has talked about the use of Peircean logic to create self-contained automated management system loops, ‘Single Warrior Model.’ He uses a concept from Semiotics and Intelligent Systems known as functional loops and applies this to controllers, thus creating a ‘closed loop management system’: The topic of fully autonomous weapons systems has come to the fore in ethical conversations regarding weapons development, for example the on-line community of AI developers against fully autonomous weapons, https:// autonomousweapons.org/. However, this is a recent topic of conversation among Weapons and AI developers. This slide, originally from 1995, predates these conversations by some two decades. The question we have to ask is, ‘Was automation and cybernetic control put into play in tandem with Neuroweapons, automated thought injection based on machine learning algorithms and situation management?’ One need not look too far into nightmare film scenarios from Hollywood for such a situation of automated neuro-warfare. Genetic Algorithms founder, John Henry Holland was inspired by Peircean logic. See also the work of Matthew Kabrisky for USAF ‘ATR’ fusion. He is mentioned by Norseen. Matthew Kabrisky: “A Proposed Model for Visual Information Processing", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:113:02773bbafeca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2466, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 114, "text": "ask is, ‘Was automation and cybernetic control put into play in tandem with Neuroweapons, automated thought injection based on machine learning algorithms and situation management?’ One need not look too far into nightmare film scenarios from Hollywood for such a situation of automated neuro-warfare.

Matthew Kabrisky: “A Proposed Model for Visual Information Processing in the Human Brain.” Michael Senglaub, PhD, colleague of Nozawa at Sandia National Laboratories, owned by Lockheed-Martin. “Knowledge Representation in Reasoning Systems” and “C2 for Complex endeavors Automated Decision Support in a Complex Information Space.” Troubling is the connection of Sandia Researchers, who worked directly with Nozawa as a consultant to their work, that specialize in ‘Network Assurance and Survivability’ such as Michael Senglaub (Senglaub 2001) and their being influenced by closed loop automated controllers under Nozowa’s Peircean model. Meaning that if system designers for, say, nuclear missile defense, systems designed to withstand end-of-world conflicts continue operating on their own without human intervention based on the Peircean models, they could continue fighting wars after there are no more humans left to fight. In this case we have a clear example of a situation of loop controllers and engineers such as Senglaub and Nozawa using loops to control weapons systems. Senglaub, in the applications section of his research paper (Senglaub 2001), suggests using the Peircean model for Data Fusion, Anti-Terrorism, Cognition-Based Decision Making and Autonomous System Control. Thus, possibly in their designs they have integrated Closed Loop Management Systems, which is to say fully automated weapons systems which also may integrate Holland’s Peircean Genetic Algorithms – self-writing algorithms. An additional element to the research conducted by Sandia (Senglaub 2005) is that of using game theory to be deployed within the systems [see deeper discussion of Simulation AI in online supplement Appendix D]. Thus, with the integration of games into defense systems we have a computational model that could be invoked which is based purely on mathematical conditions that claim to model the real world; but fall short of it. The issue of bias in AI is a prime problem area and is something that will need to be carefully monitored in applications. If a bias is introduced the AI can get stuck and move in one direction without correcting itself, such as in an adversarial network with Red vs. Blue, so that an attacker in such a biased network would end up with an advantage. More is covered on the issue of bias and adversarial networks in online supplement Appendix D. Graphic from Senglaub presentation which is similar to contemporary Generative Adversarial Networks architecture. This was initially presented in 2003 in the Journal on Reflexive Control by an American team of researchers, pictured previously, from NMSU RTRT group (Kramer et al,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:114:1c39003a4340", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2467, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 115, "text": "as in an adversarial network with Red vs. Blue, so that an attacker in such a biased network would end up with an advantage.

This was initially presented in 2003 in the Journal on Reflexive Control by an American team of researchers, pictured previously, from NMSU RTRT group (Kramer et al, 2003). We can see the direct influence between Senglaub’s work and that of the group: It is an interesting point of understanding that this conception of adversarial networks predates the innovations in contemporary Artificial Intelligence, introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2017, so that we see the pre-dating of what is considered cutting edge AI techniques in the public sector by at least 15 years in the defense industry. As is indicated in Senglaub’s graph, POMDP (Partial-Observable Markov Decision Process), which is of interest to GANs and Deep Reinforcement Learning as ‘breakthroughs’ in AI techniques in such applications of using AI to compete against human competitors in Real-Time Strategy Games (RTS), such as what is viewed as the elite public application of this techniques at London based Deepmind. We can see that there is a clear technological lead in the compartmentalized covert world compared to that of the public domain; which, as we shall see later, is also of interest to Quantum Computation (QC), where just in the last 2 years QC simulations have become public, but were written of by Defense researchers some 20 years ago. Traditional game theory is a normative science and is not meant for modeling the real behavior of players. This paper describes a method the goal of which is to predict the choices of players in real situations rather than to compute optimal decisions. It is assumed that each player faces a choice between two strategies: active and passive. The method is based on structural representation of a subject together with his images of the self and another. This representation allows us to compose systems of equations whose solutions are the probabilities with which the players choose the alternative strategies. (Lefebvre 2010) Stated simply, Alice and Bob are in Nash equilibrium if Alice is making the best decision she can, taking into account Bob’s decision while his decision remains unchanged, and Bob is making the best decision he can, taking into account Alice’s decision while her decision remains unchanged.

Likewise, a group of players are in Nash equilibrium if each one is making the best decision possible, taking into account the decisions of the others in the game as long as the other parties’ decisions remain unchanged. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Nash_equilibrium) As was mentioned previously the technological edge rests with the covert science compared to open-source open-domain technologists. One such area of interest is that of Quantum Computation. It is interesting that many years before that Defense-related computer scientists were already exploring QCs to implement automated decision making: A quantum device simulating the human decision-making process is introduced. It consists of quantum recurrent nets generating stochastic processes which represent the motor dynamics, and of classical neural nets describing the evolution of probabilities of these processes which represent the mental dynamics. The autonomy of the decision-making process is achieved by a feedback from the mental to motor dynamics which changes the stochastic matrix based upon the probability distribution. This feedback replaces unavailable external information by an internal knowledge base stored in the mental model in the form of probability distributions. As a result, the coupled motor mental dynamics is described by an online version of Markov chains which can decrease entropy without an external source of information. Applications to common sense-based decisions as well as to evolutionary games are discussed. An example exhibiting self-organization is computed using quantum computer simulation. Force on force and mutual aircraft engagements using the quantum decision maker dynamics are considered. (Zakab 2000) It is well known to computer scientists that Quantum computation gives one an incredible step up in terms of computational power, it would be hard for a classically based computer to implement an advanced algorithm for such decision making in a complex environment such as the fog of war (incomplete information, dynamic, etc) but not for a Quantum Computer. Another area that has influenced Intelligent Systems and automation is that of Genetic Algorithms or Genetic Programing, which is based on Natural Genetic Selection, where a computer compiles its own components and finds the best fit among various modules to formulate an optimal choice. This area was strongly influenced through Peircean Logic in the founder of Genetic Algorithms, John Holland of the University of Michigan. It was also advocated by Senglaub in engineering Automatic systems. Senglaub writes: Genetic programming or evolutionary programing technologies could also provide insight into design configurations that could result in fault configurations under sets of environmental drivers. recognizing the basic elements of the design configurations and introducing specialized “abnormal environment” operators, genetic programs (GP) could be tasked with finding all possible fault configurations that result in unacceptable states for a sub-system. A great deal of work has been performed in which GP’s have been tasked with designing circuits, structures, and algorithms.

A great deal of work has been performed in which GP’s have been tasked with designing circuits, structures, and algorithms. (Senglaub 1997) Thus in turn the possible decisions that agents can make must be considered relative to those possible actions. The result of all of this is that SAs can be cast in terms of a generalized control architecture, as in the work of Powers [1973, 1989], where the autonomy of the system is allowed by its manifestation of a closed causal relation with its environment. Through this relation the agent makes decisions so as to make its measurements (representations of current and past decisions and states) as “close” as possible to its goals in order to reduce a generalized “error function” given by its own beliefs of what desirable states are. Thus, as illustrated in Fig. 2, SAs manifest a generalized negative feedback control relation. ( Joslyn 2000) (Miller 1996) Lockheed-Martin is not alone in seeking to use Semiotic Cybernetics in their defense systems. Saab Microwave Systems, for example, also is relying on Automated Intelligent Systems, possibly also influenced by Peircean Logic as tech is often copied by one company to another, to manage their defense infrastructure. It is interesting and directly related to Neuroweapons as their systems oversee Radar and Microwave infrastructures which are both directly related to the technologies of Neuro-warfare. In a presentation on-line by Saab Scientist, Hakan Warston, they show the progression in their thinking and what they view as a necessity of relying in the future on automated computer decision-making systems. (Warston, 2007) As one can plainly see from the slides at the time of their writing it relies a great deal less on automated with manual assistance and very small footprints of fully automated. However, from 2015-2020 they foresee a large footprint for fully automated computer decision-making in their systems. I would imagine that Saab Microwave Systems is not alone in this trend. Of course, such concepts as Reflexive Control, Thought Injection and other methods of this weapons technology would be incomplete without a grounding in Brain/Computer Interfaces.

Human performance enhancement may require modifications to the biochemical aspects of the human. Maintained alertness, enhanced physical and psychological performance, and enhanced survivability rates in serious operations all require modifications to the biochemical aspect of the human. DARPA is in the process of developing drugs to enhance performance when a person has been sleep-deprived. Consider the use of externally applied, non-dangerous electromagnetic fields to increase the rate of production of body biochemicals that enhance human performance. DARPA has a proposal to increase the rate of stress protein production before a soldier goes into combat. The intent is to increase the survivability rate when the soldier is wounded and needs to receive blood products. Beyond that, one can envision increasing the rate of production of ATP [triglycerides in fat cells as power booster?], which will yield higher energy levels by natural means, will help ion pumping to aid in nerve recovery and contraction of muscles, and will speed recovery from combat stress. What other changes can be engineered by a specifically shaped electromagnetic pulse that might enhance human performance without pharmaceuticals? This investigation may spawn a new industry in which the human is enhanced by externally applied electromagnetic pulses so shaped as to enhance specific biochemical changes within the body without drugs or in combination with drugs, with fewer side effects. For instance, nanoparticles might be formulated to release drug dosages…(Asher, 2003, p. 355) It is not hard to see, through Asher’s work, that when using electromagnetic pulses to increase combat readiness one would have to monitor each soldier in combat to increase their biochemistry. It of course would be impossible to do this manually, which would mean that it would take an Intelligent System controller to oversee the mass number of troops in combat to increase their biochemistry, and if this is connected to an Automated system then it is not hard to see how this could also be done on a mass scale covertly. For Norseen’s project they would be able to use electromagnetic stimulation to ‘lobotomize’ a terrorist with dual usage always in view. Asher continues on the different applications of electromagnetic stimulation: Nano. Develop and understand the nano aspects of the use of electromagnetic field interactions with cellular structures.

Investigate whether electromagnetics can be used as a power source to conduct mechanical actions at the sites. This is an alarming development from 2003. If they have in fact developed nanotechnology to enhance or control human performance then ordinary biological humans could be very realistically turned into cyborgs without any visible mechanics. And it is very clearly that this is in line with the Norseen Semiotic vision of Information Injection. In this report of Asher in the section under Brain-Machine-Interfaces he sees the applications of this technology to mass control of automobile drivers or air traffic controllers. Again we see the convergence with Radar in this technology. In many civilian complaints of neuroweapons abuse there are statements related to being stalked by vehicles on the road, Asher writes: The DARPA program could be extended to include a broader range of potential impact by including the possibility of other applications: learning and training, automobile control, air traffic control, decision-making, remote sensing of stress, and entertainment. Learning and training might be implemented as information coded into brain signals and then input into the person. Air traffic control in increasingly busy skies can use such capability: the controller has multiple inputs from multiple aircraft. These can be input into his brain in a 3 -D aspect and an alertness signal used to “wake him up” when his attention drifts beyond acceptable limits. Not only intellectual data might be passed from one person to another without speaking, but also emotional and volitional information. Decision-making may become more precise as emotional, fatigue, and other cognitive states can be appraised prior to making a critical decision. The potential impact on automobile safety is great. The driver can have quicker control of his automobile (Figure E.1 5), allowing for safer driving while reducing the car- to-car spacing on congested highways. This would help alleviate highway congestion and the need for more highways. Furthermore, it would allow for safer driving, as driver attention can be measured and the driver “alerted,” or told in some manner to pay attention to his or her driving when attention wanders beyond safe margins. It can allow for detection of driver impairment so that the vehicle may be made either not to start or to call emergency.

One field where Ithis has entered into the convergence between technological and social spaces is that of International Relations. The use of Intelligent Systems to not just model but control and interact with international relations is related: The second procedure, called long range, strategic control reflects a longer term planning of policy changes that are implemented consistently throughout the whole evolution. The long term strategic control is achieved by an optimal control algorithm that we briefly discuss in Section 4. In the optimal control framework the perturbations (controls) are evaluated in order to minimize or maximize some objective functional that depends on the state and the controls. The actual form of this functional essentially depends on the goal we want to achieve and explicitly includes the reward and cost of that goal. The main advantage of such planning is that the changes one has to implement are known over the whole time span of the system’s evolution and provide an optimal solution (an optimal cost effectiveness is realized for attaining the desired goal). The basic disadvantage of this method is that modeling errors, inherent perturbations, and unforeseen factors will usually lead to a trajectory different from the planned one. This approach is based on the optimal control method applied to discrete systems. The optimal control method can be simply summarized as follows. The system is described by a scalar or vector state function depending on a number of independent variables that take values in the phase space of the system. The state satisfies a (usually nonlinear) dynamical scalar or vector equation that depends also on some parameters that take values in the parameter space. One or more of these parameters are considered external controls to be adjusted at will. The goal is to optimize a given objective func-tional that depends on the state and on the control(s). From the state equation and objective functional one constructs, in a canonical way, a non-homogeneous adjoint equation for a (scalar or vector) adjoint variable. The original state equation together with the adjoint equation form the optimality system (OS). The optimality condition yields an explicit, analytical formula for the optimal control in terms of the solutions of the OS. By replacing this expression of the control in the OS and solving it, one obtains the optimal state and adjoint variable and therefore the optimal control. The general framework for optimal control for general nonlinear systems as developed by J.-L. Lions was recently applied to competitive systems of social and military interest The long range control is", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:120:0778afb20af4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2473, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 121, "text": "optimality system (OS).

Lions was recently applied to competitive systems of social and military interest The long range control is better suited when one has a good idea about global strategic objectives, the costs involved and, one wants to achieve a well-defined goal. Since the role of the user is essential in deciding what control strategy to use we see here an excellent example of applied semiotic analysis to international relations. (Pentek 1997) Dr. James Giordano, a DOD specialist in neuroweapons and lecturer at George Washington University, like Norseen and Umpleby, has written regarding what are known as nootropics, bio-chemical agents affecting cognitive function. Norseen also talks about the use of nootropics with Laurie. He also in this dialogue explicitly implicates ‘the Brits’ as being the main party responsible behind starting research into this area. Perhaps, the most interesting take from what Norseen discusses with Laurie is what would normally be considered a Conspiracy Theory in relation to the mass shooters at Columbine in Colorado. He suggests that they were influenced by a remote thought injection system in another part of his discussion through websites, which may have used the 25th frame technique [see Neuroweapons discussion] or other methods of subliminal control and influence. In an a long passage from their conversations Norseen goes into a conversation hitting on the use of thought injection as a Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD), one that he later goes on to view as a means of being implemented for that purpose, which of course should sound like a paranoid conspiracist if it were for the fact that he is a weapons designer working on these very systems for Lockheed-Martin and the National Security apparatus of the United States. And now you get me going into the kinds of Little White Pills that are being made in Porten Downs [UK Biochemical Production facility] and in the Russian labs and other places I am familiar with…and you are coming up with MK-809 in Germany and a special little breed I am working on that heads directly for each of the 5 main pain receptor sites in the Central Nervous System…alpha, epsilon, delta, kappa, and mu. You can easily think of the brain as simply a NITROGEN MOLECULE RESONATOR, and this is the currency by which the ZPE comes pumping in to humans.

(Noseen, Laurie Part 11) Norseen here directly talks about the influencing of minds through nootropics, stating that Nitrogen (N) is the key to unlocking Wiring in the brain and leading to changes in function which is to say human behavior. Again we see his notion of unlocking the functions in the brain, QSK. He uses the example of the Columbine shooters here to illustrate his point, which may sound like irrational rambling. It is interesting to note that in the Snowden Leaks it was discovered that GCHQ and the NSA infiltrated video game communities to do behavioral studies. So it may not be as far fetched as we may think, especially with the knowledge of illicitly and illegal biological tests done on unknowing civilians in the history of National Defence research in the United States. OK, OK…where did this all come from…The Brits and their work with the opium trade wars…and also the fear of drug-induced attacks on the Royal Marines that the big bore and higher caliber ammunition couldn’t stop…what is the cause?…the Brits still classify all the work in THIQ…now it happens that THIQ is even more powerful than MK-809 and along the lines of my Designer register. When a drunk becomes a Stage 4 alcoholic, the body and the brain actually convert body chemicals into THIQ…tetrahydroquinine, etc. and the THIQ can actually be found as little white crystals and powderize crystals in the brains of dead alcoholics. The BRITS began over 100 years ago to administer this to see the effects and they found it was 1000x more powerful than morphine (it is even more powerful than fentnyl, the gas used by the Russian ‘vimple’ antiterror squad to squash the Chechnyan take over of NordEst in Moscow…(the Brits gave the fentyl to the Russkies) and it knocked everybody out in less than 10 seconds…well, THIQ is 100x or more powerful than that…it is what the alcoholic produces to keep him, or rather, his Brain, alive THIQ was thought at one time to be the cause of Alcoholism, however, this was later disproved, it is rather a product of Alcoholism according to Norseen.

This is an interesting connection, in fact we have already seen how Alcohol was related as a trance agent in an earlier passage in the Norseen and Laurie in regards to Norseen’s encounter with Russian scientists. It is a question if he had a scientific purpose in discussing THIQ or to what ends other then as an example of a substance that can alter human behavior. He continues with the discusson of THIQ: And back to THIQ…for a while the British medical corps was using the THIQ for battlefield ops and the patients were getting up and going back into battle with no arms and legs and such and they realized…this stuff is beyond TOP SECRET. What if the enemy gets this…our .45 to the head won’t stop them from coming over the walls…so the Brits SEALED IT DEEP AWAY and got the US to “fogitdabowdit.” Until certain agency souls started to play with it again and it slipped out…hence the race to Oxycontin… pure female birthing neurotransmitter Oxytocin…I like the spelling changes myself…to MK-809, to new Fentnyl, to my new Designer Formula… (Norseen, Laurie, Part 11) Here Norseen discusses an interesting opiate Oxycontin, which has become an epidemic in places like the United States in terms of addiction. Other countries developing Neuroweapons, such as Nazi Germany, also had major opiate addictions, for instance IG-Farben created methamphetamines [see Neuroweapons section]. It is also of interest that he relates this to the ‘female birthing neurotransmitter Oxytocin.’ Oxytocin is a peptide hormone and neuropeptide. It is most important in birthing and nurturing young (social bonding) of mothers to children, it is produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary glands. It is interesting to note that civilians claiming to be affected by Neuroweapons, often termed ‘Targeted Individuals’ are comprised of 70% female. What role specifically Oxytocin and Oxycontin plays in this is not known to this author, but clearly Norseen as a weapons designer brings it up in the context of brain alteration. He continues: Duncan…This page shows the chemical “resonating” structure of quinolines…the basic block that links into the neuronal synapses, the neuropil, of the brain and when locked in, the ZPE comes pouring in…and you are the signal…pain goes away and is replaced by the Semiotic.

As we approach 500 million people in 2025 [in US population] and the nasties start flying, we are going to lash out at the world and “waste $\\scriptstyle 1 / _ { 2 }$ of it” — if you look very carefully at the Semiotics that are being impressed on our culture you can see “Total War” as the dominant theme. F the UN, “just waste em” will be the mindset. (Norseen, Laurie, 2002, part 15) And yes, there are technologies already set up in advance, pre-positioned for the future border semiotic wars — rapid fire Stego Bullets, brain specific prions, multi-channel semiotic PSYOP — I can believe when people say they have signed documents concerning non-disclosure for ⁷⁰⁺ years…I inked such forms myself. (Norseen, Laurie, 2002, part 15) Mind you this was written in 2002, and approaching 20 years later we see this reality unfolding as climate change has put pressures on growing populations around the globe, leading to migrations, which has led to a rise in Nationalism, and Border Walls, or as Norseen put it ‘future border semiotic wars.’ One can only imagine how fantastical this conversation must seem to an uninformed audience over the years, however, to those living some time after this conversation as public disclosure regarding neuroweapons and with the changing climate, it is more and more realistic.

The great advances in computer science that have occurred since the 1940s were greatly enhanced by the war effort in the Allied countries, specifically the Anglo allies: US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain. The race for computational superiority, which I would argue actually went to the Germans, could have been the deciding factor in the war if the German military had continued access to raw materials such as Oil to run their industries and machines. The early pioneers in this field were in the Allies: Alan Turing, and in Germany Konrad Zuse. Some of the first examples of computer controllers are found in the German military industrial production plants. Some of the first examples of “Machine Intelligence” were a direct outcome of the work of Alan Turing for the predecessor of GCHQ. However, before going into Turing and Zuse it is important to look at some of the more basic and the predecessors to more advanced operations of computation in the form of management of the Holocaust by the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:125:ff8c9b633cce", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2478, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 126, "text": "Germany Konrad Zuse.

However, before going into Turing and Zuse it is important to look at some of the more basic and the predecessors to more advanced operations of computation in the form of management of the Holocaust by the Germans, using IBM tabulating machines. Everyone is familiar with the numbers tattooed on inmates of Nazi Labor and Death camps. Those numbers were an index for the tabulation machines created by IBM for the German Government in 1937. International Business Machines (IBM), an American company founded by German Herman Hollerith and managed by American supporter of fascism, Thomas J. Watson, now popularly the name of the IBM Artificial Intelligence platform ‘IBM-Watson.’ IBM is also involved in the development of Quantum Computing. IBM manages the information used in the extermination camps and mass categorization of Germany through a subsidiary in Germany: Dehomag and other IBM subsidiaries custom-designed the applications. Its technicians sent mock-ups of punch cards back and forth to Reich offices until the data columns were acceptable, much as any software designer would today. Punch cards could only be designed, printed, and purchased from one source: IBM. The machines were not sold, they were leased, and regularly maintained and upgraded by only one source: IBM. IBM subsidiaries trained the Nazi officers and their surrogates throughout Europe, set up branch offices and local dealerships throughout Nazi Europe staffed by a revolving door of IBM employees, and scoured paper mills to produce as many as 1.5 billion punch cards a year in Germany alone. Moreover, the fragile machines were serviced on site about once per month, even when that site was in or near a concentration camp. IBM Germany’s headquarters in Berlin maintained duplicates of many code books, much as any IBM service bureau today would maintain data backups for computers. …IBM Germany’s census operations and similar advanced people-counting and registration technologies. IBM was founded in 1898 by German inventor Herman Hollerith as a census tabulating company. Census was its business. But when IBM Germany formed its philosophical and technologic alliance with Nazi Germany, census and registration took on a new mission. IBM Germany invented the racial census listing, not just religious affiliation, but bloodline going back generations. This was the Nazi data lust. Not just to count the Jews — but to identify them. (Black 2009) As was seen in the section on the Science of Neuroweapons regarding Eugenics and tracing tribes and clans along genetic bloodlines, we see how the IBM tabulators were used to keep track, index and exploit these data points for the mass extermination of Jews, Poles, Gypsies, Homosexuals, and Leftists, among others.

The diabolical methods created by such a Totalitarian regime are truly mind bending. The more scientific and military applications of the German Computer Scientists followed a more technical rather than sociological route in comparison to this utilization of IBM to manage the Holocaust. Konrad Zuse is not known to be a devoted Nazi, rather he was known as a dedicated computer engineer who happened to be German and was later conscripted into service. However, it is known that one of his collaborators was a dedicated Nazi, Helmut Schreyer, who later went on to leave Germany like many former Nazis and resettled in Brazil, where he set up a computing institute. Zuse began his development of his famous Z-series computers in the spare rooms of his parent’s apartment. In 1938 he attempted to create his first computer, which never actually worked due to fabrication problems with the mechanical systems of his machine. The construction of the Z-series computers was oriented exclusively towards the mathematics of statistics and Zuse’s encryption engine was never built, it was the S1, a special computer which was used in the Henschel factory between 1942 and 1944 to calculate wing measurements for remote control flying bombs, a predecessor to modern drones. Previously, in 1940, Zuse was able to complete his first working computer, the Z-2. In 1941 he built the first programmable computer, the Z-3. After the war he also developed the first algorithmic programming language, Plankukul (Calculus Plan) in 1945-6. Meanwhile, in Britain, the more famous Alan Turing started working on his computational ideas, some of which were done in collaboration with Von Neumann, a Germanic Hungarian that taught at Princeton, who was respected as one of the greatest mathematicians of his time. Turing became most famous for his breaking of the German Military encryption Enigma machine. Although, this work was actually pioneered by a Polish Intelligence decryption engineer at the Biuro Szyfrów (Cipher Bureau), Marian Rejewski, who created the first version of the ‘cryptologic bomb’ (bomba kruptologiczna) before the Nazis destroyed the Polish military and work had to be stopped in Poland. The computer as it became known was the ‘Bombe.’ The Bombe was an electro-mechanical device used by British cryptologists to help decipher German Enigma-machine-encrypted secret messages during World War II. The US Navy and US Army later produced their own machines to the same functional specification, albeit engineered differently both from each other and from the British", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:127:7230d0af6660", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2480, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 128, "text": "first version of the ‘cryptologic bomb’ (bomba kruptologiczna) before the Nazis destroyed the Polish military and work had to be stopped in Poland.

The US Navy and US Army later produced their own machines to the same functional specification, albeit engineered differently both from each other and from the British Bombe itself. The initial design of the Bombe was produced in 1939 at the UK Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), now known as GCHQ_(↓) at Bletchley Park by Alan Turing, with an important refinement devised in 1940 by Gordon Welchman. The engineering design and construction was the work of Harold Keen of the British Tabulating Machine Company. It was a substantial development from the first bombe, code-named Victory, installed in March 1940 while the second version, Agnus Dei or Agnes, incorporating Welchman’s new design, was working by August 1940. the complex Lorenz ciphers used by the Nazis during World War II. A total of ten Colossi were delivered, each using as many as 2,500 vacuum tubes. A series of pulleys transported continuous rolls of punched paper tape containing possible solutions to a particular code. Colossus reduced the time to break Lorenz messages from weeks to hours. Most historians believe that the use of Colossus machines significantly shortened the war by providing evidence of enemy intentions and beliefs. The machine’s existence was not made public until the 1970s. Another important German computer engineer who came to attention shortly after the war, was Heinz Billing. Billing was heavily involved in the development of magnetic drum memory. This eventually converged in a meeting between British computer engineers and German computer engineers shortly after the war: “…the question of an unknown potential meeting between the computer pioneers Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse. It is said to have taken place at Gottingen in 1947. Most historians of computing have no knowledge of Zuse’s interrogation by Turing. So far, only one source is available which mentions this event, Heinz Billing’s memoirs.” [other participants include on the German side: Zuse, Helmut Schreyer who eventually went to Brazil, and Alwin Walther. On the English side, interrogators Arthur Porter, Alan Turing, and John Womersley]; after which electronic magnetic drum computing entered English computation designs. It is interesting that Britain was able to take the work of Billing after the war and create advances to computational abilities. Heinz Billing researched and worked at the Institute for Instrumentation in the Max Planck Society, which was located on the grounds of the AVA in Göttingen and where he developed in 1948 a magnetic drum memory and program-controlled computing machines. Billing mainly used amplifier tubes for this purpose.

Billing mainly used amplifier tubes for this purpose. During this time, he learned about the novel electronic computing machine ENIAC in the USA and its performance. In 1947, an exchange with senior English scientists and computer scientists from the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) took place in Teddington, where John Roland Womersley (1907-1958), Arthur Porter and Alan Turing were involved. In the form of a colloquium, the British experts interviewed German scientists such as Heinz Billing, Konrad Zuse, Alwin Walther and Helmut Schreyer. Billing was confronted for the first time with the idea of binary numbers and data storage. In contrast to the English, who worked with acoustic storage, Billing from 1948 worked on music recordings and glued on a rotating drum tapes for magnetophones to save numbers. Later, Billing was interested in Physics and was part of the research which was cited to disprove the discovery of Gravitational Waves by American Physicist, Weber. [See Ch. 6 Physics of Neuroweapons]. Also, later in life, in 1967, Zuse became interested in Physics and created what was known as Digital Physics. Zuse suggested that the universe itself is running on a cellular automaton or similar computational structure (digital physics); in 1969, he published the book Rechnender Raum (translated into English as Calculating Space). This idea has attracted a lot of attention, since there is no physical evidence against Zuse’s thesis. One of the tragic stories of the development of computer technology involves that of Alan Turing after the war. After the war, Turing made great strides in developing proto-Artificial Intelligence ideals. In 1950, he created the Turing test which was a theoretical test to see if a human could tell if they were interacting with a computer or a person. If the computer could fool the human it had passed the test, posing as human. He also was involved in researching new computational hardware to support his ideas in Artificial Intelligence. However, Turing was a homosexual, which at the time was a criminal offense in Great Britain. Whether he was set up to cover up a burglary at his residence and where he conducted his research is an open question in conspiracy theories. Nonetheless, it was charged that his lover burgled his house leading to discovery of his homosexuality. Turing’s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for GCHQ. He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952; but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:129:55615580933f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2482, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 130, "text": "a burglary at his residence and where he conducted his research is an open question in conspiracy theories.

He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952; but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but, in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park, he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work. On 8 June 1954, Turing’s housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post-mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. As can be seen by this brief history of the development of computing out of the need to break encryption during World War II, we see the convergence of computation and Intelligence work. Jumping forward, we will see how the British Secret Intelligence Services used computers in the war with the Irish Republican Army. Building on the earlier work of such great Intelligence computer engineers as Turing in Britain, the United King-dom started turning to computers for active surveillance and tracking of Irish Republican Volunteers during the ‘Troubles’ in Northern Ireland which ended some 20 years ago as Neuroweapon computerized Thought Injection was becoming a viable platform for conducting irregular warfare. Ironically Lockheed-Martin engineers used the IRA as an example in their early 2000s research on Game Theoretic Reflexive Control. It is interesting that in 1966, which was also the year that saw the creation of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in Northern Ireland, which openly attacked Native Irish Catholics starting the ‘Troubles’, Great Britain developed its first Intelligence Satellite. Later, in 1969, a series of satellites were launched, ironically named ‘Skynet’, which is also an electronic surveillance system used by the NSA. Though this is ironic in a chapter on Artificial Intelligence and Automated Systems, it does reveal a frame of mind in the British Intelligence Community, of desiring information. The question then becomes how to manage such information. In Northern Ireland during the Troubles, MI-5 developed some of its first surveillance systems based in visual data: cctv; and managing that data using Statistical Learning algorithms and computer networks. It is easy to see why they would want to use computers for surveillance and tracking with this brief account of what is involved in surveillance and the mass numbers of human agents involved: The branch of MI5 in charge of static and mobile surveillance is A4, part of A branch", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:130:19f74634e98f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2483, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 131, "text": "Northern Ireland during the Troubles, MI-5 developed some of its first surveillance systems based in visual data: cctv; and managing that data using Statistical Learning algorithms and computer networks. It is easy to see why they would want to use computers for surveillance and tracking with this brief account of what is involved in surveillance and the mass numbers of human agents involved: The branch of MI5 in charge of static and mobile surveillance is A4, part of A branch (Operations & Intelligence) in a fast-growing empire that has at least fourteen main departments and many sub-units. The field officers of A4 are dedicated expert people who are often treated as a lesser breed by the desk analysts and policy makers. Foot surveillance is taught to students of MI5 and military Intelligence officers using a drill known as the A-B-C system. At least three people are used to follow the target: A (for adjacent, also known as the ‘Eyeball’) is nearest; B (Back-up) is further back, preferably concealed from the quarry. Both usually stick to the same side of the road. C (Control) has a wide field of vision on the opposite side of the road, guiding the other two with concealed throat microphone and/or discreet hand signals. A guide for novice trackers suggests: “Behave naturally; have a purpose for being there; be prepared with a cover story (ensure that it fits the situation); remember you are most vulnerable when coming from cover.” The guidance deals with distance from the target, anticipation, body language, local knowledge, concentration and teamwork. Means by which the target is kept off-guard include ‘boxing’ and ‘paralleling.’ “The subject is allowed to proceed on a route where there are a minimal number of surveillance officers. The idea is to let the subject ‘run’ from point to point to be checked at various places [like polling in a video game] by surveillance officers on parallel routes or ahead.” Even if new faces are introduced into the surveillance team, close control deteriorates in this form of play. However, “the most important factor about surveillance is the need to be honest about exposure. It is better to have a controlled loss rather than to hang on to the subject too long.” In the early 1970s, to track movements of vehicles in Northern Ireland, the British military used a system of logs which recorded the drivers and vehicle tags. As technology developed in CCTV, the system became more and more computerized. Initially, the logs were replaced with computer terminals and a database. Then in the mid-1990s, the computer system started switching to Machine Intelligence to analyze data. They developed a system of hidden cameras deployed covertly, called Glutton. Second only to the informer is the computer or, rather, the array of computers which act as the collating brains of this new style of warfare.

Second only to the informer is the computer or, rather, the array of computers which act as the collating brains of this new style of warfare. In Northern Ireland, for example, the army uses two systems: ‘Vengeful’, dedicated to vehicles, and ‘Crucible’, for people. Crucible, one source explained, “will hold a personal file containing a map/picture showing this is where a suspect lives; as well as details of family and past.” Vengeful is linked to the Later, a new AI system was introduced called Caister, which was a knowledge-based system to analyze IRA movements and personnel. This system replaced an earlier system, known as Crucible. Later, Caister was replaced by a system known as Calshot, which included AI analysis of data, bypassing human interaction, an automated autonomous system, which replaced an earlier attempt at using AI for automated analysis called Effigy, which was replaced in 1998 with a system known as ‘Mannequin.’ Another new Intelligence computer was ‘Caister’, a knowledge-based system (KBS) to replace the earlier Crucible [mid-90s] in sifting personal information about terrorists and their associates. Caister or its later variant ‘Calshot’, it was hoped, would be part of a process of analysis where the computer, rather than human mind, identified significant links between one suspect and another. The generic name given to this technique is Artificial Intelligence. Laden with personal files Caister, according to one document, would ‘provide dual central processing suites at Theipval (military HQ) and Knock (RUC HQ) interconnected by mega-stream support up to 350 terminals over secure communications bearers. Data up to ‘Secret.’ Average response time of ten seconds for a single enquiry with 192 concurrent references.’ Artificial Intelligence was trialed and failed at an earlier stage under the code-name ‘Effigy’, but by 1997, under the code-name ‘Mannequin’, plans were virtually complete to have a second shot at this project, regarded as vital to a successful counter-terrorist campaign in the future. The key was integration, and an electronic spring-clean of the Military Intelligence cupboard in which, in 1994, there were no fewer than thirty-seven separate computer programs, virtually none of which was compatible with any other. (Geraghty 1998, 160) By 1996, the new culture of directed Intelligence had proliferated like some exotic plant inside a greenhouse in Bedfordshire, new home of the Defense Intelligence and Security School. The system could run effective surveillance on an entire population and, through the use of psychological warfare (reserved, so far, for use in Bosnia), shape popular perceptions of events to suit a military strategy. It gave enormous power to those in charge of the system in Northern Ireland… (Geraghty 1998,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:132:088a3b2726c5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2485, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 133, "text": "1998, 160) By 1996, the new culture of directed Intelligence had proliferated like some exotic plant inside a greenhouse in Bedfordshire, new home of the Defense Intelligence and Security School.

It gave enormous power to those in charge of the system in Northern Ireland… (Geraghty 1998, 131-2) It is interesting to note that at that time, the mid-90s, psychological warfare could be run through their computer systems and its AI. Although the claim of psyops being limited to Bosnia and not employed in Northern Ireland is contradicted by historical accounts of such psychological warfare in Northern Ireland (Cadwallader 2013, 328, 348). Additionally, there is a cavalier attitude about such powers held by those in authority. As exhibited by Michael Mates, Northern Ireland Secretary 1991-2: Indeed, it is noted by the author Richard Aldrich that the European Convention on Human Rights was viewed by the British secret state as a threat to its viability (Aldrich 2010, 485); that adhering to international treaties and laws, not to mention domestic laws would be a ‘threat.’ To what extent this attitude remains in the human administrators of the security establishment in Great Britain, it is an interesting question as to whether the AI analysis also considers such laws a ‘threat’ and what it’s automated responses to such a threat might be. Clearly, when it comes to security agencies the law is not implemented against their own Intelligence. Professor Bill Rolston in his paper “An Effective Mask for Terror: Democracy, Death Squads and Northern Ireland”: “Although the law was sometimes used against state forces, it was used leniently, even when they acted independently outside of their special units.” (Rolston 2005, 21). It is recorded that the Military Intelligence during the Troubles viewed those in civil authority with contempt as they referred to oversight as being ‘betrayed and maligned’ by ‘flabby-faced men with pop-eyes and fancy accents.’ (Cadwallader 2013, 322). Going even further than contempt for legal oversight is the outright applying of fuel to the fire to achieve objectives: If loyalist paramilitaries could not shoot the fish, they would poison the water. Eventually, they reasoned, this would ineluctably drive the nationalist community to pressurize the IRA to stop its campaign. A spokesman explained the UVF strategy at that time: “We believed, rightly or wrongly, that the only effective way to beat the terror machine was to employ greater terrorism against its operative [s] … By bombing the heart of Provisional enclaves we attempted to terrorize the nationalist community into demanding that the Provisionals either cease their campaign or move out … we hoped to crack their morale and destroy their chain of command.” (Cadwallader 2013, 323) A third military strategist with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:133:6da5da29c125", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2486, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 134, "text": "spokesman explained the UVF strategy at that time: “We believed, rightly or wrongly, that the only effective way to beat the terror machine was to employ greater terrorism against its operative [s] … By bombing the heart of Provisional enclaves we attempted to terrorize the nationalist community into demanding that the Provisionals either cease their campaign or move out … we hoped to crack their morale and destroy their chain of command.” (Cadwallader 2013, 323) A third military strategist with experience in Ireland was Robin Evelegh, who served in Cyprus during the late 1960s. After service in Northern Ireland, he wrote Peace-Keeping in a Democratic Society: The Lessons of Northern Ireland, which influenced later security operations. In his book, Evelegh bemoaned “shortcomings in the laws governing the operation of the Security Forces [in Northern Ireland] to suppress terrorism and disorder” which –if only they could be corrected –could “succeed in ending these horrors.” Echoing Kitson [directed psyops], he thought such limitations necessitated civil, policing and military powers being united to “weld all the efforts of the Government into a machine directed at one end, the defeat of the insurrection” – a call, in effect, for martial law. Evelegh supported Kitson’s lead on turning paramilitaries into allies who ‘have to be consciously created’ and then indemnified with immunity “for the crimes he will have to commit.” On agents provocateurs infiltrating enemy ranks, Evelegh says openly that the agent should “clearly play his part in terrorist activity which will almost inevitably involve him in committing further crimes.” He quotes Lord Widgeryad in a 1974 High Court appeal as also acknowledging this fact. (Cadwallader 2013, 352) To what extent surveillance systems and their management through Artificial Intelligence could go toward enforcing martial law, or of enabling Military Intelligence to run around oversight is an open question. Clearly, there is a very big opening for abuse of such systems. It is worrisome that the NSA does not consider passive automated systems of surveillance as real ‘surveillance’; would this mean that an automated system of thought injection is also not ‘neuroweapons’ or ‘mind control’? As journalist Jakob Applebaum explains: According to Appelbaum, the NSA is running a two-stage data dragnet operation. The first stage is TURMOIL, which collects data traffic passively via satellite and cable taps and stores it – in some cases for up to 15 years – for future reference. The NSA does not consider this surveillance because no human operator is involved, just automatic systems.” [1] Tracking and Surveillance are not the only areas in military operations that are automated and utilizing Artificial Intelligence. Information Operations is also an area that is utilizing automated and machine intelligence to achieve the aims of secret Intelligence organizations. Many are now familiar with the Cambridge Analytica data breach and exploitation story. Influence operations, a sub-specialty of Information Operations are becoming more and more automated.

Information Operations is also an area that is utilizing automated and machine intelligence to achieve the aims of secret Intelligence organizations. Many are now familiar with the Cambridge Analytica data breach and exploitation story. Influence operations, a sub-specialty of Information Operations are becoming more and more automated. Cambridge Analytica, a British defense contractor, with many connections to far-right American business interests, such as billionaire Robert Mercer, who made his fortune in Image Recognition in Artificial Intelligence Systems, was owned by SCL Group. SCL Group conducted Information and Influence Operations research for the British Ministry of Defense. As explained by this news article: It is easy to see how such a company could be used to further a Secret Intelligence Agency’s goals and plans; goals and plans which need not be the same as the democratically elected government. Another troubling aspect of Cambridge Analytica was its complicity in influence operations during the UK’s plans to exit the European Union, which as noted before Secret Intelligence viewed EU laws on human rights, such as the equality of the Irish with the British in Northern Ireland, as a ‘threat.’ Indeed, another company connected to Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group, Harris Media, conducts influence operations for far-right political organizations such as the AFd in Germany, and has a common cause with other far-right political causes. The Defense Science and Technology Laboratory has as its component areas of expertise such areas as counter-terrorism, under which category in America research into ‘Thought Injection’ was conducted as a counter-terrorism tactic. Another area of DSTL research and promotion of automation and machine autonomy is Influence Operations, and Cognitive Science. Recently it has offered financial support to researchers using machines in this endeavor.[2] It is not just the 5 Eyes nations, such as the UK and USA, that have automated influence operations, virtually any well-organized intelligence department of any nation could easily deploy such a system, and not just the bogeymen of Russia and China. So, with such a plethora of potential operatives in Influence Operations one would think the United States would have developed counter measures to such operations, as Maj. Christopher Telley reminds us: …the transformation of one industry in particular has grave implications for U.S. national security: influence. AI-guided information operations (IO) utilize tools that can shape a target audience’s perceptions through the rapid and effective mimicry of human empathy with that audience.

Though the threat of automated influence exists quite literally on the smartphone in front of you, the Pentagon’s current efforts to integrate AI do not appear to include any reasonably resourced IO response. (Telley, 2018) It is noteworthy that the Defense Department tried to create a counter-measures department for Influence Operations, but it was closed down in 2002 by Donald Rumsfeld, SECDEF under George W. Bush, citing public outcry, which itself may have been an influence operation. [3] Although, in late developments it has been revealed that in 2022 the DoD has set up a department, Influence and Perception Management Office (IPMO), to counter other countries disinformation regarding perception management. (Klippenstein, 2023) Maj. Telley calls the automated machine intelligence implementation of Influence Operations, the Influence Machine, he elaborates on the problem with such Influence Machines: The crux of the Influence Machine’s value is the inherent vulnerability of Western democracy, that decision makers are beholden to a malleable selectorate. as senator Mark Warner noted, “We’re increasingly in a world where cyber vulnerability, misinformation and disinformation may be the tools of conflict.” By affecting the cognition—the will—of enough people, this machine can prevent or delay a democratic government’s physical response to aggression; it is a defeat mechanism. The Influence Machine’s objective comes down to changing the value of the target’s strategic goal. Clausewitz knew that the political object, the original motive, in a conflict was the essential factor in any deterrence equation. The smaller the value demanded of an opponent, the less that competitor would be willing to try to deny it. This is the inverse of Fearon’s “tying hands” findings that the increase of the perceived costs for an audience, a national population, tends to prevent a country from backing down when attempting to coerce an opponent. With automated influence, that opponent attempts to lower the expected benefits, on the part of the competitor’s audiences, for the intervention action. The Influence Machine enables defeat before any shots are ever fired by removing “the physical means or the will to fight.” in this condition, a defeated state’s executive is unwilling or unable to respond to a threat action, thereby yielding to the opponent’s will as fake news becomes frighteningly competitive with real news, the emergence of the Influence Machine presents a novel way to “hack” the unchanging human nature of war.

(Telley, 2018, 7) As we have learned Influence Operations are an integral part of any Intelligence Agency’s strategic goals and policies. Another area that has developed directly out of Intelligence work is that of Operations Research, which is most closely identified with the development of Cybernetics, which is a direct outgrowth of Operations Research. According to the Operational Research Society of Great Britain (OPERATIONAL RESEARCH QUARTER-LY, l3(3):282, l962), Operational Research is the attack of modern science on complex problems arising in the direction and management of large systems of men, machines, materials and money in industry, business, government and defense. Its distinctive approach is to develop a scientific model of the system, incorporating measurements of factors such as change and risk, with which to predict and compare the outcomes of alternative decisions, strategies or controls. The purpose is to help management determine its policy and actions scientifically. (Anonymous, year unknown) Operations Research began in Great Britain just before the war [WWII] and was involved in the development of British Radar defenses. The Operational Research department was eventually placed under the command of Lord Dowding, in charge of Air Defenses and credited with saving England in the ‘Battle of Britain’ (he also believed in UFOs). It is easy to see how this is important to a National Intelligence infrastructure. As it is also the task of the IC to monitor its nation’s fiscal and economic output and intakes, every IC has a department related to these affairs. Hence, the creation of a mathematically based scientific discipline for analysis of these most important aspects of national Intelligence. Norbert Weiner coined the term ‘Cybernetics’ as a participant in the Macy Conferences, an early academic colloquy on automation and machine learning held at Dartmouth College in the 1950s. Weiner worked on controllers for Radar systems during World War II for the United States Government. Later, he was interested in how controllers work in not just radar but in general terms. Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary approach for exploring regulatory systems—their structures, constraints, and possibilities. Norbert Wiener defined cybernetics in 1948 as “the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine.” In the 21st century, the term is often used in a rather loose way to imply “control of any system using technology.” In other words, it is the scientific study of how humans, other animals and machines control and communicate with each other. A colleague of Weiner was Stafford Beers, who during World War II worked for British Military Intelligence in the area of Operations Research and was a prominent figure in the development of Cybernetics.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:137:2052a969d2ab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2490, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 138, "text": "animal and the machine.” In the 21st century, the term is often used in a rather loose way to imply “control of any system using technology.” In other words, it is the scientific study of how humans, other animals and machines control and communicate with each other. A colleague of Weiner was Stafford Beers, who during World War II worked for British Military Intelligence in the area of Operations Research and was a prominent figure in the development of Cybernetics. Eden Medina provides a digest of the interactions between Military Intelligence and Cybernetics: British cybernetics, as practiced by Beer, differed from the U.S. approach in significant ways. In his book The Cybernetic Brain, Andrew Pickering distinguishes British cybernetics (as represented by the careers of Beer, Ashby, Grey Walter, Gregory Bateson, R.D. Laing, and Gordon Pask) from the better-known story of cybernetics in the United States, which is often tied to the career of Norbert Wiener and Wiener’s military research at MIT during the Second World War. Pickering notes that British cybernetics was tied primarily to psychiatry, not military engineering, and focused on the brain. (Medina 2005, 36) Psychiatry and military engineering were not separate domains in the postwar era, and work in cybernetics spanned both fields in the U.S. and British contexts. For example, the British cybernetician Gordon Pask received fifteen years of funding for his work on decision making and adaptive training systems from the U.S. Office of Navy Research. Military funding also supported the work of psychologists such as George Miller, who promoted the use of cybernetic ideas and information theory in psychology. (Medina 2005, 36, Note 45) The modeling of cybernetics on the Nervous System of vertebrate animals was done explicitly by Stafford Beers; in the sense of the brain as commander of the body. This is a biological C2 system (command and contro b= bC2 ). USAF Colonel Scherrer delineates the relationship of cybernetics to C2 [for similarity to discussion on Semiotic Cybernetics see ‘Ch. 4’]: The cybernetic-system model is the dominant C2 paradigm for nearly all researchers and systems builders and either explicitly or implicitly informs all C2 models (see Figure 5). A cybernetic system is composed of three fundamental components: sensors that accept input from the environment, processors that accept the input and transform it, and output mechanisms that take the processed information and use it to change the behavior of the system. The cybernetic aspect of military operations is readily apparent given these operations are a process by which a commander (sensor and processor) directs forces (people, processes/ors, and technology organized into a system to produce output) to achieve comparative advantage over an adversary (interaction with the environment) through maneuver and the application of firepower (output and feedback). The science of cybernetics studies internal and external interactions “guided by the principle that numerous different types of systems can be studied according to the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:138:8141c56fee46", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2491, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 139, "text": "cybernetic aspect of military operations is readily apparent given these operations are a process by which a commander (sensor and processor) directs forces (people, processes/ors, and technology organized into a system to produce output) to achieve comparative advantage over an adversary (interaction with the environment) through maneuver and the application of firepower (output and feedback). The science of cybernetics studies internal and external interactions “guided by the principle that numerous different types of systems can be studied according to the principles of feedback, control, and communications.” Also key to understanding the concept of cybernetics is the idea of self-regulation. When a system senses a change in the environment, that information is used to adjust the behavior according to the goal of the system. The system then monitors the environment to ascertain if either the internal or external change has successfully aligned with the system’s goal. (Scherrer, 2009, 34) With this we see how similar and intrinsic the study of cybernetics is to military and intelligence command and control. Stafford Beers, however, took this in a more interdisciplinary direction, eventually creating a cybernetic system that regulated the industries of Chile in 1972-73, with Project Cybersyn. Beers is the creator of what he termed the Viable Systems model, which was first postulated in 1972 in Beer’s book, The Brain of the Firm. Medina offers the following on the Viable System Model of Beers: Beers defines a viable system as “a system that survives. It coheres; it is integral. It is homeo-statically balanced both internally and externally, but has none the less mechanisms and opportunities to grow and to learn, to evolve and to adapt—to become more and more potent in its environment.” …a system that is “capable of independent existence.” (Medina 2005, 50) The spirit of the [Viable System Model] VSM is nicely expressed in the juxtaposition of two figures from Brain of the Firm: one a schematic of the human body; the other of the firm. Very briefly, Beer argued that one needs to distinguish, at minimum, five levels or systems of control in any viable system. In this figure, System One consists of four subsidiaries of a larger organization, labelled A,B,C,D, analogous to arms and legs, the heart, kidneys, etc. System Two, the equivalent of the sympathetic nervous system, connects them to one another and to System Three, and seeks to damp out destructive interactions between the subsidiaries. System Three– the pons and medulla of the VSM– consists of a set of Operation Research (OR) models of production that enables management to react to fluctuations in Systems One and Two–by reallocating resources, for example. System Four – the base of the brain itself – was envisaged as a decision-making environment for higher management, modeled on the World War II operations room. It would collect and display information from the lower systems and from the outside world and, very importantly, it", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:139:ef98d9e2e6c4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2492, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 140, "text": "the pons and medulla of the VSM– consists of a set of Operation Research (OR) models of production that enables management to react to fluctuations in Systems One and Two–by reallocating resources, for example. System Four – the base of the brain itself – was envisaged as a decision-making environment for higher management, modeled on the World War II operations room. It would collect and display information from the lower systems and from the outside world and, very importantly, it would run a set of computer programs that higher management could consult on the possible future effects of major decisions. At the same time, this operations room was intended to function as a clubroom for senior management – a place to hang out, even when major decisions were not at stake. Finally, System Five was the location of the most senior management whom Beer regarded as the cortex of the firm. Their vision of the firm and its future, whatever it was, was to be negotiated into reality in reciprocally vetoing homeostatic interactions with System 4. (Pickering 2006, 16) As noted, cybernetics, and controllers or control are intrinsically linked. Beer defined control in a more open sense; for Beer control is self-regulation, or the ability of a system to adapt to internal and environmental changes and self-sustain. This was an important distinction for Beer. Rather than trying to create a hierarchical system of total control, he was trying to create a system that is much more fractal in nature (Medina, 37). Indeed, for Beer an integral component of control is what he called ‘variety’, citing Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety: for a system to be stable, the number of states that its control mechanism is capable of attaining (its variety) must be greater than or equal to the number of states in the system being controlled, only variety can control variety. Medina has observed that “it is impossible to truly control another unless you can respond to all attempts at subversion.” (Medina 2005, 39). Beer emphasized creating lateral communication channels among the different subsystems so that the changes in one subsystem could be absorbed by changes in the others. This approach, he argued, took advantage of the flexibility of each subsystem. Instead of creating a regulator to fix the behaviour of each subsystem, he found ways to couple subsystems together so that they could respond to each other and adapt. Such adaptive couplings helped maintain the stability of the overall system. (Medina 2005, 39) He viewed managers as system designers rather than as part of the system, he looked for ways to restructure systems so that it would tend toward homeostasis and desired behaviors. (Medina, 40). Another aspect of the interconnectedness was the creation of horizontal and vertical forms of communication and control. This allowed changes in one subsystem to be reacted to by other subsystems rather than waiting for", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:140:1078803900eb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2493, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 141, "text": "Such adaptive couplings helped maintain the stability of the overall system.

(Medina, 40). Another aspect of the interconnectedness was the creation of horizontal and vertical forms of communication and control. This allowed changes in one subsystem to be reacted to by other subsystems rather than waiting for a directive from the top (C2). Thus, cybernetic management approached the control with degrees of freedom and autonomy of subsystems, while preserving the overall system (Medina 2005, 40). For those with a computer science background or those interested in how the architecture for AI simulations is conducted you should read Appendix D in the on-line supplemental materials at this point, which gives an overview of AI, constructing simulations, using automated planning and other topics of interest to the geek at heart. n chapter 4 “Lessons from an American Weapons Developer” we briefly introduced the topic of ‘Reflexive Con-I trol’ (RC), to quickly jog one’s memory, this is the doctrine created in the 1960s by Soviet military planners to enforce their will on other countries or entities by making others ‘choose’ their positions through coercion, negotiation and manipulation; it was related to the concept of military deception (maskirovka). Understanding the subtleties of the Russians, we should observe the difference between ‘vranyo’ and ‘lozh’: …it is important to become familiar with the Russian terms lozh and vranyo, two of the most common terms of in-exactitude in the language. Lozh refers to actual lies and total untruths, whereas vranyo is a more subtle term referring to the dissemination of untruths which have some grounding in reality. (Chotikul, 1986, 66) …facts will change this predetermined approach, in which the main aim is to create several alternative truths (instead of one truth), which by their very existence can give rise to doubts. Telling ‘tactical truths’ and lack of trust between the government and citizens provides a fertile ground for such activities: nobody expects to hear the objective truth from the official channel as people expect everybody to lie to some extent. The observations made over the past ten years show that Russia has, at least to a certain degree, managed to create such alternative narratives, independently of the objective truth. In the long term, systematic information operations carried out by Russia are also producing results: they create uncertainty and suspicion between citizens and the government. At the same time, efforts are made to steer the opinions of susceptible citizens in polarized societies. (Vasara, 2020, 79) In a later section we shall review the polarization effect of the Boolean Algebra of RC.

(Vasara, 2020, 79) In a later section we shall review the polarization effect of the Boolean Algebra of RC. It is important to understand that the basis of effective RC is to create confusion in the adversary, to trick the enemy from the beginning. The Soviet Union’s military was heavily invested in developing RC for military operations. It has also been suggested RC was first begun as a means of domestic influence in the SU: …there was a need for reflexive control in the Soviet society, which prompted systematic research on ‘soft’ influence operations. This research and the influence operations may first have been directed at the country’s own citizens after which they were incorporated into the planning of military operations and the use of military force (Pynnöniemi, 2018, cf. Peters, 2016, p. 4). (Vasara, 2020, 32) The political counterpart to maskirovka appears to lie in the concept of ‘Finlandization.’ Briefly stated, Finlandization describes a process whereby the Soviet Union influences the domestic and foreign policy behavior of non-communist countries in a way that leads them to follow policies congenial to or approved by the Soviet Union, (Chotikul, 1986, 72) And of course, we can trace back to Nazi doctrines as originally inculcated by the German Black Reichswehr such as the military doctrine of ‘poisoning’- perverting the intellectual space of your enemy or target group. A Russian military planner explains the use of deception in RC, in particular keying in on the tactic of diversions: According to Karankevich, success requires a systemic approach in which, parallel to the actual operational plan, a diversion plan is prepared on the basis of which appropriate diversionary moves can be carried out. In that case, the commander must determine in advance which of the enemy’s decisions are advantageous to his own side. Karankevich also discusses the use of information technology, which in his view, is connected with the use of reflexive control. He does not only emphasize the role of deceiving the enemy but also highlights the extreme complexity of carrying out deception operations in today’s situation. In his view, deception lies at the core of information operations and deception measures must be planned at strategic level (Karankevich, 2006, p. 143). Deception is a high-level chain of command decision according to Karankevich. As can be seen the snowball effect can become a fixture in the calculations of RC with the use of multiple layers of deception or Shannon Entropy. There are clear similarities between Karankevich’s thoughts and Lefebvre’s approach to modelling the information available to the enemy and shaping it in accordance with one’s interests (discussed earlier).

(Vasara, 2020, 48-9) Strict differentiation between methods and the need to find desired reflexions in all actions are additional weaknesses in this approach. This may lead to a situation (which existed during the Cold War) in which the mere possibility of doing something is interpreted as an intention of the other party: a neutral text assumes a different meaning when it is interpreted using the ‘methods.’ It is entirely possible that these methods only exist in researchers’ imagination and their determination to find a deeper meaning in all human activities. (Vasara, 2020, 79) As one could see, deception or camouflage is a source of Shannon Entropy in the equations of RC. In analyzing the effectiveness of RC, you first need to accurately assess the conditions of your target vectors. If you go against an adversary in RC that appears sophomoric in RC capabilities, it may turn out to be deception. Chotikul notes in her report that one of the key findings is that underestimating the enemy and its reflexion capacity may substantially undermine the effectiveness of reflexive control methods. It is also important to understand that a variety of different techniques should be applied, and the same technique should not be used repeatedly. This prevents the enemy from deducing which methods and techniques are used and from developing appropriate countermeasures (Chotikul, 1986, p. 83). In 1929, Nikolai Bernstein, a Soviet neurophysiologist, wrote for the first time that when acting in a goal-oriented manner, human brain creates two models: the real world (the model describing what exists around us) and the goal (the model of what will exist around us in the future). Bernstein called the function linking these two models as the feedback arising from the joint impact of neurons and muscles. In 1934, he proposed that the concept ‘reflex arc’, according to which the stimulus-reaction link moves in a single direction should be replaced with the concept ‘reflex circle’, in which the stimulus and reaction also move in the opposite direction. Identical results were published by Norbert Wiener, one of the founders of cybernetics, 15 years later. However, Bernstein’s theories were not appreciated as they ran counter to the Pavlovian physiology, and in the Soviet Union, he was marginalised. (Vasara, 2020, 11) V.

Lefebvre is the seminal reference in the West and to a great extent in his native Russia on Reflexive Control. As a Colonel in the Soviet Army, he began his first mathematical formulations of RC; he is especially mentioned in connection to the creation of RC in a Game theoretic framework, with Reflexive Game Theory. He also discovered the science of ‘Fast Reflexion’ which allows one’s subconscious to be over-ridden through the Amygdala via a controlling force. Reflexive Control is a sub-science of Cybernetics, which is the study of control in mechanical and biological systems. Specifically, RC grew out of Soviet Military Cybernetics, hence you see in the West the corollary in private Defense contractors. It is important to realize that RC is a part of cybernetics, and as such covered under cybersecurity threats. The Soviet conception of cybernetics, although as a scientific discipline it was refuted as a Western Capitalist conspiracy under Stalin, flourished under Khrushchev. Lefebvre, working as a military engineer in cybernetics, first formulated the equations that would come to define RC. Lockheed-Martin engineer Dr. Ed Nozawa, who has studied reflexive control in Russia, points out there are two types of reflexive schools of thought, or rather that RC is a subset of overall Reflexive Processes, of which RC is a subset, Nozawa created automated decision-making systems for Lockheed-Martin. American studies dating to at least 1986 have systematically studied Soviet Reflexive Control, Diane Chotikul writing in her thesis for the Naval Postgraduate School notes the dual nature of Reflexive Control: In addition to being made up of two components—the psychological and cybernetic—reflexive control theory has other dual aspects. For one, it [can] be conducted in two ways: 1. reflexive control through transformation [of] the enemy’s information processing (cognitive), and 2. reflexive control by selecting the messages (informational). Furthermore, reflexive control can be of two types: 1. constructive reflexive control in which the enemy is influenced to voluntarily [consciously or unconsciously] make a decision favorable to the controlling … or 2) destructive reflexive control in which means are employed to destroy, paralyze, or neutralize the procedures and algorithms of the enemy’s decision-making processes. These varied aspects and applications of the theory add to its range and potential effectiveness, as well as to the difficulty of discerning it in use. (Chotikul, 1986, 81-2) Constructive RC is also sometimes referred to as Creative RC. The mathematics of RC is expressed in Boolean Algebra, usually working with sets.

The algebra that Lefebvre created is expressed mathematically below, where the calculations become more complex in the case when a subject under control may realize they are being manipulated, even to the point of playing the Reflexive Game to their advantage if they have sufficient knowledge of the situation. Cybernetics was initially developed by the Soviets at the First Computer Center of the Ministry of Defense. One of the major tasks of the institute during the early 1960s was to develop methods of optimization of the decision-making process. Lefebvre worked in a sub-unit of the institute developing algorithms for the automation of computers, under the leadership of Colonel Tkachenko. In 1963, Lefebvre proposed a different approach to the problem from the game theory methods being employed by the other scientists involved. He proposed that there was a need to organize a special ‘modeling system’ consisting of three subsystems: 1. a unit to simulate one’s own decisions, 2. a unit to simulate the adversary’s’ decisions, and 3. a decision-making unit. In response to criticisms that the principle of guaranteed results must be followed and that decisions must be independent of the decisions of the adversary, he suggested the concept of reflexive control. (Chotikul, 1986, 86-89) Although RC work was begun by the military it was not immediately classified or taken into a covert layer of official defense work. However, a few short years after Lefebvre began formulating this concept it was taken by the KGB and according to Lefebvre became part of a hidden classified workspace in the KGB: In 1968, a KGB agent named Panov published a classified report of Lefebvre’s work, and it is rumored that the KGB Organized its own laboratory of reflexive studies. According to Lefebvre himself, the theory of reflexive control became a classified subject shortly following the publication of Panov’s report, which lends support to the viewpoint that it is considered an extremely valuable concept by the Soviet leadership. Military interest heightened with the publication of K.V. Tarakanov’s book, Mathematics and Armed Conflict in 1974, and particularly with Druzhinin and Kontorov’s ‘Problems of Military Systems Engineering’ in 1976. These highly ranked officers of the Soviet Army’s General Headquarters claim that it is widely used in pedagogical, political, diplomatic and administrative activities.

In military affairs, they discuss the excellent results reflexive control engenders in the training and control of troops and the development of effective leadership, in addition to the obvious goal of control of the adversary. (Chotikul, 1986, 90) o focus more on the dual nature of RC, the cognitive and the informational approach is a good way to under-stand the underlying theories of RC and its combination with real world maneuvers. It is important to understand that along with exerting influence on minds and providing information to deceive, there is also the tandem actions of troop management along with RC deployments. In 1984, Lefebvre presented the concept of two different ways of exerting control for the first time: the cognitive way, in which the aim was to change the processing of the information possessed by the enemy; and the informational approach, in which the messages conveyed to the enemy were selected. (Vasara, 2020, 38). In the first model, the aim is to influence the known cognitive dissonance of the adversary, while in the second model, the enemy is provided with selective information. (Vasara, 2020, 48). Another factor in RC is its longitudinal nature; that is, it is a long term ‘long war’ campaign according to western theoreticians Giles, Seaboyer and Sherr, the author decided to divide reflexive control into long-term constructive methods and short-term destructive methods that are applied in different ways. As a result, no limits have been set for the time span of reflexive control. (Vasara, 2020, 79). The main object is to create reflexive decisions in an adversary, that are in harmony with your intentions or goals. Reflexive Decisions are conveyed by Vasara: ‘From Prediction to Reflexive Control.’ According to the authors, in traditional decision-making theories, the adversary is considered an uncontrolled factor, which naturally leads to the paradigm of anticipation. This means that a decision maker attempts to anticipate the potential responses of the other side in different situations. Correspondingly, by applying reflexive control, anticipation can be replaced by defining the future. The authors introduce a new term, reflexive decision, in referring to decisions that contain an informational message for the other side. (Vasara, 2020, 47) RC is a means of controlling the future, orchestrating a reflexive decision, although it can also have deleterious effects from controlling the future, such as ‘self-fulfilling prophecies’, the process of RC is to predetermine the future, which may have unforeseen consequences since unless you know all events in the future you may end up engineering a bad result for yourself.

As a RC theoretician notes regarding the process of controlling foresight or the future: How does foresight become a “guide to action”? Foresight is committed to achieving by all parties involved consensus on the “vision of the future.” Since, from the participants’ point of view, the final option is chosen as the best of set of all possible, then deviations from it, generally speaking, anyone not beneficial. Respectively, every starts focus on this image and make efforts to ensure that exactly this version of the future was realized. This means that in that the extent to which it was possible to involve all or most stakeholders, starts up the mechanism of “self-fulfilling prophecies “ (Nikateav, 2011) According to Chausov, the pervasive nature of information technology, especially in command-and-control systems, is a factor facilitating the use of reflexive control. This allows one’s own side to infiltrate the enemy’s information networks, filter information, block or restrict network access, set up ‘information ambushes’ and traps, distort information or replace information with lies. The capacity to create value-based models of the way in which enemy leaders behave is especially important. These models are compilations of behaviour, thoughts and emotions. Such activities can be carried out by broadcasting fabricated (but correctly presented) information directed against military and political leadership. At the same time, high-ranking officials are urged to betray their own country. This helps to create public support for one’s own cause and weaken the adversary’s will to fight. (Vasara, 2020, 49) Chausov’s war is a war over behavior, thoughts and emotions. It may sound funny to break war down into a soap opera, but indeed that is the base underlying RC and Information Warfare, or combined Neuro-warfare. The method used in RC to attack the psyche of the adversary is that of simulacrum, or targeted images, which can also be textual, into the mind of the adversary. The Russian military planners have based their ideal of simulacra (‘influence images’) on that of a sign, or what we know from Dr. John Norseen and Lockheed et al, that of the Semiotic (signs), the simulacra is a sign, a message. These signs can be from many different sensory inputs: images, thoughts, text, PR, Social Media, etc. Makhnin, a Russian enthusiast of simulacra has provided a basic outline of these methods: With simulacrum, Makhnin refers to a stimulus arising from simulated influence produced by a reflexive system. Based on these stimuli, the adversary’s battle system produces decisions and provides the system exerting", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:147:86771cddd671", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2500, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 148, "text": "Dr. John Norseen and Lockheed et al, that of the Semiotic (signs), the simulacra is a sign, a message.

Based on these stimuli, the adversary’s battle system produces decisions and provides the system exerting reflexive control with the understanding that it needs to achieve its own goals. Organization of reflexive processes between battle systems manifests itself in the development and carrying out of measures (sending simulacra) that provide the controlled system with areas of interest, motivation and reasons as a result of which the controlled system makes decisions that are in the interests of the controlling system (Makhnin, 2013b, p. 34). (Vasara, 2020, 53) In accordance with the figure above, different ways of producing variations can be defined. Makhnin presents the variations of real-world objects, information world objects and variations of psychological impacts and the resulting categories of simulacra. By doing this, he expands the concept of reflexive control beyond the concept of information operations. (Vasara, 2020, 54) In Makhnin’s view, the key elements of reflexive influence are as follows: 1) the inputs creating the influence; 2) order of the inputs; and 3) the procedures used to create information packets. The fourth important thing is to identify the reflexive techniques used by the enemy and against which protective measures must be taken. Like Lefebvre et al., Makhnin also identifies two different principles for applying reflexive control: the first principle is to use predetermined simulacra so that the enemy can be induced to select the desired line of action. The second principle is to use simulacra with a vague chain of action [suggestibility not pre-definement]. This means that the enemy uses the information as a basis for its own action and can choose between a number of different options. One must be able to shape one’s own action on the basis of the option selected by the enemy. (Vasara, 2020, 54) According to Makhnin, reflexive actions are at their most effective when replacing rational stereotypic algorithms with entirely new methods and tactics to take the enemy by surprise. Likewise, reflexive actions can disorient the adversary’s command and control system by paralyzing its components, one by one. (Vasara, 2020, 55) Combining Lefebvre’s theory and the ideas of Makhnin described above, Kazakov and Kiryushin note that in Makhnin’s view, key to reflexive control is the chance to generate influences preventing the enemy from using new information, to paralyze the enemy’s creativity and to prevent the enemy from making full use of its combat potential. They note, however, that it is equally important for a researcher of reflexive control to identify the messages essential to reflexive control (the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:148:16a524673fe3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2501, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 149, "text": "one.

They note, however, that it is equally important for a researcher of reflexive control to identify the messages essential to reflexive control (the information packets used by the enemy as a basis for its decision-making). Like Makhnin, they recommend that the term ‘simulacrum’ should be used. In their view, it provides an adequate theoretical basis for the information packets used for deceptive purposes. They note that such information packets should be divided into two general models: representational and non-representational. A representational information packet is a copy of a copy (pretending to be the real thing). In the context of reflexive control, such information packets are used when one wants to conceal one’s intentions. The information is partially false but its sole purpose is to conceal the real information and to deceive the enemy A non-representational information packet, on the other hand, does not pretend to be a copy of a real thing. Its purpose is to act as a cover for the original matter and to convey false information about a matter, action or an event. (Vasara, 2020, 56). As Vasara has noted it is also important to realize that there are two simultaneous processes going on, 1. the RC of the adversary and 2. mission management: moving around troops as RC is running to respond to the outcomes of forcing the adversary around the battlefield based on RC. The model described above shows that the implementation making use of constructive reflexive control can be based on any of the three inputs. The real inputs are based on the action of one’s own troops, while the informational and psychological inputs are based on the starting point or situational data created for the enemy’s decision makers that is advantageous to one’s own side. Using these inputs as a basis, the enemy is expected to voluntarily make decisions that are advantageous to one’s own side and that one’s own side has been able to anticipate. To complement this definition, a model has been prepared on the basis of the sources discussing reflexive control and presented above. It encompasses all aspects of reflexive control, from the methods of exercising it to its goals, using the division Ends-Ways-Means produced for strategy by Lykke. The essential feature of the model is that, in accordance with the ideas presented by Lefebvre and Makhnin, it is divided into two implementations: constructive (creative) implementation, employing procedures aimed at inducing the enemy to make desired decisions, and the destructive implementation, employing methods attempting to weaken and disrupt the enemy’s decision-making (Ways). The", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:149:6c2934dc8f62", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2502, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 150, "text": "above.

The model also features different types of reflexive control, different forms of control inputs and different methods for exerting reflexive control (Means). The model combines all these factors to illustrate the areas of the military command system targeted for the influencing efforts (Ends). (Vasara, 2020, 62) There is one key element to remember in dealing with RC; that is, that without a valid model of the adversary you have a useless tool that will continue to attack phantom targets rather than real targets. This is because the whole concept is based on the assumption that the enemy’s decision-making can be modelled so that using specific prepared inputs, the enemy can be persuaded to take the decisions anticipated and desired by the other side. (Vasara, 2020, 67). As the processes of RC become more and more AI driven and automated the question of a valid model becomes increasingly important. Another important understanding of the functionality of RC techniques is that of targeting the interpretation of objects, in Semiotics the Interpretant (Subject), this can be affected through various means, such as providing false interpretation of scientific data by paying experts to mislead with half-truths, for instance to obfuscate military capabilities. Franke, gives a fuller understanding: Ulrik Franke, a Swedish military researcher, has written a study of information warfare, which relies on Russian documents as source material. Like Makhnin, he highlights the use of real, informational, and psychological inputs in the conveying of information. According to Franke, the following measures can be used during peacetime: attempts can be made to discredit foreign politicians; messages can be sent by means of aggressive air operations; or Russian views on the world situation can be conveyed through suitable media. However, as required in the implementation of reflexive control, more importance is attached to the adversary’s interpretation of the activities than to the activities themselves. (Vasara, 2020, 68) One example of messing with interpretations is that of using social networks to plant fake news which is usually not totally fabricated but half-truths. Social networks can be used to influence individuals’ behavior and their beliefs and such action provides a basis for the use of legal ‘agents.’ (Vasara, 2020, 61). It is telling that with the new technology of decentralized networking via computers that it has opened a new door to operations of RC, and that military planners view the members themselves of these networks as valuable ‘agents’ even", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:150:1c6b14b6c301", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2503, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 151, "text": "social networks to plant fake news which is usually not totally fabricated but half-truths.

It is telling that with the new technology of decentralized networking via computers that it has opened a new door to operations of RC, and that military planners view the members themselves of these networks as valuable ‘agents’ even if unknowing. This handling of these agents “can be applied using real and information inputs that mainly comprise surprise/deception by one’s own troops or the feeding of information to the enemy’s system and decision-makers that creates confusion on the enemy side or is otherwise harmful to the enemy. These inputs are expected to destroy, weaken or paralyze the enemy’s decision-making capacity.” (Vasara, 2020, 65). It should be noted that Russians do not allow their soldiers to actively participate in social networks, especially on deployment, one can also testify to the vulnerabilities of allowing social network access while on deployment in the many encounters of US servicemen being targeted by the likes of ISIS and al-Qaida operatives through these networks, for instance honey-potting by Islamists of American servicemen on dating apps. Operations Research as a part of Intelligence operations is a natural home for Reflexive Control; the inter-twinement of Cybernetics and Reflexive Control is a long held combination, we can even see its influence today in the work of Serge Kernbach, a Professor of Robotics who also studies Soviet remote influencing. Again, cybernetics being the study of control in the animal and machine, it is not surprising that a binary logic such as Reflexive Control grew out of the section that developed computerized algorithms, such as V. A. Lefebvre. As those old enough to remember, the Soviet Union’s dictatorship of the proletariat was a hierarchical directed graph. The notion of machine and man is not separate in Soviet culture. We look for instance at Soviet artistic expressions in ‘Constructivism’ which envisioned the mixing of man and machine, a new Soviet man. It is also expressed in the military organization of the Soviet Union where it was not difficult to envision total automation of military units, for instance we could look at the Alpha class of Soviet submarines with a skeleton crew of commissioned officers only and cybernetic control of most systems. This extended into other spheres of the Soviet military: In Soviet economics we therefore see Five-Year and Ten-Year Plans; in the Soviet military, a trend toward a cybernetically based theory of troop control (upravienie voyskami/silami, C² ), and projection for the eventual total automation (ASUV) of the Command, Control, and Communications (C3) System. (Chotikul, 1986, 29) However, ‘management of troops’ is not the correct translation for the Russian term either. This translation fails to convey the fact that the Russian", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:151:bd8e76b8ae03", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2504, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 152, "text": "This extended into other spheres of the Soviet military: In Soviet economics we therefore see Five-Year and Ten-Year Plans; in the Soviet military, a trend toward a cybernetically based theory of troop control (upravienie voyskami/silami, C² ), and projection for the eventual total automation (ASUV) of the Command, Control, and Communications (C3) System. (Chotikul, 1986, 29) However, ‘management of troops’ is not the correct translation for the Russian term either. This translation fails to convey the fact that the Russian term refers to a successive management process and not merely to the direct action of commanding troops. ‘Giving orders’ (командование) is an instrument implementing the directing function, whereas ‘management’ (управление) implements the action itself. The fact that the Russian translation for ‘reflexive control’ is ‘refleksivnoje upravlenie’ (‘reflexive management’) and not ‘kontrol’ is also relevant to this study. Management is a dynamic process, which includes both inputs and feedback. In Russian, the word ‘control’ (контроль) is used to describe feedback functions and supervision. Thus, directing and execution are seen as two separate, though continuous and mutually dependent, (dialectical) functions. (Vasara, 2020) Researchers studying the military applications of cybernetics proposed that computers and cybernetic control should not only be used in autonomous weapons systems but also in the command of military units. In fact, the first information technology centre operating under the auspices of the Soviet Ministry of Defence was the first facility to study automated command of troops. In the opinion of cyberneticians, computers can make more objective decisions than individual commanders because computers do not base their decision making on intuition but on collective information and on a broader operational-tactical view in specific areas. (Vasara, 2020, 15-6) Volostnov and Golod put together earlier concepts in their search for the core idea of command and control. In their view, command is an intentional, creative, organizational and a technical process that is put into practice by commanders and their staffs. It creates impacts on the troops subordinated to them. The ultimate goal of command and control is to organize troops for their combat missions and to ensure that they can effectively carry out their combat missions within the time allocated to them and with minimum losses. Secondly, when examined through the cybernetic perspective, all command takes place in a closed cybernetic system, in which objects in contact with each other transmit information in an appropriate manner. Thirdly, the command process is part of the military system. In this connection, the principles defining the content of ‘control’ are those that define the functioning of complex military systems. (Vasara, 2020, 25) At least initially this willingness to trust cybernetics with management of troops themselves and automation of C3 was not shared in the West, for instance while serving on US submarines the main reason our Sonar system was not fully automated was this distrust of machine over human intuition, then again Sonar personnel are", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:152:592e528e7e3f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2505, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 153, "text": "of the military system.

Returning to the concept of hierarchical control, realizing we are dealing with Soviet architecture, it is not surprising to see a main controller, the main controller of all controller classes; the concept of ‘edononachalniye’, one man control (Chotikul, 1986, 61), finds itself even imported to the west later after the fall of the Soviet Union in Lockheed-Martin engineer Ed Nozawa’s ‘Single Warrior Model’ which is a closed loop self-management automated system based on Soviet research. We see it previously, “….to the Soviet view of the leader as ‘sole formulator and controller’ of group decisions and actions.” (Chotikul, 1986, 62). In fact, according to the analysis of Vasara the prime target of Russian RC is the commander or leader: In the context of this study, it is important to identify the potential targets for influence operations in this highly automated command system, which is designed for quick commander-centred decision-making. It can be concluded from the above that the commander is likely to be the prime target and the staff the secondary target. This is because influencing them will impact the whole system (in the same way as exerting influence on a higher-level commander). Influence on the commander and his staff can be exerted through their thoughts (command and control and thoughts about the conflict as background factors), through the plans that they have prepared (the aim is to influence the fundamentals of the plans), or through decision support systems (solutions advantageous to one’s own side are fed into the decision-making process). Efforts may also be made to exert direct influence on individuals (especially the commander). Efforts may also be made to influence the command system, even though this will produce more limited results. The ultimate method of exerting influence on the enemy is to cause more disruption in the operating environment. All these options are discussed in the dual model of reflexive control. (Vasara, 2020, 28) Softening up of a target of Reflexive Control, the subject, is another area that goes hand in hand with RC. In this battle between opposing RC agents the mind becomes the seat of conflict, the Russian Generals are very aware of this both in terms of counter measures and in offense.

In this battle between opposing RC agents the mind becomes the seat of conflict, the Russian Generals are very aware of this both in terms of counter measures and in offense. Vasara citing the influence of Gen. Ryabchuk, “intellectual capability is the key weapon and crucial to achieving victory over a well-armed, well-equipped and well-trained enemy (Ryabchuk, 2001, pp. 14–15).” Another General, Makhnin, reached similar conclusions. (Vasara, 2020, 26). One of the most important contributions from cybernetics to Command and Control in the SU was the creation of decision aides to guide commanders’ decisions. However, even with the added tool of automated data mining and simulations, the mental strength of the commander is the key, according to Ryabchuk. Vasara notes: Ryabchuk concludes his article by noting that today’s military commanders have access to more systems helping them to select the best possible options when making decisions. Nevertheless, in his view, success in the battlefield is guaranteed by the personal characteristics of a military commander, which comprise a high intellectual capability, high ethical standards, and psychological and professional capabilities. When available in sufficient quantities, these characteristics provide a basis for an effective approach to command and control (Ryabchuk, 2001, p. 17). (Vasara, 2020, 26) For a Commander when dealing with RC and it’s necessary cybernetic underpinning one of the key attributes of success is maintaining an analytical mind as well as applying ‘exploration’ in tactics. Decisions are usually made according to the Recognition-Primed model of Klein which states that decision makers make quick decisions based on previously experienced patterns, without analyzing different options. In such an automated system this would lead to being quickly out-maneuvered. Another mentally weak strategy in RC for a commander is to quickly make decisions, avoid knee-jerk responses which may even be conducted with RC psychological inputs to promote such knee-jerk responses. It is important to understand the systems a commander is faced with, that these systems of complex reflective systems, taking into account decisions made by the adversary in their own actions and try to achieve a higher degree of reflex (Vasara, 2020, 22). And secondly by the Soviet study of the psychology of attention. This academic discipline and, in particular, its research on the ‘orienting reflex’ has convinced the Soviets of the value of inducing psychological strain and inability to cope through inhibition of the ability to establish patterns. These repeating techniques, coupled with an emphasis on redundancy, would thus appear to be very effective tools in the attempt to reduce risk and create “right conditions’ to gain advantage, and possibly even control, over an adversary.

As Beaumont has noted, “The cross-links between Soviet psychology, the military and engineering are far more well developed than in the West and have been since the Revolution. (Chotikul, 1986, 76) Although it is not true that the union of psychology and warfare is not found in the West (perhaps not mentioned due to a need-to-know restriction of the military author), it is important to understand the linkage. On the battlefield, in this case a physical space, the Commander is going to establish full-spectrum dominance; they are going to want to control the terrain, the heights, the valleys, the beach, etc. This is also a part of effective RC, hence the softening up process is also a means of extending dominance of the environment, removing unknown factors or variables, thus controlling even the inputs to the Reflexive algorithm: Important considerations for the Soviets when attempting to optimize a decision are: what is the nature of unknown factors, what is their origin, and who controls them. Measures of effectiveness (MOEs) in Soviet operations research take these unknown factors into account in their algorithms, and attempt to optimize effectiveness in spite of them. (Chotikul, 1986, 86) The Soviet military put a lot of emphasis into Reflexive Control in the 1970s and 1980s; of course one questions its validity considering the Soviet Union collapsed like Nazism, but nonetheless military planners in the Soviet Union and now the UK-USA have fully embraced the edicts of RC. The problem is that in militaries around the world, most will simply mimic each other, as the SU creates RC, then the UK-USA must also create RC and RC counter-measures. referencing the work of Lt. Col. Timothy Thomas (US Army Ret) currently a contractor for Defense Industry Company Mitre Corp, has perhaps the deepest academic understanding on Soviet RC of anyone. Soviet military leader Col. Leonenko explains the importance of knowing RC and applying it to the enemy: If successfully achieved, reflexive control over the enemy makes it possible to influence his combat plans, his view of the situation, and how he fights. In other words, one side can impose its will on the enemy and cause him to make a decision inappropriate to a given situation. Reflexive control methods are varied and include camouflage (at all levels), disinformation, encouragement, blackmail by force, and the compromising of various officials and officers. Thus, the central focus of reflexive control is on the less tangible element of “military art” rather", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:155:3909b7900bab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2508, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 156, "text": "possible to influence his combat plans, his view of the situation, and how he fights.

Reflexive control methods are varied and include camouflage (at all levels), disinformation, encouragement, blackmail by force, and the compromising of various officials and officers. Thus, the central focus of reflexive control is on the less tangible element of “military art” rather than more objective “military science.” Achieving successful reflexive control requires in-depth study of the enemy’s inner nature, his ideas, and concepts, which Leonenko referred to as the filter through which passes all data about the external world. Successful RC represents the culmination point of an information operation. So defined, a filter is a collective image (termed “set” [see Bernstein above] of the enemy’s favorite combat techniques and methods for organizing combat actions, plus a psychological portrait of the enemy. Thus, reflex requires study of someone else’s filter and the exploitation of it for one’s own ends. In the information age, this filter is represented by human and machine (computer) data processors. The most important question then becomes: How does one side achieve this higher degree of reflex and, hence, more effective reflexive control over the enemy? It does so primarily by employing a broader range of means for achieving surprise. In turn, it achieves surprise by means of stealth, disinformation, and avoidance of stereotypes [shablon]. (Thomas 2004, 242-3) You might compare the process of Reflexive Control to a normal war, except the battlefield is of the mind, wherein you use various tools for manipulation, intimidation, honey-potting, psychological torture, rewards, payoff, a combination of both positive and negative feedbacks – even physical violence to steer your opponent to your will, while hiding your true will and goal from your opponent; it is a hidden war. This is all done in an effort to hamper, hinder and sabotage the opponent’s decision-making process, time and methodology, to sow confusion at every turn. • Provocation, by force him into taking action advantageous to your side. • Overload, by dispatching an excessively large number of messages to the enemy during the preparatory period. • Suggestion, by offering information that affects the enemy legally, morally, ideologically, or in other areas. • Pressure, by offering information that discredits the government in the eyes of its population.27 (Thomas, 2004, 248-9) As one can see from this list a large amount of emotional and psychological pressures are formulated in the process of RC. One may think that only national leaders or Generals would be subject to this kind of campaign, however, it is noted that this is to be used against even local commanders in military operations, of course to psychologically manipulate someone you have to have solid information about their psyche, the inner world, their behaviors.

The predicted responses, the methodology for achieving this psych profile has become increasingly invasive, see Quantum Consciousness chapter for how this is achieved. As mentioned earlier the primary difference between modern RC and ancient RC is that of technology. Since the creation of computational systems in war fighting with the advent of the computer in combat during WW2, it has also come into play in RC, with the automation of RC under the Soviets, who at one time enjoyed an almost two-decade advantage in computer power compared to the United States in the 1980s; in other words the Soviets had far outpaced the UK-USA in terms of computational and psychotronics in the 1980s but still lost the Cold War. Like the Nazis in Russia in WW2, natural power trumps artificial power, as the Russian winter defeated the Nazis. …that the use of reflexive control by making it easier to process data and calculate options. This is so since an opponent can more easily ‘see through’ a reflexive control measure by an opposing force by simply using a computer. The computer’s speed and accuracy in processing information can detect the reflexive control measure. On the other hand, in some cases, this may actually improve the chances for successful reflexive control, since a computer lacks the intuitive reasoning of a human being. (Thomas, 2004, 246). Leonenko draws attention to the problem of involving computer automation in such military operations as RC. He stated, “we live in a much more frightening existence than we care to believe if, in fact, decisions are in the hand of machines that are “incapable of assessing what is occurring and do not perceive that a person reacts to” (Thomas, 2004, 247). Automated weapons researchers also note that computers also do not experience guilt and remorse regarding their actions; it provides a layer of emotional insulation to human decision makers, when a machine is the main instrument of conducting ‘wet’ operations. In a later section we will be reviewing the automated aspect of computer management systems of Reflexive Control. A s we shall read later regarding Western development of software that manages military simulations, situational awareness and management is a key to effective military operations regardless if they include an RC component, although it is safe to say that every modern military action includes RC.

Managing situations becomes a cornerstone to the understanding of RC. Lefebvre viewed conflict as no longer between two physical armies; rather the conflict was an interaction between two decision-making processes which have a feedback loop onto how the troops are managed and deployed (Vasara, 2020, 34). Lefebvre’s definition accords that the other party gains leverage over the adversary’s situational assessment, this in tandem with studying and knowing the highly probable moves of the adversary, it is possible to create an equation of the options available to decision-makers. Vasara notes, “it is particularly important to be able to influence the adversary’s situational awareness, his goals or doctrine and to ensure that the adversary does not notice the influencing attempts” (Vasara, 2020, 35) Major General M. Ionov notes that influencing is possible if the plans and intentions of the enemy are revealed. According to Ionov, the enemy can be persuaded to make decisions that are to one’s advantage based on the following conditions: the enemy is placed under pressure; influence is exerted on the enemy’s situational assessment, decision-making algorithm, and the way in which it selects its goal; and influence is exerted on the timing of the enemy’s decision-making. Placing the enemy under pressure is the easiest condition to understand. Its aim is to influence the psychological state of decision-makers and to persuade them to avoid combat. Disguise, deception, unexpected new instruments, and changes in troops are used to influence the enemy’s situational assessment (Vasara, 2020, 36). • .goal setting can be influenced in three ways. One is a show of force to convince the enemy that a goal is unachievable. A second is to demonstrate a threat of such significance that its countering dominates the enemy’s goals. The third way is to keep the enemy in a state of uncertainty concerning one’s own actions to ensure that none of its goals can guarantee a satisfactory outcome in all plausible sets of events. (Vasara, 2020, 39) • Transferring a situational picture to the enemy: in this method of reflexive control, the enemy is conveyed a wrong or incomplete situational picture by means of deception, disguise or decoys. • Creating goals or a doctrine for the adversary: in this reflexive control method, the aim is, by sharing one’s own information, to put the enemy in a situation where its only options are also advantageous to one’s own side. • Transferring the desired decision: in this operating model (which requires trust and contacts between the parties), the aim is", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:158:f1d532e9047b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2511, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 159, "text": "of reflexive control, the enemy is conveyed a wrong or incomplete situational picture by means of deception, disguise or decoys. • Creating goals or a doctrine for the adversary: in this reflexive control method, the aim is, by sharing one’s own information, to put the enemy in a situation where its only options are also advantageous to one’s own side. • Transferring the desired decision: in this operating model (which requires trust and contacts between the parties), the aim is to force the enemy to make a decision that provides a basis for action on one’s own side. These three operating approaches are simple models, in which the aim is to directly influence the adversary’s situational assessment at specific stages of decision-making. The operating models described below are more complex because in them, the aim is to shape one phase of the decision-making process by controlling the adversary’s understanding of another phase. Success in such actions requires extremely good understanding of how the adversary makes decisions. • Influencing goal formation by feeding a false situational assessment: feigning weakness so that the enemy can be lured into a trap is one application of this method. This model can also be used by controlling specific ‘indicators’ identified in advance that the enemy uses as a basis for its decision-making. • Feeding parts of one’s own situational assessments to the enemy: for example, controlled leaks concerning matters presented as important to one’s own operations. • Feeding details of imaginary goals to the enemy: the purpose of this method is to shift the enemy’s attention away from one’s actual goal to the desired goal. • Feeding a fake version of one’s own doctrine to the enemy: exercises, in which the troops are deployed differently than in the real situation are an example of this method (ibid., p. 305). • Modifying one’s own action so that the enemy gets a wrong situational picture: in this method, one takes a controlled risk and moves troops to an area from where no attack is planned. The assumption is that the enemy expects an imminent attack. • Reflexive control of bilateral engagement by a third party: in this method (which is directed at decision-makers), a third-party attempts to get two other parties into a situation that is advantageous to it (ibid., p. 306). • Reflexive control over an enemy relying on the game theory: in this method, which is based on the conservative nature and inflexibility of the game theory and answers known in advance, inputs in line with these characteristics are fed into the adversary’s decision-making process (Vasara, 2020, 39-40) n the Russian and earlier Soviet research regarding RC it is noted that automation and information technology Igreatly expand and also limit the effectiveness of RC.

In terms of amplifying RC, the sheer iterations that a machine can throw at an adversary can potentially paralyze their response due simply to the number of automated attack vectors, but for the same reasons of losing effectiveness due to automated detection of RC techniques, the same machines can undo attacks along with making attacks of one’s own more effective. This was not lost to Russian military planners such as Ionov as early as 1971: Ionov concludes his article by noting that influencing the enemy’s operations constitutes a complex logical problem that can only be solved if a large amount of information is processed. This is beyond the capabilities of the commander and his staff and automated systems are required for the work (Vasara, 2020, 37) Earlier we mentioned that in Russian Cybernetics there is a trust in full-cycle automation, that is, there is no human in the loop of automated management, though still not as popular as having a human commander to reference automated data procedures, as a form of insight or recommendation, which is conducted by Decision Aides. Russian military planners write regarding Decision Aides: Tikhanitsev, who works at the research department of the Russian military administration and actively contributes to the debate on research issues, has written about developing decision support systems for automated administration. He notes that in the context of the systems theory, the individual who decides to launch an operation (battle) merely adjusts the control parameters in order to construct a strategy allowing weapons systems and troops to achieve the goals set by the commander (within the limitations set). If there is only one solution to such a system-level problem, it can be determined by means of direct calculations. However, Tikhanitsev admits that in combat troops are rarely in such a situation. If there are not enough troops or weapons, the goal can rarely be achieved with the prerequisites set. In such cases, in order to achieve a solution, new values for the target function (goal) must be calculated or estimated or some of the limitations must be adjusted. In that case, a rational solution can be achieved but solving the equation involves a large number of changing parameters and producing the calculations is difficult. Reaching a solution may prove impossible unless the decision-makers use the capabilities offered by automated support. (Vasara, 2020, 23) Although it is hard to imagine that human soldiers would just be moved around a battlefield like tin soldiers of competing machines, the reality is that is what warfare has become,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:160:02a219b915d6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2513, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 161, "text": "limitations must be adjusted.

(Vasara, 2020, 23) Although it is hard to imagine that human soldiers would just be moved around a battlefield like tin soldiers of competing machines, the reality is that is what warfare has become, whether the soldiers are directly controlled by a machine or still maintain their own consciousness in battle through the thin line of a human commander interacting with a machine, we are confronted with a situation in automated warfare where even the soldiers themselves are mere puppets to an automated system, as we have read in ‘Lessons from an American Weapons Developer’ it has already been investigated in the United States military of using EM to control soldiers body states and the use of Decision Aides in Lockheed Martin’s work on Reflexive Games based on AI POMDP Algorithm competing agents of Red and Blue. The downside of using automated decision support is that those decisions themselves could be based on disinformation, data poisoning, or just bad math. The article by Donskov, Nikitin and Besedin on intelligent decision support systems for electronic warfare is relevant to reflexive control. In their view, decision support systems used today are typically built as expert systems that support decision makers without them having to take any active measures. In the authors’ view, the risk here is that the adversary can manipulate these automated systems with its signals. They note that as systems become more extensively automated, it becomes increasingly likely there will be attempts to control them on a reflexive basis. According to the authors, a decision support system may in itself exert reflexive control over the enemy and protect one’s own system against the control attempts made by the adversary. (Vasara, 2020, 23). It is not trivial to realize that any group with appropriate knowledge can poison an automated system, for instance when Microsoft’s AI came under attack from a Neo-Nazi-style attack, which trained the AI to produce Nazi-aligned beliefs in its comments. Our view of “reflexion” has been essentially broadened during the last twenty years. Traditionally we have considered it to consist of the conscious constructing of images of the self and others by human beings. Now we have evidence that there is a reflexion of another nature as well. It is as if an inborn informational processor is built into human psyche whose function is to automatically create these images together with their subjective domains. This processor generates a specific specter of human responses not controlled consciously and running extremely fast (one-two milliseconds).

This processor generates a specific specter of human responses not controlled consciously and running extremely fast (one-two milliseconds). This type of reflexion, as distinct from the traditional concept is called fast reflexion [not controlled by one’s self-will, an entirely subconscious process] (Lefebvre & Webber, 2002). In Lefebvre’s Algebra of Conscience, he postulates a pole between liberal “western” values and authoritarian “eastern” values. Which are diametrically opposed to each other. Agents within these two systems are given their position by the pressures from others. An agent creates an image of self and an image of other and even more complex images of reflexion. Ideally, global theoretical models ought to possess two properties: integrity and uniformity. Integrity means that the model must be able to reflect simultaneously the subject’s perception, behavior, and inner domain. Uniformity requires that different aspects of the subject’s activity must be described in terms of the same theoretical language. The general method for attaining these two properties is to represent the subject as a composition of mathematical functions. Various elements of this composition are interpreted as “inputs” and “outputs” and as images of the self and of other subjects. These images can have their own inner domain containing images of the next order. As a result, we succeed in producing a unified functional description of the subject’s inner and external activity. A composition of mathematical functions is also a function. It describes the subject’s behavior. Therefore, the composition’s structure reflects not only the subject’s inner domain, but also the macrostructure of a computational process generating behavior. In the simplest cases, when the “global” function of behavior is known in advance, information about the mental domain can be obtained from a purely mathematical analysis of the properties of the function. (Lefebvre & Webber, 2002, 1) (1) A person possesses an inner formal mechanism for modeling the self and others. This mechanism is universal and does not depend on the particular culture to which a person belongs. (2) The models of the ‘self’ and ‘other’ are reflexive; that is, these models may themselves contain models of the self and other, and so on. (3) The inner formal mechanism for modeling includes a computational process, which is automatic and does not depend on conscious will. This process predetermines a person’s responses in a situation of choice between “good” and “bad,” and it also generates his inner feelings, such as guilt and condemnation. (4) The models of the self and of the other also have this computational ability, which allows a person to model automatically his own and his partner’s inner feelings, providing information that is unavailable to direct observation.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:162:cb3c0a273317", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2515, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 163, "text": "for modeling includes a computational process, which is automatic and does not depend on conscious will.

Okatrin noted to the CIA that he was only aware of Western attempts at such technological control or mass influencing. Which is probably dishonest but as a member of the Soviet Academic community he would as a Government employee of the Soviet Union disavow any such work. Apparently, this is contradicted by memos regarding official Soviet interest in controlling biological objects. However, the claim that the west is interested in such technology is also brought forward by Brushlinsky’s replacement in charge of Russian Reflexive Control Vladimir Lepsky, in his work also claims that the west is interested in controlling the East, that is Russia, through such technology, creating an oligarchy, through a form of ‘organized chaos’ citing DoD funded researcher Mann’s chaos ideals in geopolitics, charging the west with the managed chaotic destruction of Russia. In 1992, “according to Lazarev, the United States uses information as a reflexive control instrument, and for this reason, information security of the state must be given a high priority.” (Vasara, 2020, 42) There is also the work of Sokolov, that claims that the attacks on people in Russia working on these technologies has led to losing such talent to England who are now working against Russia. Then we can also look at the 2015 claim by the Russian Press Secretary Peskov that Russia was under ‘Anglo-Saxon’ information war as noted by one opinion piece author: …Peskov also spoke about the information war “primarily with the Anglo-Saxons” on March 26 on the air of the TVC. And, as if by way of illustration, the Kremlin’s Russian Institute for Strategic Studies released a report “Foreign media in 2015 - an anti-Russian vector.” Information war will write off everything (Sinitsyn & Epple 2016). Yet, looking back in history it is important to note the Nazi plan to colonize Russia and displace the Slavs with Aryans, with those Nazis who were serving to that purpose during the war, then after the war headed to western intelligence organizations set to defeat the Soviet Union. So, the question is whether this is a cultural artifact or an actual reality that the Russians are under a form of neuro-warfare, a soft form of open warfare?

So, the question is whether this is a cultural artifact or an actual reality that the Russians are under a form of neuro-warfare, a soft form of open warfare? Interest in the west in Russian Reflexive Control is known through the work of Miller and Sulcoski in 1999, who proposed application of a model based on multi-attribute utility function (MAUF) in automated decision support systems. The model represented a chain of binary choices, for each of which its own reflexive model can be built. Taran (2002) elaborated models of multi-criteria reflexive selection and researched conditions that create prerequisites for management of a subject’s behavior under decision making. In collaboration with Shemayev (2005) she also proposed an approach to solution of problems of cognitive conflicts modeling, considering the influence of the external environment, psychological set and intentions of subjects. (Shemayev, 2017) Other Americans that have studied in Russia include Dr. John Norseen and Ed Nazawa both of Lockheed Martin. Earlier work in the American equivalent of RC: …the focus in the Western approach to influencing opinions and impressions (perception management) is to steer the emotions, motives and objective deduction of foreign audiences and decision-makers by conveying to the target audiences selected information and indications or by preventing the target audiences from accessing information. This action is based on presenting the truth in a desired manner, operational security, deception and psychological operations. In addition to (or instead of ) the term ‘perception management’ the term ‘strategic communication’ is now also used in the West (the concept originated in the United States). It is described as a government-level activity in which the aim is to reach target audiences, and create, strengthen or preserve conditions that are in one’s own interests. Strategic communication is carried out using a variety of different methods and all channels available at government level. Analysis of the target audiences and decision-makers and of the way in which the emotions and motives of the target audiences should be understood (subjective background factors) is a key component of these methods. In the subjective (understanding) approach to target audiences and to selecting information, there is a need to use a feedback channel: measuring and assessing whether this action is creating the desired impacts or whether the action should be adjusted in accordance with the feedback has been part of the Western way of influencing opinions ever since the Second World War.

(Vasara, 2020) It is important to note a key difference here between the Russian model of control and the American model of control, with the American architecture including a feedback loop to measure the result of the action against the target. The Russian system lacks such feedback loops. The use of feedback loops of this type can be also considered similar to the use of Polling in Video Game design to measure the game state, registering actions and results through an Agent. As Vasara has noted about this distinction: It is important to remember that US contemporary influence technology is based in some degree on Russian designs that came to the west in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union, such as Igor Smirnov who worked with the FBI at Waco and also had partnerships with former US military officials, such as General Stubblebine. Parallel to the war against terrorism launched by the United States in 2001, Russia under Vladimir Putin was working to achieve rapprochement with the West. In those years, there was more public discussion of reflexive control and reflexivity, and Russian researchers were engaged in close cooperation with their US counterparts. In 2001, Vladimir Lepsky, who had collaborated with Lefebvre since the 1960s, launched the publication Рефлексивные процессы и управление. Between 2001 and 2004, it also appeared in English under the title ‘Reflexive Processes and Control.’ (Vasara, 2020, 45-6) In fact, the operational level only became a topic of discussion in the 1980s. This was prompted by American researchers who noted that reflexive control is a useful tool at strategic level and that the Soviet orientation is systemic-strategic compared with the technical-tactical approach favoured in the United States (Chotikul, 1986, 35). (Vasara, 2020, 67) In his book ‘Kremlin Kontrol’, Thomas notes that reflexive control can be applied at tactical, operational, strategic and geopolitical levels. In fact, for the people behind the theory of reflexive control and for those responsible for its practical applications, the issue of operational levels has not been a prime concern. In their view, it should be applicable at all levels listed by Thomas when used in combination with different methods. The activities should be directed at the adversary’s decision-makers regardless of whether they are heads of state, Members of Parliament or battalion commanders. (Vasara, 2020, 67) In Kiselyov’s view, the focus should now be on warfare directed at behaviour. Such warfare has only become possible in recent years as methods have been developed to collect large amounts of data on human behaviour. Human behaviour is not only based on ideas, values, and beliefs, but it is also to some extent founded", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:165:d01893d6bd2a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2518, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 166, "text": "activities should be directed at the adversary’s decision-makers regardless of whether they are heads of state, Members of Parliament or battalion commanders.

Such warfare has only become possible in recent years as methods have been developed to collect large amounts of data on human behaviour. Human behaviour is not only based on ideas, values, and beliefs, but it is also to some extent founded on stereotypes, habits, and behavioural models. At the same time, our behaviour is also shaped by official and unofficial institutions. Kiselyov goes on to note that there is indisputable scientific evidence that human behaviour largely takes place in semi-automatic mode and is based on habits and stereotypes. In his view, this not only applies to simple solutions, but the effect also manifests itself in complex decision-making situations involving choices that require in-depth thinking. (Vasara, 2020, 69) Weapons influencing behaviour are the weapons of the future, and Kiselyov claims that Western countries, especially the United States, are already developing them. Kiselyov notes that it is particularly important to conceal the personal data of senior officers to ensure the adversary is unable to anticipate their decisions in conflict. (Vasara, 2020, 70) n the 1980s there was a cyberpunk movie called War Games, in which a machine intelligence takes the world to I the brink of Nuclear War by running simulations of scenarios. RC finds its most effective application in military planning and simulation programs. Games enter into RC thought and remain used to this day in military automated programs for conflict. RC grew directly out of reflections on Game Theory. Lefebvre later went on to create the concept of Reflexive Game Theory, which was implemented in Military simulations in the former Soviet Union. Remembering the cybersecurity Red (attacker) and Blue (defender) divisions we will see how Military planners via simulations and real-world computer systems manage Reflexive Control, including the management of their own troops with algorithms based on RGT. Andrew Schumann, an investigator into RGT, defines it as: The notion of reflexive games was first introduced by Vladimir Lefebvre in 1965. A game is called reflexive if to choose the action the agent has to model (predict) actions of his/her opponents. The game-theoretic mathematics for reflexive games has been developed by D.A. Novikov and A.G. Chkhartishvili. Notice that the ideas of Lefebvre are very close to ideas of metagame which were proposed by Nigel Howard. Level-k models are considered in. The difference between reflexive games and any bounded rational approach consists in that, in reflexive games there is a massive-parallel logic [which may not be resolvable, always frustrated] that should be analyzed by the players for winning. In reflexive games both conflicting parties simulate decision making of each other and aspire to foresee them. This decision making (on the basis of reasoning", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:166:ced012ca567a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2519, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 167, "text": "are very close to ideas of metagame which were proposed by Nigel Howard.

In reflexive games both conflicting parties simulate decision making of each other and aspire to foresee them. This decision making (on the basis of reasoning as well as emotional reactions), which we expect from our interlocutor/opponent, are called perlocutionary effects of our dialogue. Let us recall that any dialogue has three levels: locutionary (information expressed in verbal or non-verbal exposition of states of affairs), illocutionary (cognitive and emotional estimations of considered information), perlocutionary (effects of cognitive and emotional estimations of interlocutors/opponents). What will be the perlocutionary effects of our utterance, i.e., which decision will be made, we do not know, but we try to foresee them. The situation where my decision processes (cognitive estimations and feelings) are not transparent for the interlocutor, while his/her decision processes are transparent for me, shows that my level of reflexion is higher than my interlocutor’s level. (Schumann, 2014) London et al. (2006) suggested a reflexive capability conceptual model for the individual in relation to e-business is developed which relies upon merging economic and social practices through an industrial organization economic theoretical lens and social science theories of communication. Studies of the reflexive approach in the sphere of market interaction of business entities are developing particularly actively. The researches deal with models of reflexive control of consumer demand, formation of supply chain and dealer network, influence on competitor behavior, seller-buyer interaction during business transaction. Hartmann et al. (2008) used the principles of reflexive control in modeling passive and active social interactions in marketing. Bettany and Woodruffe-Burton (2009) proposed a structured approach to the possibilities of critical reflexive practice in marketing and consumer research. (Shemayev, 2017) …model behavior of individuals in groups. It is possible to predict choices which are likely to be made by each individual in the group in order to cause this individual to make certain choices. Therefore making it possible to control the individuals in the groups by guiding their behavior by means of the corresponding influence. (Tarasenko, 2010, 1) The math behind RGT is based on Boolean Algebra and Set Theory. Though some have questioned whether the math itself is flawed in RC and thus never truly workable, we will follow the Soviet lead and analyze RGT from a Boolean perspective, as is the practice throughout the world’s military and intelligence fields. It is typical in RGT to assign all members of a population (individual humans or robotic autonomous agents) a unique ID which is then represented on a fully connected directed graph, where each node is defined as either in ‘Alliance’ or in ‘Conflict’ with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:167:56a1ef71e505", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2520, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 168, "text": "the math itself is flawed in RC and thus never truly workable, we will follow the Soviet lead and analyze RGT from a Boolean perspective, as is the practice throughout the world’s military and intelligence fields. It is typical in RGT to assign all members of a population (individual humans or robotic autonomous agents) a unique ID which is then represented on a fully connected directed graph, where each node is defined as either in ‘Alliance’ or in ‘Conflict’ with each other node on the graph. It is noted that mathematically conflicts are disjunction (summation) and Alliance is conjunction (multiplication), whereas the influences on a subject are held in a matrix. If a node views another node as a conflict, though the other node views them as ‘alliance’ the disjunction indicates a conflict relationship, which would always suggest a higher level of ‘conflict’ relationships. RGT employs the fundamental principles of hierarchical organization on individuals and groups. To be able to control an entity in the RGT you put them in a group, and then try to influence the target by other group members and adversaries. The goal of the subjects in the groups is to choose the alternative from the set of alternatives under consideration through what is known as the Decision Equation. If one is not able to influence the target’s Decision Equation the result is to put the target into a frustration state. Although many targets or subjects are easy to influence, there are some individuals and groups that are not. These are referred to as “Super Active Groups” (Tarasenko, 2010, 15), which would be outliers to the RC theory. When confronted with the inability to influence the subject’s Decision Equation the alternative is to put the target into a ‘frustration state’ – neither a position of safety or of adverse influence. Inverse [Reverse] Task (Turning): a task to find all the simultaneous (or joint) influences of all the subjects together on the subject of interest that result in choice of a particular alternative or subset of alternatives. We call the subject of interest a controlled subject. [Target abandons own will and submits to the will of the influencing objects giving a win to the Controller; in normative robotics this would result in a successful trajectory or path being achieved.] Novikov discusses creating two principals (red/blue or alliance/conflict in our discussion) that set up agents that control the game and make decisions based on RC rules, including the use of ‘phantoms’ – fake agents – for various reasons like manipulation and disinformation. The winner in the contested space or game will be the one that controls the ‘information equilibrium’ the best. In this case he discusses controlling economics in a game. From the game-theoretic viewpoint, the control problem of an ecological-economic system whose elements can demonstrate a purposeful behavior consists in the following.

From the game-theoretic viewpoint, the control problem of an ecological-economic system whose elements can demonstrate a purposeful behavior consists in the following. A control subject (a Principal) has to design a game of controlled subjects (agents) with some rules so that its outcome appears most beneficial to the former. Therefore, a necessary step of such control problems concerns game-theoretic analysis allowing a Principal to forecast the response of a controlled system to certain control actions. Reflexive games represent a method of game-theoretic modeling with due consideration of agents’ complex awareness (particularly, their mutual awareness). Nowadays, reflexive games have found wide application in the description of awareness, joint decision-making of agents and solution of associated informational control problems (control of agents’ awareness structures) in different fields, namely, corporate management, economics, marketing, political science, etc. Agents’ awareness in a reflexive game is defined by a structure comprising their beliefs about essential parameters of a current situation and the beliefs of their opponents (other agents). The solution of a reflexive game is an informational equilibrium, viz., a set of actions chosen by real and phantom agents (the ones existing in the minds of real agents), where each agent maximizes a goal function based on its awareness. (Novikov, 2015, 1) • a set of gradually or purposefully sent information about their troops (with a certain amount of misinformation, of course!) • information about the number, condition, staffing level, moral and psychological state (!), etc. enemy troops. • emotional reactions to actions and other aspects of the response of opponents to the information received. • intelligence information about plans that have complex informational value, emotional, etc. nature, and specific formalized and documented managerial decisions of the enemy (combat orders, decisions on military actions, etc.). In such a representation of the concept of “information package,” it appears not entirely “informational,” but is also filled with emotional and management content. Thus, we believe the concept of “reflexive game” as a mutual attempt to reflexive control of the conflicting parties. In this case, the problem arises of postulating a new term denoting confrontation carried out without the involvement of conventional weapons, directly and destructively affecting a person and military equipment. The specificity of this type of struggle lies in the indirect impact on the military man and equipment in order to organize obstacles to the adequate perception of information and the adoption of correct management decisions. This type of struggle is carried out at the level of human thinking (which, although it operates with information, is regulated and determined by a large number of non-informational", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:169:6afe39a818e0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2522, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 170, "text": "without the involvement of conventional weapons, directly and destructively affecting a person and military equipment.

This type of struggle is carried out at the level of human thinking (which, although it operates with information, is regulated and determined by a large number of non-informational factors), which is the basis of our actions and deeds. As a clarification and addition to the concept of “information confrontation” within the framework of its most effective methodological base – the theory of reflexive games – and in the context of a broader vision of indirectly influencing the enemy and causing damage to the adequacy of his thinking process, we propose to use the term “reflexive confrontation.” By reflexive confrontation, we mean the rivalry of the opposing sides for the superiority of the implemented means and methods of reflexive control. In this context of the proposed definition, the concepts of reflexive confrontation and reflexive play turn out to be synonymous. At the same time, the use of the factor of reflexive confrontation is justified for the analysis of military-applied problems, since it focuses on the exclusively hostile nature of the social interaction of combat systems. Let us suppose now that rational agents are our enemies. They do not wish to help us to reach the equilibrium of our goal functions by means of an interchange. In every possible way they hinder us from having the usual interchange with other players (for example, they use dumping practices so that we will go bankrupt). In this case the Nash equilibrium cannot be reached. We cannot wait for a simple mutually advantageous interchange of goods. Competitiveness complicates any strategy of reaching a maximal guaranteed payoff. We should already deal with reflexive games in order to evaluate other actors, for example, to reconstruct their goal functions, taking into account circumstances in which they can try to delude their environment concerning the original motives of their acts. The main task of reflexive games is to hide true motives and goals, not to be transparent for others, but to know everything important about them. (Schumann, 2018, 44) This concept of the ‘zero-sum’ game with either total victory or total defeat is the end state of the Game, which can become a problem when coupled with the power of Machines to run processes that will far outstrip any human mind. It could also mean that in a Reflexive Game no endgame state could be achieved due to the complexity of the interactions of the systems under study, leaving a cybernetic manager running endlessly; since no end state can ever be achieved, there is no Path to victory for an overly complex reflexive game. Schumann describes this", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:170:3074606a23e4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2523, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 171, "text": "the Game, which can become a problem when coupled with the power of Machines to run processes that will far outstrip any human mind. It could also mean that in a Reflexive Game no endgame state could be achieved due to the complexity of the interactions of the systems under study, leaving a cybernetic manager running endlessly; since no end state can ever be achieved, there is no Path to victory for an overly complex reflexive game. Schumann describes this as a reflexive paradox: If at least one agent selects a game strategy assuming a non-zero level of reflexion, then this game is called a reflexive game. Its essence consists in finding the level of reflexion n of the competitor (n>0) to move onto reflexion level n (if I have advantages at the equal level of reflexivity) or n + 1 (if I have no advantages) and to act on the basis of the given level. The task of a reflexive game is to have the opponent’s actions become transparent for us, while our actions remain obscure for the competitor. (Schumann, 2018, 47) Accordingly, the victory in a reflexive game is determined by who has managed in most cases to be in dialogues at a level of reflexion n or n + 1 while the interlocutor remained at level n . The more difficult the reflexive game, the more information we should give about ourselves to uncover all motivations and all predispositions of the interlocutor. There are too many examples of daily reflexive games. (Schumann, 2018, 47) In RGT there is an implicit understanding that there is a form of mimicry involved in the game, with many theoreticians assuming that players will play the same play as the opponent in each given situation. This is also known in Game AI as ‘shadow AI’ where a game agent mimics the attacks of the player. This is played out in solving the game according to Schumann: 1. The finite number of real and phantom agents participate in a reflexive game. 2. Equally informed agents select identical actions according to reflexion level n . 3. The rational behavior of agents consists in that each of them aspires to maximize a goal function by a choice of appropriate actions, predicting which actions other agents will choose as rational agents from the point of view of knowledge of reflexion level n about other agents. In case a reflexive game is carried out between agents belonging to the same organization (corporation, company, institute), success in a reflexive game can be reached by a purposeful modification of some components [structures, ‘change the group’] of a controlled system. Such a modification for the guaranteed victory in a reflexive game is called reflexive management. The task of reflexive management is formulated as follows: a controlling organ creates a knowledge structure of agents in a way such that a performative", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:171:e3c192c0a95e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2524, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 172, "text": "case a reflexive game is carried out between agents belonging to the same organization (corporation, company, institute), success in a reflexive game can be reached by a purposeful modification of some components [structures, ‘change the group’] of a controlled system.

The task of reflexive management is formulated as follows: a controlling organ creates a knowledge structure of agents in a way such that a performative equilibrium satisfies the centre’s goals (maximally favourable for this centre.) Management of an opponent’s decision-making can be carried out by means of suggestions to him/ her of some foundations from which (s)he could logically infer decisions favourable to us. Such a process of suggesting foundations for an opponent’s decision-making is called reflexive management. Reflexive management can be performed by means of saying false information about a state of affairs (creation of false objects), by means of suggesting an opponent’s purposes (provocations and intrigues, acts of terrorism and ideological diversions), or by means of suggesting decisions (false advice). (Schumann, 2018, 50) In an interesting point regarding structure, whether an organization should be centralized or decentralized, Schumann makes the point that decentralized organizations provide more complex reflexive games and through these games, probably through constant refinement between the different moving parts, a higher efficiency is gained because of the interactions. The system, in which there is a delegation of powers, where the decision-making process is distributed throughout the entire system of management, is more rational than the centralised system. The higher tasks of organization are divided into many more detailed tasks for which solutions specific employees are responsible. Hence, each employee (1) surely knows what action (s)he is responsible for; (2) knows what resources (s)he can use independently and in what cases (s)he can ask the manager about additional resources; (3) knows how outcomes of activity are evaluated and knows the method of reward for success. These conditions provide the system with complex reflexive games, making the system more stable performatively (Schumann, 2018, 51) Having seen how reflexive games can be applied to economic and organizational structures it is also informative to analyze how a Reflexive Game is compiled for specifically military purposes. In a prototypical military simulation using Reflexive Gaming the Russian military research community has come up with one algorithmic depiction of such a game. …any specific battle is a unique, isolated phenomenon …and is special, making this fight different from another.

The essence of such studies is in reproducing the commander’s reasoning about the degree of influence of various parameters setting and quantifying this impact. Assuming reasonable behavior [of an] adversary, it is advisable to carry out such reasoning for him and also evaluate their influence. Thus, the success in organizing a particular battle largely depends on the skill of the commander to try to side with the enemy, to analyze the course of his thoughts, to understand his possible further actions, to predict their result and thus be able to act in anticipation, outsmarting it, to form in him false ideas about the real state of affairs by using masking (maskirovka, маскировки) or demonstrating false intentions (сформировать у него ложные представления о реальном положении дел путем использования маскировки или демонстрирования ложных намерений ). In addition, in itself such a two-way process of analysis can provide additional information for thought about the best option for their actions in a combat, continuously changing situation. For a formal description of this type of mental activity of commanders of the opposing sides, the closest in fact is the apparatus of the theory reflexive control (hereinafter – TRU) рефлексивного управления (далее – ТРУ). As a rule, reflexive control means the use of results imitating reasoning for the opposing side in the course of making your own decisions and the impact on the process of making its (the opposing party’s) decisions by forming in her the necessary (as a rule, false about us) idea of setting. The solution obtained in this way can be used for repeatedly imitating the reasoning of the enemy, taking into account the fact that this decision to one degree or another the enemy knows. In this regard, the concept of the rank of reflection is introduced. (Rulko, 2017) The purpose is to plan for battle, as well as play out possible scenarios for RC. However, without quantitative tools to measure the effectiveness of such influence one could be left in the lurch and deceiving oneself about the adequacy of the models used for behavioral modification of a target.

However, until now since then there was no possibility of a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of such an influence, which is essentially the basis for the reflexive control of the enemy. In this sense, the application of the SM developed by us is of interest. In [4], it is shown that the maximum appropriate rank of the reflexive management, which today should be considered when making decisions, is equal to two. When the chain of reflexive reasoning that needs to be reproduced looks like: “Determine what the enemy thinks about my behavior, based on this make a decision for him, then on the basis of the information received to make his own decision. “Quantitative accounting for higher ranks of reflection is a formalization “Significant tricks.” He is fraught with the danger of “outsmarting himself” and today it is difficult to implement, since it will require much more complex and accurate predictive models of simulated processes and highly adequate models “Intellectual abilities” of specific decision-makers (commanders of warring parties). And there are no such models yet. Moreover, on a tactical level of decision-making, as a rule, there is no information on the enemy commander, necessary for modeling his mental activity. It is interesting to note that Rulko et al put the limit of nested reflexive processes at 2 levels and that quantitative accounting for higher reflection levels would need ‘significant tricks’ and the operator of such tricks is in danger of ‘outsmarting himself.’ The system that Rulko et al came up with to simulate these rounds uses the standard Red vs. Blue architecture. Consider an example of choosing behavior alternatives by Red and Blue using simulation of the process of their confrontation on the developed SM. Let, according to the results of battle planning, the Reds (we) have three ( $\\overset { \\cdot } { n }$ = 3 ) behavioral alternatives given in the form of appropriate behavior strategies (Table 1). The Reds also have some information about the Blue (enemy) and non – which probability can suggest their possible steps in the form of four alternatives (m=4) . In this case, these are alternatives; figuratively speaking, a phantom agent, existing in the minds of the Reds. It is obvious that the degree of their identity with the real behavior is determined by the degree to which the Reds are aware of their opponent. For a specific solution of one side with the chosen option behavior, another simulation system", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:174:2b9f2c824c34", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2527, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 175, "text": "Blue (enemy) and non – which probability can suggest their possible steps in the form of four alternatives (m=4) .

It is obvious that the degree of their identity with the real behavior is determined by the degree to which the Reds are aware of their opponent. For a specific solution of one side with the chosen option behavior, another simulation system allows you to obtain values by selected indicators of the effectiveness of each side of its combat mission: losses at a given moment in time, the line reached by one of the parties at that moment in time, time of holding the boundary, etc. Given that there can be many such possible behaviors, for their comparative assessment, we introduce an indicator characterizing the effectiveness of actions by one side for a given variant of behavior of the other ρx ∈ [ − 1; 1] and obtained by simulation results. Here, the index x defines the affiliation of the party, relative to which the indicator is calculated: ρC for the Blue side and ρ К – for the Red ones. It is interesting to see how the concepts of RGT can be employed in combat. The boolean red and blue games could also be extended into other areas as previously noted, such as geopolitics, which of course we did portray during the cold war as Blue vs. Red. It is interesting to note that in this game of Rulko et al, Blue is attacking and Red is defending; again we see the Russian psychology of being on the defense against the West. n the previous section we have delved into the basics of Reflexive Control and Reflexive Game Theory. The Iresearch that was done in the 1960s and into the 2000s was conducted by one generation which has given way to a new generation, with such authors as Tarasenko and Shemayev extending the work of Lefebvre, and Novikov he initial ideas regarding the use of cognition were written about by Chotikul in the US in 1986. According to Vasara, RC could be used to exert influence on the adversary’s activities, and it could be applied if the adversary’s cognitive map was thoroughly understood. In this case, objective observations of the situation made by the adversary could be modified without the adversary noticing anything. To achieve the situation described above, the attention should be on psychological aspects and subjective factors characteristic of the adversary. (Chotikul, 1986, p. 79).

Volodymyr Shemayev is head of the Department of Economics and Finance of the National Defense Academy of Ukraine, Kyiv. His scientific interests include Reflexive Control, Information Security, Defense Planning and Budgeting, and Ukraine’s Integration to NATO. Shemayev writes: Another approach to modeling socio-economic systems is cognitive modeling. Cognitive modeling based on fuzzy cognitive maps is considered to be one of the best ways to formalize control processes in social-political and economic systems. Such a mathematical model allows both to analyze the situation in-system and to synthesize a control strategy. (Shemayev, 2007) This synthesis of RC and Cognitive Mapping is more like western attempts at behavioral influencing which are covered in a separate chapter. However, it is interesting to compare the procedures of Shemayev compared to what is mentioned by Dr. John Norseen regarding the Inverse, sometimes also referred to as Reverse, and Direct Tasks, sometimes referred to as Forward, of Reflexive Control. Here Shemayev defines the synthesized Forward and Inverse Task: Direct and reverse tasks are used for cognitive analysis and reflexive control of situation development. Shemayev and Taran proposed a new method that bridges the gap between the two approaches to finding a solution when conflict situations occur. The authors propose to make a system of representations of each conflict party in the form of fuzzy cognitive maps. The task of reflexive management is to create such representation about a situation for one of the parts that will make the other part benefit. Other more recent work in RC in Russia is that of D. Novikov, head of the Institute of Control Sciences & Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who has looked into the issue of mass-influencing mobs. Novikov works on the mathematical modeling of mob control. This can be traced back to earlier work in 1978 by Granovetter and his own work from at least 2008. Mathematical models of Mobs are of two types: 1. Models of Teams: joint adaptive decision-making by groups of people using information about uncertain factors, which is not considered by Novikov. 2. Conformity Threshold Collective Behavior (Granovetter 1978): the decision of a given agent depends on the proportion or number of other agents making a corresponding decision (particularly, mob behavior); which is considered in the work of Novikov here. ‘Control of agents’ motion (goal achievement, collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance, formation control, etc.). This direction of group control demonstrates intensive development since the early 2000s, embracing two broad fields of research, namely, analytical and simulation (agent-based) models. …A separate aspect concerns choosing a set of physical influence measures", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:176:0788e7610f23", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2529, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 177, "text": "1978): the decision of a given agent depends on the proportion or number of other agents making a corresponding decision (particularly, mob behavior); which is considered in the work of Novikov here. ‘Control of agents’ motion (goal achievement, collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance, formation control, etc.). This direction of group control demonstrates intensive development since the early 2000s, embracing two broad fields of research, namely, analytical and simulation (agent-based) models. …A separate aspect concerns choosing a set of physical influence measures for a mob (prevention of jams, mass riots, and so on), which also represents a subject of many investigations. (Novikov, 2017, 5) Mobs are classified using several bases. This book proceeds from a substantial hypothesis that a mob can be united by a common object of attention (be organized in some sense), while its members-people (agents) may undertake certain actions or not. To put it tentatively, agents can be active (e.g., supporting some decision, participating in mass riots, etc.) or passive. Accordingly, mob control represents a purposeful impact (as a rule, informational influence exerted on a whole mob or separate agents for implementing their desired behavior. [74]. If the goal of control is to optimize the number or proportion of active agents, exactly this index [active, passive] forms a major control efficiency criterion. As actions of agents and communications among them are both vital for mob analysis, a mob can be treated as a special case of an active network structure (ANS). Other special cases of ANS’s are social groups, online social networks and so on. Some models developed in the book turn out applicable to wider classes of ANS’s, not only to mob control problems. In such cases, the term ANS will be used. (Novikov, 2017, 5) While making his decision, each agent demonstrates conformity behavior, taking into account the so-called social pressure as the observed or predicted behavior of the environment: if a definite number (or proportion) of his ‘neighbors’ [KNN clustering?] are active, then this agent chooses activity. The minimum number (or proportion) of neighbors that ‘excites’ a given agent is called his threshold. Note there also exist models of anti-conformity behavior and ‘mixture’ of conformity and anti-conformity [26]. (Novikov, 2017, 7) If the relationship between the equilibrium state of a system (a social network, a mob) and the threshold distribution function is known, one can pose threshold control problems, e.e., find an appropriate control action modifying agents’ threshold so that the system reaches a desired equilibrium.

According to the former approach, the structure of relations in a network is averaged, and agents’ behavior is studied “in the mean.” The latter approach takes into account the structural features of the influence graph of agents and their individual decision-making principles. The first and second approaches are compared using the threshold model of collective behavior with a common relative threshold. (Novikov, 2017, 10) The models of agent’s opinions dynamics in ANSs involve a single characteristic of each agent– his opinion– and the rest parameters reflect the interaction of agents. The so-called behavioral models of ANSs are richer: in addition to ‘internal’ parameters, the incorporate variables describing agent’s behavior (his decisions). Generally, these decisions depend on the internal parameters of an agent (his opinions, individual characteristics) and, maybe, on the opinions and/or actions of other agents (all agents, neighbors or some group of agents). As an example of behavioral models, we choose the threshold model (the general game theoretic modeling approaches to collective threshold behavior were outlined in the publications. (Novikov, 2017, 15) The relations among agents in a real SN can be reflected by a directed graph G. The direction of an edge from one agent (node) to another shows the former’s influence on the latter. The micro-models address explicitly the influence graph, whereas the macro-models operate its macro-characteristic, i.e., the distribution M(.) of a number of neighbors (Novikov, 2017, 20) For instance, in Facebook an agent has connections to his friends, which can be interpreted as the influence relations of these friends on the agent. In LiveJournal and Twitter, directed influence relations are agent’s subscriptions for viewing and commenting information posted by other agents. We will believe that all agents influencing a given agent in a network are his neighbors, see expression (1).

In other words, the sequence of sets Q₀ ⊆ Q₁ ⊆ ⋯ ⊆ Q_(n − 1) ⊆ Q_(n) is assumed to have no coinciding elements.This implies that each consequent set differs from the previous one (at least) bya single element. On the other hand, the sequence has n + 1 sets, but there are n totally.We have arrived at a contradiction. Let x^(*)(T, Θ) specify the CBE. And so,all agents belonging to the set Q_(q(τ, Θ)) are active.However,according to formulas (1)-(2), this choice matches their best responses.All agents in the set N ∖ 𝒬_(𝔮(T, Θ)) turn out passive.Byvirtueof (2)-(3)，theseagentssatify ∑_(j ∈ 𝒬_(q(T̄, θ)))t_(ij) < θ_(i) $i \\in { \\cal N } \\backslash { \\cal Q } _ { q ( T , \\Theta ) }$ .Then being passive is the best response (see expression (1)).Hence, for all i we obtain x_(i) = BR_(i)(x_( − i)) ，and x^(⋅)(T, Θ) represents a Nash equilibrium. Proof of Assertion 4.1 is complete. ⋅ (here and in the sequel, symbol • indicates the end of a proof, example, etc.). We underline that the above CBE definition possesses constructive character,as its evaluation based on (2)-(4) seems easy.Moreover,a reader should observe an important fact: without agents having zero thresholds,passivity of all agents makes up the CBE.In the sense of control, this means that most attention should be paid to the so-called “ringleaders,” i.e., agents deciding “to be active” even when the rest remain passive.l influence of agent j Î N on the rest agents.

Some examples of the mathematical models considered by Novikov also includes Reflexive Control along with Reflexive Game models of competing Principals usually expressed by a bi-matrix in the considerations. An example of RC in Mob Control is where the Principal influences the beliefs of the agents about their parameters, the beliefs about beliefs. The non-cooperative Principals must control the informational equilibrium; possessing a certain awareness structure the agents choose their actions. Here, awareness would be the equivalent of an opinion (Novikov, 2017, 49). Novikov argues that the basis of altering awareness or opinions is best conducted through information control, or information warfare in military contexts. …we believe that any result achievable via a real variation of thresholds can be implemented by informational control (an appropriate modification of the agents’ beliefs about their thresholds). And so, information control for thresholds turns out equivalent to threshold control in a common sense. Apparently, the former type of control is ‘softer’ than the latter.” One property of ‘good’ informational control concerns its stability [75] when all agents observe the results they actually expected. (Novikov, 2017, 49) For instance, consider the following interpretations of potential control actions: the thresholds of a given proportion of randomly chosen agents are nullified (which matches ‘excitation’) or maximized (which matches ‘immunization,’ ie., complete in-susceptibility to social pressure). Or just believe that each agent can be excited and/or immunized with a given probability. Such transformations of agent’s threshold cause a corresponding variation in the equilibrium state of an active network structure (a social network, a mob). Another way for managing threshold behavior (not agents’ thresholds) is staff control according to the control types classification introduced in [74]. Staff control implies embedding additional agents with zero and maximum threshold (provokers and immunizers, respectively) in an ANS. In this case, the resulting equilibrium of the ANS depends on the number of embedded agents having an appropriate type. And finally, there may exist two control authorities (Principals) exerting opposite information impacts on the agents [red vs. blue sub-machines]. This situation of distributed control [43, 74] can be interpreted as informational confrontation [46, 48, 70, 72] between the Principals. Using the analysis results of the control problems for each separate Principal, one can describe their interaction in terms of game theory.” (Novikov, 2017, 51) What makes Mob Control Game theoretic is the situation with non-cooperative Principals gaming the agents to influence them to achieve the Principals’ goal state.

A look at Novikov’s models for Game theoretic considerations is very illuminating in understanding issues in cybersecurity dealing with influencing of masses. Problem description: Consider a set of interconnected agents having mutual influence on their decision-making. Variations in the states of some agents at an initial step accordingly modify the state of other agents. The nature and character of such dynamics depend on the practical interpretation of a corresponding network. Among possible interpretations, we mention the propagation of excitation in biological networks (e.g., neural networks) or in economic networks [49, 54], failure modes (in the general case, structural dynamics models) in information and control systems and complex engineering systems, models of innovation diffusion [controlling scientific consensus], information security models, penetration/infection models, consensus models and others, see an overview in [48]. (Novikov, 2017, 72) the control problem of the purposeful ‘excitation’ of a network is to find a set of agents for applying an initial control action so that the network reaches a required state. This abstract statement covers informational control in social networks [8, 48], collective threshold behavior control, etc. (Novikov, 2017, 72) “Using relationship (4) between the final opinion of the agents and the control actions, one can suggest a game-theoretic interaction model of the agents performing these actions. To this end, it is necessary to define their goal functions. Suppose that the goal functions of the first and second agents… are calculated as the difference between their ‘income’ that depends on the final opinion of the agents and the control costs. “ (Novikov, 2017, 112) Choose the zero opinions of the agents (X⁰=0) ）as the“status quo.” Suppose that the first player is interested in final opinion maximization H_(F)(X) = X) ,whereas the second player seeks to minimize it (H_(F)(X) = − X) .Both players have identical “control resources” U = V = [d, D] d < − 1 ≤ 1 < D) and identical cost functions $\\dot { \\mathit { c } } _ { F } ( \\mathit { u } ) = \\mathit { u } ^ { 2 } / 2$ c_(s)(ν) = ν²/2 which leads to the stable implementation of the Pareto point The same result can be achieved using the penalty strategy in repeated games.

According to condition (8), the“contracl equilibrium”is implementable if the impact levels of the first and second players differ slightly.Fig.22 demonstrates the hatched domain OAB that satisfies condition (8）with d = − 1 and D = 1 Consider the goal finctions that differ from the ones explored in the previous subsection in the cost functions of the players: c_(P)(ι/) = ιr²/(2 q_(P)) and c_(S)(ν) = ν²/(2 q_(S)) where q_(F) = 1 and denote the“efficiency levels”of theplayers.By assumption.each player knows his efficiency level.the first player believes that the common knowledge is q_(S) = 1 while the second player knows this fact and the real efficiency of the first player. The described reflexive game [75] has the graph 2112 Accordingto expression(11), the firstplayerchooses $u ^ { * } = \\frac { r _ { F } - 2 r _ { F } ( r _ { S } ) ^ { 2 } } { 4 ( r _ { F } ) ^ { 2 } + 2 ( r _ { S } ) ^ { 2 } + 1 }$ .Consequently, the second agent selects his best response $\\nu ^ { * } = \\frac { 0 . 5 r _ { s } ( 1 + 2 ( r _ { F } ) ^ { 2 } ) ( 1 + 2 ( r _ { s } ) ^ { 2 } ) } { ( 1 + ( r _ { s } ) ^ { 2 } ) ( 4 ( r _ { F } ) ^ { 2 } + 2 ( r _ { s } ) ^ { 2 } + 1 ) }$ These actions lead to the final opinion $X = \\frac { ( r _ { F } ) ^ { 2 } + ( r _ { s } ) ^ { 4 } + 0 . 5 ( r _ { s } ) ^ { 2 } } { ( 1 + ( r _ { s } ) ^ { 2 } ) ( 4 ( r _ { F } ) ^ { 2 } + 2 ( r _ { s } ) ^ { 2 } + 1 ) }$ of the ANS;in the general case,itdoesnotcoincidewiththeopinion $X ^ { 1 } = \\frac { ( r _ { F } ) ^ { 2 } + ( r _ { s } ) ^ { 2 } } { 4 ( r _ { F", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:184:dfb7928b2216", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2537, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 185, "text": "^ { 2 } ) ( 4 ( r _ { F } ) ^ { 2 } + 2 ( r _ { s } ) ^ { 2 } + 1 ) }$ of the ANS;in the general case,itdoesnotcoincidewiththeopinion $X ^ { 1 } = \\frac { ( r _ { F } ) ^ { 2 } + ( r _ { s } ) ^ { 2 } } { 4 ( r _ { F } ) ^ { 2 } + 2 ( r _ { s } ) ^ { 2 } + 1 }$ expected by the first player.This means that the resulting informational equilibrium is unstable [75]. For this reflexive game graph,the informational equilibrium enjoys stability only in two situations: (1) the belief of the first agent about the opponent’s efficiency level is true, or (2) the total reputation of the impact agents of the second player makes up zero (however,the reputation is assumed strictly positive). $H _ { S } ( X ( u , v ) ) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array} { l } { h _ { S } > 0 , X < \\hat { X } } \\\\ { \\phantom { - } 0 , X \\geq \\hat { X } } \\end{array} \\right. , \\quad c _ { F } ( u ) = u , \\quad \\mathrm { ~ a n d ~ } \\quad c _ { S } ( v ) = v , \\quad \\mathrm { ~ w i t h ~ } \\quad \\forall x \\in \\mathbb { R } ^ { 3 } .$ U = V = [d, D], d < − 1 ≤ 1 < D, h_(F) > D, and h_(ν) > |d| In a coiresponding practical interpretation, the first player is interested in the adoption of a certain decision,which requires that the opinion of the ANS members exceeds the threshold X̂ ; in contrast,the second player seeks for blocking this decision. In this section, we have analyzed a series of specific examples illustrating the applicability of game theory to the description of informational confrontation in ANS’s, both in terms of the process and result. Despite its simplicity, the stated model shows the diversity of possible game-theoretic formulations (dominant strategies’ equilibrium, Nash equilibrium, “contract equilibrium,” Stackelberg hierarchical games and hierarchical games of the type Г1, reflexive games, secure strategies’ equilibrium). Generally speaking, any specific model of informational confrontation should be developed taking into account, first, the features of an associated practical problem and, second, the identifiability of a modeled system (i.e., ANS parameters, the admissible actions of the players, as well as their preferences and awareness).

In mob control problems, the players (principals) often make decisions sequentially, Here the essential factors are the awareness of each player at the moment of decision-making and the admissible strategy sets of the players. A certain hierachical game can be ‘superstructured’ over each normal-form game [74]. Moreover, it is necessary to discriminate between two settings as followed: Novikov’s work on Mob Control mathematical modeling gives us valuable insights into influence campaigns conducted on a daily basis on such social networks as Facebook, Twitter, and others. The need for mass education on influence machines is one that should be addressed by regulators at all levels of civil oversight with appropriate international laws applied to such use of mob control and cyber influencing. It is not hard to imagine why a military power might want to be able to control mobs in enemy areas which necessarily raises issues of the Geneva Conventions and other bans on prohibited weapons, making their use a war crime, but of course proving such a case in law may be a complete impossibility which would leave competing military powers to develop their own offensive and defensive influence machines. nother contemporary scientist working in the field of Reflexive Control is Serge Tarasenko; A younger re-Asearcher, who has written articles for the Journal of Reflexive Control as well as his own independently published results of applying RC in Games, applying Emotions to Agents, and socializing mixed groups of Robots and Humans for the purposes of steering the Humans with the Robots. Earlier we encountered Tarasenko’s work in terms of Alliance/Conflict groups or otherwise known as Red vs. Blue. In this section we will be mainly going over his research regarding using Robots to train Humans using Reflexive Control. Tarasenko introduced the subject of Robots into Reflexive Game Theory in 2010. In a nod to Asimov, Tarasenko argues that the Robots should always observe the 3 Laws of Robotics. Introducing a certain assumption of moral responsibility behind the Robots actions, of course we know in a military or weaponized context these safeguards would be contradictory to using Robot agents when the goal of the Robot is to use force to stop an adversary, and hence not included in any war application. The output of the Module 1 is set D of alternatives, which robot has to choose under the given joint influences.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:186:895d69bd12e9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2539, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 187, "text": "always observe the 3 Laws of Robotics. Introducing a certain assumption of moral responsibility behind the Robots actions, of course we know in a military or weaponized context these safeguards would be contradictory to using Robot agents when the goal of the Robot is to use force to stop an adversary, and hence not included in any war application. The output of the Module 1 is set D of alternatives, which robot has to choose under the given joint influences. In the Interaction Module 1, the conjunction of sets D and U is performed: D ∩ U = DU If set DU is not empty set, this means that there are aproved alternatives among the alternatives that robot should choose in accordance with the joint influences. Therefore, robot can implement any alternative from the set DU. If set DU is empty, this means that under given joint influences robot cannot choose any approved alternative, therefore robot will choose an alternative from set U. This is how the Interaction Module 1 works. The output of the Module 3 contains sets Dh and Zh. The goal of the robot is to refrain human subjects from choosing risky alternative. This can be done by convincing human subjects to choose alternatives from the set U. First, we check whether Dh contains any approved alternative. We do so by performing conjunction of sets Dh and U: Dh ∩ U = DhU . If set DhU is not empty, then it means that it is possible to make a human subject to choose some non-risky alternative. Therefore, we should choose the corresponding reflexive control strategy from the set Zh. However, if set DhU is empty, we have to find the reflexive control strategy that will make human subject to select approved alternative from set U. For this purpose, we construct set ZU by including all the joint influences Zχ for approved alternatives: Zχ ∈ ZU ⇔ χ ∈ U. Next, we check whether set ZU is empty. If set ZU is empty this means it is impossible to convince a human subject to choose non-risky alternative. Therefore, the only option of reflexive control in this case is to put this subject into frustration state. However, if set ZU is not empty, this means that there exist at least one reflexive control strategy that results in selection of alternative from the set of the approved (non-risky) ones (Tarasenko, 2010) In computing and robotics one method suggested to increase the robot or artificial agent’s ability to work in an environment is to add emotions. Tarasenko has proposed the use of the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) model to robotics.

PAD is traced back to Mehrabian and Russell 1974 to assess environmental perception, experience and psychological responses. The three dimensions can be linked to the current ABC Model of Attitudes: pleasure, arousal and dominance can be respectively related to affective, cognitive and conative responses, ie. Affect (feeling), Cognition (thinking) and Behavior (acting) (ABC). (Mehrabian & Russell, 2014). Previous to this Kelly in 1955 came up with the Theory of Bipolar Constructs of Good (+)/Bad(−) . The propensity of turning toward good and bad is estimated by V. Lefebvre that the positive pole is chosen by 61.8% of subjects and the negative pole by 38.2% . Later in 1957 Osgood proposed the semantic differential approach which characterizes a subject’s personality as Evaluation, Activity, Potency, which Mehrabian & Russell proposed the PAD on. In Neuromarketing, the business implementation of neuro-warfare, uses the PAD model in Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) tests, emotional responses of consumers can be recorded through the SAM scale. This is a non-verbal pictorial assessment technique applicable for direct measurement of PAD associated with a person’s affective reaction to a wide variety of stimuli. In this study of Tarasenko he uses the PAD model along with Reflexive Game Theory (RGT) to emotionally color the interactions between humans and robots. The emotional research based on PAD model is transparent and clear. The models of robots exhibiting human-like emotional behavior using only PAD has been successfully illustrated in recent book by Nishida et al. Nishida, T., Jain, C. L., and Faucher, C.: Modelling Machine Emotions for Realizing Intelligence. Foundations and Application. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (2010). The ideal of mixing emotions with AI agents, Affective Computing (see Nashida), can be traced back to earlier work in the Soviet Union with Russian Pospolev’s Psychonics theory of computation in the 1960s. The basics of PAD begin with a 3-axis layout, one axis for P, A, D. These three states are the basis of the 3d binary space. Thus, any other five emotional states can be considered as disjunction (notations OR/ ∪ / + ) of these three basis vectors (emotional states). For example, emotional state Dependent ( + P, + A, − D) is disjunction of basis states Docile ( + P, − A, − D) and Anxious ( − P, + A, − D) : Docile OR Anxious = ( + P, − A, − D) ∪ ( − P, + A, − D) = {1, 0, 0} ∪ {0, 1, 0} = {1, 1, 0} = ( + P, − A, − D) ∪ ( − A, − D) + A, − D) = I Dependent. (Tarasenko, 2010b, 3-4) Docile (+P,−A,−D) is coded as {1,0,0} ;", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:188:a63fe46fcc8d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2541, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 189, "text": "Docile ( + P, − A, − D) and Anxious ( − P, + A, − D) : Docile OR Anxious = ( + P, − A, − D) ∪ ( − P, + A, − D) = {1, 0, 0} ∪ {0, 1, 0} = {1, 1, 0} = ( + P, − A, − D) ∪ ( − A, − D) + A, − D) = I Dependent. (Tarasenko, 2010b, 3-4) Docile (+P,−A,−D) is coded as {1,0,0} ; Anxious (−P,+A,−D) is coded as {0, 1, 0} ; Disdainful (−P,−A,+D) is coded as {0, 0, 1} ; Hostile (−P,+A,+D) is coded as {0, 1, 1} ; Dependent (+P,+A,−D) is coded as {1, 1, 0} ; Relaxed (+P,−A,+D) is coded as {1, 0, 1} ; Exuberant (+P,+A,+D) is coded as {1, 1, 1} ; Bored (−P,−A,−D) is coded as {0, 0, 0} . we note that PAD model provides description of how the emotional states of humans can be modeled, meaning that a certain emotional state of a particular person can be changed to the desired one. Furthermore, it is straightforward to see that the coding of the PAD emotional states and alternatives of Boolean algebra are identical. (Tarasenko, 2010b, 7) Example 1. Subjects a and b are in alliance relationship. Subject a makes influence Dependent {1,1,0} . Subject b makes influence Relaxed {1, 0, 1} . Their resultant influence will be $( { \\bf a } \\cdot { \\bf b } ) = \\{ 1 , 1 , 0 \\} \\{ 1 , 0 , 1 \\} = \\{ 1 , 0 , 0 \\}$ or Docile. Consequently, the influence of the group, including subjects in alliance with each other, on a given subject is considered as conjunction (defining compromise of all the subjects in alliance) of the influences of all the subjects’ influences. Example 2. Subjects a and b are in conflict relationship. Subject a makes influence Docile {1,0,0} . Subject b makes influence Disdainful {0, 0, 1} . Their resultant influence will be (a + b) = {1, 0, 0}{0, 0, 1} = {1, 0, 1} or Relaxed. Therefore, the influence of the group, including subjects in conflict with each other, on a given subject is considered as disjunction (defining overall influence since compromise is impossible) of the influences of all the subjects’ influences. RC is an attack on the mind of a subject, usually cognitively, through using words to alter perception. However, with PAD-RGT one can have Reflexive Emotional Control: emotional states can appear to be the subject for the reflexive control, emotions being large impactors on motivation and what actions are chosen by a given controlled subject. …we have not only illustrated how to apply RGT to the control of subject’s emotions but uncovered the entire cascade of human reflexion as a sequence of subconscious reflexion, which allows to trace emotional reflection of each reflexive", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:189:7c1f34d84676", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2542, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 190, "text": "using words to alter perception.

This provides us with unique ability to unfold the sophisticated structure of reflexive decision-making process, involving emotions. (Tarasenko, 2010b,10). According to Ekman, emotions should be regarded as highly automatics processing algorithms responsible for our everyday life survival. Being entire unconscious (automatic) regulators of the human body’s physiology, emotions bring the instantenous solutions of how to act in front of rapidly approaching possible threat. This instantenous activity is possible due to unconscious processing algorithms, which have been characterized by Lewicki et al. as highly non-linear by nature and extremely fast by performance (Tarasenko, 2010b, 11) Therefore, emotions are fast processors of information coming, apart from environment. Usually, the emotions are characterized by some physiological patterns of body activity on the one hand, and external expression by face mimic or gestures on the other hand. From this point of view, the fact that the reproduction by the self of the physical part of emotional pattern, i.e., just making an angry face can elicit the anger as emotional state itself, is scientifically a completely unexpected phenomenon. (Tarasenko, 2010b, 11). It is important to understand here that what is being said that just seeing a sad face can make one sad, or seeing an intimidating face puts one in a fear defense response. In this sense one can attempt Emotional RC on another just by frowning at them and change their emotional state; one could also control their muscles to put them into a frown, and the corollary sad emotion will be triggered as well. This kinesthetic trigger is able apply to affect a wide variety of motor actions, causing some emotional states to emerge “therefore, it is possible to control human emotions not directly, but making people perform particular actions.” (Tarasenko, 2010b, 11) From this point of view, the self-mimicking is reflexive process. Thus, it is possible to elicit and understand the emotions of others by reflexion.

Tarasenko in 2015 wrote a paper addressing the issue of Network Activity of Robots including the communications protocols he envisioned for group collaboration in Alliance and Conflict teams of mixed groups of Robots and Humans. The notion of reflexia in the psychological context was first introduced by Lefebvre in late 60s. Reflexia means projection of the external world on one’s mental state. More specifically, if a human being stands in a field of barley he/she can imagine standing in the field of barley from the 3rd person’s perspective. Thus, preserving the egocentric point of view, humans are capable of imagining their own allocentric representation. 1. Therefore, the gist of reflexia is an ability to imagine self-perception in the allocentric reference frame (external 2 point of view) operating in one’s egocentric reference frame. Reflexia is an ability to penetrate into the deeper layers of one’s psychological state. An abstract example of penetration into the deeper layers is when subject (a) can imagine another person (subject b), who is imagining subject (a), the world around and himself imagining it A. Mirror neuron system: The key concept of the Mirror Neuron System discovered by Rizzolatti and his colleagues, is that there are neurons in primate brain that activate in both cases when the primate is doing a particular action itself or observes someone else doing the same action. Therefore, mirror neuron system translates external state of another agent into the internal state of the current agent. Therefore, primates can repeat the observed action. This functionality is very close to the notion of reflexia. (Tarasenko, 2015, 1) B. Perception of Emotions – proposed based on facial recognition and emotional responses of face. The question that the paper addresses mainly is that of how to synch groups of agents, given their Alliance/Conflict value, so that they can coordinate actions in influencing humans to choose the positive pole of the Principal. Tarasenko employs Frequency Domain Multiplexing, that is each robot communicates with another via specific frequency based on alliance/conflict groups, which is also reminiscent of Kernbach’s mapping of entangled objects, each has a unique frequency. In Tarasenko’s proposal each robot has a unique ID and frequency. Spiking is a part of such a communications network; you might imagine a spike wave crossing over a group, inhibitory/excitatory (active/passive) pulses are sent through the network, each series of pulses starts 1ms after the system onset.

Pulsations are based on Resonate and Fire linear neural model proposed by Izhikevich. We present the sample dynamics of two resonate-and-fire neurons, described by system, with different eigen-frequencies ωl = π : 3/2 and ω2 = π4/3 in Fig. 4. It is illustrated that neurons with eigen-frequency ω1 spikes for the series of pulses with the same frequency and does not respond to the series of pulses with frequency ω2 . The same is true for the second neurons regarding shift in roles of frequencies ω1 and ω2 . Thus, we have described the mechanism of frequency selectivity. This can be used to enable multiple neurons to talk to each other via the same medium by means of Frequency Domain Multiplexing. However, the linear model has other important properties. The inhibitory pulses can also cause resonate-and-fire neurons to spike, if the inhibitory pulses are applied with the eigenfrequency of the neuron. However, it is not the final feature of this model. It is possible to make the neuron fire with series of pulses of different magnitudes. For example, let the magnitudes of the first, second and third pulses be 0.1, 0.4 and 0.6, respectively. The same result will occur for the inhibitory pulses (Fig. 7). Since the neurons are selective to a certain frequency, it is possible to transfer signals of several frequencies through the same communication channel.

Thus, each unit can make both it’s own choice and also predict the possible choices of other members of the group. The Reflexive Game Theory (RGT) [1, 2] allows to predict choices of subjects in the group. To do so, the information about a group structure and mutual influences between subjects is needed. Formulation and development of RGT was possible due to fundamental psychological research in the field of reflexion, which had been conducted by Vladimir Lefebvre [3]. The group structure means the set of pair-wise relationships between subjects in the group. These relationships can be either of alliance or conflict type. The mutual influences are formulated in terms of elements of Boolean algebra, which is built upon the set of universal actions. The elements of Boolean algebra represent all possible choices. The mutual influences are presented in the form of Influence matrix. (Tarasenko, 2012) 1. formalize choices in terms of elements of Boolean Algebra of alternatives 2. presentation of a group in the form of a fully connected graph of alliance and conflict 3. if graph is decomposable: then it is polynomial: alliance is a conjunction operation; conflict is disjunctive operation 4.

The influences, which subjects make on each other, could be considered as a result of a decision-making session previous to ultimate decision making (final session). We will call the influences, obtained as a result of a previous session(s), set-up influences. The set-up influences are intermediate result of the overall decision-making process. The term setup influences is related to the influences which are used during the final session, only.

(Tarasenko, 2012) “…using the 2 stage decision making is possible to make one’s opponents choose one’s point of view.” (Tarasenko, 2012, 5). How does one get this done, in this study Tarasenko offers up the exclusion or changing the structure of a group by node removal from the connected graph of an opposing viewpoint to the Principal seeking to push through their agenda in a decision-making group. In decision making there are consecutive decisions, decisions regarding a single parameter, a secondary process is ‘parallel decision’ with distinct parameters. When you play dodge ball and you are dodging, ducking, diving and dodging, you are playing a game that two examples of changing structure to your benefit, first excluding a member from a decision from Tarasenko 2012 and second, Reflexive Emotional Control to alter the opinions of a member of a group from Tarasenko 2010. Now we consider the two-stage model in more details. In the considered example, during the preliminary session only the decision regarding the influences has been under consideration. In general cases, however, before the final session has begun, decisions can be made regarding any parameters of the final session. Such parameters include but are not limit to: We call the decision regarding a single parameter a consecutive decision, and decisions regarding distinct parameters to be parallel decisions. Therefore, during the first stage (before the final session) it is possible to make multiple decisions regarding various parameters of the final session. These decisions could be both parallel and consecutive ones. We call such a model of decision making a multi-stage process of decision making (Fig.3). Next, we consider the realization of multi-stage decision making with RGT. Example 2: Change a group structure. Considering the subject from Example 1, we analyze the case when a director wants to exclude the 3rd advisor from the group, which will make the final decision. In such a case, there is a single action (1) to exclude subject (d) from the group. Then Boolean algebra of alternatives includes only two elements: 1 and 0. Furthermore, it is enough that the director simply raise a question to exclude subject d from a group and make influence 1 on each subject: if = 1 , then a = 1 , b = 1 and $\\dot { \\mathrm { d } } = 1$ (Table 2). Thus, the decision to exclude subject d from the group would be made automatically (Fig.4). Example 3: Realization of multi-stage decision making.

Thus, the decision to exclude subject d from the group would be made automatically (Fig.4). Example 3: Realization of multi-stage decision making. Let the first decision discussed during the first stage be a decision regarding influences (points of view). The next decision was about exclusion of a subject d from the group. Thus, during the first step the formation (setting-up) of points of view has been implemented, then the structure of the group was changed. Therefore, the group which should make a final decision is described by polynomial ab + c. . The decision equations and their solutions are presented in Table 4. The overall multi-stage decision-making process is presented in Fig.5. Such proccess is introduced in Fig. During the lst stage (first step),the points of view of subjocts have been forined. On the 2nd stage (socond step), the docision to cxclude subject d from a group has been made.Finally, during the Srd stago thc final docision regarding the Inarketing stralegy has bocn inade. It is assumcd that cach subject is in a particular uniquo cmotional state. Let director will be in Exuborant emotional state. The advisors ^(α) ^(b) and c are in Relaxed ({1, 0, 1}) ,Docile ({1, 0, 0}) and Anqioua ({0, 1, 0}) cmotional states, respoctevely.

We have shown how the rofloxive omotional control can besucossfully implomonted by moans of the Reflexive Gamo Theory. In the preceding we have traced out the history of cybernetics and it’s relationship to psychotronics or neuroweapons. We have also seen how cybernetics is combined with Reflexive Control and even the addition of robots into the RC cycle. The main point is that scientists have worked out how to control not just individuals but entire groups within society. In the hands of a benevolent agent there is good to be found in such influence, say a weather disaster and you need to influence people to safety, on the other hand we can see how in the wrong hands such mathematical precision combined with AI could lead to societies spinning out of control in a neurowar based in the information space, leading to alteration of the brain’s neurons themselves.

However, this is not mandatory for psi or faster-than-light propulsion. The question of Gravity is a central question to Einstein’s equations, yet missing from GR is the explanation of Quantum Gravity. This remains an open question in Quantum Physics. Below we will review one possible explanation of Quantum Gravity in the work of German Physicist Burkhard Heim. It is important to realize that what we know of Gravity is still very much an open investigation with no firmly established principles or any quantifiable explanation for how Quantum Gravity works. In regard to explanations for Quantum Gravity we will also encounter the founder of Quantum Field Theory, Pascual Jordan, who as a Nazi scientist worked extensively on Gravity and Quantum Biology. The conception in many conspiracy theory explanations of Neuroweapons is that cell towers are the methodology for such propagation. Though it is true that potentially microwaves, as used in cell towers, could be used to send out EM waves. From the documentation by proponents of this technology it becomes clear that the cell tower explanation may indeed be disinformation. In the High Frequency Gravitational Wave (HFGW) section of this chapter we will see documentation by former Lockheed Engineer, Dr. Robert Baker, to embed HFGW receivers and transmitters in cell phones; thus making the need for any cell towers obsolete and unnecessary. However, it is still a valid concern regarding the 25^(th) Frame effect in inducing deeper trance states which can be manipulated through gravitational waves and their conversion into EM radiation to affect brain function through video screens, not reliant on cell towers, including 5G. For instance, microwaves can be blocked, yet people complaining of Neuroweapon exploitation experience this effect even in shielded environments where microwaves cannot penetrate, which points to gravitational waves which can penetrate all materials.

For instance, microwaves can be blocked, yet people complaining of Neuroweapon exploitation experience this effect even in shielded environments where microwaves cannot penetrate, which points to gravitational waves which can penetrate all materials. The question becomes where and how did Gravitational Wave technology come from and who developed it. Regarding this we would have to look at an avowed Nazi Quantum Physicist, credited as one of the founders of Quantum Mechanics, Pascual Jordan and the conscripted German soldier Burkhard Heim, who went on to propose a gravitational theory that expanded on Einstein’s General Relativity into a hyper-dimensional space where others have noted Gravitational Waves can also propagate. Before diving deeper into Jordan and Heim’s work in Nazi Germany and post-war Germany it is worthwhile to take a look at the development of these ideas as they were propagated through the post-war Soviet Union and UK-USA defense industry research. Also of note is Austrian biologist Paul Kamerrer (who based his ‘law of seriality’ on the theory that that synchronicities occur through a gravity-like field. His writings indicate a typology associated with ‘Targeted Individuals.’ He died of suicide in 1926. This technology, in the early days, was not referenced as Neuroweapons, but rather as ‘Transcommunication.’ There are several explanations for the ability of non-local communication, most of which incorporate gravity and neutrinos. Several researchers in the Soviet Union have credited the work of Pascual Jordan on gravity as the source of their gravitational wave investigations for the purposes of neurowarfare. American researchers have also noted the role of gravitation in psi or ‘transcommunication’ technology; for instance, in the Soviet Union the work of Dubrov, which calls for ‘non-local transference only in a gravitational field, which he based on the work of L.L. Vasilev” (DIA, 1975, 16-17). It is also incorporated into the work of Bunin in his creation of a signal transmitter/ receiver using GW in 1972. Dubrov credits Bunin with his knowledge of bio-gravitation. Also mentioned in Dubrov’s work is that of theoretical physicist K. Stanjukovic. We mention the work of Matvei Bronstein, Gravitational Theorist, who was killed in a Stalinist purge. The purges themselves may have been a Nazi Psyop, as they occurred in 1938, just before the war started and shortly after the ending of the Nazi-Soviet military cooperation pact, signed in 1932. Another purged researcher in Astrocosmology was Kozyerev, who did not use the term ‘gravitation’ for his explanation but seems to correlate what he called ‘time’ as ‘gravitational effects’; a theory formulated in the Siberian gulag he was sentenced to.

Again, there is a pattern of people involved in gravitational explanations being targeted by the Stalinist purges, while Jordan is working on his own Nazi technology based on the same. United States academics have cited the work of Haaken Forwald (1897-1978), who proposed in Mind, Matter and Gravitation (1969) that psi was gravity based. W. G. Roll, originally a German national, immigrated to the US and proposed that ‘psi’ field which we would now call ‘gravitational field’; he also worked with Nazi Parapsychologist Hans Bender after the war, on a physical explanation of ‘Psi.’ Bender, as noted before, also worked with Jordan and Heim, as well as Capt. Hans Roeder, post-war on a physical explanation for psi on which to base a real scientific technology. Bender is not outside American influence either, as he is noted to have worked with the DIA on ‘hauntings’ at an American base in Germany. In the DIA report that speaks of this collaboration, an American academic, Elizabeth Rauscher, was also consulted where, in the work cited in the report ‘Higher Dimensional Geometrical Models’, she also used a higher dimensional or hyper-space; in this case 8d, to explain psi. Again only gravitation could be in both 4d and hyper dimensions. Dr. Robert Baker writes, “An important point about Gravitational Waves is that they propagate in subspace or hyper dimensions beyond the 4d we inhabit” (Baker, 2017, 28). An interesting contribution to the gravitational explanation for Psi came from former DoD analyst, Lt. Col. Thomas Bearden, who worked on analyzing Soviet technology in this area, where he explains the construction of electro-gravitational waves and beams. The destructive interference of ordinary EM waves produces potential gravitational energy. Release of EM leads to bleed off of a 5d gravitational potential as EM. Bottling up of EM leads to 5d Gravitational potential, similar to Gerstenshtein Effect and Li Effects discussed in HFGW section below, as ordinary 4d gravitational force. These and other ideals are analogous to B. Heim’s explanations of Psi and gravity. Digging deeper into Soviet research, it was L. L. Vasilev who proposed the gravitational hypothesis, first formulated by Jordan. Vasilev also referenced neutrinos, another particle, like graviton, that is thought to be able to penetrate almost anything (DIA, 1975, 7-8). L. L. Vasilev was a key assistant to Bekhterev in the joint German-Soviet Brain Institute.

He also suggested that thought transmission might be connected with the laws of cybernetic systems. Vasilev also referred to the action of the neutrino particles formed during nuclear reactions. If it could be established that such particles (neutral charge), move with speed approaching C [light] and are capable of penetrating obstacles of enormous mass, are generated during the neuropsychic activity of the brain, it might conceivably be shown that these particles serve as the mechanism for telepathic transmission. (DIA, 1975, 16-7) Aleksandr P. Dubrov, in a seminal article from 1973, “Bio-gravitation and Psychotronics” noted: “By the term bio-gravitation, we designate a field energy system. The bio-gravitation field is universally convertible…it is capable of transition into any form of field and energy, therefore a unified field theory.” d. Can carry information e. Convert the energy of field into matter with weight (mass) f. Field persists in absence of source g. can transition to any form of field or energy h. Are bound up with the change of symmetry groups and with distorting of space at the sub-molecular level of biological structure (Dubrov, 1973, 313) For a variable biogravitational field, according to V. Bunin, it may be accepted that gravitational radiation is contingent on the phased oscillations or rotating of hydrogen electrons or atoms of water in H2O [see Persinger below and in Quantum Consciousness section, thixotropy] a living organism may be both a receiver/transmitter of gravitational waves, evaluating the minimum level of a receivable signal: we should mention in this connection that a number of researchers have studied gravitational radiation in respect of rotating particles. This radiation has been studied by quantum theory methods in respect to the approach of a weak gravitational field in the case of the gravitational radiation of a synchotron of a particle moving along a circle. The most interesting thing for us is this research author’s conclusion that the major part of the radiation is concentrated in a small angular region near the particles place of rotation and can thereby be directed. (Dubrov, 1973, 316) Bob Forward …. I had no real idea of how impressive he was. Mead had supported him when he looked at exotica such as anti-matter propulsion and tethers.

I found that in a 1963 paper, he talked about controlling gravity with electric and magnetic fields, something that Einstein in his recently translated papers from 1920 said the same thing. Forward looked at gyroscopes about the same time as the Russian Kosyrev also investigated such effects. (Murad, 2006) …the formation of a gravitational field, with all its attendant consequences, is also possible. In this way, theoretical calculations support our hypothesis that a biogravitational field may result from changes in the conformation of protein molecules subjective to compression, tension and deformation. (Dubrov, 1973, 316) The process by which a constant biogravitational field is formed can be hypothesized in a similar way using traditional notions. Considering that, during that change in conformation of the protein molecules from a state of random aggregation to an ordered crystalline state, not only does a phased oscillation of the atoms occur but the atoms move closer together, it is to be expected that a considerable constant Bio-Gravitational field will appear, owing to the great increase in the density at micro level, of the biostructures. Aleksandr P Dubrov, a Moscow physicist, has proposed a model for paranormal perception based on a gravity-type interaction. In this concept, he considers it theoretically possible for aggregates of biological molecules that are in a loosely bound state (liquid crystal type) to create very weak quasi-gravitational field effects. This would result, in his view, from variations in gravitational attraction forces arising from changes in relative molecular spacing. The net effect would be a very small gravitational-type perturbation. This would be in addition to normal gravitational attraction and gravitational perturbations which are theoretically possible from thermal oscillations. (DoD, 1978) In psychology, new light will be thrown on one of nature’s greatest secrets, the workings of the brain. A better understanding of mental processes, the brains integrating activity, the coding of information and partcular states of consciousness can be achieved only with the aid of the bioGravitational hypothesis. (see V. Pushkin psychological biogravitational hypothesis ‘Autogravitaija (Autogravitation).’ in Socialisticeshajaindustrija Moscow 9 Sept 1973) From Dr. Dubrov’s work we can see the direction and correlation with actual inventions in the form of Bunin’s Gravitational Signal Transmitter (1972), as well as the tendency to associate gravity with influencing the Brain. The subsequent publication in 1973 of Dubrov’s paper shows that at least as early as the 1970s the Soviets were working on weaponized versions of Gravitational based technology for the purpose of remote influencing.

One of the most important North American researchers in the role of gravitation, electro-magnetism and mi-crowave radiation in remote sensing was Dr. Michael Persinger (d. 2019), who as the son of a Naval Intelligence officer and also research collaborator, got interested in the idea of EM waves and remote sensing at an early stage, a subject that has occupied his entire career. He is known to neuroweapons developers as evidenced in the writings of Lockheed engineer, Dr. John Norseen. As a professor at Laurentian University in Canada, he had an experimental lab set up that could look into these areas with some level of public financial support. His experiments are, as we should expect with plausible deniability, doubted, controversial and often on the receiving end of extreme emotional counter arguments for such a quantized scientific experimentation that he employed in his understanding of the physics behind entanglement (he calls ‘deep correlation’), brain physiology, brain microtubules, Schumann Resonance, and other areas, all of which are directly related to technologies outlined and documented in Neuroweapons development. …the theory developed by Hu and Wu (2006a, b; 2013) that the primary source of the macroscopic manifestation of quantum entanglement originates from primordial spin processes in non-spatial and non-temporal pre-space-time and involves gravity. When one considers the measurement by Fickler et al (2013) that single photons (even though they differ by 600 in quantum number as long as they exhibit quantized orbital angular momentum from helical wave structures) can exhibit excess correlation, then the potential for remote sensing become feasible. (Persinger, 2015, 660) Measurements have shown an inverse association between natural electromagnetic intensities and irradiance from background photons. In general for every ∼ 10^( − 12)W ⋅ m^( − 2) increase in photon radiant flux density there was a 1 nT decrease in intensity of the ambient static (geo-)magnetic field. Dimensional equivalence of the two quantities required the latter to be multiplied by ∼ 10^( − 3)A ⋅ s^( − 1) . Assuming ∼ 10⁷⁹ particles universally, each with a unit charge, the rest mass of that particle would be ∼ 10^( − 65)kg or the median solution for the graviton. On the bases of the calculations and conceptual inferences, entanglement phenomena across the space-time that defines the universe could be mediated by a gravitational field whose quantized component, the mass of a graviton, when expressed as the square of the hypothetical entanglement velocity, is light. This velocity (10²³m⋅s⋅1) ) is derivable from independent approaches that require", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:203:ece1c59980da", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2556, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 204, "text": "each with a unit charge, the rest mass of that particle would be ∼ 10^( − 65)kg or the median solution for the graviton.

This velocity (10²³m⋅s⋅1) ) is derivable from independent approaches that require the consideration of the universe as a single set. If this inference derived from empirical measurements is valid, then there is additional evidence that “excess correlation” and entanglement of photons anywhere in the universe is mediated by quantized components of a gravitational field that is contained within the total spatial and temporal boundaries. (Persinger, 2015b) Persinger, in this same paper goes on to clarify that entanglement or deep correlation occurs in a singular universe, the view that the universe as proposed by theoretical physicists, Hu and Wu, that everything is connected, or a full graph. Persinger remarks, “the essential premise is that the physical mechanisms that serve as the substrate for entanglement reflect the properties of the entire universe as a unit within which differences in time may be less critical” (Persinger, 2015). Again, one should be aware that graviton and gravitational waves are indeed non-local, both spatially and temporally, adhering to the quantum physics definition of non-local. We can see from Persinger’s research that he directly relates ‘remote sensing’ with gravitational effects at the least. In another paper, he relates that entanglement and remote sensing are directly related: “two-photon, 3d entanglement may be capable of applied quantum communication [transcommunication]. Such quantum energy teleportation may not be limited to distance [or location: $\\bf { x } , \\bf { y } , \\bf { z } , t _ { \\mathrm { ~ \\tiny ~ . ~ } }$ ].” (Persinger, 2014). We will encounter Dr. Persinger more in the Quantum Consciousness section where we will learn about his ideas regarding neuroscience, entanglement and changing angular momentum as the means of remote sensing, which of course is common to all waves, whether EM or Gravitational. Pascual Jordan received his Habilitation (Ph. D). in 1927 at age 24 in Göttingen. After graduating he received a Rockefeller Grant to study in Copenhagen, the center of the dominant QM interpretation. In 1929 he was a professor at Rostock; he had a stuttering problem which kept him from more prestigious postings. At Rostock he became a propagandist for the Nazi cause, he later became the same for the Christian Democratic Union in West Germany. His sentiments at the time of his appointment to Rostock are characterized by Beyler: After the Nazi takeover, Jordan put his own name to similar but even more vehement opinions.

The physics professor and new NSDAP member wrote in the Rostock University student newspaper in May 1933 that ‘armed with fundamentally unlimited power…this [ongoing] transformation [of the state] levis the ‘claim of totality’ to reform incisively all domains.’ An antiliberal variation appeared in his 1935 book Physicalisches Denken in der neuen Zeit, from the same publishing house as Dutsches Volkstum. The book was, inter alia, a proclamation of the service that science and technology–above all, military technology–could offer the power-oriented modern state. The ‘technical modernization of the apparatus of government,’ he specified, occurred through the replacement of the old parliamentary forms… with authoritative and dictatorial methods.’ Elsewhere, in a report to the Reich education ministry on the 1936 Unity of Science Conference in Copenhagen, he endeavored to convince the authorities of the possible role of modern science in the struggle against ‘Bolshevism’ and the ‘materialistic camp’ in general. (Beyler, 1996, 259) An avowed fascist and racist from an early age, after having been a Protestant Fundamentalist, his scientific interests diverged from his cultural interests; on one hand he worked with such infamous Jews in Physics as Einstein, on the other hand calling for their removal from academia. In 1942 he attempted to start a Physics journal dedicated to the industrial scale development of Quantum Biology. Often Jordan’s contributions to Quantum Mechanics are minimized due to his Nazi past. During the war he ostensibly served in the meteorological service until 1944, when he received a Professorship in Berlin, worked with Berlin-Buch Brain Institute, and was employed, like Capt. Roeder, at the secret technology office of the Kriegsmarine (German Navy). After the war he eventually ended up in the 4th Reich hotbed of Hamburg where he was a professor in 1947. Pascual Jordan worked with Burkhard Heim to set up experiments, but never got funded. Pascual Jordan was also at MBB when Heim made his presentation in 1969. Pascual was also in contact with Hans Bender. Bender records in a letter to Duke University parapsychology Dr. Rhine, that he had exchanged information regarding parapsychology with Jordan in 1949 (Asprem, 2013, 410). Jordan, already in 1936 had written regarding parapsychology and quantum physics[1]. As we shall read later, he very much anticipated developments in Quantum Consciousness, thus informing the work of Dr. Norseen. “Jordan was a visionary revolutionary” (Schoer 2003, 9).

He was guided in his early work by Max Bjorn, and his papers helped solidify Heisenberg’s claims. He is considered a co-founder of Quantum Mechanics, but due to his Nazi beliefs his contributions are largely minimized, although one can see the importance of his intellectual scientific achievements in being considered as one of the founders of Quantum Mechanics. He also founded a form of mathematics known as Jordan algebras. In 1926 he worked on quantization of wave fields using Quantum Field Theory, which differs from typical Quantum Mechanics. In 1929 at a conference in Kharkov, Jordan gave a remarkable plenary talk (the conference language at that time was still German). In a way it marks the culmination of the first pioneering phase of QFT; but it also already raised some of the questions which were partially answered almost 20 years later in the second phase of development (i.e., renormalized perturbation theory, gauge theory). In his talk Jordan reviews in a very profound and at the same time simple fashion the revolutionary steps from the days of matrix mechanics to the subsequent formulation of basis-independent abstract operators (the transformation theory which he shares with Dirac) and steers then right into the presentation of the most important and characteristic of all properties which set QFT apart from QM: Locality and Causality as well as the inexorably related Vacuum Polarization. ….These statements are even more remarkable if one realizes that they come from the protagonist of field quantization only two years after this pivotal discovery. When I accidentally came across the written account of this Kharkov talk, I was almost as surprised as I was many years before when it became known that Oscar Klein (with whom Jordan collaborated in the 30s in Copenhagen) had very advanced ideas about nonabelian gauge theory (which were published in the proceedings of the 1939 Warsaw international conference). Apparently, all of the classical aspects of nonabelian gauge theories and some quantum aspects were known before the second world war. Apart from QED the postwar interest developed away from gauge theories into pion-nuclear physics. The great era of gauge theory in connection with strong interactions had to wait 3 decades. (Schoer, 2003, 8) It is interesting to note that Jordan was decades ahead of the rest of the physics community in the 1930s, an era when he is also formulating his ideals on mass scale Quantum Biology research. The modern antecedent to Jordan’s thought is contained in Loop Quantum Gravity theory.

The modern antecedent to Jordan’s thought is contained in Loop Quantum Gravity theory. According to Schoer Jordan’s expectations about QFT are now in Local Quantum Physics (LQP): …although important ideas in the exact sciences may get lost in certain situations, sooner or later they will be rediscovered and expanded.” In this sense it is in relation to the rediscovery of key concepts of QFT from 1939 that were lost during the war and not taken up again for 30 years. Noting such work at Oscar Klein, all of the classical aspects of non-abelian gauge theories and some quantum aspects were known in 1939 but lost for 30 years (Schoer 2003, 8-9). Quantum Biology these days is thought to have begun with Heisenberg, who was never a member of the Nazi Party; in actuality it was started through a synergy of ideas exchanged between Bohr and Jordan. Jordan heavily influenced Heisenberg, though they disagreed on many points, Werner Heisenberg did accept the target-theory approach. Jordan’s contribution is largely buried, suggested by scholars due to his Nazi beliefs, which also could be explained if he was continuing research as an obfuscation of hidden work. He worked with a team of Genetic Researchers at the Berlin-Buch Brain Institute. He collaborated with this group from the 1930s to the end of the war. He also sought to work with the Nazi Reich in establishing a massive industrial scale Quantum Biology research sector within the assumedly victorious Nazi Reich. In 1942 Jordan started the academic journal Physis: Betrage zur Naturwissenschaftlichen Synthese, in which he propagandized for his scientific ideas. He was working with the censorship office on this, while also being dually recruited by the Propaganda Ministry for a similar project. (Beyler 1996, 268). Dahn has written regarding this period: The second contribution, though, exemplified the way in which ideology could find its way into Physis—and into the plan for Europe-wide big science—as it was written specifically to pique the curiosity of well-positioned Nazi power brokers. Titled “Future Tasks for Quantum Biological Research,” it expanded on Jordan’s article in Deutschlands Erneuerung, outlining a detailed plan for a massive group of research institutes to investigate Jordan’s quantum biology—essentially prototyping his vision of big science. The “research center” envisioned was so costly and ambitious that “its realization would certainly presuppose the German victory as already achieved,” so it would “stand after the German victory as a symbol and representation of the unlimited means of power [Machtmittel] of the new Reich.” In charge would be a Führerinstitut, or leading institute,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:207:2f2e2fe801fe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2560, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 208, "text": "article in Deutschlands Erneuerung, outlining a detailed plan for a massive group of research institutes to investigate Jordan’s quantum biology—essentially prototyping his vision of big science.

At the end, Jordan slyly tied his proposed institute to another of the Nazis’ favorite bugbears, cancer, noting that all quantum biological research opened “new possibilities of attack against the cancer problem.” This wide spectrum of articles makes the deeper designs for Physis clear: Jordan and Meyer-Abich aimed to create a leading (and the analogy to the Führer was intended) interdisciplinary, international, scientific organ, in the vein of Nature or the German Die Naturwissenschaften, that would institutionalize Jordan’s vision of big science in the “new Europe.” Demonstrating the quality, loyalty, and military value of German science to the Nazi state, Physis was to be a vehicle through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich could pull in financial support—and protection—for their monumental plan for a Europe-wide scientific enterprise operating on an industrial scale under German leadership.” (Dahn, 2018, 82) To delineate the departments of the Quantum Biological Institute would undertake, the first volume of the journal, Physis, contained Jordan’s elaborate plan for a quantum-biological research institute. This envisioned 3 research groups: genetic research (on bacteria, yeast, fruit flies, etc.), protein research [RNA], and ‘warm-blooded [animals] research’ (Including topics such as serology [Vershuer-Butenandt experiments], immunology, oncology and mammalian genetics). Jordan was in dynamic tension with the ideological purity of the Hitler-led establishment of the Nazi Reich. He worked regularly with Jews in Quantum Mechanics and this was not viewed as true Deutsch Physics: the attempt to rid Physics of all Jewish influence. He did, though, manage to get official sponsorship from the Reich for his journal. Beyler notes: The power structure of the Nazi state, despite the propaganda touting totalitarian unity, was a ‘polycracy’ of different power blocs [Himmler: North German (Hamburg) vs. Hitler: South German/Austrian] often with ill-defined and overlapping spheres of authority and sometimes with mutually antagonistic interests. This was especially true in science policy. Here there were long-standing conflicts between authorities who pushed for instrumental efficiency [Himmler] and those whose main interest was ideological purity [Hitler] (Beyler, 1996, 250). To win support for a quantum revolution in biology, Jordan sought to reconcile organicist ends– the rejection of mechanistic theories–with physicalist means–the deployment of concepts, techniques, and metaphors derived from modern physics. Extending the quantum revolution also meant, for Jordan, seeking to link modern science and the Nazi state in mutual legitimation.

Extending the quantum revolution also meant, for Jordan, seeking to link modern science and the Nazi state in mutual legitimation. He was partially successful in finding a niche for quantum biology in the ideological and institutional structures of the Third Reich, but only partially. Just as the intended conceptual and disciplinary bases of quantum biology were marked by unresolved tensions, so too the cultural meanings Jordan ascribed to quantum biology mirrored a volatile instability in Nazi ideology and praxis; professed allegiance to ideals of volkisch social harmony alongside the unmitigated exertion of authoritarian, technocratic power. In short, in its cultural meanings the target-theoretical organism embodied the precarious situation of modernity in the Third Reich. (Beyler,1996, 248-9) On the conceptual and disciplinary levels, quantum biology combined two trends that seem prima facie to be polar opposites. Starting in 1932, Jordan published several essays on biology that he intended as contributions to the ‘organicist conception of the world’ and to the concomitant rejection of materialism [Marxist Leninism]. Responding to criticisms of these speculations, he added from 1937 onward a quite different perspective appropriated from the ‘target’ or ‘hit’ theory in biophysics. Target theory was a statistical methodology for analyzing the effect of radiation or other physical agents on organisms. It hypothesized the existence of submicroscopic ‘targets’ that were affected–that is, ‘hit’–by the impinging radiation. Through the target-theoretical connection, quantum biology would acquire experimental technologies and theoretical models from modern physics. It would also become allied with a group of dynamic and well-supported researchers. (Beyler, 1996, 249) ‘Target’ or ‘hit’ theory was first introduced in 1922 by the X-ray physicist Friedrich Dessauer, professor of the physical foundations of medicine in Frankfurt. Parallel developments started in Britain with the work of J.A. Crowther and in France with that of Fernand Holweck. The theory gained in interest following a series of dramatic discoveries that focused new attention on physical experimentation in biology and on the microscopic or submicroscopic domain. The discovery of X-ray mutagenesis by H. J. Muller in 1927 opened a new era in experimental biology. (Beyler, 1996, 253-4) Boris Rajewsky continued the work of Dessauer, who went into exile in 1934. Rajewsky headed and founded the KWI for Biophysics in 1936. Another target institution was the KWI for Genetics, the Institute for Brain Research in Berlin-Buch, founded by Oskar Vogt with a twin institute in Russia. The work in Berlin-Buch was by Russian geneticist Nikolai W. Timofeeff-Ressovsky. Target theory also influenced the founding of microbiology through phage research.

The work in Berlin-Buch was by Russian geneticist Nikolai W. Timofeeff-Ressovsky. Target theory also influenced the founding of microbiology through phage research. By 1936, [ Jordan] spoke enthusiastically of using physics in pursuit of fundamental problems of genetics, within the context of eugenics. In 1935, Timofeeff and Zimmer wrote a paper with CalTech’s German emigre Delbruck, which addressed the atomic-physical model of gene-mutation. Within the target-theoretical analysis of radiation genetics data, the paper argued that mutation was a ‘one-hit’ process, a single ionization produced by a quantum of radiation in certain receptive areas, a large organic molecule. Jordan argued that the gene was such a thing, the gene as a group of atoms. Jordan is here speaking or alluding to the concept of targeting genes with waves or radiation, a specialty of one of his collaborators, Karl Zimmer of the Brain Institute. It is important to note that the working group at Berlin-Buch that Jordan was involved with led directly to the invention of Genetic Engineering. As is well documented, the Nazi scientific community was very interested in using Genetics to target those of other Genetic compositions deemed ‘non-German.’ Beyler writes of this collaboration: Jordan’s plans for restructuring biophysical research were directly linked to his target-theoretical contacts. Their importance to him is shown by the fact that during the war years he repeatedly attempted to be transferred to Berlin from his postings in the Luftwaffe meteorological service in order to be closer to the Berlin-Buch group. Despite the resistance of his military superiors, in late 1943 he succeeded–with Heisenberg’s help–in obtaining simultaneous appointments to a professorship of physics at the University of Berlin and to a position at the Navy Research and Patent Office. He hoped to be able to pursue biophysical work more intensively and in closer collaboration with Zimmer, Rompe, and other Berlin colleagues. (Beyler, 1996, 269) Again, the Navy Research and Patent Office of the Kreigsmarine were secret facilities to develop advanced technology for use in warfare. It is not known if Jordan seeking a physical explanation for Psi, and Capt. Roeder also seeking a physical explanation for Psi converged as they served in the same institution, the Navy Research and Patent Office. It is known they circulated among die-hard supporters of the Nazi cause post-war. Roeder and Jordan, both being Hamburg based, had common connections like Nazi Parapsychologist Dr. Hans Bender; Jordan worked with Heim, who worked with Bender, who worked with Roeder. “In the noninheritance of acquired characteristics, lies the natural scientific foundations of the racial-political conceptions that have victoriously prevailed in the great revolution of our", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:210:7efb734c99c7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2563, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 211, "text": "converged as they served in the same institution, the Navy Research and Patent Office.

(Beyler,1996, 270) In a previous section we covered the work of Baron von Verschuer through Mengele, a different group working on genetics, through the Genetics section of the KWI for Anthropology headed by von Verschuer. Jordan saw science as a directed endeavor, to be used for interdiction into human natural existence to meet social demands, like the demands of the Nazi ideology. He viewed existence as teleological (designed with purpose): Jordan’s question to biology, then, became “whether organic entities, e.g., humans, can be seen as essentially macroscopic entities.” He believed he knew the answer: “Exactly such organic reactions by which the macroscopic reactions of the human or animal body are directed… are often a delicacy that reaches in the atomic domain.” Living beings, although macro-physical in size, were ‘directed’ or ‘steered’ by acausal quantum events, whose effects were then somehow amplified by organic structures. Jordan cautioned that this ‘amplifier theory’ could not by itself explain the ‘essence of the organic.’ Indeed, he thought that complete physical-chemical investigation might well destroy the ability of the steering centers to function; they might possess a kind of non-observability over and above that found in ordinary quantum physics. Despite this, the amplifier theory brought out the crucial anti-mechanistic insight that quantum effects had to be taken into account in biology. (Beyler, 1996, 261) The concept of the Amplifier theory from Quantum level of existence to macroscopic level, or the classical level of existence, is an important understanding for Jordan. Indeed, it presages ideas of Quantum Consciousness discussed later; that consciousness bubbles up from the Quantum level to the biological scale. What became, then of organic totality in the Nazi state? In the formulation of Ralf Dahrendorf, “the Nazi regime tried everywhere to replace organic structures by mechanical formations.” As we shall see, Jordan applied metaphors from quantum biology to a modern, technocratic, albeit anti-democratic society; these metaphors accorded with certain aspects of his cultural context but were hard to reconcile with the concept of holistic, organic coordination. Embodying in this way the ambiguities of modernity in the Third Reich, Jordan’s biophysical metaphors may have contained more truth then even he realized.

(Beyler, 1996, 252) In the first instance, microphysical control centers–genes, ‘miniature nuclei,’ and the like–served as metaphors for dictatorship. In 1941, in a book on the ‘secret of organic life,’ Jordan wrote that “the parliamentary-democratic idea lives no longer.” In contrast to decrepit, outmoded democracy he placed lively, modern authoritarianism. “The micro-physical steering center ruling the macrophysical cell,” he wrote, “offers perhaps the most extreme realization that the principle of authoritative leadership has received in all of nature.” Especially in the midst of war, it seemed to him that the future belonged to decisive, instrumentally efficient political structures led by a directing will of the greatest strength and rigor [emphasis added] (Beyler, 1996, 269) The stakes went beyond conceptual innovation and the reconfiguration of scientific disciplines, however. Refutation of the scientific versions of materialism would contribute, Jordan argued, to the struggle against the putative political manifestations of materialism: liberalism and Marxism. The extension of quantum ideas would stand in analogy to the extension of the power of the German imperium. The microphysical ‘controlling centers’ of the organism would symbolize the political Fuhrer and vice versa. (Beyler, 1996) From Pascual Jordan we see how science in the Nazi Reich is intended to serve the Wehrmacht (War machine, Military). Academic researchers tend to ignore his involvement in the military research done with the Kriegsmarine, or the genetics research performed with the Berlin-Buch group, among those who even bother to mention him in relation to the founding of Quantum Physics. As we can see, this type of authoritarian science also is largely devoid of any moral scruples or feedback as it is designed for one end: Killing the perceived weak. One physicist working on the issue of trans-communication or syn-thetic telepathy was Burkhard Heim. One cannot exclude that perhaps Heim had developed an intuitive ability, which focused his research, as he lived with severe hearing and visual disabilities that led him to resign from the prestigious Max Planck Institute for Physics under Wiesacker after receiving his Ph. D. in Physics from Göttingen. After the war the KWI Institutes were renamed after Max Planck. Heim was a type of misfit wunderkind with chemicals and especially thermite explosives; after a prank with small explosives he was kicked out of school at age 14. He was recruited by Göring after submitting ideas regarding a type of nuclear detonator, to the Chemical-Technical Institute of the Reich in Berlin-Tegel while serving in the Luftwaffe in Italy. He was then put in touch with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:212:ffe070d7a798", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2565, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 213, "text": "in Physics from Göttingen.

He was recruited by Göring after submitting ideas regarding a type of nuclear detonator, to the Chemical-Technical Institute of the Reich in Berlin-Tegel while serving in the Luftwaffe in Italy. He was then put in touch with Heisenberg, to work on thermite explosive devices for the Wehrmacht. As a very young man, aged only 19, he led his own team. It was his love of thermite that led to his disabilities. As he was loading a thermite explosive for testing, an air raid alarm warning, a false alarm, went off. The vibrations triggering the explosives he held in one hand, he instinctively covered his neck with his other hand, both hands were blown off, otherwise he would have been decapitated by the explosion. Luckily for Heim, the plant doctor was present on his one-day-a-week onsite duty and prevented massive blood loss, saving Heim’s life. (Ludwiger, 2001, 5-6) He received personal and financial support from Ludwig Bolkow of the aerospace and defense contractor, Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB), starting in 1958, from which he was able to hire an electrical engineer to assist with his experiments short term. The US Government was also interested in Heim, with an early review of Heim theory in the technical publications of the USAF from 1961. One would think that with such patronage as Heisenberg and von Wiezsacker that Heim’s academic credentials would be secured. Heim and his ideas regarding gravity, propulsion and transcommunication have had a steady opposition from the start. One modern example includes a former Physicist, Dr. Holm Hummler. He left science in 2001 to work for Boston financial interests, the Boston Consulting Group. He has been the owner and managing director of Uncertainty Managers Consulting GmbH in Bad Homburg, near the banking center of Frankfurt, since 2007 (Hummler, 2018). He makes a habit of specifically debunking Heim’s theory as pseudoscience and is a self-marketed ‘skeptic’, among other things he ‘debunks’ are technological conspiracy theories. So once again, we find another gravitational theoretical physicist being suppressed and again we see some connection to the same original social networks of the Boston-London-Hamburg axis of financial interests. As mentioned in the Jordan section, Jordan and Heim collaborated together. Heim and Jordan were both educated at Göttingen, both had connections with von Weizsacker, who was imprisoned in Britain for a year after the war as a member of the Nazi A-Bomb team. Jordan and Heim have extensive theories and emphasize the role of Gravity, both were seeking a physical explanation for telepathy using gravity.

It is no wonder that they would eventually collaborate. Jordan was in attendance when Heim presented his theoretical physics at a symposium for the staff of German areo-space and defense contractor Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) at Ottobrun in 1969. At that time Jordan was an advisor on Aerospace propulsion for MBB and others. It is important to remember Jordan had won a Gravity Research Foundation (GRF) award for a paper on faster than light propulsion. Jordan and Heim were to conduct an experiment on measuring gravity, but it did not receive sufficient funding at the time and the experiment was superseded by other experiments and never conducted. Like Jordan, Heim also collaborated with the former SS member and scientist Dr. Hans Bender, who scientifically investigates psi phenomenon and specifically worked with Heim on a scientific theory of ‘transcommunication.’ Many physicists have come up with hyperdimensional explanations of our physical reality, like Klein-Kaluza theory from the 1930s, the original hyper dimensional explanation. Heim too comes up with a theory based on hyper-dimensions, (6d). Ludwiger notes regarding 6d that Roger Penrose has come up with a similar concept; we will read about Penrose’s ideas on Quantum Consciousness later, where gravity plays a role in determining the final Quantum State: Incidentally, the mathematician Roger Penrose, Stephen Hawking’s teacher, has come across three real and three imaginary dimensions of the world as well. He discarded his complex C3-world, as he could not interpret the two additional imaginary dimensions physically. Should there be three time dimensions? How should they be discriminated from one another? However, if they are not time dimensions, what are they? And why can’t they be temporal dimensions? Xiaodong Chen, a student of Penrose, found that in a R6 at least the wave-particle-dualism… (Ludwiger 2013) • a unified phenomenological field theory in which electro-magnetism and gravity have been united by Heim, • a unified quantum-geometric structure theory that has led to a formula for the calculation of the masses of elementary particles, and • development of an aspectual logic by means of which both the quantitative-physical as well as the qualitative-organisational part of the world can be uniformly described. • we live in a 6-dimensional world, • elementary particles are 6-dimensional, dynamic, metric structures, • humans, too, are 6-dimensional creatures, • there wasn’t a big bang, but the universe developed from a simple space cell, • the organization in matter is governed by qualitative structures from the 5th world coordinate, an ap proach for solving the body-mind-problem, • autonomous structures of consciousness can exist free", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:214:2db6f6edce66", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2567, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 215, "text": "quantitative-physical as well as the qualitative-organisational part of the world can be uniformly described. • we live in a 6-dimensional world, • elementary particles are 6-dimensional, dynamic, metric structures, • humans, too, are 6-dimensional creatures, • there wasn’t a big bang, but the universe developed from a simple space cell, • the organization in matter is governed by qualitative structures from the 5th world coordinate, an ap proach for solving the body-mind-problem, • autonomous structures of consciousness can exist free from a material carrier. (Ludwiger, 2013) In the 1950s the main achievement for which Burkhard Heim achieved a degree of recognition was his discovery of a new propulsion concept for space flight. According to this concept, it should be possible to have a spaceship powered by specially generated gravitation fields and by conversion of electromagnetic waves… instead of chemical fuels. Heim had discovered a phenomenological explanation of gravity as well as a connection to electromagnetic fields. By analogy with Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism, he had interpreted gravity as a physical field. (Ludwiger 2013) Heim notes that, “temporally variable magnetic fields [see Ch. 9] should also be able to generate gravitation fields.” Which is significant in that it presages the ideas of ‘Gerstenshtein Effect’ by a decade, where EM is turned into Gravity and Gravity into EM. This may also be related to the findings of Dr. Persinger that variable magnetic fields are used in ‘remote sensing’ and ‘deep correlation.’ Only as of 1985 the aerospace company MBB seized on Heim’s idea, and wanted to furnish the experimental proof that rotating masses can generate magnetic fields. In a laboratory experiment the weak magnetic field generated by means of a rotating crystal ball should have been proved with a Squid magnetometer, which is a highly sensitive detection device. However, the money necessary for that device couldn’t be raised. (Ludwiger 2013) As noted before Einstein’s GR does not supply a complete answer for the role of Gravity in our Universe, and it still remains in 2023 an open question how Quantum Gravity works exactly. Heim developed a Contrabaric Equation, first formulated in 1955, which is used by other researchers in faster than light propulsion. Ludwiger notes regarding the equation: As he factored in the field mass of the gravitation field (which Einstein had neglected due to its insignificance), Heim obtained his so-called contrabaric equation. According to that equation, the transformation of electric or magnetic fields into gravitational acceleration fields and vice versa should be possible. (Ludwiger, 2013) It is interesting that in the 1950s he is already contemplating issues that would later be written on by the likes of Russian Physicist, Gerstenshtein, regarding Gravity in 1962. Yet, there is an almost total absence of knowledge of Burkhard Heim, for reasons such as his having to live in isolation due to his disabilites, and not wanting to publish in Academic journals without experimental results", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:215:cc2159b91a6b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2568, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 216, "text": "magnetic fields into gravitational acceleration fields and vice versa should be possible.

Yet, there is an almost total absence of knowledge of Burkhard Heim, for reasons such as his having to live in isolation due to his disabilites, and not wanting to publish in Academic journals without experimental results to back up his theories. Unfortunately, he did not live into the era we live in now, when Gravitational Science is taking off and taken more seriously after the confirmed discovery of Gravitational Waves in 2015. When in 1966 the well-known parapsychologist professor Hans Bender asked whether he would be willing to help him with his physical knowledge with interpreting the “tape-recorded voices,” Heim agreed. In Sweden, together with his assistant W.-D. Schott, he assessed the claims made by Mr. Jü rgenson who heard unexplainable voices on tape and on the radio, voices that seemed to address him personally. As these experiments weren’t performed scientifically correct, Heim himself did experiments in his laboratory, which, however, he only rarely talked about. He despised people who carelessly went public with undistinguished results. In 2010, the physicist Holger Klein found several hundred manuscript pages in Heim’s legacy in Northeim which had been administered by Heim’s foster daughter Ingrid Hartung until her death in the same year. Not only did these pages contain hundreds of Heim’s experiments regarding the validation of transcommunication, but also approaches for a theory of transcommunication. No mainstream physicist would ever dare to start such a kind of work. As in the 6-dimensional theory all physical field sizes are 6-dimensional, too, Heim derived a possible influx of the additional components x5 and x6 to the moduled phonetic sequence density from the 6-dimensional radiation vector that is transmitted by radio stations. He did this in such a way that in considering the required aerial properties for the trans-components of the radiation vector a modified spoken text can be received as a matter of principle. Yet, it gets weirder for Burkhard Heim, as has been indicated with other scientists, some feel that they are interacting with a superior intelligence while researching and being in a sense directed in their research, one notable example of this is the case of physicist and former CIA consultant Dr. Jack Sarfatti. Heim, while working on his Logics, was working on ‘Syntrometric Telecentrics of Maximes’, a book on formal logic, that was unpublished but presented at MBB in 1976 with Jordan present. He speaks of being in communication with an extrinsic intelligence, which of course would match the description of a Targeted Individual who hears either positive or negative feedback from ‘voices’: “As I cannot write, I dictated the derivations I did in my head to my", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:216:9eab55dbee65", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2569, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 217, "text": "CIA consultant Dr. Jack Sarfatti.

And during this, I sometimes got a very strange feeling: I couldn’t say ‘I’m dictating this’ and ‘I’m thinking this’, but ‘IT is dictating. IT’s thinking!’ It was something that apparently didn’t belong to me at all. It seemed to me as I was only repeating something that actually belonged to something completely elsewhere. That’s a weird feeling! I have never talked to anybody about this, as I said to myself, nobody would understand anyway.” (Ludwiger 2013) Sometimes – and that’s the most creative moments you can have as a human being – you have the feeling as if you’re only the tool and you say, dictate or write something that actually doesn’t originate in you. That has happened to me more than once while I was dictating these notebooks that I later further worked on in more detail. I always had the feeling that completely foreign thoughts were approaching me which only had to be recorded. But I was never able to tell where that came from. That only happened some times, strangely always in such moments where it seemed that I was at a loss. Then it happened.” (Ludwiger 2013) As can be seen from Burkhard Heim’s studies and findings the science of Trans-communication is directly related to Gravity. Later, other researchers picked up on Heim’s original theories. Droscher and Hauser have used his theories to create “Extended Heim Theory” (EHT). They even won an award, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics’ Future Flight prize, for a paper in 2010 that argues for faster than light propulsion based on this. However, it would take some x-ray generation, pulsed high power beam, to get it done as Roger Lenard of Sandia Labs has stated regarding the proposal: Although this is one way of doing new propulsion, it may or may not be the way. Without adequate funding for experimentation, we may never know if Heim Theory is accurate or inaccurate. As it has not been tested it is too early to be a protagonist or antagonist of the Heim Theory. As knowledge and interest in working with gravitational wave technology is relatively new and under-researched, since it took so long to even confirm their existence, an entirely different or unknown process may emerge from gravitational research, especially at the quantum level, that may be the real answer.

Although, it is true many supporters of UFO encounters claim that different governments in the world already have this technology, if it is gravitational based then when it exists may be completely irrelevant, with the real question, who has the capability? he question of Gravitational Waves was for a very long time a controversial topic in Physics. Many doubted they even existed, until confirmed in 2015 by LIGO. The story of the building of LIGO itself is full of ‘intrigue’, ‘disruptions’ and ‘delays.’ The controversies dealing with the detection of Gravitational Waves and general gravity theory and quantum gravity research extends to at least the 1930s, noting the execution by Stalin (a repeated pattern in dealing with the topic of Neuroweapons research in the Soviet Union) of the theoretical physicist Bronstein, then working on advanced theories regarding gravity. The controversy extends to the first claims of actual detection of GW by the American Naval Academy graduate Dr. Joseph Weber. On Jan 19, 1949 Roger W. Babson founded the Gravity Research Foundation (GRF) dedicated to the science of Gravity, a gravity-centric physics research institute. It was attacked by the scientific community, in part due to faster than light propulsion studies. Because of this villification, Babson moved on to start a new institute to study gravity, although today the GRF enjoys credibility in the scientific community. An interesting aside is that Pascual Jordan, writing on faster than light propulsion using gravity, was an award winner in the GRF’s annual competition for best Gravity-related research paper. Babson’s new Institute for Field Physics (IOFP) was headed by Dr. DeWitte in Chapel Hill, North Carolina (UNC). It started the prestigious General Relativity conferences, which began in 1957, with GR1. The first conference, titled ‘The Role of Gravitation in Physics’, drew such highly regarded physicists as Wheeler and Feynman. Another participant was Joseph Weber. One of the chief questions of this conference was whether gravitational waves can produce work, or energy. Later, it was confirmed they do. In 1960, Joseph Weber published on how to detect gravitational waves. His idea, among others such as interferometric, was to use a resonant antenna (a hollow cylinder) to detect low frequency gravitational waves. He had built two detectors separated by 950km ; one at U of Maryland and the other in Chicago at the Argonne National Laboratory. He was assisted by his students, Dr. Forward and Dr. David Zipoy.

Dr. Forward went on to play a seminal role in interferometric methods and with High Frequency Gravitational Waves. In 1969 Weber published a paper claiming to have detected Gravitational Waves. Subsequent to this, attempts at replicating his experiment proved invalid. Because others were not able to replicate his results he was viewed as a fraud by the scientific community, although later rehabilitated and honored at the 2016 ceremony announcing the confirmed existence of gravitational waves. It should be pointed out that the replication attempts were flawed in several respects and were not a genuine replication of his approach. For instance, he used a 3-ton cylinder, others only a 1.5-ton cylinder made of different materials. He placed his in a sealed vacuum, others did not. Gravitational Wave research diminished after this point, while simultaneously being investigated in secret Military Defense projects of the UK-USA and USSR. Heinz Billing, former Nazi computer engineer and physicist, worked to discredit Weber on claim of Gravitational Waves. He was involved in early attempts at building interferometry projects, all of which faced difficulties during his involvement. Also involved in discrediting Weber was an IBM scientist, Richard Garwin, noted for his highly aggressive derision of Weber’s gravity wave results, based on the claim that Weber’s computer program had a bug creating the readings. Former Nazis were not alone in discrediting Weber; also not able to replicate his results was the Soviet Physicist Braginsky. We note that Bunin’s Gravity Wave signal generator was built in 1972, so was the Soviet criticism of Weber also a form of technological obfuscation of actual military capabilities? In 1975, Heinz Billing laid plans for a Gravitational Wave detector. He was working with the Garsching Group to build an interformetric system for detection, later contacted by NSF regarding Weiss plans, see below. Billing’s project tried for 30 years but never detected GW. Apparently, noise was too costly, although the noise suppression technology developed did lead to LIGO, which did detect Gravitational Waves in 2015. Weber’s main method of detection was a cylinder; he also thought of investigating Gravitational Waves with interferometric methods, which became the basis of LIGO. In the following section we shall look at how the interferometric method for measuring Gravitational Waves came into being.

The road to LIGO began with the work of Joseph Weber, his student, Bob Forward, Dr. Weiss at MIT working with the DoD, eventually leading to other projects of the same nature such as the Billing-led Garsching Team in Germany. Interferometers are investigative tools used in many fields of science and engineering. They are called interferometers because they work by merging two or more sources of light to create an interference pattern, which can be measured and analyzed; hence ‘Interfere-o-meter’, or interferometer. The interference patterns generated by interferometers contain information about the object or phenomenon being studied. They are often used to make very small measurements that are not achievable any other way. This is why they are so powerful for detecting gravitational waves–LIGO’s interferometers are designed to measure a distance 1/10,000th the width of a proton! (LIGO, 2020) Although Joseph Weber wrote about interferometry in his notebooks, he did not publish his ideas; but he is credited by Bob Forward with coming up with the idea. The first to publish on this method were Dr. Gerstenshtein and Dr. Pustovoid in the Soviet Union. They attempted to get the Soviet government interested in supporting such a thing but were never funded. Again, in 1966, Braginsky attempted to get the Soviet interferometer going for measuring gravitational waves, but again was not supported. It is entirely possible that they had already developed a secret method for this, using superconductors like the Akimov generators, but this is speculative. In the United States Rainer Weiss was working on an Interferometer at MIT around 1968. He came up with some of his first theories on this method funded by the DoD, but the funding had to be dropped because a new law, the Mansfield Act, banned the DoD from funding college research not directly related to military purposes, which also closed down anti-gravity research at Wright Patterson AFB in 1970 (Tingley, 2019). Later, he would become pivotal in the creation of LIGO, he was awarded the 2017 Nobel prize for Physics for his work on LIGO. In California, Dr. Bob Forward at Hughes Research Labs has built a prototype of an interferometer. In 1971 Dr. Forward built the first prototype of a ‘Transducer Laser’ which became the basis of LIGO. Weiss bases his 1974 design on Dr. Forward’s.

In 1971 Dr. Forward built the first prototype of a ‘Transducer Laser’ which became the basis of LIGO. Weiss bases his 1974 design on Dr. Forward’s. In 1974, Weiss was trying to build his own prototype on requests from the National Science Foundation for a 9m prototype. NSF asked the German Max Planck Institute to review the proposal. Eventually it landed in Heinz Billing’s lap. His team, Garching Group, built a prototype on their own. The Garching Group never detected Gravitational Waves but it did develop a noise suppression system that was used on the LIGO detector. Weiss sent his assistant Dr. David Shoemaker to work with the Garching Group. In 1975 NSF funded Weiss’s detector. Weiss’s plan was to develop the detector in stages with a LIGO, a prototype and b LIGO a production detector, which did go on to detect Gravitational Waves. So, it took from 1960 to 2015 to go from ideas of detecting gravitational waves to their final authoritative confirmed finding by LIGO. This may seem like a long time to go from theory to measurement. Indeed, there have been many unforeseen delays in the detection of Gravitational Waves, from funding problems, mismanagement and intense personal conflicts; for instance LIGO was managed by Weiss and Drever, but they had intense interpersonal conflicts leading to more delays as noted by one scholar: The Caltech–MIT project was funded by NSF and named the “Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory,” known by its acronym LIGO. The project would be led by a triumvirate of Thorne, Weiss, and Drever. Soon interactions between Drever and Weiss became difficult because, besides the strenuous nature of their interaction, both had differing opinions on technical issues. During the years 1984 and 1985 the LIGO project suffered many delays due to multiple discussions between Drever and Weiss, mediated when possible by Thorne. In 1986 the NSF called for the dissolution of the triumvirate of Thorne, Drever, and Weiss. Instead, Rochus E. Vogt was appointed as a single project manager. (Czervantes-Cota, 2017) n Intelligence gathering, say, visual surveillance, a question of resolution is always an issue. The desire by agen-I cies to increase their resolution of recon satellite images is something that is always a technical challenge to be improved on. Resolution is also important in terms of Neuroweapons, or any weapon involving any basic targeting, to hit the target with the most precise accuracy is always desirable in the field of warfare.

In 1961 Dr. Robert Baker, who lived and grew up near the cornerstone of aerospace defense contractors in sunny California, a childhood friend of the Douglas family (McDonnell-Douglas) and the Grumman (Northrop-Grumman) family. He later after graduating from UCLA worked for Lockheed. It was while working for Lockheed Astrodynamics Research Center (LARC) that Dr. Baker made the first known presentation on High Frequency Gravitational Waves. According to Dr. Baker he presented his finding to Lockheed engineers, along with Weber assistant, Dr. Bob Forward, who worked at nearby Hughes Research Lab, who lectured on interferometric methods. Dr. Baker writes: The first mention of High-Frequency Gravitational Waves or HFGWs that I could determine was in a Lecture in 1961 that I had given with Dr. Robert Lull Forward at my Lockheed Astrodynamics Research Center in Bel Air, California. [Lecture given at the Lockheed Astrodynamics Research Center (LARC), 650 N. Sepulveda, Bel Air, California, USA, a few blocks from UCLA, November 16^(th) .

Attendees included LARC members Robert Rector, Professors Geza Gedeon, Kurt Forester, my secretary Joan Boyle who typed up Herrick’s notes in the Lockheed Research Report of the Lecture, plus UCLA students.] I had invited Dr. Forward over from the Hughes Research Laboratory in Malibu, California to deliver a lecture on the “Weber Bar” that he and Dr. Joseph Weber were constructing at the Hughes Lab to detect Low-Frequency Gravitational Waves ${ \\bf \\zeta } ^ { \\left( 1 6 6 0 \\ H z \\right) }$ . During the Question and Answer part of our Lecture, Bob Forward and I talked about building a Laboratory generator and detector for “High-Frequency Gravitational Waves,” having frequencies over 100kHz . As far as I know this was the first time the subject had been broached. I recall that we concluded that it could not be accomplished with the technology then available; but I suggested that such high-frequency gravitational waves, or HFGWs, would have practical applications, for example communication (the ultimate wireless system).” (Baker, 2017) As always in science the issue of who takes credit for an idea or invention is always a high prestige item for engineers. The first written paper on HFGW was by a Soviet researcher, in 1962.

The first written paper on HFGW was by a Soviet researcher, in 1962. Mikhaeil Gerstenshtein ‘Wave Resonance of Light and Gravitational Waves are HFGW’ A paper on HFGW regarding converting EM to HFGW and HFGW converting to EM. Which became known as the “Gerstenshtein Effect.” An important note regarding this is that later this effect will be misapplied in a suppression effort against another HFGW technology based on the “Li effect” in the US DoD and Intelligence Community circles JASON Reports. It was in 1964 that HFGWs were written of in relation to investigating the Big Bang. Leopold Halpern and Bertel Laurent published on the Big Bang having relic HFGW and suggested a gasser Generator of HFGW analogous to EM Wave generation by lasers. Then in 1974, Leonid Grishchuk, Mikhail Sazhin’s “Emission of Gravitational Waves by an Electromagnetic Cavity” involved HFGW. The Soviets did research in HFGW during the cold war, which draws attention to the very important concept of EM Cavity, of which there are also many natural biological correlates. In other words, we can find EM Cavities in Biology, such as proposed by some researchers for microtubules in the brain. It should be pointed out in regard to the Soviet use of Gravitational Wave signal generators that those generators were of a Low Frequency nature, not HFGW. One of the first practical HFGW detectors was developed at Birmingham University, England by Professor Mike Cruise and his graduate student Richard Ingley. Professor Cruise published his years of research in 1983 and during the 1990s on an electromagnetic detector for very-high-frequency gravitational waves, in Class. Quantum Gravity in 2000. Professor Cruise has published over 100 research papers and a textbook on The Principles of Space Instrument Design. He is a member of the European Space Agency and a member of international teams searching for gravitational waves using ground based and space-based facilities such as LIGO and the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna or LISA. An interaction between a gravitational wave and the polarization vector of an electromagnetic (EM) wave is the basis for the Cruise-Ingley Birmingham HFGW detector. The polarization vector of the EM wave rotates about the direction of its propagation. If a resonant condition can be established with the EM wave always experiencing the same phase as the gravitational wave, then the effect is cumulative and can be enhanced linearly by repeated circuits of a closed loop. The detector measures changes in the polarization, using a short filament or probe, of the EM microwave beam (indicating the presence of a HFGW) propagating within a waveguide loop", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:223:edf48403c754", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2576, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 224, "text": "The polarization vector of the EM wave rotates about the direction of its propagation.

This is about the wavelength of 300 MHz HFGWs. (Baker, 2017, 10-11) Giorgio Fontana in Italy had been studying another possible HFGW laboratory generator also similar to a Laser that he termed a “HTSC Gazer.” His high-temperature superconductor or HTSC generator is based upon the previously mentioned Halpern and Laurent studies and “…the properties of copper-pair pairing states …” (Baker, 2017, 15-16) Baker also filed a patent for ‘Gravitational Wave Generator Utilizing Submicroscopic Energizable Elements filed Dec. 27, 2000 (Baker, 2005). In 2004 issued a patent for generating HFGW using x-rays, which was a method noted by researchers on anti-gravity technology as being a necessity for creating anti-grav tech. Lockheed-Sandia labs in New Mexico operates an X-Ray generator for weapons development, the ^(α)Z -Machine.” In this particular submicroscopic version Dr. Baker sees the ability to change cellular nuclei, etc., along the lines of earlier work in microbiology during World War II. It is also interesting to note that Dr. Baker foresaw this technology as a means of transferring thoughts, and his company, GravWave LLC, has partnered with the French company Exobiologie on thought transference, as described by Lockheed engineer Dr. John Norseen in a previous chapter, using HFGW from one person to another (see http://www.exobiologie.org); which in its premiere Academic conference has the following program for 2020: “Brain to Brain exobiological communication by High Frequency Gravitational Waves. (Gary V Stephenson - Physicist and engineer, Gravwave team)” (web site, accessed 7/28/20). The Exobiologie documentation references the work of Daniel Bar of Bar Ilan University in Israel, who in 2007 first proposed publicly the concept of gravitational brain waves. Noting that: For the first half of this work we have used the fact that the ionic currents and charges in the cerebral system radiate electric waves as may be realized by attaching electrodes to the scalp. That is, one may physically and logically assume that just as these ionic currents and charges in the brain give rise to electric waves so the masses related to these ions and charges should give rise, according to Einstein’s field equations, to weak GW’s. From this we have proceeded to calculate the correlation among an n-brain ensemble in the sense of finding them at some time radiating similar gravitational waves if they were found at an earlier time radiating other GW’s. We have used as a specific example of gravitational wave", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:224:f7559ee06a90", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2577, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 225, "text": "these ionic currents and charges in the brain give rise to electric waves so the masses related to these ions and charges should give rise, according to Einstein’s field equations, to weak GW’s.

We have used as a specific example of gravitational wave the cylindrical one which we have investigated in a thorough and intensive way… (Bar, 2007) Another interesting topic related to Neuroweapons is holography; if, after all, Gravitational Waves are used for Neuroweapons which are based on remote sensing of brain states, how would one represent such states. Since there are gravitational brain waves, and since according to Bar, who writes on the topic of gravitational wave holography: In our discussion we have used the known methods of optical holography and, especially, the realization that, under certain conditions such as very small wavelength, one cannot, theoretically, differentiate between GW and EMW. We have, thus, shown that passing a reference GW (not in the same region passed by the subject wave) and letting these two waves meet and interfere in some other space-time region (hologram) then if this reference wave is again passed, as the corresponding EMW illuminator, through this hologram the result will be a reconstruction of the subject wave. Although this discussion is purely theoretical one may hope that a future advanced technology will be developed which will enable the next generation of scientists to use and manipulate GW the same way we are able now to use EMW. (Bar, 2005) Thus, using this holography one could recreate the matrix of GW in Minkowski space (4d); thus, have a holographic representation of gravitational brainwaves. Additional to that is the recently confirmed gravitational memory effect which as the name suggests leaves an imprint, so to speak, on the local particles of a passing GW, or a memory, perhaps what some mystics call the “Akashic Records.” Theoretically, one could generate a visual map based on gravitational brainwaves, Dubrov’s bio-gravitation; a map of the brain, as referenced in the work of Dr. John Norseen. There is basically no area of research for HFGW outside of the military and IC. Public funding, except to a limited degree, is only given in China, there so far has been no major funding in any publicly trackable way for the development of HFGW.

Later in 2007 he presented on HFGW Surveillance at the University of New Mexico STAIF conference. This is in the heartland of government labs such as Lockheed-Martin-Sandia and others. In China Dr. Fangyu Li had accomplished research into the Li effect in which HFGWs in a Gaussian electromagnetic field and an intense magnetic field could allow for the detection of HFGWs. This detector, termed the Li-Baker HFGW Detector, was under initial development in China at Chongqing University. (Baker, 2017, 17) The Li Effect was the basis for Dr. Baker’s work, not the Gerstenshtein Effect which was used to debunk Dr. Baker’s work by the Military Scientific advisor, Yeardley, of the JASON Reports. The Fangyu Li effect, a gravitational wave transfers energy to a separately generated electromagnetic (EM) wave in the presence of a static magnetic field as discussed in detail in Li et al., 2009. That EM wave has the same frequency as the GW (ripple in the spacetime continuum) and moves in the same direction. (Baker, 2010, 25) In 2003 a former DIA officer, Paul Murad (M.Sc.), organized a conference on HFGW at a front company for DoD and US IC projects, the Mitre Corporation of McLean, VA, which is also known for its cybersecurity platforms. The Mitre Conference was the first sponsored, serious symposium solely dedicated to HFGW. Presenters included the leading figures in HFGW, such as Dr. Baker and others; Gary Stephenson, who presented on using HFGW for communications, Eric Davis, who presented on “Laboratory generation of high-frequency gravitons via quantization of the coupled Maxwell-Einstein fields.” Others presented on other issues related to HFGW. The interesting detail regarding this conference was its intimacy with the DoD/IC Research community through Paul Murad (d. 2022). He is known to have worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency on new technology research. He ran Section-F of the University of New Mexico STAIF conference, dealing with anti-gravitation propulsion and the like. Section F was established by a NASA scientist, Marc Millis, who invited Murad to organize the sectional conferences. (Murad, 2006) Murad: The overall STAIF conference in 2004 had up to 750 attendees and we held an audience of regulars for each paper. I am not concerned about military attendees. In fact I have many people from DoD and various government agencies as session chairs and co-chairs [it] is useful because if funding were available, they would be knowledgeable about it. (Murad, 2006) So, clearly, the Military and Intelligence community is established in HFGW. Also attending the conference was Janes Military Intelligence editor Nick Cook.

Janes attended conferences between 2003-5, which is in keeping with its mission of providing private intelligence information regarding all kinds of military threats. I often studied Janes Warships while on Sonar duty on a US Navy Submarine. One would think with this much interest the United States was ahead of the game. However, Murad paints a different picture, one with the Russians and Europeans in the lead as he recounts of the 2003 Mitre Conference: As is typical of Americans, during the coffee breaks, they would sketch a candidate idea for a gravitational wave detector at a given frequency x trying to impress a foreign presenter. The foreigner in one case shook his head and suggested it was a good design and then took out Polaroid pictures showing his test apparatus at frequency x, then y and finally z! These were pictures of metallic hardware representing a gravity resonating cavity that was shock isolated and quite impressive. Clearly, the U.S. had ignored this technology and seriously, if there was any value to this work, we were sorely not even second best. (Murad, 2006) This too was the case with Neuroweapons research in general, with the United States, having out-spent, out-muscled, and outlasted the Soviet Union, inheriting the Soviet’s research once it collapsed; bringing Soviet Researchers to New Mexico in the 1990s to work on NSA sponsored Neuroweapons research as evidenced by the writings of Dr. John Norseen. After the 2nd HFGW Workshop on June 17, 2008, a research group called the JASONS, composed of very influential and respected university scientists, were given a briefing on the generation, detection and applications of high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). The JASON Report ( JSR-08-506) on that briefing was published in October 2008. The Report was widely distributed to the US scientific community and various press organizations reported it. The JASON Report stated that, Our main conclusions are that the proposed applications of the science of HFGW are fundamentally wrong; that there can be no security threat; and that independent scientific and technical vetting of such hypothetical threats is generally necessary. We conclude that previous analysis of the Li-Baker detector concept is incorrect by many orders of magnitude … The author of the JASON Report’s basic premise for generating HFGWs was: “A basic mechanism for generating a HFGW is the direct conversion of an electromagnetic wave into a gravitational one of the same frequency, by a strong static magnetic field. This Gertsenshtein process is idealized in Figure 3.” In addition, the Report states: “Proposed HFGW detectors have generally", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:227:7d8d5e225e0e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2580, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 228, "text": "is generally necessary.

This Gertsenshtein process is idealized in Figure 3.” In addition, the Report states: “Proposed HFGW detectors have generally been based upon versions of the inverse Gertsenshtein process.” (Italics added by the author for emphasis.) These statements are both incorrect. As already mentioned, the Gertsenshtein process or effect was published in 1962: M. E. Gertsenshtein, “Wave resonance of light and gravitational waves,” Soviet Physics JETP, 14, Number 1, pp. 84-85. The effect is extremely weak and is not utilized in most of the modern HFGW generation, detection or applications. (Baker, 2017, 24) Once again, it is not surprising that we find some irony in the concept of suppression of HFGW, which occurred after Dr. Baker’s 2007 STAIF presentation. In general, working with gravitational based technology is considered a high risk proposition by many ‘free energy’ researchers: ‘faster than light’ propulsion researchers. According to Lt. Col. Tom Bearden, he himself no longer researches in this area due to concern for his life: I’m a co-author of a paper in the literature way back there which reports a successful anti-gravity drive. I’m not going to do another experiment not even going to participate in one … so you know everybody’s got a little bit different circumstance and my circumstance for me to go on living and staying healthy and doing well depends on me avoiding certain areas and that’s one of them. (Bearden, 2005) The culture and the problem set had to change. The major problem was how could one simple person change these things and then I found that I was not alone in these beliefs and surrounded myself with several other kindred spirits with similar ideas. This included Dr. Bob Baker and Tony Robertson. My papers were then being rejected from both AIAA and STAIF because of much stricter selection criteria. For example, papers would only be accepted if I had somebody from academia as a co-author! At this point, going to these conferences were, at least in my view, quite boring. It was as if the technical community had shut down and would become bureaucratic, thereby losing its lust to resolve new and exciting technical challenges. Clearly the technical community was falling into a risk-averse paradigm and apparently there was no way out.

Could it be directly related to non-disclosure of highly classified military weapons programs being developed by the likes of Lockheed-Martin? Dr. Robert Baker, when asked if he believed that the 2008 JASON Report was an attempt at suppression, answered rather directly in the affirmative: A: It is difficult to believe otherwise. Ordinarily, an unbiased analysis of a technical presentation would have involved some consultation with the presenters in order to better define the subject matter. Furthermore, an exclusive focus on only one HFGW detector, to the exclusion of the Birmingham University, INFN Genoa and Japanese HFGW detectors, which the GravWave presenters discussed in their PowerPoint presentation, would be unwarranted in an unbiased analysis, as would be the avoidance of a discussion of other HFGW-generator research presented by GravWave. Only one HFGW detector paper was scrutinized by the JASON authors – their reference [10]. Although never discussed in the GravWave® presentation, the Abstract of that paper did mention the Gertsenshtein effect, but the first paragraph of the actual paper admonished the reader to review the other literature that clearly showed that the detector was the result of a combination of the Gertsenshtein effect with synchro-resonance, the Li-effect and not the Gertsenshtein effect alone. Their avoidance of analysis of the basic reference in their Report, which covered the Li-effect, was certainly unwarranted in an unbiased Report. (Eardley, et al.) (2008) “High Frequency Gravitational Waves,” JSR-08-506, October, the JASON defense science advisory panel and prepared for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. (Baker, 2009) In personal communications with one of the attendees of the JASON meeting that debunked Dr. Baker’s plans, it is noted that CIA consulting scientists were behind denying the validity of the approach of Dr. Baker’s group. Dr. Jack Sarfatti was invited by the JASON chair Dr. Ron Pandolfi (Sarfatti, 2022) both of whom are former CIA contract scientists and were part of the JASON consultations regarding HFGW feasibility as a security threat. It is an established practice of nations’ military defense to obfuscate their own capabilities from others, as well as take technology from original researchers and place it in classified labs of their own. Additionally, if an enemy has such technology it could be used to send enemies down the wrong research trajectory by influencing the reviewers to make basic academic mistakes.

Undoubtedly, the US Military has expressed interest in HFGW at least into 2013, when DARPA issued a call for proposals https://www.sbir.gov/node/386412 (accessed 7/19/20) regarding HFGW communication systems much like Dr. Baker’s. Research conferences continue on the issue of HFGW with the 2017 3^(rd) HFGW Conference in Chengdu, China. • Gravitational waves have a very low cross section for absorption by normal matter, so HFGWs could, in principle, carry significant information content with effectively no absorption, unlike electromagnetic (EM) waves. • Because of their unique characteristics, HFGWs could be utilized for uninterruptible, very low-probability-of-intercept (LPI) communications. • Other potential very theoretical military applications are propulsion, including “moving” space objects and missiles in flight, surveillance through buildings and the Earth itself, and remote initiation of nuclear events. (Baker 2009) Of the applications of high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs), communication appears to be the most important and most immediate. Gravitational waves have a very low cross section for absorption by normal matter, so high-frequency waves could, in principle, carry significant information content with effectively no absorption, unlike electromagnetic (EM) waves. Multi-channel HFGW communications can be both point-topoint (for example, to deeply submerged submarines) and point-to-multipoint, like cell phones. HFGWs pass through all ordinary material things without attenuation and represent the ultimate wireless system. One could communicate directly through the Earth from Moscow in Russia to Caracas in Venezuela—without the need for fiber optic cables, microwave relays, or satellite transponders… (Baker 2009) [in this system it is important to note it is terrestrial based, not space based satellites as in many conspiracy theories about Targeted Individuals.] Any nation that possesses a communication system that is totally secure, high-bandwidth and can propagate directly through the Earth has an economic advantage over nations who do not possess that capability. From a national security viewpoint, they would be able to communicate with little or no possibility of interception. Surprise attacks by enemies of the United States could be planned and executed utilizing such a communications system with impunity. (Baker 2009) One of the important components of the Li-Baker HFGW detector is the use of FBARs (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator pairs) which are commonly used in such things as cell phones. FBARs are powered by magnetrons in their design; through which Dr. Baker plans to miniaturize his technology and put in cell phones, so that each phone would have its own Gravitational Wave", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:230:b910675bc9b9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2583, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 231, "text": "of the United States could be planned and executed utilizing such a communications system with impunity.

FBARs are powered by magnetrons in their design; through which Dr. Baker plans to miniaturize his technology and put in cell phones, so that each phone would have its own Gravitational Wave antenna/transmitter, which he envisions for secure communications in a noiseless channel. The potential for through-earth or through-water “X-ray like” surveillance utilizing the extreme sensitivity of HFGW generation-detection systems to polarization angle changes (possibly sensitive to even less than 10^( − 4) radians) might allow for observing subterranean structures and geological formations (such as oil deposits), creating a transparent ocean; viewing three-dimensional building interiors, buried devices, hidden missiles and weapons of mass destruction, achieving remote acoustical surveillance or eavesdropping, etc., or even a fullbody scan without radiation danger (Baker 2007a). (Baker, 2009) [] Figurc 1.2.2.1.HFGW Survcillance [Operational capability prediclionsarebased onvery rough estimales bythe authorfrom conversationsand impressions gained during three international HFGW Workshops (MITRE2003.Austln2007and Humisville2009)andtripsIoChinain2004.2006and 2008andto Europeand theMiddleEastin2009.] The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory (LIGO) and other long-wave-length GW interferometer detectors (such as GEO 600, Virgo, TAMA, Advanced LIGO and the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, or LISA) cannot detect HFGWs due to the HFGW’s short wavelengths, as discussed by Shawhan (2004). Long-wave-length gravitational waves have thousand-to million-meter wavelengths, which can be detected by LIGO (LIGO is frequency limited to signals below 2, 000Hz and wavelengths longer than 150km, ), but these are of no practical surveillance value, due to their diffraction and resulting poor resolution. Furthermore, the LIGO technology is completely different from the detection method and noise suppression suggested here. (Baker, 2000) From Dr. Baker’s overall picture and others’ work with High Frequency Gravitational Waves we can see how from at least an academic or prototypical design view point that it is highly possible that HFGW could not only be used for ‘remote sensing’, but, as we shall see later, for ‘consciousness’ or using gravitational waves to affect brain function remotely. We can also see clearly how the primary players, at least in the UK-USA countries, is the Military and IC, and no doubt neuro-marketers would be of keen interest to such a technology. 1918 – Einstein Gravitational Quadropole (4x4 Tensor). Einstein writes about GW as a quadropole; a quadropolar waves simplest solution that maintains conservation of momentum during propagation of waves. An interesting episode in GW History is Einstein’s denial of GW, then his re-affirmation of them.

In Berlin is able to more closely work with the Berlin Group of the Brain Research Institute: Nikolai W. Timofeeff-Ressovsky (Russian), Karl Gunter Zimmer (later taken to Soviet Union), as well as with Walter Gerlach, famous for spin theory experiments, later taken as POW to Britain and debriefed for a year by MI6. Group included phage research as it relates to target theory. 1952 – Jordan publishes Gravity and Space (Schwerkraft und Weltall), textbook on his ideals regarding cosmology and gravity. Cited by Russian L. L. Vasilev as source of Biogravitation. Other possible dissemination of ideals is through Zimmer during forced labor in Soviet prison on Soviet Nuclear Bomb project. 1978 – Forward builds the first interferometric detector. “In the early seventies Robert L.

(2018) Vortrag über Burkhard Heim ⋅ Held der UFO-Szene presentation at Planetarium Nürnberg, am 04.07.2018 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqR2S8yxfFM My first experience with radar was as a radar operator in the US Navy, watching the sweeping green line make its centrifugal rounds of any contacts on the green-tinted screen. Radar is a detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object’s location and speed. Radar is a direct outcome of the British need to detect incoming Nazi German aircraft, and again we see the relationship of technical advances in warfare. A s early as 1886, German physicist Heinrich Hertz showed that radio waves could be reflected from solid objects. In 1895, Alexander Popov, a physics instructor at the Imperial Russian Navy school in Kronstadt, developed an apparatus using a coherer tube for detecting distant lightning strikes. The next year, he added a spark-gap transmitter. In 1897, while testing this equipment for communicating between two ships in the Baltic Sea, he took note of an interference beat caused by the passage of a third vessel. In his report, Popov wrote that this phenomenon might be used for detecting objects, but he did nothing more with this observation. The German inventor Christian Hülsmeyer was the first to use radio waves to detect “the presence of distant metallic objects.” In 1904, he demonstrated the feasibility of detecting a ship in dense fog, but not its distance from the transmitter. He obtained a patent for his detection device in April 1904 and later a patent for a related amendment for estimating the distance to the ship. He also obtained a British patent on September 23, 1904 for a full radar system, that he called a telemobiloscope. It operated on a 50cm wavelength and the pulsed radar signal was created via a spark-gap. His system already used the classic antenna setup of horn antenna with parabolic reflector and was presented to German military officials in practical tests in Cologne", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:233:913b4e321911", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2586, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 234, "text": "in April 1904 and later a patent for a related amendment for estimating the distance to the ship.

In 1915, Robert Watson-Watt used radio technology to provide advance warning to airmen and during the 1920s went on to lead the U.K. research establishment to make many advances using radio techniques, including the probing of the ionosphere and the detection of lightning at long distances. Through his lightning experiments, Watson-Watt became an expert on the use of radio direction-finding before turning his inquiry to shortwave transmission. Requiring a suitable receiver for such studies, he told the “new boy,” Arnold Frederic Wilkins, to conduct an extensive review of available shortwave units. Wilkins would select a General Post Office model after noting its manual’s description of a “fading” effect (the common term for interference at the time) when aircraft flew overhead. Across the Atlantic in 1922, after placing a transmitter and receiver on opposite sides of the Potomac River, U.S. Navy researchers A. Hoyt Taylor and Leo C. Young discovered that ships passing through the beam path caused the received signal to fade in and out. Taylor submitted a report, suggesting that this phenomenon might be used to detect the presence of ships in low visibility, but the Navy did not immediately continue the work. Eight years later, Lawrence A. Hyland at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) observed similar fading effects from passing aircraft; this revelation led to a patent application as well as a proposal for further intensive research on radio-echo signals from moving targets to take place at NRL, where Taylor and Young were based at the time, just before World War II. Before the Second World War, researchers in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, and the United States, independently and in great secrecy, developed technologies that led to the modern version of radar. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa followed prewar Great Britain’s radar development, and Hungary generated its radar technology during the war. In France in 1934, following systematic studies on the split-anode magnetron, the research branch of the Compagnie Générale de Télégraphie Sans Fil (CSF) headed by Maurice Ponte with Henri Gutton, Sylvain Berline and M. Hugon, began developing an obstacle-locating radio apparatus, aspects of which were installed on the ocean liner Normandie in 1935. During the same period, Soviet military engineer P.K. Oshchepkov, in collaboration with Leningrad Electrophysical Institute, produced an experimental apparatus, RAPID, capable of detecting an aircraft within 3km", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:234:66663a6bd567", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2587, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 235, "text": "In France in 1934, following systematic studies on the split-anode magnetron, the research branch of the Compagnie Générale de Télégraphie Sans Fil (CSF) headed by Maurice Ponte with Henri Gutton, Sylvain Berline and M.

Oshchepkov, in collaboration with Leningrad Electrophysical Institute, produced an experimental apparatus, RAPID, capable of detecting an aircraft within 3km of a receiver. The Soviets produced their first mass production radars RUS-1 and RUS-2 Redut in 1939 but further development was slowed following the arrest of Oshchepkov and his subsequent gulag sentence. In total, only 607 Redut stations were produced during the war. The first Russian airborne radar, Gneiss-2, entered into service in June 1943 on Pe-2 dive bombers. More than 230 Gneiss-2 stations were produced by the end of 1944. The French and Soviet systems, however, featured continuous-wave operation that did not provide the full performance ultimately synonymous with modern radar systems. Full radar evolved as a pulsed system, and the first such elementary apparatus was demonstrated in December 1934 by the American Robert M. Page, working at the Naval Research Laboratory. The following year, the United States Army successfully tested a primitive surface-to-surface radar to aim coastal battery searchlights at night. This design was followed by a pulsed system demonstrated in May 1935 by Rudolf Kühnhold and the firm GEMA [de] in Germany and then another in June 1935 by an Air Ministry team led by Robert Watson-Watt in Great Britain. In 1935, Watson-Watt was asked to judge recent reports of a German radio-based death ray and turned the request over to Wilkins. Wilkins returned a set of calculations demonstrating the system was basically impossible. When Watson-Watt then asked what such a system might do, Wilkins recalled the earlier report about aircraft causing radio interference. This revelation led to the Daventry Experiment of 26 February, 1935, using a powerful BBC shortwave transmitter as the source and their GPO receiver set-up in a field while a bomber flew around the site. When the plane was clearly detected, Hugh Dowding, the Air Member for Supply and Research was very impressed with their system’s potential and funds were immediately provided for further operational development. Watson-Watt’s team patented the device in GB593017. Development of radar greatly expanded on 1 September, 1936 when Watson-Watt became Superintendent of a new establishment under the British Air Ministry, Bawdsey Research Station located in Bawdsey Manor, near Felixstowe, Suffolk. Work there resulted in the design and installation of aircraft detection and tracking stations called “Chain Home” along the East and South coasts of England in time for the outbreak of World War II in 1939.

This system provided the vital advance information that helped the Royal Air Force win the Battle of Britain; without it, significant numbers of fighter aircraft, which Great Britain did not have available, would always need to be in the air to respond quickly. If detection of enemy aircraft had relied solely on the observations of ground-based individuals, England might have lost the Battle of Britain. Also vital was the “Dowding system” of reporting and coordination to provide the best use of radar information during the tests of early radar deployment during 1936 and 1937. Given all required funding and development support, the team produced working radar systems in 1935 and began deployment. By 1936, the first five Chain Home (CH) systems were operational and by 1940 stretched across the entire UK including Northern Ireland. Even by standards of the era, CH was crude; instead of broadcasting and receiving from an aimed antenna, CH broadcast a signal floodlighting the entire area in front of it, and then used one of Watson-Watt’s own radio direction finders to determine the direction of the returned echoes. This fact meant CH transmitters had to be much more powerful and have better antennas than competing systems but allowed its rapid introduction using existing technologies. In April 1940, Popular Science showed an example of a radar unit using the Watson-Watt patent in an article on air defense. Also, in late 1941 Popular Mechanics had an article in which a U.S. scientist speculated about the British early warning system on the English east coast and came close to what it was and how it worked. Watson-Watt was sent to the U.S. in 1941 to advise on air defense immediately after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Alfred Lee Loomis organized the secret MIT Radiation Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, which developed microwave radar technology in the years 1941–45. Later, in 1943, Page greatly improved radar with the monopulse technique that was used for many years in most radar applications. adar relies on its own transmissions rather than light from the Sun or the Moon, or from electromagnetic Rwaves emitted by the target objects themselves, such as infrared radiation (heat). This process of directing artificial radio waves towards objects is called illumination, although radio waves are invisible to the human eye as well as optical cameras.

The klystron was the first significantly powerful source of radio waves in the microwave range; before its invention the only sources were the Barkhausen-Kurz tube and split anode magnetron, which were limited to very low power. It was invented by the brothers Russell and Sigurd Varian at Stanford University. Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937. Upon publication in 1939, news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of US and UK researchers working on radar equipment. The Varians went on to found Varian Associates, to commercialize the technology (for example, to make small linear accelerators to generate photons for external beam radiation therapy). Their work was preceded by the description of velocity modulation by A. Arsenjewa-Heil and Oskar Heil (wife and husband) in 1935, though the Varians were probably unaware of the Heils’ work. The work of physicist W.W. Hansen was instrumental in the development of the klystron and was cited by the Varian brothers in their 1939 paper. His resonator analysis, which dealt with the problem of accelerating electrons toward a target, could be used just as well to decelerate electrons (i.e., transfer their kinetic energy to RF energy in a resonator). During the second World War, Hansen lectured at the MIT Radiation labs two days a week, commuting to Boston from Sperry Gyroscope Company on Long Island. His resonator was called a “rhumbatron” by the Varian brothers. Hansen died of beryllium disease in 1949 as a result of exposure to beryllium oxide (BeO). During the Second World War, the Axis powers relied mostly on (then low-powered and long wavelength) klystron technology for their radar system microwave generation, while the Allies used the far more powerful but frequency-drifting technology of the cavity magnetron for much shorter-wavelength one-centimeter microwave generation. Klystron tube technologies for very high-power applications, such as synchrotrons and radar systems, have since been developed. Right after the war, AT&T used 4-watt klystrons in its brand-new network of microwave relay links that covered the US continent. The network provided long-distance telephone service and also carried television signals for the major TV networks. Western Union Telegraph Company also built point-to-point microwave communication links using intermediate repeater stations at about 40-mile intervals at that time, using 2K25 reflex klystrons in both the transmitters and receivers.

The hacking tools employed by the NSA as revealed by Snowden, had some intriguing elements. If you go through the leaks you will read how they could install ports and chips into targeted systems, and power them through Radar, by directing a radar signal at the target the device inserted into their system would be energized, a basic magnetron. Similarly, you will read reports from former MI-5 and MI-6 agents that talk of doing this same thing to their targets, deploying radar for the purposes of covert surveillance. Radar’s relationship to neuroweapons is not just limited to CN ops. The Frey effect itself, hearing voices not spoken inside one’s head, was a direct outcome of radar technicians’ experiences while maintaining the radar; they would start to hear strange things inside their heads, leading to the discovery of the Frey effect. In another ironic twist with contemporary politics, one of the leading engineers on the US Radar systems during World War II at MIT in Boston, was David G. Trump, the uncle of ex-President Trump. He was dispatched upon Tesla’s death (Tesla suggested a radar system in 1917), to American investors, to investigate Tesla’s papers and remarked upon review that there was nothing to see in them. Radar sends out an EM wave in the microwave bandwidths hitting a reflection or object, then a very small amount of energy bounces off the target and is processed by the Radar’s receivers. Then the signal undergoes processing and finally output to a User Interface of some kind. The two main components of radar in terms of scientific equations are the Received Signal equation and the Radar Range Equation including signal to noise equations. First, the Received Signal equation is formulated as: $= [ \\mathsf { P } _ { \\mathsf { T } } ] [ \\frac { 4 \\pi \\mathsf { A } } { \\mathsf { A } ^ { 2 } } ] [ \\frac { 1 } { 4 \\pi \\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } } ] [ \\frac { 1 } { \\mathsf { L } } ] [ \\mathrm { ~ ~ \\vec ~ { ~ \\tau ~ } ~ } ] [ \\frac { 1 } { 4 \\pi \\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } } ] [ \\mathrm { ~ ~ \\vec ~ { ~ \\tau ~ } ~ } ] [ \\mathrm { ~ ~ \\vec ~ { ~ \\tau ~ } ~ } ] [ \\mathrm { ~ ~ \\vec ~ { ~ \\tau ~ } ~", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:238:17116e1b52dd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2591, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 239, "text": "L } } ] [ \\mathrm { ~ ~ \\vec ~ { ~ \\tau ~ } ~ } ] [ \\frac { 1 } { 4 \\pi \\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } } ] [ \\mathrm { ~ ~ \\vec ~ { ~ \\tau ~ } ~ } ] [ \\mathrm { ~ ~ \\vec ~ { ~ \\tau ~ } ~ } ] [ \\mathrm { ~ ~ \\vec ~ { ~ \\tau ~ } ~ } ] [ \\mathrm { ~ ~ \\vec ~ { ~ \\tau ~ } ~ } ] [ \\mathrm { ~ ~ \\tau ~ } ] [ \\mathrm { ~ ~ \\tau ~ } ]$ This equation is used to measure the echo from an object or target that the radar signal has a hit on. The objects echo foot-print is represented by Target RCS (sigmoid), this is the area of the object that the radar can see and receives a return signal or echo from, it is a small fraction of the original sent signal amplitude. The radar equation is used to formulate the details of the echo and processing of it, in this book I use the equations for tracking a target also known as surveillance radar, we start with the Radar Range equation: $$ \\mathsf { P } _ { \\mathrm { r } } = \\begin{array} { r l r l } & { \\mathsf { P } _ { \\mathrm { t } } \\mathsf { G } _ { \\mathrm { t } } } & { \\sigma \\mathsf { A } _ { \\mathrm { e } } } & { \\mathsf { P } _ { \\mathrm { r } } = \\mathsf { p o w n e r ~ r e c e i v e d } } \\\\ & { 4 \\pi \\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } } & { 4 \\pi \\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } } & { \\mathsf { A } _ { \\mathrm { e } } = \\mathsf { e f f e c t i v e ~ a r e a ~ o f } } \\end{array} $$ n an earlier chapter we discussed how the use of agents to track an intelligence target in Northern Ireland, spe-Icifically, Irish Catholic nationalists, was something like 50 agents per 1 target. This labor intensive process of surveillance of an intelligence target was the main reason to use cyber as a means of tracking targets, it reduced the need for so many agents.

It’s a bit like what takes place in a science fiction movie. People can be tracked anywhere by radar, satellite, a base station and complimentary computer programs. For example, three radar devices would sometimes be positioned in the vicinity of the target. The radar emits electromagnetic waves, some of which pick up the target and the result is then evaluated. My friends who work in the special department could then follow the target all day on their computers. This form of localizing the target made it easy to deploy the weapons accurately. My colleagues could see exactly where to aim and also observe how the target reacted. (Groß 2009) …a couple emails back you talked about how you can feel different thought patterns, sometimes just a twinge, other times full bore…well, I wrote a rather lengthy project report for NASA back in 2000 and also for NSA related to Cryptomnesia…this is Greek for the Continuum of signals and noises that can occur in a brain. This is exactly the same kind of measurement scale that is used to rate a submarine sound signal or Electromagnetic Signal…positive and negative. Well, it is possible using EEG and other BioFusion tools that one can track the movement of Identified Thoughts or Semiotic Structures as they emanate Functions or Communications (INTENT). In fact, right now, you Duncan, probably have hundreds or thousands of Thoughts and mini-thoughts that are dancing around, and banging around inside your head, just like a radar sweep looking out at weather patterns…one can radar sweep the semiotic conditions inside of your head and plot them on this Cryptomnesia Scale. You can even apply Doppler analysis and see which thoughts are growing in intensity, or dying out, or getting stuck in “feed-back” loops, sustaining themselves, perhaps in Unconscious or Non-Cognitive zones, at let’s say – 100 db or -35-50 db, self-obsessive routines, etc. etc. This is similar to the NSA using Radar to illuminate a target computer for off-line retrieval of information in a covert manner.

One such system that is used was the CTX4000 system which has been replaced by what they termed ‘PHOTOANGLO’, again showing the Anglo-Saxon bias of UK-USA secret intelligence, rather than calling it PHOTOBRIT for example, inclusive of all British nations including the Irish of Northern Ireland. It works in tandem with other components such as VA-GRANT and NIGHTWATCH – portable computer to display data from VAGRANT retrieved via PHOTOAN-GLO. NSA docs relate the following: (TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) The radar unit generates an un-modulated, continuous wave (CW) signal. The oscillator is eithergenerated internally,or externally througha signal generator orcavity oscillator.The unit amplifies the signal and sends it out to an RF connector, where it is directed to some form of transmission antenna (horn,parabolic dish, LPA,spiral).The signaliluminates the target system and is re-radiated.The receive antenna picks up the re-radiated signal and directs the signal to the receive input.The signal isamplified,filtered,and mixed with the transmit antenna.The result isa homodyne receiver in which the RF signal is mixed directly to baseband. The baseband video signal is ported to an external BNC connector.This connects to a processing system,such as NIGHTWATCH,an LFS-2,or VIEWPLATE,to process the signal and provide the intelligence. At that time, the German scientific team led the world in the theory and technology of radar absorbing materials (RAM) and radar cross section. For example, some leading Western radar experts believe that the German scientists had already advanced the theory of radar cross section beyond where Western scientists have arrived at today. Radar cross section science is the “heart” of modern radar technology, countermeasures, and counter-countermeasures. The theory of RAM technology is precisely what is needed to develop and design phase conjugate mirrors for radar frequency bands. Phase conjugate mirrors are capable of producing a time-reversed (TR) wave in direct response to a received ordinary wave. The mirror may be powerfully “pumped” with energy to produce a very large amplification of the time-reversed wave. (1) If any signal at all can be received from a distant target, a return TR signal of extreme power can be delivered directly to that target. Almost all of the transmitted TR signal energy will arrive at and in the distant target, even through a highly nonlinear medium or under scattering conditions. Hardly any of the energy will be lost en route. If the target is fast-moving, a “lead correction” signal can be calculated and added", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:241:50a2996b7773", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2594, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 242, "text": "the time-reversed wave.

Hardly any of the energy will be lost en route. If the target is fast-moving, a “lead correction” signal can be calculated and added to steer the return path. (2) Since real-time holography can readily be accomplished using TR waves - and without first making holograms, geometrical forms (balls, shapes, hemispherical shells, etc) of energy can be created readily by interferometry (crossed beam techniques). Since the TR wave carriers do not disperse with distance, these interference energy forms can be assembled by crossed TR wave beams at great distances – even hundreds of thousands of miles. The energy appearing in such a distantly created energy form is limited only by the amount one cares to put in at the amplified transmitting end. Thus, the radar itself now becomes a powerful, all-around weapon. With a TR wave adjunct, once the radar receives a return signal from a target, an extremely powerful TR wave pulse can be generated, and all the energy in that pulse can be unerringly returned to the distant target from which the return was received. (Bearden, 1988, 285) What a time-reversed wave does, is allow for a channel to be opened up in a certain sense from the object to the radar. Radar sends out a signal, it is echoed back by an object, then another wave is sent back directly to the target and not to any other coordinates, which is also akin to Ahronov-Bohm Effect monitoring we shall read about in later chapters as developed by the Soviets. This would be one way to pump an auditory signal as example to a target but nobody else around the target will hear that signal. Holography, as we shall read about more in the next section, is something he brings up, which we shall also read about more in later chapters as well. It is important to note that he mentions holography in connection with time-reversed waves, as well as his drawing attention to the cross section of the target or object of surveillance. reviously, we read how the early Russian researcher Kazhinsky had formulated a connection to communication and the eyes. Recently, this conjecture of his has been given experimental ground through the work of Singh, et al (2018). In their studies they find the eye to be an antenna capable of receiving microwave radiation, infrared, ultraviolet, aside from the normal color spectrum of electromagnetic radiation we see.

As Norseen noted, flashes of images appear in the visual cortex through Thought Injection; the visual pathway is a major part of Thought Injection. He also has spoken of sending beams of light (LED) at a target to affect neuro-cognitive function, see Chapter 4. Yet, he was not the originator of this concept, either, as it was done in the Soviet Union long before Thought Injection made its mark in the national security world. Pribram is sighted as the originator of Norseen’s ideas of using holography. As we shall see, there are real-world applications of this developed by Kaznacheev. Three sorts of image representation are proposed to be used in the cortex: 1. the Gabor wavelets, rooted in dendritic webs, seem to be used for associative processes underlying visual cognition; 2. their Gabor coefficients represent neural-net’s sparse codes which serve for automatic processing; 3. the spatial image, reconstructed in the extrastriate area, is those which is then consciously perceived “with shapes and colors.” Because the third image representation is even perceptually projected back into external space, so that it coincides precisely with the original object, I propose that quantum holographic process is necessary, since neural nets cannot realize that alone. (Perus, 2010) Earlier it was mentioned that Pribram was a source for the holographic background to Norseen’s work; however, it should be mentioned that the use of holography was already developed in the Soviet Union. Holography is a visual field phenomenon as noted by a Russian researcher Kaznacheev in work initially begun by him in the 1960s. Again, it should be pointed out that the retina’s cones and rods act as cavity resonators or as high-Q antennas. In his patent (Kaznacheev 2004) he and his team engineered a system to pass holograms into the visual cortex but not in the visual range so it is imageless holography, although it can be modified to also send visual holograms, as he writes “the invention relates to the field of optics and is intended to create a hologram containing non-visualized physiologically significant information that can be used in medicine.” (Kaznacheev, 2004). This method is described: Method 3: The holographic image reproduced from the transmission hologram according to option 3 is taken on a digital video camera, the contrast of the diffractive components is enhanced using computer programs, for example PhotoShop, the graphic image of the hologram is converted into a digital matrix containing information about the color components and their intensity, a comparative statistical analysis of the values of elements of numerical matrices of holograms with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:243:c311975543cd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2596, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 244, "text": "used in medicine.” (Kaznacheev, 2004).

If there are significant differences, a conclusion is made about the presence of non-visualized physiologically significant information in the hologram. (Kaznacheev 2004) This allows both the transmission and reception of holographic information in the form of a frequency-modulated luminous flux. The transmission of the holograms occurs in the 2.5Hz − 3.5Hz , and 10Hz (Alpha) brain-wave rhythms. When the brain is presented with a hologram containing non-visualized physiologically significant information triggers the activation of 10Hz Alpha, which is also mentioned by Norseen. It has been argued that the proteins vibrate in the presence of electromagnetic signal like a cavity resonator… Protein synthesis is stimulated by electromagnetic fields of the specific frequency in the RF range…Since we now have evidence that proteins vibrate electromagnetically, we can revisit the electromagnetic interaction in the cells, considering the whole cell as a cavity resonator. (Singh et al, 2018b) The coupled electro-mechanical system consisting of a microwave cavity and its walls can serve as a gravitational radiation detector. A gravitational wave interacts with the walls, and the resulting motion induces transitions from a highly excited cavity mode to a nearly unexcited mode. (Caves, 1976) Singh has found that the structure of the eye’s retina nano-center is a dipole antenna network. The interaction of a photon beam with this mechanism is considered: “If a rotation of the light wave underlies the laser emission then the possibility of helical electron transmission increases… …the network of cells acts as an array of helical antennas.” (Singh et al, 2018b) This is important to note in that helical structures interact with the Aharonov-Bohm Effect, so that in the human eye, this effect is felt and acted upon biologically. This dipole antenna of the eyes photoreceptors is modeled as an octagonal array; there is an octagonal order in rods and cones, with three types of cones: s, m, l , with wavelengths at three separate magnitudes: $\\scriptstyle \\mathbf { r } = 4 0 0 \\mathbf { n m }$ , $\\scriptstyle \\mathtt { g } = 5 5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ , $\\scriptstyle \\mathbf { b } = 7 0 0 \\mathbf { n m }$ .

This is somewhat reminiscent of radar used by wasps at three different magnitudes as well as noted also in another paper by Singh et al (2018). We see how the human eye, not normally thought of in connection with Radar, has certain radar-like properties, which may include infrared transmission and reception – the same basic structural pattern of the wasp’s antennae which use infrared communication signals according to Singh, et al. In later chapters, we shall see how the Soviets developed a radar-like system using the Ahronov-Bohm effect and Spin-Entanglement which effectively are Quantum Radars.

In his research articles and in conversations he explained several of the key areas involved in his work. One of the areas that he touched upon was the concept of Quantum Consciousness. Citing many researchers in this area, he was influenced by the holonomic ideas of Dr. Karl Pribram. Dr. Norseen, in one particular key technological area of his research, specifically cites the gravitational based Orchestrated Objective Reduction of Nobel laureate Sir Roger Penrose and University of Arizona professor, Dr. Stuart Hameroff.

It is important to again note Dr. Norseen’s concept of Quantum Shift Keying (QSK), which is to say a code, which was suggested in Koruga-Hameroff ’s 1994 research on Quantum Consciousness. Norseen claimed to use this QSK as a lock-key mechanism that he also compared to a die, casting a thought into the biological fabric of a target brain. In ‘Ch. 6, Physics of Neuroweapons’ we studied how gravitational waves served as the basis of this technology, and in detecting gravitational waves, the technology of interferometry is used. This is exactly how Norseen viewed the brain – the brain is an interferometer: “If we take Pribram and the Russian work, it shows that the human brain structure is an interferometer that uses Gabor Function (wavelet-codelet analysis) in Hilbert Space.” (Norseen, 2002, Part 4) Invariance can be captured in MT by quantum encryption of various combinations of photons, phonons [GW produces phonons], and electrons, which may synergistically produce, via solitons, a binding property of emergent epiphenomenon; a biofield communication both local and non-local to the protein MT strings. Calpain induced start/stops in the dendritic-synaptic receptors, with varying degrees of glial cell neurochemical nutrient infusion, to turn on or off the QSK coded learning sequences in the MT. As more and more neuronal activity forms a topological geometry around these events, oscillating in concert, perceptual and then cognitive events transpire, suggesting a process for sensory to sentient computation. Norseen (1996) Semiotics leads to greater complexity and teleological concentration of energies. Brain structures form to interface and resonate with ZPE; memories are captured ZPE events stored in orchestrated reductions of proteins. When memories are tapped by brain signals — electromagnetic, biochemical or phononic or vibrational — the proteins unwind and unleash the stored memories. Then, as proteins do, they rewind themselves to be tapped again…think of a balsa wood, rubber band-powered airplane that can be used over and over again to fly around the yard. (Norseen, 2002, Part 11). An important thing to notice about these remarks, aside from familiarity with Orchestrated Reduction of Penrose, is that he is also formulating the Amplifier Theory of Jordan, as he speaks of memories coming from ZPE, Zero Point Energy, which are vacuum fluctuations of virtual particles which in the Classical world are encountered in the Casimir Effect where virtual particles can appear, of which we will read more from Dr. Michael Persinger. Dr. Persinger also points to ORCH-OR as a viable candidate as a physical explanation for Consciousness.

Dr. Persinger also points to ORCH-OR as a viable candidate as a physical explanation for Consciousness. (see more below) In talking about the negentropy (structure) of Semiotics, Norseen brings up the issue of the ability to speak of them quantitatively and then improve on that quantization through technology: So, if you are concerned, we are dealing in Esoteric, erudite, non-approachable conditions of Semiotics and Radionics and ZPE and Alfven Wave Grids, then BE SOFTENED my good friend. The very fact that SEMIOT-ICS requires structure means that it can be TESTED, MEASURED, VERIFIED and understood and TECH-NICALLY AMPLIFIED. I have given examples of how simply twisting Chromatin within a mitochondrial (ZPE channel) cell structure results in SEMIOTICS expression and cell division/cloning (Representamen)… and this can be shown faithfully and measurably. (Norseen, 2002, Part. 7) The question becomes, how is the measuring done? To which Norseen has also provided some insights, speaking of using holography, which we also encountered in the work of Dr. Bar in terms of gravitational wave holography. Norseen also speaks of the gap junctions between neuronal cells – they correspond to a small enough distance for Casimir Effects to take place: It is only in the communications switching capacity of the brain — (no two neurons normally physically touch each other, therefore, this gap represents a switching capacity), and it is this switching capacity of several million objects that allows for our great mental scan and scope capabilities, not the Memory Storage in physical memory of proteins. This structure is almost limitless in the ability to generate Holonomic-holographic-like resonance patterns. In physical protein memory, there are parts of the brain that deal in one memory to one laid down protein. For instance, in the Fusiform Gyrus, the one-to-one memories of loved ones’ faces are stored in isomorphic recall conditions, whereas the rest of the brain is involved with undulating and regular modifications of the alternating calpain, induced plasticity of neurons and protein lay down, that occurs each time we introduce a new memory for codification. These functions normally take place during the delta frequency of deep-sleep patterns, only after repeated Rapid Eye Movement (REM) cycles trigger new memory consolidation. (Norseen, 2002, Part. 7) Here he is noting the difference between long-term memory, which can become encoded in proteins, and a holographic resonant model of memories before they become encoded as long-term memories. Not all resonances will become memories, though. Norseen has noted that to get a hologram of the brain state at a given time the Casimir Effect is employed. Another methodology he", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:247:e568ee37f4ee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2600, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 248, "text": "frequency of deep-sleep patterns, only after repeated Rapid Eye Movement (REM) cycles trigger new memory consolidation.

Not all resonances will become memories, though. Norseen has noted that to get a hologram of the brain state at a given time the Casimir Effect is employed. Another methodology he explicitly brings up in regard to measurements and modeling (holographic mapping) is the Zeeman Effect which he received from the Russians: I am into Continuous Wave Energy (CWE) using the Zeeman Effect (ZE), and refined by the Russkies under Zavoisky in ‘45, and picked up by the Japanese in the mid 80’s at Hitachi. It is even being used in conjunction with some deep space and HAARP projects and hyper spectral satellite transmissions groups to find gravity lenses, and ionosphere scintillation factors that corrupt GPS, etc. Anyway, in the human brain the combination of electric fields, biochemical plasma and magnetic dipoles [MT dipoles] set up conditions ripe for monitoring by CWE and the hyper spectral definitions come about by looking at the Zeeman Effect - the directions that the electrons take in the presence of the regular and applied magnetic field…you can peer right into the actual communications structures, the semiotics if you will, of the target. (Norseen, 2002, Part 8) …and right at the zone where Alfven Wave corridors of the brain Magnetite exchange ZPE in the dendritic neuropil at nanoscale [MTs], discrete bandwidth, channels. It is right here in the Marianas Trench of human thought/perception, that the person is exposed to the Universals of Quantum State potentials, and that each individual thought or Semiotic Identity is formed, only to then bubble or shoot right up to the surface of positive thought realms. Norseen here specifically mentions the Zeeman effect, which is of special interest because of the importance of Zeeman data in the analysis and theoretical interpretation of complex spectra used in Atomic spectroscopy and spectroscopy in general–the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation [see chapter 6, ‘Physics of Neuroweapons’ for HFGW spectroscopy of Dr. Robert Baker]. Pieter Zeeman effect: splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field (CWE radar of Norseen). It is analogous to the Stark effect, the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an electric field; splits, via changing angular momentum, a spectral line say 400nm into a more energetic line, it’s normative line and a less energetic line, 3 lines. Since the distance between the Zeeman sub-levels is a function of magnetic field strength, this effect can be used to measure magnetic field strength, e.g., that of the Sun and other stars or in laboratory plasmas.

The Zeeman effect is very important in applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Mossbauer spectroscopy. A theory about the magnetic sense of birds assumes that a protein (cryptochrome-2) in the retina is changed due to the Zeeman effect. Humans have similar proteins in their eyes. Kernbach in experiments directly related to the work of Norseen has noted that earlier Russian versions of this technology used spectroscopy based on Impedance Spectroscopy, which uses Zeeman splitting. Kernbach also notes that this technology is used in Intelligence work: There are known cases of application of these methods in anti-terrorist, military and intelligence operations but they also have the nature of rare exceptions. Reaction from the academic community is quite polarized, although in the field of quantum research such a potential it is quite possible: ‘Quantum entanglement allows engineered quantum systems to exceed classical information processing bounds’, especially for biological systems, neurons, nervous system and brain (and ‘nonlocal functions’ of consciousness) (Kernbach, 2018) The proposed method for remote monitoring is based on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) with optical excitation and is a combination the notion of the two systems …. The essence method is to create a entangled system from a remote object and a measuring container with liquid. A new element is the introduction of optical IC excitation at two wavelengths 470 / 940nm into the measuring system. Experiments with LED demonstrated the property of transmission of influence between two entangled macrosystems therefore, it is assumed that in the presence of an optical the excitation of the container with water will be the impact is also the remote object. Necessary bridging of EM radiation for entangling macro objects other authors also paid attention. Measuring the excitation of electrochemical dynamics water system, it is possible to express this impact result in numbers. The more ‘active’ the remote object is etc., the more intense the EIS deflection will be from an unexcited state. A numerical estimate uses a statistical method to characterization of electrochemical noise, which has proven itself in other EIS applications. Thus, this method makes it possible to estimate the degree of the level of ‘activity’ of a remote object is its way to influence other objects. By observations, this property is characterized by biological organisms, generators, shape effects, certain processes.

By observations, this property is characterized by biological organisms, generators, shape effects, certain processes. An interesting area of study is the ‘activity’ of information (sym-free) objects, which brings us back to the discussion in work on the possible independent character of the sym-free structures. ‘Activity’ can stimulate or depress the dynamics of the corresponding channel. These changes can be expressed in terms of entropy (negentropy) and associate with the state of the remote object. This moment is especially interesting when working with pathogenic objects/zones, allowing casting of their possible parameters without direct contact. Experiments have shown the same possibility of selective detection of global ‘informational/cosmo-biological’ events. In tests with humans, when volunteers with sufficient level of sensitivity were informed of the beginning of the measurements, various subjective reactions occurred – dizziness, specific ‘tingling/burning’ on the skin, changes in state of consciousness and sleep patterns. If the subject is not new to the measurement process, he could determine in most cases, the fact of measurement, however there was an error in determining the measurement time. With short-term use, this method can be used for self-diagnosis, for example, when taking info-ceutical drugs or with psycho mental training (yoga, meditation, various practices), in the experiments there was a correlation between the current psycho-physiological state and the received data. (Kernbach, 2018) Others Kernbach points to in Russia working on ‘Quantum Indexing of Entangled Macro Objects’ during the Soviet era were Shkatov, Kravchenko, Savelyev [who worked with Okatrin, see below]. With this ability to alter brain, nervous systems with nonlocal functions of consciousness would be one of the most valuable assets any military commander could have, hence, we see the importance the KGB put behind developing these technologies. Indeed, the Soviet Military was involved in this research: The test of the Radiation installation in military unit 71592, where this installation was created (in the Novosibirsk region), has become well-known. A report on this test was heard at the Institute of Radio Engineering and Electronics of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The authors of the invention called the report “Impact on biological objects by modulated electrical and electromagnetic impulses.” Regarding the spectroscopy involved it is interesting that in one presentation for the product GeoScan System speaks of referencing hyper dimensions in their program; in this use instance it is able to penetrate kilometers of earth to find mineral deposits, when radar can only penetrates a few meters (Geoscan 2016). Again, this research was also looked into by the Soviets from at least the 1970s.

Again, this research was also looked into by the Soviets from at least the 1970s. (Sokolova, 2016) The operating intensity of the cerebrum has been measured and calculated to be in the 1 to 100pT range with a wide band of coefficients. From this context it is interesting that kg/As^(*)1/s or the mass of an electron divided by a unit charge multiplied by 7Hz is 9.1 x 10^( − 31)kg/1.6 x 10^( − 19)As^(*)7Hz(1/s) or 40x10^( − 12) T. This relationship is closely coupled to the Zeeman effect whereby the application of a magnetic field produces an additional or a third spectral line in an absorption spectrum by inducing different quantum levels. The change in angular frequency with an applied field of 40 x 10^( − 12) T would be, according to classic Zeeman formula solutions, the product of 4x10^( − 11)T^(*)1.6x10^( − 19) As divided by 12.56^(*)9.1x10^( − 31)kg or about 0.6Hz . However, in non-angular systems it would be 7Hz [Schumann Resonance]. (Persinger, 2010, 818) Persinger here seems to correlate the rate of Alpha Brain Waves with the Zeeman effect’s angular momentum, suggesting that the reason that at 7Hz the entire brain is vibrating, which is also the Schumann Resonance of the Ionosphere, in other works Persinger has suggested that there is some memory connection to the EM in the ionosphere and particular individual brain memories, remote storage of memories in the ionosphere. Another area that is of interest in terms of mapping is the ability to measure brain waves. The Casimir effect plays a direct role in these waves, as the effect creates the contracting and expanding of neuron cells. Duncan Laurie gave this encapsulation of Norseen’s presentation on the creation of brain waves: The communications described are instantaneous, and to describe how that is possible, Norseen introduced two additional factors: Zero Point Energy and Alfven Waves. Zero Point Waves (ZPE) having been introduced earlier in the manuscript. This energy of the vacuum has actually been measured and is called the Casimir Effect. The Casimir Effect is measurable when two metal plates are placed extremely close together (1 nanometer). The vacuum created interferes with the flow of ZPE and has been scientifically measured. The result is that the plates are drawn together, as if by magnetic attraction. Norseen points out by comparison that the identical 1 nanometer distance is the distance between brain cells, thereby implying a stage for ZPE coupling. As these distances open and close between the cells, a signal impressed upon the ZPE [virtual particles in a vacuum]", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:251:4aaa124ad805", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2604, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 252, "text": "plates are placed extremely close together (1 nanometer).

Norseen points out by comparison that the identical 1 nanometer distance is the distance between brain cells, thereby implying a stage for ZPE coupling. As these distances open and close between the cells, a signal impressed upon the ZPE [virtual particles in a vacuum] can be generated out in the 5 − 30Hz . range. How it becomes an instantaneous signal reaching anywhere in the universe is accomplished by the Alfven Wave (AW). Norseen’s definition of Alfven waves is that of a magnetic string stretched out, and then impinged upon by unique traveling magnetic resonant structures…like plucking a magnetic harp. Theoretically, Alfven waves interconnect all parts of the universe via magnetic fields. Magnetite within the brain cells connect local magnetic swirls to the magnetic river or storms existing locally or outside our magnetosphere. Norseen describes the AW as a universal plasma that extends between local and non-local events, capable of carrying semiotic communications via directed ZPE [virtual particles in a vacuum] pulsation. These signals are capable of penetrating the magnetic storm, in the same way radio signals penetrate our congested airways carrying selective information from point to point. (Norseen, 2002) Here Norseen seems to suggest that to observe brain state, you need an EM field (Alfven Wave Grid), which can also be a correlate to a Gravitational Field, perhaps using gravito-electromagnetics (GEM). An Alfven Wave is a wave behavior of magnetic grid lines, if you could imagine those grid lines as the surface of an ocean, then the Alfven Waves would be surfable. A more technical definition is given: In a compressible fluid, the pressure acts as a restoring force, and one obtains sound waves. The combination is magneto-acoustic waves, which have three modes: i) unchanged Alfvén mode, because it is incompressible; and sound waves modified into two coupled slow (ii) and fast (iii) modes. Considering a stratified fluid (e.g., an atmosphere) and adding gravity as a restoring force, one has magneto-acoustic-gravity waves and Alfvén-gravity waves decouple only if the horizontal wave-vector (which exists only in the direction transverse to stratification) lies in the plane of gravity and the external magnetic field. Adding rotation and the Coriolis force as the fourth restoring force leads to magneto-acoustic-gravity-inertial waves for which decoupling of Alfvén-gravity modes is generally not possible.

Although there are in these plasmas magneto-gravity wave. A magneto-gravity wave is an acoustic gravity wave which is associated with fluctuations in the background magnetic field. In this context, gravity wave refers to a classical fluid wave, and is completely unrelated to the relativistic gravitational wave, see Gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect in Ch. 9. Although, as we know the Alfven Wave Grid would and does interact with gravity, thus producing gravitational waves, and one would also be able to interact with the Alfven EM Grid, as explained by Norseen, with gravitational waves. In 1985 P.P. Belyaev … discovered a resonant structure of electromagnetic noise at frequencies below the first harmonic of the Schumann resonance. It turned out that Alfvén waves in the ionosphere form an Alfvén resonator with an oscillation frequency that depends on the thickness of the ionosphere, the strength of the Earth’s magnetic field and the concentration of ionospheric plasma particles… the resonant frequency of the Alfvén resonator varies within 0.5 − 3.0Hz… the amplification of the Alfvén resonance phenomenon occurs at night, in the daytime the amplitude of resonance increases decreases to the values of ordinary noise… historical “adjustment” to the rhythms of the ionosphere…, synchronization of delta - and theta - rhythms with the frequencies of the Alfvén resonator, most likely, did take place I am not aware of any working HFGW surveillance at the time of Norseen’s engineering work at Lockheed-Martin; it would be shortly after Norseen ended his work at Lockheed that Dr. Baker would write to the NSA regarding such technology. In interviews Norseen indicated a small local Radar system was to be deployed to do neural scanning of suspected terrorists at airports. As we know a gravitational signal receiver/transmitter can do the type of spectroscopy that was done with Radar alone before, but with added resolution. One other note in relation to Alfven Waves is that they are usually associated with Solar plasmas, in the inner solar corona of Stars. It is known that during Solar Storms, vast EM discharges from the Sun that are shielded from the Earth by the Atmosphere, correlate with decreased ‘psi’ ability according to Dr. Persinger and earlier Russian studies, related to breaking the static conditions of the EM Field as rapidly increasing levels from solar coronal masses make their way to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:253:00f56f196c28", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2606, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 254, "text": "other note in relation to Alfven Waves is that they are usually associated with Solar plasmas, in the inner solar corona of Stars.

Also, the relationship to geomagnetic plasmas in the inner core of the earth may also have a relationship to Dr. Persinger’s proposal to predict earthquakes based on EM discharges. Kravkov explains the relationship of Schumann Resonance, Alfven Waves and Consciousness: “It has been experimentally revealed that the brain, as an oscillatory system, has a high Q factor. With a simple forced resonance of a linear system with a high-quality factor, the amplitude of the oscillations increases significantly only when the natural frequency and the frequency of the external influence exactly coincide.” The basic rhythms of the human brain are as follows: • Delta-rhythm, rhythm of a sleeping person, sinusoidal, F = 0.3–4.0Hz; • theta-rhythm, rhythm of a completely relaxed state and transition to a state of sleep, anesthesia, sinusoidal, F = 4–8Hz ; • alpha-rhythm, the rhythm of a waking person, dominant in the occipital parts of the brain, is associated with the ability of abstract thinking, sinusoidal, F = 9 − 13Hz . s we’ve seen, Dr. Norseen directly cites the work of Hameroff-Penrose on ORCH-OR as the model or physical explanation for Quantum Shift Keying, which is to say changing or monitoring the brain maps of a given target, thus directly affecting cognitive function of that brain targeted. ORCH-OR has also had its detractors, such as Stefan Koch. The most direct explanation of ORCH-OR was given by Hameroff in his 2014 paper: ‘Orchestrated objective reduction’ (‘Orch OR’) is a theory which proposes that consciousness consists of a sequence of discrete events, each being a moment of ‘objective reduction’ (OR) of a quantum state (according to the DP scheme), where it is taken that these quantum states exist as parts of a quantum computations carried on primarily in neuronal microtubules. Such OR events would have to be ‘orchestrated’ in an appropriate way (Orch OR), for genuine consciousness to arise. OR itself is taken to be ubiquitous in physical actions, representing the ‘bridge’ between the quantum and classical worlds, where quantum superpositions between pairs of states get spontaneously resolved into classical alternatives in a timescale ∼ τ , calculated from the amount of mass displacement that there is between the two states. In our own brains, the OR process that evoke consciousness, would be actions that connect brain biology (quantum computations in microtubules) with the fine scale structure of space–time geometry, the most", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:254:3eae81ab8e65", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2607, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 255, "text": "taken to be ubiquitous in physical actions, representing the ‘bridge’ between the quantum and classical worlds, where quantum superpositions between pairs of states get spontaneously resolved into classical alternatives in a timescale ∼ τ , calculated from the amount of mass displacement that there is between the two states. In our own brains, the OR process that evoke consciousness, would be actions that connect brain biology (quantum computations in microtubules) with the fine scale structure of space–time geometry, the most basic level of the universe [Norseen’s ZPE], where tiny quantum space–time displacements are taken to be responsible for OR. The Orch-OR proposal therefore stretches across a considerable range of areas of science, touching upon the foundations of general relativity and quantum mechanics, in unconventional ways, in addition to the more obviously relevant areas such as neuroscience, cognitive science, molecular biology, and philosophy. It is not surprising, therefore, that Orch OR has been persistently criticized from many angles since its introduction in 1994. Nonetheless, the Orch OR scheme has so far stood the test of time better than most other schemes, and it is particularly distinguished from other proposals by the many scientifically tested, and potentially testable, ingredients that it depends upon. It should be mentioned that various aspects of the Orch OR theory have themselves evolved in response to scientific advances and, in some cases, constructive criticism. We here list some recent adaptations and developments that we have now incorporated into the theory. • Alzheimer’s disease, brain trauma and other disorders are related to microtubule disturbances; promising therapies are being aimed at BC in the brain. • Scale invariant (1/f, ‘fractal-like’) processes at neuronal and network levels might perhaps extend downward to intra-neuronal BC in microtubules, e.g. megahertz excitations. • Orch OR conscious moments, e.g. at 40 Hz, are now viewed as ‘beat frequencies’ of BC megahertz in MTs, the slower beat frequencies coupled to neuronal membrane physiology and accounting for EEG correlates of consciousness. The Orch OR proposal suggests conscious experience is intrinsically connected to the fine-scale structure of space– time geometry, and that consciousness could be deeply related to the operation of the laws of the universe. (Hameroff, 2014) Hameroff and Watt suggested that distinct tubulin dipoles and conformational states—mechanical changes in protein shape—could represent information, with MT lattices acting as two-dimensional Boolean switching matrices with input/output computation occurring via MAPs. MT information processing has also been viewed in the context of cellular (‘molecular’) automata (‘microtubule automata’) in which tubulin dipole and conformational states interact with neighbor tubulin states in hexagonal MT lattices by dipole couplings, synchronized by biomolecular coherence as proposed by Fröhlich. Protein conformational changes occur at multiple scales, e.g. 10^( − 6)s to 10^( − 11) s transitions.

Coordinated movements of the protein’s atomic nuclei, far more massive than electrons, require energy and generate heat. ….recent Orch OR papers do not make use of conformational changes, depending instead on tubulin dipole states alone to represent information. Within MTs, each tubulin may differ from among its neighbors due to genetic variability, post-translational modifications, phosphorylation states, binding of ligands and MAPs, and moment-to-moment conformational and/or dipole state transitions. Synaptic inputs can register information in dendritic–somatic MTs in brain neurons by metabotropic receptors, MAP2, and CaMKII, [Norseen’s Calpain] a hexagonal holoenzyme able to convey calcium ion influx to MT lattices by phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Thus tubulins in MTs can each exist in multiple possible states, perhaps dozens or more. However for simplicity, models of MT automata consider only two alternative tubulin states, i.e. binary ‘bits.’ Another potential factor arises from the specific geometry of MT lattices in which helical winding pathways (in the A-lattice) repeat according to the Fibonacci sequence (3, 5, 8…) and may correlate with conduction pathways. Dipoles aligned along such pathways may be favored (and coupled to MT mechanical vibrations) thus influencing MT automata computation. MT automata based on tubulin dipoles in hexagonal lattices show high capacity integration and learning…. Finally, MT information processing may be directly related to activities at larger scale levels of neurons and neuronal networks through something of the nature of scale-invariant dynamics. Several lines of evidence point to fractal-like (1/f) self-similarity over different spatio-temporal scales in brain dynamics and structure. These are generally considered at the scale levels of neurons and higher-level neuronal networks but may extend downward in size (and higher frequency) to intra-neuronal MT dynamics, spanning 4 or 5 scale levels over many orders of magnitude. MT information processing depends on interactive dipole states of individual tubulin proteins. What are those states, and how are they governed?” In this technical explanation of information processing an important point is that “MT information processing depends on interactive dipole states of individual tubulin proteins.” Another important point he makes is that MT information processing is scale-invariant with fractal-like self-similarity. This is also seen not just in the brain but also in the human eye where cones and rods match a Fibonacci sequence in an octagonal antenna for EM. This is also seen in DNA. Helical structures are also designed by Dr. Baker in his HFGW receiver/transmitter, using a double helix like DNA.

Given that these structures may be scale-free fractal-based patterns there may be a reason that the Retina Antenna is similar to brain information processing. The manipulation of MT dipoles may be the key in Norseen’s QSK. It is also important to note that the binary model was a toy model created for a simple explanation of information processing. If we are talking about Quantum computation then we are probably talking about qubits or qutrits. A qubit reduces to O or 1 with a temporary superposition 0,1. A qutrit reduces to 0,1,2 with the superposed state maintaining its own state without a binary collapse, objective reduction. A final point regarding computation is that Hameroff-Penrose do not see human consciousness as something computable, rather they view it as non-computable, their colleague Badhyapadhyay has created a project, Artificial Brain (not AI), based on the resonant model of dipole switching (shifting) in MT’s. In Penrose, the tentatively suggested OR proposal would have its onset determined by a condition referred to there as ‘the one-graviton’ criterion. However, in Penrose, a much better-founded criterion was used, now frequently referred to as the Diósi–Penrose proposal (henceforth ‘DP’; see Diósi’s earlier work, which was a similar gravitational scheme, though not motivated via specific general-relativistic principles). The DP proposal gives an objective physical threshold, providing a plausible lifetime for quantum-superposed states. Other gravitational OR proposals have been put forward, from time to time as solutions to the measurement problem, suggesting modifications of standard quantum mechanics, but all these differ from DP in important respects. Among these, only the DP proposal (in its role within Orch OR) has been suggested as having anything to do with the consciousness issue. The DP proposal is sometimes referred to as a ‘quantum-gravity’ scheme, but it is not part of the normal ideas used in quantum gravity… Moreover, the proposed connection between consciousness and quantum measurement is almost opposite [Copenhagen Interpretation, Heisenberg], in the Orch OR scheme, to the kind of idea that had frequently been put forward in the early days of quantum mechanics (see, for example Wigner) which suggests that a ‘quantum measurement’ is something that occurs only as a result of the conscious intervention of an observer. Rather, the DP proposal suggests each OR event, which is a purely physical process, is itself a primitive kind of ‘observation’, a moment of ‘proto-conscious experience.’ This issue, also, will be discussed below. It is a very important distinction that Hameroff-Penrose are making here in terms of the reduction or collapse of the quantum wave into a fixed state.

It is a very important distinction that Hameroff-Penrose are making here in terms of the reduction or collapse of the quantum wave into a fixed state. In the Copenhagen Interpretation the observer plays a role in collapse, in D-P the collapse has no ‘conscious’ element, it rather is based on the effects of gravity. In this sense of being a purely physical process alone, it is like P. Jordan’s ideals: “there were times when a quantum system effectively observed itself, by collapsing into a specific state rather than remaining in a superposition of states. This does not need any ‘conscious observer,’ as had been argued by John von Neumann and Eugene Wigner, but it does need decoherence (and collapse) of the wave function that prevents further interference of various possibilities.” (https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/ scientists/jordan/ [accessed 7/19/19]) OR and quantum gravity Diósi–Penrose objective reduction (DP) is a particular proposal for an extension of current quantum mechanics, taking the bridge between quantum- and classical-level physics as a ‘quantum-gravitational’ phenomenon. This is in contrast with the various conventional viewpoints, whereby this bridge is claimed to result, somehow, from ‘environmental decoherence’, or from ‘observation by a conscious observer’, or from a ‘choice between alternative worlds’, or some other interpretation of how the classical world of one actual alternative may be taken to arise out of fundamentally quantum-superposed ingredients. The DP version of OR involves a different interpretation of the term ‘quantum gravity’ from what is usual. Current ideas of quantum gravity (see, for example, Smolin) normally refer, instead, to some sort of physical scheme that is to be formulated within the bounds of standard quantum field theory—although no particular such theory, among the multitude that has so far been put forward, has gained anything approaching universal acceptance, nor has any of them found a fully consistent, satisfactory formulation. ‘OR’ here refers to the alternative viewpoint that standard quantum (field) theory is not the final answer, and that the reduction R of the quantum state (‘collapse of the wavefunction’) that is adopted in standard quantum mechanics is an actual physical process which is not part of the conventional unitary formalism U of quantum theory (or quantum field theory). In the DP version of OR, the reduction R of the quantum state does not arise as some kind of convenience or effective consequence of environmental decoherence, etc., as the conventional U formalism would seem to demand, but is instead taken to be one of the consequences of melding together the principles of Einstein’s general relativity with those of the conventional unitary quantum formalism U, and this demands a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:258:c5188a4ac5b1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2611, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 259, "text": "conventional unitary formalism U of quantum theory (or quantum field theory).

According to this OR viewpoint, any quantum measurement—whereby the quantum-superposed alternatives produced in accordance with the U formalism becomes reduced to a single actual occurrence—is a real objective physical process, and it is taken to result from the mass displacement between the alternatives being sufficient, in gravitational terms, for the superposition to become unstable. In the DP scheme for OR, the superposition reduces to one of the alternatives in a timescale τ that can be estimated (for a superposition of two states each of which is assumed to be taken to be stationary on its own) according to the formula τ ≈ h/E_(G) . An important point to make about τ_(ı) however, is that it represents merely a kind of average time (Hameroff, 2014) It is helpful to have a conceptual picture of quantum superposition in a gravitational context. According to modern accepted physical theories, reality is rooted in 3-dimensional space and a 1-dimensional time, combined together into a 4-dimensional [Minkoswki] space–time. This space–time is slightly curved, in accordance with Einstein’s general theory of relativity, in a way which encodes the gravitational fields of all distributions of mass density. Each different choice of mass density effects a space–time curvature in a different, albeit a very tiny, way. This is the standard picture according to classical physics. On the other hand, when quantum systems have been considered by physicists, this mass-induced tiny curvature in the structure of space–time has been almost invariably ignored, gravitational effects having been assumed to be totally insignificant for normal problems in which quantum theory is important. Surprising as it may seem, however, such tiny differences in space–time structure can have large effects, for they entail subtle but fundamental influences on the very rules of quantum mechanics. The degree of separation between the space–time sheets is a more abstract mathematical thing; it would be more appropriately described in terms of a symplectic measure on the space of 4-dimensional metrics but the details (and difficulties) of this will not be important for us here. It may be noted, however, that this separation is a space–time separation, not just a spatial one. Thus the time of separation contributes as well as the spatial displacement.

It is the product of the temporal separation T with the spatial separation S that measures the overall degree of separation, and OR takes place when this overall separation reaches the critical amount. In the absence of a coherent theory of quantum gravity there is no accepted way of handling such a superposition as a separation (or bifurcation) of space–time geometry, or in any other way. Indeed the basic principles of Einstein’s general relativity begin to come into profound conflict with those of quantum mechanics. Some form of OR is needed. The OR process is considered to occur when quantum superpositions between such slightly differing space–times take place (Fig. 9), differing from one another by an integrated space–time measure which compares with the fundamental and extremely tiny Planck (4-volume) scale of space–time geometry. As remarked above, this is a 4-volume Planck measure, involving both time and space, so we find that the time measure would be particularly tiny when the space-difference measure is relatively large (as with Schrödinger’s hypothetical cat), but for extremely tiny space difference measures, the time measure might be fairly long. For example, an isolated single electron in a superposed state (very low EG) might reach OR threshold only after thousands of years or more, whereas if Schrödinger’s (∼10 kg) cat were to be put into a superposition, of life and death, this threshold could be reached in far less than even the Planck time of 10−43 s. As already noted, the degree of separation between the space–time sheets is technically a symplectic measure on the space of 4-metrics which is a space–time separation, not just a spatial one, the time of separation contributing as well as spatial displacement. Roughly speaking, it is the product of the temporal separation T with the spatial separation S that measures the overall degree of separation, and (DP) OR takes place when this overall separation reaches a critical amount. This critical amount would be of the order of unity, in absolute units, for which the Planck–Dirac constant h^(−) , the gravitational constant G, and the velocity of light c_(j) all take the value unity. For small S, the lifetime τ ≈ T of the superposed state will be large; on the other hand, if S is large, then τ will be small. To estimate S, we compute (in the Newtonian limit of weak gravitational fields) the gravitational self-energy EG of the difference between the mass distributions of the two superposed states.

(That is, one mass distribution counts positively and the other, negatively.) The quantity S is then given by: S ≈ EG and T ≈ τ , whence τ ≈ h/EG , i.e. E G ≈ h/τ. Thus, the DP expectation is that OR occurs with the resolving out of one particular space–time geometry from the previous superposition when, on the average, τ ≈ h/E G. The Orch-OR scheme adopts DP as a physical proposal, but it goes further than this by attempting to relate this particular version of OR to the phenomenon of consciousness. Accordingly, the ‘choice’ involved in any quantum state-reduction process would be accompanied by a (minuscule) proto-element of experience, which we refer to as a moment of proto-consciousness, but we do not necessarily refer to this as actual consciousness for reasons to be described. With such a simple mechanism of collapsing the wave function, rather than ‘observers’ or ‘decoherence’ we have a straight-forward measure of reduction. In a later section Hameroff discusses the question of Quantum Computing in the Brain, this would correlate with the ‘cryptological’ QSK of Dr. John Norseen. A long passage which goes over QC in MTs is given by Hameroff: 5.1. Quantum computing in the brain Penrose [23,24] suggested that consciousness depends in some way on processes of the general nature of quantum computations occurring in the brain, these being terminated by some form of OR. Here the term ‘quantum computation’ is being used in a loose sense, in which information is encoded in some discrete (not necessarily binary) physical form, and where the evolution is determined according to the U process (Schrödinger’s equation). … A proposal was made in Penrose [23] that something analogous to quantum computing, proceeding by the Schrödinger equation without decoherence, could well be acting in the brain, but where, for conscious processes, this would have to terminate in accordance with some threshold for self-collapse by a form of non-computable OR.

Synaptic inputs could ‘orchestrate’ tubulin states governed by quantum dipoles, leading to tubulin superposition in vast numbers of microtubules all involved quantum-coherently together in a large-scale quantum state, where entanglement and quantum computation takes place during integration. The termination, by OR, of this orchestrated quantum computation at the end of integration phases would select microtubule states which could then influence and regulate axonal firings, thus controlling conscious behavior. Quantum states in dendrites and soma of a particular neuron could entangle with microtubules in the dendritic tree of that neuron, and also in neighboring neurons via dendritic–dendritic (or dendritic–interneuron–dendritic) gap junctions, enabling quantum entanglement of superposed microtubule tubulins among many neurons (Fig. 1)… In dendrites and soma of brain neurons, synaptic inputs could encode memory in alternating classical phases, thereby avoiding random environmental decoherence to ‘orchestrate’ U quantum processes, enabling them to reach threshold at time τ for orchestrated objective reduction ‘Orch OR’ by τ ≈ h/E_(G) . At that time, according to this proposal, a moment of conscious experience occurs, and tubulin states [which would be Norseen QSK encoded] are selected which influence axonal firing, encode memory and regulate synaptic plasticity…the idea is that consciousness is associated with this (gravitational) OR process, but occurs significantly only when (1) the alternatives are part of some highly organized cognitive structure capable of information processing, so that OR occurs in an extremely orchestrated form, with vast numbers of microtubule acting coherently, in order that there is sufficient mass displacement overall, for the τ ≈ h/E_(G) criterion to be satisfied. Only then does a recognizably conscious Orch OR event take place. On the other hand, we may consider that any individual occurrence of OR without orchestration would be a moment of random proto-consciousness lacking cognition and meaningful content. We shall be seeing orchestrated OR in more detail shortly, together with its particular relevance to microtubules. In any case, we recognize that the experiential elements of proto-consciousness would be intimately tied in with the most primitive Planck-level ingredients of space–time geometry, these presumed ‘ingredients’ being taken to be at the absurdly tiny level of 10^( − 35)m [Baker’s HFGW resolution] and $1 0 ^ { - 4 3 } \\ : s _ { \\mathrm { \\scriptscriptstyle { 1 } } }$ , a distance and a time some 20 orders of magnitude smaller than those of normal particle-physics scales and their most rapid processes, and they are smaller by far than biological scales and processes.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:262:7b188fdee0cf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2615, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 263, "text": "Planck-level ingredients of space–time geometry, these presumed ‘ingredients’ being taken to be at the absurdly tiny level of 10^( − 35)m [Baker’s HFGW resolution] and $1 0 ^ { - 4 3 } \\ : s _ { \\mathrm { \\scriptscriptstyle { 1 } } }$ , a distance and a time some 20 orders of magnitude smaller than those of normal particle-physics scales and their most rapid processes, and they are smaller by far than biological scales and processes. These scales refer only to the normally extremely tiny differences in space–time geometry between different states in superposition, the separated states themselves being enormously larger. OR is deemed to take place when such tiny space–time differences reach the Planck level (roughly speaking). Owing to the extreme weakness of gravitational forces as compared with those of the chemical and electric forces of biology, the energy E_(G) is liable to be far smaller than any energy that arises directly from biological processes. OR acts, effectively, instantaneously as a choice between dynamical alternatives (a choice that is an integral part of the relevant quantum dynamics) and E_(G) is not to be thought of as being in direct competition with any of the usual biological energies, as it plays a completely different role, supplying a needed energy uncertainty that then allows a choice to be made between the separated space–time geometries, rather than providing an actual energy that enters into any considerations of energy balance that would be of direct relevance to chemical or normal physical processes. Another colleague of Hameroff ’s who supports the ORCH-OR theory is the research scientist that works with physical materials at a Japanese Materials Science lab is Dr. Anirban Badhyapadhyay. There is a convergence between Dr. Persinger and Dr. Bandyopadhyay’s research in studying the EM resonance of molecular materials. Both cite the work of Dr. Irene Cosic and her Resonant Recognition Model (RRM) which is an implementation of research carried out in the Soviet Union as early as the 1960s and earlier in Nazi Germany. Dr. Bandyopadhyay based his resonance research model on Cosic. Dr. Bandyopadhyay has found the following in studying Microtubules in which he examined tubulin, the MT and the Neuron with the same meteorology used by Kernbach, Impedance Spectroscopy: Here, we report a self-similar triplet of triplet resonance frequency pattern for the four-4 nm-wide tubulin protein, for the 25-nm-wide microtubule nanowire and 1-μm-wide axon initial segment of a neuron. Thus, preserving the symmetry of vibrations was a fundamental integration feature of the three materials. There was no self-similarity in the physical appearance: the size varied by 106 orders, yet, when they vibrated, the ratios of the frequencies changed in such a way that each of the three resonance frequency bands held three more bands inside (triplet of triplet).

This is why three elements, a protein, it’s complex and neuron resonated in 106 orders of different time domains, yet their vibrational frequencies grouped similarly. Our work supports already-existing hypotheses for the scale-free information integration in the brain from molecular scale to the cognition.

Similar to the microtubule and the neuron cell, we observed here triplet of triplet resonance bands (Figure 3c right). Normally, it was believed that electromagnetic resonance depends on the carriers, dispersion relation in a classic textbook would show how at different frequency regions, different carriers resonate. However, the classic dispersion relation presented in the textbooks, do not consider self-similar symmetry structures at all scales. (Bandyopadhyay 2020) The axon core, microtubule and tubulin have self-similar bands, with a common frequency region, a similar structural symmetry governs the resonance in all the three systems. Helical distribution of neural branches, rings of proteins in the axonal core, spirals of proteins in the microtubule, α helices in the proteins, are the common structures, and the resonant energy transmission in generic spiral symmetry follows a quantized behavior. Sahu et al. have patented this feature of microtubule as a new class of fourth circuit element. Hence, a spiral symmetry possibly ensures coupling of all the periodic oscillations. (Bandyopadhyay, 2020) An earlier finding of Dr. Bandyopadhyay was that the water channels inside microtubules were responsible for conduction of electrical signals which control the EM field within the microtubule. We shall read later in the work of Dr. Persinger that virtual particles (Norseen’s ZPE) are a part of water Casimir effect, Bandyopadhyay remarks: The large tunneling current across 25 nm wide microtubule (insulator) is not via tubulin-water-tubulin route, the water core should act as a current source by storing charges. Dried microtubule does not show energy levels identical to tubulin protein, therefore, the water channel holds the proteins in a mechanism that does not allow splitting of energy levels of tubulins (Bandyopadhyay, 2013, 145) The delocalization feature is responsible for four-probe unique conductivity, and automated noise management; again, delocalization disappears if water channel is removed.

Then, at a higher bias 42 V , protofilaments disintegrate in one scan. In the atomic force microscope (AFM) measurement, protofilaments do not break apart. In the AFM images, only helical tubulin rings are visible, while STM images show only longitudinal protofilaments, when water is inside, otherwise, it is a disintegrated mass of proteins. This suggests that the water channel controls microtubule’s internal conductivity and force modulation. In TEM, both helical ring and longitudinal fringes due to the water channel are visible, if water channel is released the fringes disappear and rings split… (Bandyopadhyay, 2013, 145) Microtubule exhibits a perfectly square hysteresis behavior (Fig. 4a,b) (Damjanovic, 2006), it means the dipole moments of tubulin proteins rotate synchronously by ± 23^(∘) , which plays a vital role in switching the conductivity or memory states. The hysteresis area increases with the maximum applied bias [or Aharonov-Bohm potential]… (Bandyopadhyay, 2013, 145) Dielectric resonance frequencies of multiple proteins were mapped by applying two distinct kinds of electromagnetic fields one perpendicular to another. Such an orthogonal field-based splitting of energy exchange was never applied before to read the 2D interaction of the system profile over a large frequency range. Normally 1D transmission profiles are studied, the direction at which the input signal frequency is pumped along the same direction how much the carriers are pushed through is estimated as the response of the system. When a gating effect [EM Zeitgebers] is applied to all the three systems, additional dynamic feature hidden in the system is revealed by orthogonal fields. Such studies are regularly applied in transistor research. However, that is not the end. We speculate that if advanced further, it may be possible to map the higher-level dynamic features in the neuron, thus, we advance here the temporal correlations observed by Ghosh et al. and Agrawal et al. We have detailed how a 3D triplet of triplet band could be experimentally extracted from the three systems, located one inside another. The tubulins are located inside microtubule and the microtubules are located inside a neuron, if the 3D band architecture is also self-similar, it would mean that the three systems could exchange geometric information conformally, i.e., without losing the angular features of the geometric shape over a time domain of 10⁶ order in time scale.

(Bandyopadhyay 2020) s mentioned in the ‘Physics and Neuroweapons’ chapter Dr. Persinger was a research professor at Laurentian University. He duplicated earlier Soviet experiments in his labs, as well as interfaced with people attached to Stanford Research Institute. He investigated a research track that mirrors that of various military intelligence research labs throughout the world, with the caveat that his research was done with public funds at a parochial university working in the public interest. As such, he was never in a position to capitalize on his research as many other researchers in the field of neuroscience and physics have. As mentioned previously Dr. Persinger also concurred that ORCH-OR was a viable model for explaining Quantum Consciousness. He gives a very technical consideration to the issue: The quantity of energy 10^( − 20)J has direct application to the neuroquantum approaches to consciousness. The most popular is the “collapse of the wave function” as cogently articulated by Hameroff and Penrose. Their recent articulate article entitled, “Consciousness in the universe: a review of the ‘ORCH OR’ theory” reviews the essential concepts. The dichotomy of the existence of the electron as a particle or a wave within space is reflected by its classical width, of about 2 ⋅ 10^( − 15)m and its Compton wavelength, 10^( − 12)m, , derived from quantum concepts. Although there are several interpretations for this discrepancy, what is important here is that the discrepancy in length according to the Lorentz contraction requires a specific discrepancy between the speed of light (3.10⁸ m ⋅ s^( − 1)) and some very negligible value less than that velocity. The difference in energy equivalence for the electron at the velocities that would accommodate the Lorentz contraction is in the order of 10^( − 20) J. This could suggest that the increment of energy required for the “collapse of the wave function” is congruent with the quantum increment associated with a single action potential. By extension, millions of action potentials would affect millions of these functions. That the action potentials from only one neuron could affect the global state of the entire cerebral cortices has been reported by Li et al. Energies in the order of a few increments of 10^( − 20) J have been shown experimentally to alter the probability of an overt response. (Persinger, 2015c) He takes the ORCH-OR theory one step further by suggesting that the reduction of the wave form is able to be performed by a ‘single action potential’ which can alter the state of the whole brain; he identifies a measure of the energy behind this potential as 10^( −", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:266:dfba259b5dad", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2619, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 267, "text": "by Li et al.

He then points out: “Energies in the order of a few increments of 10^( − 20)J have been shown experimentally to alter the probability of an overt response.” Indeed, this would seem to confirm to some degree the claims of Dr. John Norseen of altering brain behavior with Thought Injection. It is also worth noting that responses are ‘probabilities’ not deterministic. A s seen from the work of Dr. Norseen, he notes the role of the Casimir Effect in generating brain waves such A as Alpha at 7Hz , etc.; and, we are talking about a Biological entity, so it necessarily has a large portion of water as its constituent parts. It is easy to overlook this most basic element of all biological entities for the last 3.5 billion years of evolution on this planet. As noted in the work of direct supporters of ORCH-OR in the work of Bandyopadhyay MT water controls EM, which gives a product – memories or what the more technical community calls Semi-states. It is also important to note where ideals of the Casimir Effect and Consciousness come from originally, which Dr. Persinger’s work replicates and also provides original methodologies and insights on work conducted in the Soviet Union directly under the sponsorship of the KGB; so obviously of importance to weapons and possibly even propulsion systems for ICBM, Star Wars, etc. The question is, where did the Soviets get their ideas regarding the importance of these things? It is noted that German nuclear engineers were brought to the Soviet Union; part of that work was the creation of Heavy Water, so obviously they would have understood a thing or two about the Casimir Effect and its role in heavy water; one would assume any nuclear engineering team anywhere would. It is also noted by Dr. Kernbach (2014), that alleged Psychotronic experiments were conducted at German run Soviet Nuclear Weapons labs in the 1950s for instance in Sukhumi under Hertz, who also worked with von Ardenne, who in the 1930s conducted research with reading brains in his research institute. Ardenne was also a nuclear engineer, held in prison in the Soviet Union after the war working on their nuclear program.

In the realist narrative, virtual particles pop up when observable particles get close together. They are emitted from one particle and absorbed by another, but they disappear before they can be measured. They transfer force between ordinary particles, giving them motion and life. For every different type of elementary particle (quark, photon, electron, etc.), there are also virtual quarks, virtual photons, and so on. (Rorvig 2020) The space occupied by a brain would be subject to the complex possibilities of the multidimensional spaces of Kaluza-Klein as well as the potential energy contained within the structure of space. Matter, defined as protons and electrons, occupy spaces of ∼ 10^( − 15)m . Between this level of discourse and the smallest conceptual increment of space, Planck’s Length (∼10^( − 35)m) [resolution of HFGW goes down to $1 0 ^ { - 3 7 } ]$ , there are inordinate degrees of freedom whose structures could contain latent energy. The boundary of “the smallest space” which has been considered Planck’s Length (1.62⋅10^( − 35)m) , includes the “virtual particles” of the zero-point potential of vacuum energies. They are functionally a modern equivalent of the 19th century concept of “ether” or a universal medium. These virtual particles exhibit zero-point fluctuations or Zitterbewegung which endow the property of “process” or a change as a function of time. Within these point fields, a changing electromagnetic boundary has the capacity to transform virtual particles, through Casimir processes, to “real” particles. Real particles are protons and electrons with the capacity to mediate local causality. Virtual particles would have the capacity to mediate “non-local” causality. (Persinger, 2015) There are several aspects to this understanding of virtual particles that are worth recollecting: 1. the brain interacts with hyperdimensions (Kaluza-Klein) 2. Quantum is associated with the Planck length, the level of existence of virtual particles, and hence the Casimir Effect, though it’s possible to see in the Classical world, an immanence of quantum existence, that engineers can work with. How all this relates to consciousness is best given in an overview of the significance of the Casimir Effect, and other EM effects Persinger gives the following: The explanations for the absolute nature of consciousness have been distributed historically along a continuum that ranges from extreme materialism to idealism. Consequently, the fundamental operations of most philosophies range from the assumption consciousness is determined by the physical laws of matter and energy to energy and matter as being constructs or “creations” of consciousness.

Within the quantum domain that includes Casimir phenomena whereby virtual particles can be transformed under optimal conditions to particles with mass, there are other perspectives. The perspective developed in this paper is that consciousness is a boundary condition between a singularity (black hole) and space within the brain [hippocampus]. … One traditional approach to pursuing the validity of concepts that are difficult, but not impossible, to verify experimentally is to pursue the consistency of the quantitative solutions that relate central components to the theory. We assume here that the central mass unit associated with the physical bases of the phenomena that define our reality is the simplest complex of a proton and an electron, the hydrogen atom. Metrics related to these phenomena should be related in a meaningful and systematic manner to the key parameters that occur at the level of the synapse and the neuronal plasma membrane ion channel as well as the values that define the boundaries of our current concepts of the smallest (∼10^( − 35)m) and largest (∼10²⁶m) spaces. The human brain is the matter within a volume that may contain properties that facilitate the transformation of virtual particles existing at the level Planck’s length to actual matter. As indicated by Bordag et al. an infinite vacuum energy of quantized electromagnetic field in free Minkowski space can be shown to allow a finite force between two parallel neutral plates. This Casimir force involves the existence of zero-point oscillations which are associated with the point values of a quantized field. Boundaries composed of matter polarize the vacuum of a quantized field. The energy over distance is a consequence of the result of vacuum polarization by an external field. One of the possibilities of vacuum quantum effects is the creation of particles from the vacuum by external fields. Energy is transferred from the external field to virtual particles or vacuum oscillations, much like Eddington’s formulation, to produce real particles. However, this effect of transformation requires the boundary condition to be a function of time (time varying) rather than static conditions. In other words, a transformation of the state of particles occurs when there is a changing electromagnetic field that contributes to or defines a boundary condition. The degrees of freedom for this potential are markedly enhanced by the unique property of attraction or repulsion depending upon the geometry and topology of the quantized manifold or shape. The recursive, changing electromagnetic fields, much like a classical tensor, that occurs within synaptic space and across the cerebral cortical manifold during the ∼ 20ms", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:269:575833d24c31", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2622, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 270, "text": "other words, a transformation of the state of particles occurs when there is a changing electromagnetic field that contributes to or defines a boundary condition.

The synapse, the primary interface between two neurons, is effectively two plates where the width is much larger than the separation between the apposing boundaries of a Casimir condition. These “plates” are in the order of 1,000 to 2, 000nm wide and are separated by 10nm . Assuming a width of 2μm (an area of 4 ⋅ 10^( − 12)m², ), the Casimir force during discrete intervals of neutrality between the “plates” or boundaries would be about 0.5 microNewtons. When applied across the 10 nm synaptic cleft, the energy would be 14 0.5 10 . J. The frequency equivalence of that energy, when divided by Planck’s constant (6.624⋅10^( − 34)J⋅s) , is . 078 ⋅ 10²⁰Hz . The equivalent wavelength, assuming c is the velocity of light in a vacuum is 3.8 ⋅ 10^( − 11)m or 38pm . This length is within error measurement of the width of the neutral hydrogen atom. Such convergence would be expected between Casimir transformations from virtual to real particles and the component that composes 90% of the matter in the universe. Hydrogen is the essential unit by which aggregates of heavier elements are formed. (Persinger, 2013) Returning to Bandyopadhyay’s work on demonstrating that virtual particles affect conduction and EM patterns in Microtubules through waters and brain EEG rhythms, which is to say Consciousness, it is important to understand the role of the Casimir Effect in terms of water. Persinger has studied the role of Casimir Effect of thixotropy of water (relating to viscosity), and in more general terms in entangled states, between two non-local water samples united by a changing velocity EM field, through a local device (a circular pointing vector emitter), which was also used by Kernbach (2017b). He cites Akimov generators as the basis of their usage, they being circular versions of the Akimov generators. Serge Kernbach replicated earlier Soviet experiments on distant influencing of biological organisms. The original experiment of A.E.

Before going into the experimental results and setup of this replication we will first review the history of this research with secret intelligence such as the KGB, which would eventually result in leading Soviet experts moving west to work for western intelligence agencies. Kernbach notes of the original experiment, it was mainly investigating the disturbance of biological rhythms by long-term non-local impact and possible neurological manifestations. Noting its connection to the KGB, Kernbach writes: The work [originally from 1986] was published in 2001 and caused extensive controversy in the press. It reported about the experiments performed in 1986 on a nonlocal impact on biological objects over 22km distance, the article pointed out that “advancement in this area was made possible through the support of the KGB of the USSR and the USSR’s Council of Ministers.” In it is explicitly stated “all reports even on works with the Ministry of Defense of the USSR were not classified.” According to the biography of A. E. Akimov, he worked 1977-1983 in the Moscow Research Institute of Radio Communication and 1983-1987 in the research institute of communication and control systems. This explains the telecommunication methodology and terminology that are used for conducting those attempts. Indeed, modern experiments on quantum communication confirm his vision and approach (Kernbach, 2018b) The description of the experiment from 1986 indicates that ’a bioelectronic system was used as a torsion Aharonov-Bohm effect receiver. It is based on the property of tissue cells to change the conductivity of membranes when exposed by a torsion field [vacuum virtual particles created with potentials]. This property was implicitly established by V.A.Sokolova in 1982′ . The use of biological objects (in this case plants) for technical communication systems is surprising. The approach developed by V.A.Sokolova (several of those methods were confirmed in our laboratory) used a simplified impedance spectroscopy applied to fluidic systems. Cellular tissues were only one of many tested systems; they are characterized by unstable electrochemical properties. In later works of the ISTC VENT, for example of A.V. Bobrov, water was used as a physical receiver of nonlocal signals. Another interesting point, related to this experiment, is the widely debated resolution of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, that allegedly was about ’managing living objects.’ It also dates back to 1986 and was mentioned by E.B.Aleksandrov. Finally, our attention was attracted to works on interaction with biological systems that were carried out at that time, whose traces can be found in the press. Therefore, the question faced by the thoughtful reader is whether the experiments of 1986, under the patronage of the KGB, were first test experiments on nonlocal influences on biological objects. Such an interpretation could explain the motivation of transmitting signals in a slow ’communication channel’", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:271:3b05f53eada8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2624, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 272, "text": "back to 1986 and was mentioned by E.B.Aleksandrov.

Such an interpretation could explain the motivation of transmitting signals in a slow ’communication channel’ with only a few bits per hour, that has no technical sense but a lot of biological implications. This could also explain the interest of intelligence services of different countries in these technologies, for example, the CIA called similar methods ’Remote Action’; the beginning of their research falls also in 1986-87. (Kernbach, 2018b) Although, they were not the first tests of remote influencing, it is illustrative to see the history behind the generators used in these experiments. Akimov and also Bobrov mentioned in these passages both had experience working secretly for the Soviet secret intelligence services. Akimov generators became public in the mid-1980s, much later then their military and intelligence development, extending back to at least the 1950s. Akimov himself started in this field in 1959 working for the KGB scientific labs that studied remote influencing of biological objects, such as white rabbits (Zhigalov, 2009). In 1961, a young A.V. Bobrov was sent to the Baltics to study fields associated with psychics, his first foray into detectors and transmitters; later, from 1989-91, Bobrov was doing classified work on ‘remote consciousness’ (Kernbach, 2019). He again worked on secret projects for the military and intelligence sector of the Soviet Union. Bobrov reported in a discussion about studies performed at Gagarin Air Force Academy in Monino and by St. Petersburg L.I. Mechnikov State Medical Academy in the 80s and 90s. (Kernbach, 2013, 17). Bobrov returned in 1964 to graduate school looking for a theory to explain the energetics associated with his classified psi work from 1961. He later, according to the public story, came across the work of Akimov, then formulating the ideal of ‘information radiation.’ He continues working today on projects with open researchers such as Russian researcher at the University of Stuttgart Serge Kernbach. Among the innovations that Bobrov brought to the field, aside from Medical Treatments, is the question of detection and sensing, or metrology. For instance, the question becomes to change a thought you have to have the map of the thought, as Dr. Norseen put it. Kernbach writes of Bobrov’s innovation of the electric double layer in sensing: In 1988 the first note of A.V.Bobrov about the electric double layer (EDL) as a sensor had appeared. In his book, he confirmed the program of the USSR’s Ministry of Defense on the study of psychics and instrumental psychotronics. Bobrov’s EDL sensors have been proven as very sensitive devices.

In his book, he confirmed the program of the USSR’s Ministry of Defense on the study of psychics and instrumental psychotronics. Bobrov’s EDL sensors have been proven as very sensitive devices. The book edited by Lunev describes the work carried out at the Tomsk Polytechnic University from 1983 to 1993, including a number of sensors based on quartz resonators and detectors of radioactivity. In 1989 a patent of G.A.Sergeev on capacitive sensors is issued. Since 1989 various tests with crystallized structures are conducted and, further, with the melting of metals. Attempts were made to develop sensors on that basis. In the early 90s sensors of Y.P.Kravchenko (Ю.П.Кравченко) appeared, based on measurements of electric fields. In the Institute of Physics, St. Petersburg State University, the results related to Kozyrev’s sensors are verified (these and other works have stimulated the development of solid-state sensors). The book of G.N.Dulnev and colleagues describes the research conducted between 1995-1998 at the Center for Energy and Information Technologies at the St. Petersburg State Institute of Fine Mechanics and Optics (TSEIT GITMO). In those experiments more biological, optical, magnetic and thermal sensors are used. Interesting works are performed on bioelectrogenesis of plants and the application of such sensors in experiments. By 2000, there is already a large amount of works on the impact of ’high-penetrating’ radiation on different semiconductor devices, see e.g. in the review in 2013 related to metrology of ’high-penetrating’ emission, there are 19 groups of physical effects that can represent a basis for the development of sensors, with dozens of technical sensors. (Kernbach, 2013) The question as to where Akimov learned of these technologies can be traced back to at least the 1920s. While Kernbach has argued that Vril generators (the Nationalist Socialist idea of ‘prana’ or ‘ruah’, spirit) possibly date back to early versions in 1913. This is no coincidence, as Kernbach has traced the production of these generators as a direct outcome of Nazi war research and possible deployment in Germany during the war. The German aristocrat Manfred von Ardenne, who later was taken to the Soviet Union as a captive scientist working on their Nuclear program, was known to have worked before the war with reading brainwaves in his self-funded research institute. Ardenne wrote, the high-frequency field is nothing in thinking, to perceive the electricity, amplify with tube amplifiers, and transfer this enhanced energy to the second brain. So that in the second brain… we have the same thoughts, it is necessary that with a variety of thinking, an amplifier of produced broadband frequency very uniformly… (Kernbach, 2014, part 2) Ardenne and Hertz", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:273:d0a0aaada964", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2626, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 274, "text": "their Nuclear program, was known to have worked before the war with reading brainwaves in his self-funded research institute.

In Georgia, we also find traces of early psychotronic works. According to eyewitnesses, back in the 50s research works were carried out in Agudzer on hypnosis and ultra-weak radiation of biological organisms… there is a description that AEG supplied equipment for secret projects such as Colocation [instrumental remote viewing]. The authors indicate that German specialists from the AEG-Röhrenfabrik Oberspree, where the high-frequency technology of the war was harnessed, took part in the formation of Research Institute 160, later Research Institute Istok. (Kernbach, 2014) In addition to this, Kernbach has cited the Soviet Army’s discovery of special antennas that resemble the design of Akimov generators including klystrons, ray tubes, and other items related to highly penetrating radiation generation. Kernbach concluded regarding the various electronic finds from Nazi Germany: “These strange phenomena suggest that the objects under study somehow possibly acted on the morale of the German units and the civilian population.” (Kernbach, 2014). I took up my duties for Deputy Director for Scientific Affairs (Research Institute-160 Source) from May 15, 1948 …Institute was very broad. In terms of time work was listed not only microwave devices, but also electron-beam devices, generator and modulator lamps, kenotrons, type raytrons, gas-discharge stabilizers, resonators resonance arresters, receiving-amplifying lamps. The range of microwave devices included many other classes: magnetrons of continuous and pulse action, generator klystrons and amplifying, reflective heterodyne klystrons, traveling wave tubes – input and medium power, backward wave lamps, amplitrons and other M-type amplifiers. Interestingly, in another interview we find Devyatkov and backward-wave lamps in completely different research Institute Istok: The seminar was delivered on the initiative [of] N. D. Devyatkov - Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences USSR, scientific director of the Research Institute of Electricity [Fryazino, Moscow region – Author] and blowing department 16 Ultrahigh frequency electronics IRE AN USSR. Reverse lamps Noah waves gave the opportunity to start unconventional work of radio electronics in biology and medicine. The first very interesting experimental results, delivered at the suggestion of N.D. Devyatkov and M.B. Golant, were obtained in 1965, when the resonant response was established out biological objects when exposed to them with discrete millimeter waves range [microwaves].

Other sources, for example, indicate that high-frequency equipment SRI Istok used was called in torsion Aharonov-Bohm effect studies of the 80s and 90s. Obviously, these and other facts allow the possibility that there is a connection between the German and Soviet unconventional developments. (Kravkov, 2006) It may seem like there is insufficient evidence from the accounts of N.D. Devyatkova. But it is interesting that later in his career he began experiments with the effects of millimeter wave technology which may correspond to the Nazi find he was asked to backwards engineer in 1948. It is important to remember in the 1930s Mikhailovich was already researching in this area of microwaves effect on the brain. A Russian researcher, Kravkov, remarks regarding this development in N.D. Devyatkova Research: This is how the participant in the events, Professor O.V., spoke about the first step towards testing the hypothesis (3). Betsky: “In September 2003, 40 years have passed since the IRE of the USSR Academy of Sciences… a scientific seminar devoted to the discussion of the unusual properties of low-intensity electromagnetic fields of the millimeter (extremely high-frequency - EHF) range in relation to the processes of biological organisms functioning. By this time, the Istok Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of Economic Development of the USSR … completed research work on the development of the world’s first broadband millimeter wave generator based on vacuum devices - backward wave tubes with a longitudinal magnetic field (LOV-O). The seminar was staged at the initiative of N.D. Devyatkov - Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, scientific director of the Research Institute “Istok” (Fryazino, Moscow region - Auth.) And head of department 16 “Ultrahigh-frequency electronics” of the IRE of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Backward wave lamps made it possible to start work in an unconventional direction for radio electronics - in biology and medicine. “ this area – research on the one side [USSR] stimulated equivalent studies on the other side [UKUSA]. Some representatives of ’power structures’ in the Soviet Union so characterized the 80s: ’In general, in 80s, in this country, it was created a system of well-organized and conspiratorial work to develop new methods and means of resolving interstate and internal political problems without involving intimidating power forces and damaging effects. It includes methods of obtaining timely information, other than the traditionally known.

Since the mid-80’s the central coordinator of unconventional research became the State Committee for Science and Technology at the Council of Ministers (SCST USSR) with the direct participation of the Ministry of Defense and the KGB. In the middle of 1986, N.I.Ryzhkov (Н.И.Рыжков) on a memo about the perspectives of torsion technologies wrote a resolution: “Take steps to organize the works.” Many authors point to the classified document by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the USSR Council of Ministers N137-47 of 27 January 1986 about the program ’Management of living objects, including human.’ For obvious reasons, the text of this resolution is not in the public domain, but this document has several indirect evidences. (Kernbach, 2013, 12) As far as the technological development Kernbach notes that these generator designs were already completed a decade earlier in the 1970s, although it is possible they were taken directly from Nazi Germany, apparently in secret Soviet labs under sponsorship of the KGB and Ministry of Defense, which seems to have begun this work as a direct corollary to the Nuclear Weapons program of the 1950s in which many German scientists were involved, like Zimmer, Hertz and von Ardenne. It is possible they were disclosed in the mid-1980s to attract more research or that these particular designs were antiquated, but their circulation as devices would be valid in academic contexts even if the design itself is antiquated and replaced with a new version of the technology such as lasers of LED based devices, in the mid-90s Bobrov switched from Akimov generators to Quantum Generators (lasers, LED). As is usual there was much suppression of Akimov and the research community following the fall of the Soviet Union. In 1991, Akimov and the research of Torsion Fields were declared ‘pseudoscience’ by the presidium of the USSR’s Academy of Science, which in one week went from funding Akimov and the Center for Unconventional Somewhere in the beginning 80s (and maybe even earlier), he [Akimov] discovered the mutual influence of disunited rotating bodies. The report of these studies was classified. It seems that Akimov’s work was initiated by these studies. It is possible that the main achievements of Akimov are classified. Maybe exactly therefore in VENT publications there is very little directly on torsion topics, especially publications with detailed descriptions of experiments. I even admit that the whistle about ‘pseudoscientific’ torsion research is specially organized as a ‘disinformation’ for hiding very important achievements. But this is just an unreliable hypothesis. (Zhigalov, 2009) This was all just previous to the end of the Soviet Union. After the fall of the Soviet Union funding dried up for Akimov", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:276:122a23fc7749", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2629, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 277, "text": "achievements of Akimov are classified.

(Zhigalov, 2009) This was all just previous to the end of the Soviet Union. After the fall of the Soviet Union funding dried up for Akimov and his center, VENT, though active work continued into 1995, after that period support became sporadic, with Akimov trying to continue VENT into 2001. VENT was organized into 5 research areas: communication, material research, new sensing technologies (e.g., for forecasting earthquakes), water cleaning and medical diagnostics. All psychotronic research stopped in 2002-2003, which was also around the time of the murder of Brushlinsky ( Jan 2002); the first creation of ‘Thought Injection’ in the US. Basically most Russians with expertise in this field went west or carried on meagerly developing their own private funding sources, never with any serious money behind them. Sokolov notes that some Torsion scientists went to England as well around the time of the fall of the Soviet Union (Sokolov, 2016). An example of the ending of Psychotronics programs in Russia was the closing of the military unit 10003 in 2003, which was established in 1989 to explore the possibilities of military use of paranormal phenomena. While during this period Academics that had previously been doing solid scientific work in this area decided not to carry on this work, fearing for their academic positions at Universities in Russia by being labeled as ‘pseudoscientists’ (Kernbach, 2013). One interesting point regarding the generators used by Akimov, for instance he did not use Okatrin’s generator, though similar, or include other Theoretical Physicists’ work such as A.G. Gurvich or B. Kobozev due to their ideas being ‘Old’, like Okatrin’s microlepton theory. Kernbach has studied the Soviet ‘Torsion’ generators produced by the likes of Akimov, Oktarin (Анатолий Федорович Охатрина d. 2002), Deev, and others (Kernbach, 2015). Later, we shall examine the physics behind these generators or antennae and it’s use of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. It is revealing that in a document dated from July 22, 1991 an interview was held with a Russian scientist, Oktarin, by the CIA during the collapse of the Soviet Union. Evidently the CIA was interested in his inventions’ Neuroweapons abilities: Oktarin hypothesized during an era when many, outside of secret government labs, had given up on gravitational waves and any normal EM wave explanations for the effects they were encountering in their labs came up with the theory of microleptons, so that we now understand when he refers to microleptons he is really referring to the well-founded physics of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, not some new pseudoscientific ‘Torsion physics’ or ‘microleptons.’ The camera mentioned in the text", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:277:35964a569d22", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2630, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 278, "text": "his inventions’ Neuroweapons abilities: Oktarin hypothesized during an era when many, outside of secret government labs, had given up on gravitational waves and any normal EM wave explanations for the effects they were encountering in their labs came up with the theory of microleptons, so that we now understand when he refers to microleptons he is really referring to the well-founded physics of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, not some new pseudoscientific ‘Torsion physics’ or ‘microleptons.’ The camera mentioned in the text was created in 1989. It is a photometric method for recording energy fields using digital scanning and optical devices [see Ch. 9B] developed at the Torsion Laboratory of the International Academy of Medical and Technical under the leadership of G.F. Saveliev working with Oktarin. A brief review of Oktarin’s biography reveals some interesting relationships: Okhatrin Anatoly Fedorovich, Academician of the International Academy of Energy Information Sciences, Head of the Biolocation Laboratory and the Institute of Mineralogy, Geochemistry and Crystal Chemistry and Rare Elements (ITGRE), developer of biogenerators (академик Международной академии энергоинформационных наук, руководитель лаборатории биолокации и института минералогии, геохимии и кристаллохимии и редких элементов (ИТГРЭ), разработчик биогенераторов.). https://spaevgev.livejournal.com/44962.html From 1953 he worked in the design bureau of academician A.P. Korolev in Novosibirsk [Kozyrev also worked there on his ‘torsion’ theory based on ‘Causal Mechanics’ with time as a particle], where devices were developed that affect human energy, which is interesting since most in the west credit such work to Pavlita, but it seems to also have been investigated by the Soviet rocket scientists, literally rocket scientists. Keeping in mind that Tsiokolvsky, credited with the founding of the Russian space program, himself was haunted and also believed psi technology would bring a great leap forward in space exploration. Early in Oktarin’s career he is already investigating biological linfluences in an official Soviet government lab. His mentor, Korolev, before designing the rockets that launched Sputnik and the first manned mission, was working on biological effects of remote action, this after having been arrested and sent to the Gulag in 1938, we see another important person within this research field sent to Siberia, work with the Soviet space program and biogenerators would have ceased with his elimination. Oktarin 1953 to 1980 worked at KB Zarya, NPO Krasnaya Zvezda on the creation of onboard (space, etc.) nuclear power plants [a topic that Dr. Baker also remarks on], took part in the creation of aircraft control systems which we also see in the work of Norseen and Sokolov, which is significant in that the technology ‘Thought Injection’ as developed by Lockheed-Martin developed directly from the need to interact with pilots in combat aircraft during critical times, so points to a direct correlative result in the research from the Soviets then being imported to the UKUSA after the collapse of the Sovet Union ending up in the work of Lockheed-Martin engineer Dr. John Norseen, again he", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:278:85a130063c45", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2631, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 279, "text": "control systems which we also see in the work of Norseen and Sokolov, which is significant in that the technology ‘Thought Injection’ as developed by Lockheed-Martin developed directly from the need to interact with pilots in combat aircraft during critical times, so points to a direct correlative result in the research from the Soviets then being imported to the UKUSA after the collapse of the Sovet Union ending up in the work of Lockheed-Martin engineer Dr. John Norseen, again he also studied in Russia with Reflexive Control academics and engineers. It is not coincidental that there are claims of ‘free energy’ from this technology along with ‘remote sensing’, though ostensibly exaggerations of capabilities. Okatrin worked on creating energy for space exploration. In 1973, he is Deputy Chief Designer of NPO Krasnaya Zvezda, Deputy Director of NPO Krasnaya Zvezda for scientific work. He supervised the development and implementation of nuclear power systems for direct energy conversion (thermoelectricity, thermal emission, electrochemistry, radioisotope sources, etc.) in projects: “Romashka,” “Topaz,” “Yenisei,” “Buk,” “Lemon,” “Orion,” “Beta-1,” “Beta-2,” “Beta-3,” “Beta-M,” “Beta- S^(″) are currently working in various autonomous objects of technology on the spacecraft “Kosmos-84,” “Kosmos- 90 “(1965), radioisotope generators” Orion-1 and Orion-11K “based on polonium-210 were used, on the spacecraft “Lunokhod- ⋅ 1^(″) (1970), “Lunokhod- ⋅ 2^(″) (1973). An interesting twist is that the USA bought some of his power plants. The nuclear power plant BES-5 “Buk” was used on the USA radar reconnaissance satellite. The first apparatus of this series was launched on October 3, 1970 from Baikonur (“Cosmos-367”). The Buk itself has been in development since 1960. at NPO Krasnaya Zvezda. In 1992, the United States purchased two Yenisei (Topaz-2) nuclear power plants in Russia for $13 million. One of the reactors was supposed to be used in 1995 after thorough ground tests. in the “Nuclear Electric Propulsion Spaceflight Test Program.” The generators that he worked on had both negative and positive effects. Counter measures in military applications is always one of the most important aspects of technical development, either a weapon will be more useful or less useful based on the counter measures developed in reference to it. In terms of counter measures Okatrin also developed a system to suppress the same effects that cause physiological problems he has developed devices, sensors and neutralizers of harmful fields of natural and man-made origin, also see Maslobrod below. In particular, to protect a person from various kinds of negative fields, a series of devices “Gamma-7” «Гамма- z_(≫) has been developed: “Neutralizer” «Нейтрализатор ≫ and “Activator” «Активатор.” Persinger also has found there is a way to block ‘remote viewing.’ (Disruption of Remote Viewing by Magnetic Fields, see Ch. 9).

This could also explain why Psi differs with solar storms, changing EM field in storm. “The results suggest weak, temporally complex magnetic fields generated within [the object]… may have interfered with the stimuli to the [psychic]…” (Persinger, 2002, 994) In Kernbach’s study of the 1986 Soviet experiment he relates that the experiment from 1986 owes its impetus to previous work of Sokolova in 1982. Sokolova’s work is related to earlier studies by V.P. Kaznacheev in the 1970s. These studies are all related to the effect of an irradiated body transmitting its internal state to bystanders, or other objects nearby, such as a rat to another rat in its cage. This work actually began much earlier than the Soviet ‘inception’ of these techniques. Biophotons are a photonic form of radiation that cells and all living matter send out with exchanges of free protons in, say, a molecule. Others study the bystander effect as relates to Biophotons. Earlier we saw how biophotons are used in Brain Computer Interfaces as explained by Dr. Persinger. Some very early studies related to this are the work of Gurvitch in the 1920s, who reported communications between animals based on photons. Later, the German E. Woenckhaus from 1930 (Mothersill, 2014) experimented on the bystander effect from irradiating mice and then measuring the effect on the test subjects’ cage mates. Noting Gurvitsch’s contribution: Intensive research started in the 1920s with the work of Gurvitsch whose 200 or more experiments revealed that when pointing the tip of an onion root (inducer) to another onion root (receiver), separated by quartz glass, the receiver root surprisingly shows an increased rate of mitosis (approx. 20 − 25% ). Since this effect was absent when using ultra-violet (UV)-opaque glass, he concluded that electromagnetic radiation in the UV range was responsible. He termed this type of radiation “mitogenetic radiation.” In 1927 Frank & Gurwitsch reported the successful spectroscopic detection of UV radiation in the range of 193 − 237nm originating from frog muscles. Gurwitsch’s research stimulated many other researchers in the 1930s and early 1940s to replicate and extend their experiments, leading to both successful and unsuccessful replications. The research showed that there is indication for a non-chemical, electromagnetic cell-to-cell signaling which can be experimentally detected when investigating the effect of inducer cells on receiver cells, where the inducer cells have to be in the mitotic state or in a stressed condition (induced by e.g., chemical, thermal, mechanical", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:280:c4abead846e1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2633, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 281, "text": "237nm originating from frog muscles.

The radiation emanated from stressed cells was termed by Gurwitsch as “degradation radiation” [negative position of Akimov generator]. One limitation of Gurwitsch’s work is that it does not completely meet modern scientific requirements for proper experimental investigations, i.e., it lacks proper statistical analysis and complete control over confounders. However, new analyses of Gurwitsch’s data revealed that most of the results were statistically significant using modern statistical test (personal communication, Prof. Beloussov [Faculty of Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow], Dr. Stefanov [Institute of Biophysics, Russian Acad Sci., Moscow]). Unfortunately, these analyses were not published. Thus, Gurwitsch’s work is primarily of historical significance and should be regarded as an initial approach for experimental investigation of a new topic. Unfortunately, in the 1940s-1950s, World War II and a shift in the focus to biochemistry halted research into this topic. (Scholkmann, 2013) In the 1960s-1980s the research group of Kaznacheev continued to investigate the topic by performing a large number of experiments with different cell cultures. They used a specially designed device to perform the experiments consisting of two flasks, which were connected by a window of either quartz glass or a UV-opaque glass plate (with a depth of about 0.2−2mm ). An “inducer” cell culture was placed in one flask and a “receiver” culture in the other. It was investigated how the treatment of the inducer culture with different stressors (e.g. viruses, chemicals or UV-radiation) affects the receiver culture. For example, experiments using inducer cell cultures consisting of monkey kidney tissue treated with adenoviruses demonstrated that the receiver cell culture also shows morphological signs of infection in 72% of performed trails (total number of trials: 170) after 2.3 days of contact. The observed effect was termed the “mirror cytopathic effect.” After analyzing all experiments done, Kaznacheev concluded among other things that the effect (i) was at its strongest when cultures from the same species were used, (ii) seems to be caused by an electromagnetic interaction between the cultures in the UV range, and interestingly… (iii) its strength showed an annual modulation (month with most successful experiments: August), possibly related to environmental factors. (Scholkmann, 2013) The Soviet Union recognized Kaznacheev for his contribution, “The Phenomena of Intercellular Distant EM Interaction in the system of Two Tissue Cultures,” dating it officially to Feb. 15, 1966.

We can see clearly there is a continuation of the work of Gurvitsch. Kaznacheev was of interest to the DoD and the CIA. Former military intelligence analyst in the field of psychotronics, Lt. Col. Tom Bearden, has written of Kaznacheev’s contributions to Psi research: As an example of the kindling effect and the variability of photon quenching of the paranormal channel, some extremely interesting experiments were performed by V.P. Kaznacheyev et al regarding the paranormal transmission of death. Briefly, two groups of cells were selected from the same cell culture and one sample placed on each side of a window joining two environmentally shielded rooms. The cell cultures were in quartz containers. One cell culture was used as the initiation sample and was subjected to a deadly mechanism - virus, germ, chemical poison, irradiation, ultraviolet rays, etc. The second cell culture was observed, to ascertain any transmitted effects from the culture sample being killed. When the window was made of ordinary glass, the second sample remained alive and healthy. When the window was made of quartz, the second sample sickened and died with the same symptoms as the primary sample. The experiments were done in darkness, and over 5,000 were reported by Kaznacheev and his colleagues. The onset of induced complementary sickness and death in the second culture followed a reasonable time - say two to four hours - behind sickness and death in the primary culture. The major transmission difference between window glass and quartz is that quartz transmits both ultraviolet and infrared well, while glass is relatively opaque to ultraviolet and infrared. Both quartz and glass transmit visible light. Thus glass is a suppressor of the paranormal channel, while quartz is not. By performing the experiment in darkness through a quartz window, the four-law patterns of disease, sickness, or death engendered in the primary sample are not extensively squelched by the photon interaction, and these four-law patterns are transmitted through the quartz window into the second cell culture. Since the genetic patterns of the second culture are the same as those of the first, sympathetic four-state interaction and eventual kindling occur, resulting in the appearance of the effects in the second culture. It is well known that cells also emit mitogenic radiation, including radiation in the ultraviolet and infrared regions. Since these same regions are not strongly suppressed by the photon interaction, one may hypothesize that paranormal effects may be strongly modulated onto infrared and ultraviolet photon activity, and there is indeed evidence for", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:282:925b098e914c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2635, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 283, "text": "second culture are the same as those of the first, sympathetic four-state interaction and eventual kindling occur, resulting in the appearance of the effects in the second culture. It is well known that cells also emit mitogenic radiation, including radiation in the ultraviolet and infrared regions. Since these same regions are not strongly suppressed by the photon interaction, one may hypothesize that paranormal effects may be strongly modulated onto infrared and ultraviolet photon activity, and there is indeed evidence for such an assumption. In 1950, Western researchers found that cells could be killed in darkness with ultraviolet radiation, kept shielded from visible light for twenty-four hours or longer, and then if radiated with visible light the cells would start reviving by hundreds of thousands even though they had been clinically dead. Specifically, every cell emits mitogenetic radiation in the ultraviolet twice: when it is born and when it dies. The UV photon emitted at death contains the exact virtual state pattern of the condition of the cell at death. The healthy cells are bombarded with death messages from those that are dying, and this diffuses the death pattern throughout the healthy culture, eventually kindling into the same death pattern there. However, the squelching of the paranormal channel by photon interaction is never complete, or paranormal phenomena could never occur in daylight. Hence paranormal patterns can be modulated even onto visible light, although only extremely weakly. Thus we may speak of the Q or sharpness of the paranormal modulation upon photon frequencies; Q is extremely low for visible light and may be extremely high for infrared and ultraviolet. In the visible light spectrum, it is probable that extremely large numbers of near-zero strength paranormal patterns are modulated on the light radiation; hence these patterns simply consist of a very weak background noise and the kindling effect does not apply. (The patterns are so random as to be self-canceling in the kindling effect.) (Bearden, 1983) A.A. Deev, who created a generator emitting fields of an incomprehensible nature. Research conducted at the Institute of Clinical and Experimental medicine SB AMS USSR (director V.P. Kaznacheev) in 1981 Deev jointly with the staff of the laboratory of Biophysics A.P. Mikhailova and N.B. Kartasheva showed that under the influence of this generator, biophysical cell culture characteristics. During the experiment, a double shielding cells from the effects of an electromagnetic field. In 1984 in Peoples’ Friendship University named after P. Lumumba V.A. Sokolova, A.A. Deev and Sukhanov conducted experiments that recorded a sharp change relative dispersion of electrical conductivity in plants at frequencies 1 - 517 kHz when exposed to this generator (measurements were carried out by method V.V. Gorchakov and A.D. Kotamokhin). The generator was based on spin polarized (SP) materials.

It must be assumed that this deep interest in work with JV generators began for Akimov his research to create torsion generators. (Boldyreva, 2009) In this work some of the details on how the generators work is given; similar to the Zeeman Effect, it has 3 channels, a positive transition, negative transition (causing deleterious effects) and neutral or zero-transition channel. The zero channel is the channel that carries information with very low force and energy, the ‘psi’ channel (Sokolov, 2016, 30). Sokolov also credits not just the A-B effect but also with the gyromagnetic ‘spin-wave’, the generators are able to control the physical vacuum. In explaining the physics behind the generator Sokolov turned to the anti-gravity theory of Jose Del Prado, explaining that between 2 counter ‘torsion’ [spin] fields there is a spatial boundary tension field $\\scriptstyle { \\frac { } { . = 0 } }$ , a cord, conductor in layers of cord [cord may resemble Persinger’s Singularity explanation]. Between there is a gap formed by repulsion of the same charge (Sokolov, 2016, 35). In an interesting parallel with other researchers in ‘thought injection’ such as Dr. Norseen, Sokolova also worked on avionic systems involving the interface of the pilot and machine (Sokolova, 1981). Sokolova expresses both alarm and dismay at the use of the technology for purposes of control in terms of mass control. He writes: Even the Russian scientist Shipunov argued that the transfer of information is possible at the level of human thought. This is real since wave functions are organized more strictly. It was on Earth with the number of electromagnetic matrices grows every year negative sign, and surrounded by one person they can exist, and the other person is simply blinded by them. Therefore, it is not surprising that 70% of unsolved crimes their cause is unknown. Under certain conditions that, in particular, it can be called a “soulless person,” formed vacuum, and electromagnetic matrices with a negative sign, who then begin to control the Person like demons. This is a very dangerous situation, and one can only hope for the fact that torsion fields are not the final station of the wave world. We hope that in addition to torsion fields, there are more completed fields, purely informational, to save the world. (Sokolova, 2016) It should be noted, in a manner related to TI claims of neural monitoring, that Sokolova finds that the Torsion (Spin) Field can be broadcast over media (Sokolov, 2016, 16).

Kernbach has also performed experiments related to finding if weak radiation can be transmitted through the internet, which he concluded positively it could (Kernbach, 2015); again many TI claim to be affected through television and internet connected devices with what they call Directed Energy Weapon attacks. Later, Sokolova expressed dismay at the attacks on Russian Torsion scientists by Russian Scientific authorities and points out that some have even left Russia to work for the west: • Imprinting: There is a transfer of information properties from one object to another, and the latter acquires the characteristics of the first only if the torsion generator operates in the zero-transition mode. Transfer is possible in the operating mode of the torsion generator to zero-transition from an inanimate object (washer) to a living object (plant), and the latter loses part of its substance.“ • Fatty Acids: Found signs of changes in the geometric iso-metrics under the action of a torsion field on those objects that belong to unsaturated hydrocarbons, that is, they have a double bond – including if this bond is present in the radical organic compound. [found that milk irradiated coagulated, increasing its viscosity, applicable to other mammalian fat cells?] • Viscosity: related to Fatty Acids. In some cases, torsion fields can change the consistency of liquid substances, turning them into a solid state. Torsion fields are capable of changing the viscosity of fuels (kerosine, gasoline, oil) and, the greater the degree of continuous efficiency, the stronger this change improves fuel efficiency. Carried out the transfer of the viscosity properties of fuels with fuels for fuels that are at room temperature, and the intensity of this process depends on the degree of unsaturation of the investigated fuel, and to a lesser extent changes in the viscosity of the fuel in which are more chemically pure substances. Thus, my personal experimental results of exposure to torsion fields or those in which I took an active part. Besides those stated, there are also many other experimental materials of other specialists; and by now accumulated great experimental materials, convincingly that the effect of torsion fields on material objects really takes place. And although now there is a situation where the experimental part of the problem is ahead of the theoretical, nevertheless, in science experimental confirmation has always been the end proof of truth.

Both the effect and the history of the ‘Torsion’ generators are of importance to understand the development of this technology and how it eventually ends up in the CIA contractor SRI with Hal Puthoff ’s patent for a generator based on the Aharonov-Bohm effect in 1993. An examination of Hal Puthoff ’s 1993 patent give us an idea as to how the Akimov and other generators, all based on a basic Russian prototype, work and function and the physics behind them. First, it is important to understand Hal Puthoff ’s background. Puthoff is a physicist who formerly worked for the Stanford Research Institute, examining the physics behind psychics associated with SRI’s Remote Viewing studies funded by the DoD and CIA. He has collaborated with Lockheed-Martin scientists on Zero-Point Fields (ZPF) as referenced by Lockheed-Martin engineer John Norseen. Collaborating with Bernhard Haisch of Lockheed-Martin on Advances in the Proposed Electromagnetic Zero-Point Field Theory of Inertia, Haisch had previously to this paper worked on Quantum and classical statistics of the electromagnetic zero-point field (Haisch, 1996). As a contractor for the CIA back in the day, the early 70s to the 90s, he worked on the physics of the phenomena being experimented on by him and colleague Targ. Eventually in 1993, shortly after the publication of the Soviet “Akimov” generators, he patented an American version while working for SRI. One of the primary effects behind his device according to his patent filings is the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Puthoff writes: With the advent of quantum theory, however, the above picture changed. In the prior art literature, the (A, Φ) formalism has emerged as more fundamental because it predicts certain quantum interference effects that have been observed and are not apparent from the (E, B) approach. This difference was first set forth in an unequivocal way in a seminal 1959 paper by Aharonov and Bohm, entitled “Significance of Electromagnetic Potentials in the Quantum Theory,” Physical Review 115, 485 (1959); see also “Further Considerations on Electromagnetic Potentials in the Quantum Theory.” Physical Review 123, 1511 (1961). In these papers it is shown that in certain two-leg electron-interferometer configurations in which the potentials A and Φ are established in a region of Space, but E and B are absent, it is nonetheless possible for the potentials to induce changes in electron quantum interference patterns. That is, electrons that are in an electromagnetic field-free region and therefore do not encounter an", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:286:913c21e34fc9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2639, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 287, "text": "(1959); see also “Further Considerations on Electromagnetic Potentials in the Quantum Theory.” Physical Review 123, 1511 (1961).

That is, electrons that are in an electromagnetic field-free region and therefore do not encounter an electric or magnetic field are none the less acted upon by the presence of the A and/or p potentials. Such an effect is now referred to broadly as the Aharonov Bohm effect, and devices have been built which demonstrate this effect in the laboratory; for a recent overview, see Y. Imry and R. A. Webb, “Quantum Interference and the Aharonov-Bohm Effect,” Scientific American 260, 56 (April 1989). A Second quantum interference effect which demonstrates the independent reality of the A, Φ potentials in the absence of the (E, B) fields (and one which is significant for the technology disclosed herein) is a single-leg electron interferometer effect known as the Josephson effect, [See R. P. Feynman et al.] The Feynman Lectures on Physics, vol. III (Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass., 1965), pp. 21-14 through 21-18. The Josephson effect is based on the fact that the current density J through a Josephson junction (which consists of two Superconductors separated by a thin electric insulator) is determined by the magnitude of the potentials A and Φ, independent of whether E or B fields are present. (Puthoff, 1998) A s stated earlier by Sokolova, these A-B (Aharonov-Bohm) Generators, as I will refer to them, can control vacuum Afluctuations. Referencing Puthoff design 1 functioning of these devices is based around a helical coil that is stood up vertically (31) and is powered by a DC source. This solenoid gets current to generate a vertically directed magnetic field (B), which also generates a curl-free vector potential exterior to the solenoid. The plates (37,35) driven by the voltage source produce a horizontal electrostatic field; the voltage varies as the time derivative (rhythmic). The electrostatic and electrodynamic fields from the solenoid and plates cancel in the horizontal plane suppressing the EM Field in the horizontal plane. The field from solenoid and plates combine in horizontal plane, causing a signal along Referencing Puthoff Design 2 or Fig. 7 above we are presented a different setup, one that is used by Dr. Michael Persinger in some of his experiments, where toroidal coils, if both are properly phased and adjusted in amplitude to provide a time varying signal (A, Φ) having no EM component.

The gist of how this works is that electric potentials, not actual force, that is, structure minus any weight behind it; imagine a hologram of a punch hitting you. So, they end up transmitting structure but not force which interacts subtly with matter, which leads to reactions and causations which we would not ‘normatively’ anticipate to be caused by such low strength fields. Dr. Persinger has written about the Casimir Effect in several publications. In a paper on thixotropy which has to do with the viscosity of water and its impact by EM fields, he studies the pH free protons of aqueous solutions separated by non-trivial non-local distances but united in EM fields applied to the water samples in which he found a deep correlation between water samples pH changed locally and then reflected in the remote water sample. Regarding virtual particles Persinger writes: “Here I present quantitative evidence that thixotropic properties of water could reflect a universal interface for the transformation of virtual particles from zero-point, vacuum oscillations to real particles.” (Persinger, 2015, 6203) Previously we have read how Aharonov-Bohm generators affect the viscosity of water, which is its thixotropic properties. Knowing that these generators affect the vacuum it is important to understand the effect of these generators on water, on which all life depends, as well as playing an important role in controlling the EM within Microtubules, which is to say our memories and working consciousness, and subconscious. The persistent, subtle, and specific properties of thixotropic phenomena in water meet the quantitative criteria for a special condition that could be distributed throughout the sub-matter spatial fabric of the universe. The prevalence of the quantity of energy in the order of 2 × 10^( − 20)J derived from the product of the ratio of the proton’s magnetic moment to its unit charge and viscosity applied across the O-H length could mediate the dynamics that connect water to the transformation of vacuum oscillations (or virtual particles) to real states and determine the spatial and temporal boundaries of the coherent domains that create the thixotropic state.

When undisturbed or within minimal radiant influence the conduit of ∼ 2× 10^( − 20)J would conservatively increase the viscosity to five times the usual value. The involvements of the energies that reflect shifts of photons from rest mass as well as a “diffusivity” or “entanglement” velocity that converge with 10^( − 20)⋅ J as a universal value emerge across levels of spatial structure and suggest that thixotropic conditions of water could reflect universal conditions. The occurrence of excess correlations between solar and terrestrial water molecules could accommodate the periodicities noted in thixotropic responses reported in various chemical systems over the previous decades. (Persinger, 2015, 6209) In a related experiment Dr. Persinger studied the long-distance interaction of water samples and their connection by two alternating pattern magnetic fields; that is, he created two separate EM fields, put water samples in these fields, added free Protons (H+) and watched not just the local sample that had free protons directly added but also the separate non-local field had its samples pH increase, although no direct free protons were added to it locally. He also noted that this effect was in small volumes, < 25cc , which is much larger than water in the Microtubules. The issue of thixotropy obviously plays a role in life: The thixotropic phenomenon of water may determine many of the parameters that both create and constrain the conditions for living systems. Thixotropy is an emergent property of liquids and gels whose viscosity slowly increases and appears to involve the intrinsic ordering of large numbers of water molecules. Vybiral and Voracek’s study of water containing ions indicated that the gel-like behavior developed “spontaneously” over time when undisturbed in closed vessels. Mechanical stimuli dissipated the enhanced viscosity and the correlative properties. The history and primary explanations for the thixotropic phenomenon of water have been reviewed recently by Verdel and Bukovec. They concluded that thixotropy is one “of the more complex characteristics associated with the behavior of non-Newtonian liquids.” One would expect the mechanisms to be relatable to quantum levels of discourse. Here I present quantitative evidence that thixotropic properties of water could reflect a universal interface for the transformation of virtual particles from zero-point, vacuum oscillations to real particles.

Noting that water’s viscosity, thixotropy, loses entropy (non-structure) as viscosity increases, becoming more ‘solid’; the harder the structure the less entropy. Persinger found that if undisturbed, including from thermal radiation like sunlight, thixotropy increases in spring water samples, but not distilled water like from public taps, suggesting that the mechanism for this increase are trapped EM fields in the water: The hypothesis by Verdel et al. that thixotropy and proton transfer within water, that is the dynamics of the hydronium ion involving Grotthuss-like mechanisms, are intricately related is revealing. They examined the possibility that a structured network of hydrogen bonds between water molecules and ions in aqueous solutions when left undisturbed for protracted periods near hydrophilic surfaces facilitated this condition. If this were valid, then weak magnetic fields of the appropriate temporal configuration could be contained or “trapped” within these structure networks as predicted by Del Giudice and Preparata. When we exposed spring water containing physiological concentrations of ions to 3m . (Persinger, 2015, 6201) The Casimir effect has been considered a “pure quantum effect” from zero-point oscillations. According to Bordag et al. it represents the zero-point energy of a quantized field. To transcend and integrate spatial levels from the smallest space (Planck’s Length) the Casimir process should be transformable to macroscopic phenomena, such as matter-level magnetic fields. If this occurs there should be a convergence of quantitative solutions that relate to the properties of matter within specific boundaries. (Persinger, 2015, 6203) The occurrence of the % value has significant implications for the transformation of virtual particles to real particles. If the boundary conditions, that is the single orbital completion, depends upon time and is associated with external magnetic fields, then creation of particles could occur. From a strictly geometric perspective, because the movement is within a circle, the packet of energy is perpetually “accelerating.” If for a given single orbit of an electron around a proton half of the time the electron occurs as a particle (matter) while the other half of the orbit it operates as an emergent virtual particle (wave) derived from the Casimir-magnetic energy transformation, manifestations of random vacuum fluctuations could occur. (Persinger, 2015, 6204) If the single orbit is related by $\\scriptstyle 1 / _ { 2 }$ to the transformation from virtual manifestations to “real” particles or matter and the changing boundaries of magnetic fields are present, there should be creation of particles from the zero-point vacuum oscillations. The transformation vector would be the strength of the magnetic field coupled to the geometry of sub-matter", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:290:4207fa5db1d2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2643, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 291, "text": "particle (wave) derived from the Casimir-magnetic energy transformation, manifestations of random vacuum fluctuations could occur.

(Persinger, 2015, 6204) Remembering, according to Bandyapadhyay, that brain microtubules are controlled by water inside the MTs it is now possible to see through Persinger’s work how Norseen’s Thought Injection focused on the MT could work. Another important relation that Persinger brings up is that of the question of entanglement in water, writing on the concept of ‘entanglement velocity’, that there is an actual speed of the so-called ‘instantaneous’ entanglement. However, for excess correlations to occur “simultaneously” from our temporal perspective within the universal boundaries there must be an additional velocity whose value ultimately connects the upper boundaries for photon masses to the energies (∼10^( − 20)J) ) congruent with the operations within water that would contribute to increased viscosity. Persinger and Koren equated the product of the four-dimensional geometries for circularity, that is, 21.3π4r7 f with the aggregate m7 ⋅ s^( − 1) , to the optimal combination of universal values that balanced this relationship. They were G² ⋅ m² ⋅ d ⋅ t³ , where G was the Newtonian Gravitational constant, m was the mass of the universe, d was its diameter and t, its age. The resulting value for this “diffusivity” term for the 7th root was 2.84 × 10²³m ⋅ s^( − 1) . They called this value the “entanglement” velocity. Approximately 7 to 8 min would be required for the universe to be traversed. A process with this velocity moving between the earth and the sun would require ~10−12 s or the lifetime of a hydronium ion before the proton moves to the next water molecule. That “diffusion velocity” derived from the appropriate combination of G, and various powers of the width of the universe, its mass, and its age is related to the velocity produced by the ratio of the voltage field to the magnetic field by a frequency that at the quantum level is equivalent to the upper rest mass of the photon. (Persinger, 2015, 6208) Similar quantities of energies within the water molecule and across levels of discourse from the photon to intergalactic magnetic fields, when coupled partially by the entanglement velocity, indicate the prominence of the value of ^(10^( − 20)). J as the energy metric for both dynamics and structure within the space that is occupied by all matter including water. It might be considered the conduit by which energy and virtual particles transform from and to entropy.

(Persinger, 2015, 6208-9) However, the excess correlations were only manifested when the reactions within the two volumes of water occurred in the centers of rotating, phase-modulated magnetic fields that shared the same changing angular velocities. When a coupled decreasing phase/frequency-modulated pattern and accelerating group velocity pattern was followed by a coupled increasing phase/frequency modulated pattern immersed in decreasing group velocity the powerful excess correlation occurred. The duration of the excess correlation was about 7 to 8min . Reverse order presentations or fixed angular velocities did not produce the effect. (Persinger, 2015, 6207) When a coupled decreasing phase/frequency-modulated pattern and accelerating group velocity pattern was followed by a coupled increasing phase/frequency modulated pattern immersed in decreasing group velocity the powerful excess correlation occurred. The duration of the excess correlation was about 7 to 8 min. Reverse order presentations or fixed angular velocities did not produce the effect. (Persinger, 2015, 6207) For excess correlations between complimentary shifts in pH within two volumes of water separated by non-local distances the optimal frequency of the angular rotation was balanced with that obtained from the product of the magnetic moment of the proton and the intensity of the magnetic field divided by Planck’s constant. When this occurred the magnitude of the shift attributed to excess correlation increased by almost a factor of 10. (Persinger, 2015b, 406) Although there are clearly other explanations the orthogonal directions of the attenuated static field and the dynamic toroid field could create the conditions for the type of photon involvement (Vaziri et al., 2002) derived from the Lorentz Lemma that would allow superimposition with the Schumann Resonances that occupy the space between the earth’s surface and the ionosphere and most if not all human brains (Persinger and Saroka, 2015; Saroka and Persinger, 2014). A means by which information could be inexpensively exchanged over large distances without the requirement for classic “transmission” and the escalating expense of equipment would substantially alter the concept and form of communication. The concept of “non-locality” and “excess correlation” has been considered by many as the quintessential property limited to quantum phenomena. As indicated by Hofmann et al., “observers of two or more entangled particles will find correlations in their measurements that cannot be explained by classical statistics.” Two-photon, three dimensional entanglements may be capable of applied quantum communication.

(Persinger, 2014, 45) A researcher cited by both Dr. Persinger and Dr. Bandyopadhyay is the work of Dr. Irene Cosic, formerly of the U. of Belgrade, of which also Norseen-connected researcher Koruga is a professor. She now teaches at a tantly, allows for a new formulation of how cell signaling works, which is usually based on the JAK-STAT cellular signaling pathway, rather than resonant frequencies as suggested by Cosic and earlier Soviet Research. It should be remembered Belgrade was behind the Iron Curtain in the former Yugoslavia. The history of Resonance in physics is not new, people have been studying resonances in EM, for instance, for decades. Resonance has played a part in theoretical physics since the inception of Quantum Mechanics. One of the lead authors in QM Theory, Nazi physicist Pascual Jordan, in the early days while working with Biologists at the Berlin Brain Institute came up with a resonant theory of molecular attraction. Which was ‘proven’ wrong in the end by the majority of scientists while being explored and developed further by scientists inside Nazi Germany at the Brain Institute, which led to an official science that is accepted regarding cell signaling based on the JAK-STAT pathways and another alternative pathway of resonant cell signaling, which is ignored and not studied very much in the West. Indeed, most in the West do not consider this valid, yet we see how fruitful gains in the field of Psychotronics were conducted through this alternative scientific explanation for cell signaling. Jordan’s ideas and that of the Berlin-Buch group later influenced the ideas of Frohlich who is recognized as a well-founded scientists on molecular issues. One author writes regarding Frohlich and Jordan: I went to see Frohlich because I had been trained as a theoretical physicist and we hoped to find out whether there was anything in his theory, which, I should say, flew in the face of everything that molecular biologists believed about interactions between large biological molecules. Frohlich believed in long-range ‘resonance’ forces between identical molecules. Every other molecular biologist preferred short-range forces between areas which are topographically complementary on opposing surfaces of molecules. This is typified by the two complementary chains of DNA within the double helix. Looking for some sort of perspective on Frohlich’s theory, I discovered that the theoretical physicist, Pascual Jordan, had formulated essentially the same idea more than 30 years earlier. He had suggested that it might underlie molecular replication.

Looking for some sort of perspective on Frohlich’s theory, I discovered that the theoretical physicist, Pascual Jordan, had formulated essentially the same idea more than 30 years earlier. He had suggested that it might underlie molecular replication. The idea was sharply rebutted in 1940 by Linus Pauling in a short paper to the journal Science. Pauling’s paper seemed to foreshadow the idea of complementarity as the way to replication and provide the physico-chemical basis for genetics, later so brilliantly realized in Crick and Watson’s double helix. (Galloway, 1989) In the paper mentioned it is rather curious that Linus Pauling had such a sharp response to it; it is noted by others whereas most ignored Jordan’s paper when it first came out, Pauling’s attachment and drive towards it was of note, which did lead to the non-resonant theory achieving dominance in the scientific community, of which Pauling was a part. It is worthwhile to look at the specifics of the argument that Jordan brought forward, which was later shown to have scientific validity in other areas through experimental research in the Soviet Union, while Western science remained controlled and stymied by academic discipline, a discipline that is easy to manipulate with monetary power as most universities are dependent on private funding of very influential industrial powers: Jordan suggested that quantum-mechanical resonance phenomena would lead to an attraction between molecules containing identical groups, and thus to self-reproduction of the antibody molecule…. Jordan’’s concept was substantially identical to Ehrlich’s, with the substitution of a more ‘modern’ mechanism for the reproduction of the specific antibody molecules. It was even more closely the equivalent of Jerne’s natural selection theory…but failed completely to attract the attention of biologists. It did, however, come to the attention of Linus Pauling,t hen promoting his own theory of antibody formation, who lost no time in attacking Jordan’s formulation. The nature and role of intermolecular forces was Pauling’s special domain, and he was quick to point out, in Jordan’s own quantum-mechanical notation, that resonance attractions were less likely between identical molecules than between complementary molecules, as Pauling’s own theory had suggested. It is of some interest that although Pauling’s attack was limited to Jordan’s proposed mechanism for the reduplication of antibody molecules, it served also to eclipse the natural selection aspect of the argument. (Silverstien, 2009) Jordan believed that like molecules would have like resonances and that molecules would be attracted to these resonances. Although, the particulars are not true, the ideal did bear fruit later in a similar concept of Cosic’s that Molecules that share function share resonances; rather than being an issue of stacking or macromolecule building, it was", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:294:30bc822f7669", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2647, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 295, "text": "limited to Jordan’s proposed mechanism for the reduplication of antibody molecules, it served also to eclipse the natural selection aspect of the argument.

Although, the particulars are not true, the ideal did bear fruit later in a similar concept of Cosic’s that Molecules that share function share resonances; rather than being an issue of stacking or macromolecule building, it was relevant in terms of function. Cosic, being an eastern bloc-educated scientific engineer, later in the 1980s came up with the Cosic Resonant Recognition Model. It is generally related (though I have no direct or previous specific idea) in the Resonance research of the Soviets. The question then is, did Jordan’s ideas percolate into Soviet thought? As seen in other sections after the war the Soviets captured Nazi scientists and brought them to work on the Soviet Nuclear program, some of whom were collaborators of Jordan in Berlin-Buch. For instance, G. Zimmer, a close collaborator with Jordan and a specialist in nuclear radiation and genetics, was taken to the Soviet Union. Eventually, the resonance model would prove fruitful in the field of Psychotronics. Kravkov in writing about the use of Millimeter Waves (GHz) in Soviet Psychotronic research relates how resonances were studied in relation to signals used to influence biological objects: Resonances were the first, most intriguing manifestation of microwave exposure. Radio-physicists were struck by the narrowness of the operating radiation bands, the Q factor (the ratio of the wavelength to the bandwidth) reached 300-500 units. To date, influences (capillary effect) with a figure of merit up to 10 thousand units have been found. (i.e., at a wavelength λ = 10mm , for example, the permissible deviations are in the range from 9.9995 to 10.0005mm , no more). Soon it was realized, that not a millimeter wave in general and specific, ostrorezonansnye their frequency, causing one or another back a response of living organisms, and thus have a signal value to their control systems, can be a tool of remote external influence on biological objects, including per person. A long-term experimental search for bio-effective frequencies has begun. “The response to them can be different, both positive and negative. There are certain “frequency-amplitude windows,” inside of which there is a detectable reaction of the biological object, and outside of them, there is none. In this case, the most informative is the frequency of exposure, and the amplitude determines only the mechanism of realization of the response of the organism.“ It was noted above that the frequency is the carrier of information, and the modes of vibration in the body can transform into each other. Therefore, it can be assumed that the resonant response of an organism is possible at the same frequencies with completely different types of influences on it (electromagnetic, acoustic,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:295:3032e5c52161", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2648, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 296, "text": "none.

Therefore, it can be assumed that the resonant response of an organism is possible at the same frequencies with completely different types of influences on it (electromagnetic, acoustic, gravitational, etc.). The greatest interest has always been in the resonances of the human body as a whole: “The argument for using electromagnetic radiation with λ = 4.9mm was considerations based on the known fact of maximum absorption of millimeter waves in the atmosphere by molecular oxygen; λ = 7.1 mm was determined in the experiment - when treating animals affected by oncopathy; and only λ = 5.6mm was chosen based on the analysis of clinical observations of the results of treatment of patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers .” These frequencies are considered basic and were allowed for use by the USSR Ministry of Health. Irene Cosic’ herself has described her interest in Resonances as stemming from the work of Nikola Tesla, who studied the brain frequencies from 3 ⋅ 69Hz (Cosic, 2017). From this she eventually was led to formulate the Cosic Resonant Recognition Model, which was used by Bandyopadhyay to study the EM resonance of Microtubules which is also used by Norseen for ‘Thought Injection.’ Cosic has defined the RRM in the following: The RRM enables the calculation of these spectral characteristics, by assigning each amino acid a physical parameter representing the energy of delocalized electrons of each amino acid. Comparing Fourier spectra for this energy distributions by using cross-spectral function, it has been found that proteins sharing the same biological function/interaction share the same periodicity (frequency) within energy distribution along the macromolecule [5,6]. Furthermore, it has been shown that interacting proteins and their targets share the same characteristic frequency, but have opposite phase at characteristic frequency [5,6,14]. Thus, it has been proposed that the RRM frequencies characterize, not only a general function, but also a recognition and interaction between the particular macromolecule and its target, which then can be considered to be resonant recognition. This could be achieved with resonant energy transfer between the interacting macromolecules through oscillations of a physical field, which is electromagnetic in nature. (Cosic, 2017) Cosic discovered that spectral analyses of a protein sequence after each constituent amino acid had been transformed into an appropriate pseudopotential predicted a resonant energy between interacting molecules. Several experimental studies have verified the predicted peak wavelength of photons within the visible or near-visible light band for specific molecules. Here, this concept has been applied to a classic signaling pathway, JAK–STAT, traditionally composed of nine sequential protein interactions.

Here, this concept has been applied to a classic signaling pathway, JAK–STAT, traditionally composed of nine sequential protein interactions. The weighted linear average of the spectral power density (SPD) profiles of each of the eight ‘‘precursor’’ proteins displayed remarkable congruence with the SPD profile of the terminal molecule (CASP-9) in the pathway. These results suggest that classic and complex signaling pathways in cells can also be expressed as combinations of resonance energies…. Here we present evidence that the JAK ( Janus Kinase)– STAT (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) pathway, one of the classic signaling pathways within the cell whose final component affects the nucleus, can be described as a resonance pattern that is composed of the spectral characteristics of the pathway that converge at the nuclear interface as CASP-9. The protein interactions can be considered a transfer of resonant energy between interacting molecules through an oscillating physical field that could be expressed within the domain of classic photons. (Persinger, 2015d, 245) As we have previously seen, Akimov Generators have been replaced with Lasers and LED quantum generators, in Russian research in Psychotronics from the late 1990s. It is interesting that the RRM occurs in the frequency range from Infrared to visible to Ultraviolet waves. A further implementation of the RRM using LEDs is to use this methodology to fight viruses, not just remotely influence one’s thoughts, Persinger has written on treating viruses using Cosic Resonance with LED lights. In studies it has been used on Ebola as a model, could be investigated for Covid-19 (see Persinger 2015b) and others using appropriately patterned monochromatic (Narrow band) LED to fight Zika virus (Caceres 2018). Although, as important it is to fight infections and viruses, the most important point as this technology relates to Neuroweapons is that it is a viable explanation as to how without drugs or other direct chemical interdiction that EM waves are able to have a neurological or medical affect.” Dr. Bandyopadhyay, in research underwritten by the United States Air Force, has related how this alternate pathway interacts with neurons which produce a stream of binary information: A neuron gets hot and then cold (5–6 THz electromagnetic frequency domain) when it fires or sends a nerve spike (Abbott et al., 1958). Electromagnetic effect on neurons has been studied extensively as it modulates the firing rate (Camera et al., 2012) and even ion channel pathways (Li et al., 2014).

Two neighboring neurons communicate electrically similar to wireless communication (Katz & Schmitt, 1940), and a neuron’s sensitivity to the electric fields depends on the frequency of firing (Radman et al., 2007). While inserting an atomic sharp scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip vibrating at low sinusoidal frequency (30 Hz) inside a single protein at resonance or a protein complex deep inside an axon of a rat hippocampal neuron during a firing we observed a stream of binary pulses. In Fig. 4(a) we have shown two binary streams – one for protein complex in the axon core (see B) and the other for a neuron membrane (see A) measured by using an atomic tip. Obviously, there happens to be a communication in an electrically resonating protein complex in the axon of a neuron whose membrane is resonating a bit later. The Fourier transform of the streams of binary pulses occurring at apparently random time gaps resembled the electromagnetic resonance frequency band measured by us following other routes (Sahu et al., 2013a,b, 2014; Ghosh et al., 2014). This was a surprising observation, and we confirmed this by putting several electrodes and patch clamps simultaneously [Fig. 4(b)], we see live a new form of communication that runs through a pair of neurons and grouping of the resonance frequencies: Molecular biology has not yet incorporated the supremacy of thermal effects (5–6 THz absorption, 22 − 23THz emission as noted above), but grouping of peaks or nesting of frequencies is what we have observed over the years when we see 1012Hz bandwidth of response simultaneously [Figs. 8(a)–8(c)]. Resonance frequency groups together activate together,” is analogous to the historic wired together fire together.” See the groups of resonance peaks in Figs. 5(c)_(ι) 5(d), 6(b), 8(d) and 8(e), one could find the existence of triplet of triplet (33%9) bands. There are various forms of grouping and that is revealed only when we look at the entire frequency bands from micro-hertz to tera-hertz simultaneously. Prior to us, no one looked into the entire em band simultaneously, continuously, so no one saw the complex temporal evolution of resonance band. (Bandyapadhyay, 2016) The greatest criticism leveled against anyone claiming that Neuroweapons are real, in development and being used is the argument based on scientific refutation of such phenomena being possible.

These are two of the more common arguments put forward by those invested with denying in any way the reality of Neuroweapons. So, it is without question that there are indeed historical, scientific and social pointers to the reality of these weapons and their use. In this section I have primarily relied on the technical issues to show that the disinformation, and I can only conclude it is disinformation, is patently and easily shown to be false to the critical researcher or interested party.

Сочи 25-29 августа 2009 n the following I provide documentation on the physics of Aharonov-Bohm Effect weapons technology and neurological effects from these physics as it interacts with the interferometer known as the human brain. This is a review work that provides documentation for the A-B Cybersecurity Device developed to counter non-local weapons. The physiology of those attacked by RF-based weapons in the US Embassy in Havana provides one of the first efforts at medically studying the use of directed waves against a human target. After this I go into the use of entanglement and the physics of entanglement focusing on angular momentum and the utilization of the Aharonov-Bohm effect and Dynamical Casimir Effect, including its Gravitational corollary to the EM version, covering also gravito-electromagnetism- the coupling of gravity and EM, which produces photon emissions which is suggested by some researchers as that along with gravitons as the boson involved in entanglement or deep correlations which is the physical basis of these weapons. Then I show that this work was begun in the Soviet Union and then transferred to the defense industry of the United States of America as well as other NATO members, proliferating into the Black Market. After showing the neurological effects, then understanding the science behind the technology we can then correlate studies on A-B effect regarding Neurological effects to specific areas of the Brain affected in terms of functionality as studied by FMRI and QEEG by the Verma et al and Persinger Group cross-correlated to changes studied in the Havana Syndrome medical studies. avana Syndrome is a popular term coined to refer to the illnesses experienced by diplomats at the US Embas-Hsy in Havana, Cuba in 2016. It is similar to incidents at the Moscow US Embassy of 2.4- 4.0Ghz from 1953 to 1976. Kravkov notes the use of mm waves for biological weapons development starting in the Soviet Union in 1973 (Kravkov, 2006). Another incident was reported in Guangzhou, China also at a US Embassy in 2018. The same illnesses were reported by Russian politician Boris Yeltsin (Kernbach, 2017) in the early 1990s during the break-up of the Soviet Union and attempted coup by Communist Generals. Scientists studying the phenomenon cite microwaves (mm waves) as the culprit; directed-pulsed Radio Frequency weapons.

Whereas critics dismiss the use of highly sensitive technology by militaries around the world, calling the situation a case of mass psychogenic illness, which fits well with a disinformation campaign to keep highly classified technology top secret. There is a general pattern of labeling any serious researchers in this area that are outside military control as pseudoscientists; for instance, see the case of Akimov (see Ch. 8), former Soviet scientist denounced as a pseudo-scientist after disclosure of the Soviet military technology. These symptoms can also occur when working near Radar installations as reported by military technicians since the inception of Radar. Verma et als (2019) Neuroimaging studies focused on the change in white matter and gray matter volumes of the attacked individuals compared to controls the main area affected was the right hemisphere, specifically altering the auditory: Right and Left Superior Temporal Gyrus, Heschl’s Gyrus (BA 22, 48); Right Thalamus and visual-spatial subnets: R & L Frontal Gyrus, Superior Frontal Gyrus, Precentral Gyrus (BA 6); R & L Inferior Parietal Sulcus (BA 2, 40, 7); R & L Frontal Operculum, IFG (BA 44,45, 48) R & L Temporal Gyrus (BA 37), also involved in vision is the Cuneus (BA 17). Finding a difference of whole brain white matter volume, regional gray and white matter volume, mainly in the right hemisphere. The Cerebellar tissue micro-structural integrity was damaged. Functional connectivity in the auditory/visual-spatial subnets was reduced.

As shall be seen later, the area of BA 22 was involved in early Soviet and later Russian research as well as those scientists’ employment with western companies such as Lockheed-Martin (see Norseen et al, 1999). An additional area affected was the volume differences between right and left ventral diencephalon, the caudal (posterior) part of the forebrain containing the thalamus, hypothalamus and ventral thalamus and the third ventricle. Further, they found higher mean fractional anisotropy, the property of substances to exhibit variations in physical properties along different molecular axes (i.e. crystals). • Cuneus, receives visual information from the senses, retina.

It receives serotonin, glutamate. It is part of the “hate circuit” along with the insula. In Male-to-Female Trans people this area has significantly larger gray matter. • Post-Central Gyrus, Broadmann Area 1,2,3. Somatosensory cortex, part of Default Network, contains a sensory strip representing the lower part of the body, contains an inverted map of the contralateral body mirroring the motor strip. Senses touch, pressure, pain, temperature. TMS improves tactile discrimination and reorganizes the somatosensory map, also affects pain modulation. • Triangular part of the Inferior Frontal Gyrus (BA 45, part of Broca’s Area as cited by Norseen below), part of the IFG: BA 44,45,47 Semantic processing, associated with N400 waves in EEG. Part of the VLPFC (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) [related to hypnosis, (see Chapter.11 ‘Hypnosis in Warfare’)]. Functions as cognitive control of memory. Language processing. In Schizophrenics this area is distorted. In Epileptics right IFG (EEG F8) is where seizures start. • Parietal Operculum Broadmann Area 40 secondary somatosensory system Recent data suggest that the parietal operculum acts as an integration center within a multimodal network, originating from different primary sensory and motor cortices and projecting to frontal, parietal and temporal cortical hubs, which in turn govern cognitive and motor functions. Thus, parietal operculum might also play a crucial role in the integrated control of voluntary movement and posture. (Marchese, 2019) • Supramarginal Gyrus The supramarginal gyrus is part of the somatosensory association cortex, which interprets tactile sensory data and is involved in perception of space and limbs location. It is also involved in identifying postures and gestures of other people and is thus a part of the mirror neuron system. Broadmann Area 40 • Temporal Pole found in the Temporal Lobe complex.

Broadmann Area 38 Below, where I present the data on the Brain science involved in studying the effects of A-B weapons, we will see how the Havana Study correlates with Persinger’s (et al.) research. Another researcher on A- B weapons is Dr. Serge Kernbach at U. Stuttgart. He remarks specifically on the Havana Syndrome in relation to weapons: Akimov spoke about the possibility of using this technology in a kind of non-lethal weapon (for example, and at the conference ’KGB: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow’). Taking into account that this experiment is easy to repeat (for example, the script for creating feedback in the ’transmitter’ is provided in the paper), we ask ourselves, whether the ’1986 experiment’ did open the Pandora’s box for nonlocal biological technologies? An unexpected result of this replication experiment represents the potential possibility for a remote monitoring of biological organisms (and possibly non-biological objects). By introducing nonlocal feedback, the object on the transmitter side becomes ’entangled’ with the receiver and can thus be nonlocally monitored. It is necessary to set up such an operation of a remote station, which would not affect the monitoring object. This new aspect needs further verification and development. (Kernbach, 2017) It was the Soviet developers that used the quantum mechanical effect of entanglement to “dose” a target of their technology using the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The creation of the actual tech is well documented and it’s transition into the west, including defense industry markets as well as being available in the black market to non-state actors, so that in our day hypothetically anyone from a state (such as Israel) to a private defense contractor (such as SCL Group of Cambridge Analytica fame), as well as terrorist organizations of all styles of the political spectrum, but more so those aligned with the Black International (e.g. UDA, UVF) with sufficient small-scale technical infrastructure, could have the capability to deploy such a weapon. A succinct account is that the development of A-B weapons actually predates the Cold War, with early work A begun in this area in the 1920s during the Reichswehr-Soviet Technical cooperation agreement, the Rapallo Agreement. In the 1930s Nazi researchers (according to Soviet researchers) developed the use of remote influencing biological objects with equipment seized during the end of the war, initially begun by Ardenne, who experimented with brain-to-brain transfer of thoughts using EM (Ch.8, Quantum Consciousness for details of Nazi origins and transfer to Soviet Union post war).

Later, the Soviets arrested key nuclear engineers of the Nazi regime and brought them under forced labor to aid the Soviet Nuclear program. Earlier work had been done during the war, including the awareness of the viscosity of deuterium under studying D₂O. A secret weapons development intelligence bureau (Navy Patent and Technology Office, see Ch. 3 for details on Nazi research in remote surveillance) was set up in Berlin during the war that involved one of the founders of Quantum Mechanics, Pascual Jordan, and some of his close collaborators in molecular biology genetics research and the Nazi Nuclear program who were taken to the Soviet Union, Timoféeff-Ressovsky and Karl Zimmer; with expertise in the Nazi Nuclear program in cancer and radiation, altering genes with EM, etc. Russian researchers trace the origins of the Cold War weapons program which was re-started in the 1950s after Stalin stopped all research in 1937, ruthlessly purging his military just before the war and was diagnosed with schizophrenia, which can also mimic temporal lobe epilepsy; which also as we shall see below match symptoms of A-B effect on the brain when used maliciously. The studies of remote influence on biological objects were first conducted in 1966 by Kaznacheev and another team led by N.D. Devyatkov, who reverse engineered the Nazi generators, and M.B. Golant studying “the resonant response of living biological objects exposed to microwaves (mm waves),” (see Chapter 8). With backward wave lamps or oscillators (Лампы обратной волны) with longitudinal magnetic field linked between Nazi instruments and later remote influencing research at the Soviet Istok (Исток) Institute, which involved captured Nazi scientists in its administration and founding. These oscillators are used as microwave generators in THz range as illuminators for imaging and practically as radar jammers, will they also work against Quantum Radar such as A-B generators? It was also in 1966 that the first Soviet plans for detecting HFGW was formulated by G.A. Lupanov, using capacitors for detectors. Reflexive Control, Cybernetics and Biology were used to further the weapons program. In the later part of the 1990s the US NSA became interested in Soviet Weapons development using A-B Effect and specifically at injecting ‘corrective behavior’ using various psychological mechanisms delivered remotely through the transmitters of the A-B Generators.

One company contracted to develop American versions of Soviet technology was Lockheed-Martin, which is where engineer Dr. John Norseen, who studied in Russia, was contracted to develop Air Control systems which involved interactions monitored automatically as a means to assist the pilot for safety purposes. His other work with Lockheed-Martin involved the creation of sentient machines (Norseen, 2000) for automation, the creation of ‘Thought-Injection’ to correct the behavior of terrorists. His ideals of using ‘Thought-Injection’ were reported in popular publications as well as military publications of the late 1990s and early 2000s, before all talk of this work stopped after being deployed. We are aware of his work by his public statements, papers and conversations with others that were documented such as (Norseen, Laurie, 2002). From these open public sources, we can gain valuable information on how a neurological based weapon could be created. The following material is different from that presented in Ch.4 (‘Lessons from an American Weapons Developer’). Here I drill down into some of the specific areas that Norseen was interested in, in terms of ‘Thought-Injection’, in which he proposed using radar to inject and monitor the thoughts of the terrorist, his neurobiological interests primarily focused on using Electromagnetism (E x H Fields) to influence the microtubules (MT10 and MT13 types) in the neurons of the brain, which was compiled from brain maps using QEEG working with Soviet Researcher Juri Kropotov of the Brain Institute in St. Petersburg, one of the original centers of research for remote influence in terms of psychology. He coined the term BioFusion as on overarching term relating to the sensor fusion of the human senses. In a 1999 paper co-authored by Norseen and Kropotov, they studied the visual cortex, one of the main areas affected by the Havana Syndrome. In Norseen’s other work (Norseen, 2000) he cites specifically BA 17,18 which is the visual pathway altered in Havana Syndrome. BioFusion as the sensory input is the starting point in understanding how ‘Thought-Injection’ is accomplished. Norseen has remarked on what is BioFusion: “emergent process of biochemical-induced, electromagnetic E & H [electric and magnetic flux] fields mediated interactions of information with uniquely configured neural structures, and expressed into work via protein reconfiguration [microtubules] under the term BioFusion.” (Norseen, 2000) and “Biofusion involves posterior inferior temporal gyri (ITG) [altered in Havana Syndrome] in visual perception modality. The ability to blend vision and verbal modality in the Temporal Cortex, TC-22 and Broadmann’s Area 44 [Broca’s Area].” (Norseen, 2000).

It is interesting that the areas targeted are also areas that were affected by Havana Syndrome. The ability to sense and alter a brain state happens in the microsecond scale, see point durations below, as explained by Norseen: The time scale for Bio-Fusion action is remarkably short. The vast majority of the brain executes its portfolio of actions in seconds to tenths, to hundredths of seconds. It is very hard for the brain consciously to concentrate for minutes or hours on end, almost as if in the striatum, our sense of time to dwell, our bio-chronicity is preset for the sub-second regime. Can this be reset? The answer would appear to be yes, if only at least from episodic documentary from periods of altered states and periods of time loss due to dissociative or fugue events. This also does not preclude that the brain may be engaged in very long term, but non- conscious, mathematical processing. So, what would happen if suddenly, instantly, in a fit of advanced, catastrophic evolutionary rage, that our brain would suddenly operate on a far more distant Time Slope of not seconds and partial seconds, but thought domains of hours, days, years – allowing Sentient Machines to handle the routine reasoning tasks of the lesser Time Limits? Such time-thought testing is now available in Cortical Emulation Research (CER). And where is the dark matter of the brain, the untapped regions that will provide for our future, perhaps even Accelerated Rates of Evolution? The answer may exist at the layer in the anterior cingulate between the older brain, deeper brain and the outer folding top cover of the cortex, as well as in the less knotty, less complicated realm of the right side of the brain – ‘The God Spots!’ [a reference to Dr. Persinger’s work with sensed presences using the God helmet magnetic field generator]. (Norseen, 2000) It is interesting to note that Norseen specifically mentions the anterior cingulate which is a prime difference between highly and non-highly hypnotizable persons who have a heightened activation in the ACC, He also mentions in other places the connection to the Amygdala, which is enlarged in the highly hypnotizable and in Epileptic patients. The Cortical Emulation Research he is referencing is that of former Soviet scientist Dr. Juri Kropotov. The timings involved come into play in creating modulated phases or frequencies which are used to alter the electromagnetism of the brain.

As shall be seen this is the main principle involved in the Soviet A-B Generators. Norseen speaks of magnetism and reconfiguration of proteins, like the microtubules: Sentient machines, which Dr. Norseen advocates, is a common attribute of being interested in cybernetics along with remote influence of biological objects, seen routinely in Soviet research as well as by Dr. Serge Kernbach who teaches Cybernetics, reminding us that cybernetics is the study of control in the machine and the animal. The primary protein that Dr. Norseen is interested in altering using EM waves is that of the MT10 and MT13 25nm width, Casimir Effect length) structures in the neurons, damage to MT13 in neurons is associated with Alzheimer’s disease, brain trauma and other brain ailments due to microtubule disturbances. In some of his presentation slides (see Laurie 2002) he writes of MT10 (cellular mitosis controller) as an electrical biocomputer, and importantly for A-B effect MT13 as a magnetic bio-computation, which he notes is targeted by potentials as in the A-B Effect. Pribram speaks of MT as a wave guide, “The intracellular spread of dendritic polarizations can be accounted for by microtubular structures that act as wave guides and provide additional surface upon which the polarizations can act.” (Pribram, 1999) Norseen posited the concept of Quantum Shift Keys (QSK) which interacts as a lockkey mechanism to alter MT’s. He cites in his work the ideas of Primbram and Hameroff (see, Chapter 8, Quantum Consciousness for detailed discussion), who also worked with former Communist block scientist Dr. Koruga (U. of Belgrade, Serbia, former Yugoslavia), on the ideal of microtubules and Consciousness. Hameroff published with Karl Pribram on the topic in 1994. Brain Holography was the area cited in terms of Pribram as we shall see below, the idea of MTs and neurons goes back to the concept of the Objective Reduction, a gravitational collapse of the wave state created by Penrose and Hameroff, here we see already the role of gravity and gravitons in the collapse as shall be discussed later in relation to the Gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect and other Soviet research in control using gravitational waves, (See McCarron 2021, ‘CH.8 Quantum Consciousness’). The orchestrated reduction according to Norseen takes place in the Neuropil and involves 4 Quanta, a quaternion. Norseen writes regarding the role of QSK and MTs: The role of magnetic fields in interstitial water of MTs has been proven by Bandyopadhyay’s Group (See Ch. 8 Quantum Consciousness for detailed discussion) in The Materials Science Institute in Japan, interstitial water core of MT acts as a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:308:7b29aa9d5ccd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2661, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 309, "text": "and other Soviet research in control using gravitational waves, (See McCarron 2021, ‘CH.8 Quantum Consciousness’).

We see that the QSK is a E-H Field as mentioned by Norseen. It is claimed that human thought can be reduced down to a Krylov sub-space, “the human condition captured in automated krylov space,” as Norseen put it (Norseen, 2000). These calculations were begun by Juri Kropotov in the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Again, it does not seem Norseen has invented these techniques but learned of them for Lockheed-Martin from the original Soviet Communist science researchers. Kropotov has called the collapse of the totalitarian- dictatorship of the Soviet Union “horrible” (Kropotov, 2009). Norseen writes regarding Kropotov’s contribution to ‘Thought-Injection’: Even more extraordinary, Dr. Kropotov was able to capture the complex adaptive rules of mental functions, perceptual activity across sensory modalities, into software to produce Cortical Emulation Research, by which the same math functions that appear in brains, can now be made to emerge in software. This finding of extreme importance leads us to Information Injection via the introduction or playback of the Inverse Function of the Gabor in Hilbert Space, or whatever other mathematical domain that also may be workable in various species’ brains. Thoughts then could be categorized as either culturally dependent, or when synthetically produced, as culturally independent. Both culturally independent and dependent thought means that machines could be produced that could conceivably never be able to communicate with a human. It/they would exist in its/ their own perceptual world made up of its/their own mathematical thought structures. But more likely is that some common, semiotic language of human-machine interests will arise that can universally transform to some degree each particular species, to include synthetic species, into emergent mathematical thought domains.” (Norseen, 2000) The inverse function is similar to experiments aimed at stopping seizures by playing back an EM recording of the patient’s brain waves to suppress seizures. The work of Sandyk and Anninos in 1992 attenuated seizures by playing back through EM the intensity and frequency of a magnetic field from the MEG profile of patient, repeated for n = 150 other patients successfully (Ye et al, 2019). So, clearly, we can see that the science behind what Norseen is referring to is based on experimental success. Dr. Kropotov is a world renowned scientist in what has become known as Quantitative Electroencephalography (QEEG); he worked extensively studying various medical conditions of the brain", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:309:5c9898f907e7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2662, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 310, "text": "in 1992 attenuated seizures by playing back through EM the intensity and frequency of a magnetic field from the MEG profile of patient, repeated for n = 150 other patients successfully (Ye et al, 2019). So, clearly, we can see that the science behind what Norseen is referring to is based on experimental success. Dr. Kropotov is a world renowned scientist in what has become known as Quantitative Electroencephalography (QEEG); he worked extensively studying various medical conditions of the brain using EEG measuring tools, fMRI, during the late Soviet days Positron Electron Tomography to map the various parts of the brain and their functions. However, when the ‘horrible’ collapse of the Soviet Union came he found himself, like many scientists who went to the west for employment, working with Karl Pribram in the early 1990s at Radford University. So, we can understand the synthesis of the quantitative methods of Kropotov and those of the holographic brain of Karl Pribram reflected in the writings of John Norseen, a collaborator of Kropotovs. As mentioned previously, one of the main areas of influence are the visual cortex (BA 17,18) in Thought Injection to be delivered via EM waves, this is also one of the primary areas showing differential measurements in Gray Matter (GM) and White Matter (WM) in the fMRIs of staff affected by Havana Syndrome, see below. Kropotov and Norseen collaborated on a paper in 1999; Norseen lists himself as a Lockheed-Martin employee and uses his work address in this paper. Kropotov previously had come up with the Canonical Cortical Module (CCM), which is a way of dividing the brain into a matrix of $5 0 0 { \\bf x } 5 0 0$ individual modules, each matrix or module representing functionality in the cortical area of the brain. It is reminiscent of the AI technique Convolutional Neural Networks. The math of the CCM Operators includes encoding all orientations and all possible spatial frequencies which are extracted in the cortical area at a given eccentricity (Norseen & Kropotov, 1999) Another trade craft gleaned from Norseen’s collaboration with Kropotov was that of the use of the Gabor Function, a sinusoid wave windowed with a Gaussian wave where frequency and orientation as well as size of the function can be tuned. Norseen credits his use of the Gabor Function and the Inverse transform at 14Hz to Kropotov (Laurie, 2002), who again worked with Pribram, who comments on Gabor functions: During the 1970’s it became apparent that Gabor’s notation also applied to the cerebral cortical aspect of visual and somatic sensory processing. The most elegant work was done with regard to the visual system.

A recent review by Tai Singe Lee in the IEEE casts these advances in terms of 2D Gabor wavelets and indicates the importance of frames and specifies them for different sampling schemes. For the monkey, the physiological evidence indicates that the sampling density of the visual cortical receptive fields for orientation and frequency provides a tight frame representation through oversampling. The Gabor function is used to gather texture or fine detail of object recognition. In another presentation slide Norseen cites the use of hyper spectral analysis, fine detail analysis of spectral lines, which is also preluded by the work of former Soviet military researcher Shkatov in using A-B effect techniques in sensing. Since 2000 they used the method ‘torsion [AB] phase portrait’ (TPP), торсионного фазового портрета (ТФП)) for remote fine field diagnostics. (Shkatov 2009), claiming to glean potential energy data from EM based media. Hence, to find a Gabor-Like Function in Hilbert Space as the operant mathematical operation where neural structure interacts with information compressing it from the environment would be the precise math structure that one could use to define the exact moment when Perception occurs from the general state input from or of the Sensory Modalities. A specific Gabor function could then be assigned to each object perceived in the brain. A data base could be built up, a thought code of mathematical expressions that literally is what the brain actually sees when information, like a Bernoulli’s code, passes through neural structure. Just as wind under an airfoil produces lift, a Gabor function is the moment when information entering neural structure creates a thought. Such a ‘Eureka’ moment was discovered in Pavlov’s Laboratory in 1996, by Dr. Juri Kropotov and his team. They found that just as Pribram predicted, when you look at neural structure interacting with signal to noise information from the external environment, that a Gabor-Like Function in Hilbert Space emerges at the exact moment of perception from the sensory field. Based on the work described in this paper, BioFusion R&D findings strongly suggest earlier predictions that human brain perceptual processes represent, at a minimum, an n-dimensional family of interacting Gabor-Like Functions in Hilbert Space (Pribram-91). (Norseen, 2000) The mathematical representation of human thought for the purposes of sensory fusion enables a cognitive map to be produced. Norseen speaks of the key ability to capture brain EM maps as well as send back via an inverse function either the same or altered information to the brain. He speaks of deceiving the mind to accept these thoughts as one’s own, this concept of an A-B Effect injected thoughts not being perceived as alien to one’s own thought train", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:311:150a40456529", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2664, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 312, "text": "2000) The mathematical representation of human thought for the purposes of sensory fusion enables a cognitive map to be produced.

He speaks of deceiving the mind to accept these thoughts as one’s own, this concept of an A-B Effect injected thoughts not being perceived as alien to one’s own thought train is written of by the Persinger Group as well. Norseen comments on inverse function or injection: QSK originates in the Orchestrated Reduction of Quantum entanglement at specific EM resonating frequency locations in the protein microtubulin in the neuropil. QSK is then communicated via oscillating and standing waves [solitons] in the neurosynaptic-dendritic region… At certain frequency and energy threshold a combining resonance is established in the brain function that binds the various oscillating brain subresonances into a cohesive sentient pattern. (Norseen, 2000) Cognitive recall is comprised of Gabor Functions in Hilbert Space. The MTs are altered by the magnetic fields of interstitial (within the protein) waters. The wave form specifically targets calpain as Norseen points out: “EM Resonance, then calpain (neuromolecule), then calpain dissipates and a structural imprint of the QSK encoded wave-front interference pattern onto protein [MT] structure.” (Laurie, 2002) To account for these properties we turn to the dendritic membrane and its immediate surround. Dendritic membranes are composed of two oppositely oriented phospholipid molecules. The interior of the membrane is hydrophobic as it formed by “lipids which form a fluid matrix within which protein molecules are embedded - the lipids can move laterally at rates of 2 ~sec; protein molecules move about 40 times more slowly (50nm/ sec or 3 ∼ tm/min, ).” Some of the intrinsic membrane proteins provide channels for ion movement across the membrane. We have gone on to speculate that as each pattern of signals exciting the dendritic arborization produces a macroscopic, ionically produced change of the charge distribution in the dendritic network, it triggers a spontaneous symmetry breaking of a radiation field (a boson condensation) altering the water molecular field in the immediately adjacent perimembranous region. A macroscopic domain of the dynamically ordered structure of water is created in which the electric dipole density is aligned in one and the same direction. It is this domain of dynamically ordered water that is postulated to provide the physical substrate of the interactions among polarizations occurring in dendritic spines. (Pribram 1999) Earlier it was mentioned that Pribram was a source for the holographic background to Norseen’s work; how ever, it should be mentioned that the use of holography was already developed in the Soviet Union. Holography is a visual field phenomenon as noted by Russian researcher Kaznacheev in work initially begun by him in the 1960s.

Holography is a visual field phenomenon as noted by Russian researcher Kaznacheev in work initially begun by him in the 1960s. Again, it should be pointed out that the retina’s cones and rods act as cavity resonators or as high-Q antennas. In his patent (Kaznacheev 2004) he and his team engineered a system to pass holograms into the visual cortex but not in the visual range, so it is imageless holography, although it can be modified to also send visual hologram, as he writes “the invention relates to the field of optics and is intended to create a hologram containing non-visualized physiologically significant information that can be used in medicine.” (Kaznacheev, 2004). This method is described: Method 1. The subject is alternately presented with a holographic image invisible to him, reproduced from the transmissive hologram according to option 1 (Fig. 2a), containing (experimental hologram) and not containing (control hologram) non-visualized physiologically significant information. At the moment of presentation of holograms, physiologically significant biophysical parameters of a person are measured. As physiologically significant biophysical parameters can be used, for example, the characteristics of the electroencephalogram or the parameters of the glow of the fingers in the video recording mode, obtained by the method of computer gas-discharge visualization. In the presence of significant differences in the reactions of the organism between the control and experimental holograms, a conclusion is made about the presence of non-visualized physiologically significant information in the hologram. This allows both the transmission and reception of holographic information. The transmission of the holograms occurs in the 2.5Hz − 3.5Hz, , and 10Hz (Alpha) brain wave rhythms. When the brain is presented with a hologram containing non-visualized physiologically significant information it triggers the activation of 10Hz Alpha, which is also mentioned by Norseen. Kaznacheev found upon exposure the 10Hz frequency modulation variant in the EEG locations, with significant difference, in F3, F4 (frontal lobe) and in 01, 02 (occipital lobe) related to the visual pathways, which is noted as suffering under Havana Syndrome. The work of Gurov dating back to 1976 is of special interest as it relates to Norseen’s Thought- Injection. He works with such concepts as the ‘Semantic Field of a Person’ (семантического поля) using ‘psychosomatic radar’ (психосоматического радара) and psychoneuroimmuno-modulation which is corrective behavior. Gurov explains this concept in more detail: Human communication involves not only verbal and non-verbal signals, but also psychosomatic radar. Psychosomatic radar is a genetically determined frequency of electromagnetic oscillations emitted by the brain, which, complementing verbal and non- verbal communication patterns, sends signals to the environment and perceives signals coming from the environment.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:313:800fb0a406c2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2666, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 314, "text": "Injection.

Psychosomatic radar is a genetically determined frequency of electromagnetic oscillations emitted by the brain, which, complementing verbal and non- verbal communication patterns, sends signals to the environment and perceives signals coming from the environment. With the help of this radar, a person transmits information about himself to the outside and perceives information coming from other people. A. Meneghetti (the founder of ontopsychology) argued that such energetic interaction of people occurs in the semantic field, and the perception of the semantic field allows a person to know about any action, visible or invisible, that is related to him in his environment. This field is a radar given to man by nature. The peculiarity of the psychosomatic radar is that it can be directed both outside (extroverts) and inside (introverts) of a person. We understand the semantic field as the physical field of a biological object (person) with its bioenergetic and energy-informational features, which are revealed semiotically (by certain signs) [семиотически (по определенным знакам)] at the level of kinetic-proxemic communications and which are further interpreted by the operator, establishing a pragmatic connection of signs with the “addressee” and its properties … Let us consider two patented methods of analyzing the semantic field of a person, which in the “here and now” mode allow us to assess extra-introversion (intentionality), the level of reactivity and the degree of congruence and incongruence of the semantic field of a person. (Gurov, 2016) To summarize, neurons are controlled by the electro-magnetic waves that interact with the microtubules acting as wave guides through the influence of interstitial waters; these microtubules using QSK can be programmed and altered as well as read out using various spectroscopy. In the next section we depart from neurobiology and electromagnetics to focus on the actual physics behind the A-B generators to understand how a profile of a targeted brain or even a piece of hardware could be understood. . he means of delivering A-B Effect magnetic potentials is done through the use of generators that use the Aharonov-Bohm effect, referred to in the original and outdated Soviet research as Torsion Fields and referred to in some popular pseudoscience advocates’ presentation of this technology.

The non-local effect is created through entanglement as mentioned by Norseen above; this is also mentioned in the works of Persinger and Kernbach. In this work I will examine the original Soviet A-B generator, the Akimov Generators (Kernbach, 2017), and I will examine the design of American Physicist Hal Puthoff in his A-B Generator (Puthoff, 1998), then comparing this to the coil system based on a toroid by the Persinger Group (Scott et al, 2015a), who initially experimented with circular arrays of 8 solenoids before switching to toroids (Persinger, 2002 till 2015). It should be mentioned that Akimov Generators were replaced by an LED system by another Soviet military researcher, A.B. Bobrov, who uses lasers (LEDS) to entangle objects (targets) (Bobrov, 2009). An LED-based countermeasure system is the goal of this project after experimenting with toroid coils. In another project I experiment with LEDs and entanglement for biomedical purposes. According to physicists the key instrument of entanglement is Angular Momentum (Fickler et al, 2012). In the gen-erators such as Puthoff ’s there is a mechanism to change angular momentum as well as the rhythm of the frequency output of the generator. Angular Momentum is represented by J. For entanglement this focus is on orbital angular momentum since as Fickler et al argue single photon with helical phase (like the coil toroid) structures may carry a quantized amount of orbital angular momentum (OAM) and their entanglement is important for quantum computation and information science, which aids in quantum remote sensing according to Fickler by using OAM. Stav et al have shown that there is quantum entanglement between spin AM and orbital AM in photons (Stav et al, 2018). History of the discovery of spin or angular momentum is interesting. The first experiments that became known as being associated with the discovery of spin was that by Stern and Gerlach, both WWI veterans and German nationalists. Walter Gerlach later went on to head the Nazi Nuclear Weapons program and was arrested and detained by the British for a year of interrogations. The Stern-Gerlach experiment settled the question as to what the actual spin configuration was; whereas Bohr thought it binary, Sommerfeld thought it trinary, the experiment proved that it is trinary. Another Nazi involved in the science of spin was Pascual Jordan, whose Jordan Map was key to Schwinger’s bosonic model of angular momentum.

In the Soviet Union spin (in Russian ‘torsion’) is used was recognized as the key part to the A-B Generators. This suggests the Soviets inherited their knowledge of Spin Fields from the Nazis, calling it by the term of Torsion Fields, as named by Akimov and Shipov. However, these spin fields are really angular momentum in physics, the coupling of orbital and spin angular momentum. The lasting impact of the Iron Curtain that split eastern science from western science has had a long and deleterious effect on scientific progress. There is another type of angular momentum, called spin angular momentum (more often shortened to spin), represented by the spin operator ${ \\bf S } = ( { \\bf S } { \\bf x } , { \\bf S } { \\bf y } , { \\bf S } { \\bf z } )$ . Spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis, but this is only a metaphor: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to motion in space. All elementary particles have a characteristic spin, which is usually nonzero. • Angular momentum cannot be oriented purely in the Z axis • Spin Angular Momentum: quantum number is from a range of 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, 5/2 . Bosons (Messenger particles) full integer spin. Fermions have half-integer spin. • Coupling- 2 or more Angular Momentum interactions with each other so the angular momentum can transfer from one to the other (i.e. spin-orbit coupling) transfer of L to S (orbital to spin). (see below) • Angular Momentum Rotation: the total AM or J characterizes how a quantum system is changed when it is rotated. R is the Rotation Operator • Conservation of angular momentum states that J for a closed system, or J for the whole universe, is conserved. However, L and S are not generally conserved. For example, the spin–orbit interaction allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between L and S, with the total J remaining constant. n quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operator is one of sever-I al related operators analogous to classical angular momentum. The angular momentum operator plays a central role in the theory of atomic and molecular physics and other quantum problems involving rotational symmetry.

The angular momentum operator plays a central role in the theory of atomic and molecular physics and other quantum problems involving rotational symmetry. Such an operator is applied to a mathematical representation of the physical state of a system and yields an angular momentum value if the state has a definite value for it. In both classical and quantum mechanical systems, angular momentum (together with linear momentum and energy) is one of the three fundamental properties of motion. There are several angular momentum operators: total angular momentum (usually denoted J), orbital angular momentum (usually denoted L), and spin angular momentum (spin for short, usually denoted S). The term angular momentum operator can (confusingly) refer to either the total or the orbital angular momentum. Total angular momentum is always conserved, see Noether’s theorem. the total angular momentum operator characterizes how a quantum system is changed when it is rotated. The most general and fundamental definition of angular momentum is as the generator of rotations. More specifically, let R $\\left( { \\bf n } , \\phi \\right)$ be a rotation operator, which rotates any quantum state about axis n by angle ϕ. . As ϕ0 , the operator R (n,ϕ) approaches the identity operator,1, because a rotation of 0^(∘) maps all states to themselves. Then the angular momentum operator J is defined as: Often, two or more sorts of angular momentum interact with each other, so that angular momentum can transfer from one to the other. For example, in spin–orbit coupling, angular momentum cantransfer between L and S, but only the total J = L + S is conserved. In another example, in an atom with two electrons, each has its own angular momentum ${ \\bf J } _ { 1 }$ and J₂, but only the total ${ \\bf { J } } = { \\bf { J } } _ { 1 } + { \\bf { J } } _ { 2 }$ is conserved. A. The operator R_(☉) , related to J, rotates the entire system. B.The operator R spatial , related to L, rotates the particle positions without altering their internal spin states. C. The operator Rinternal, related to S, rotates the particles’ internal spin states without changing their positions. Thus, we see from this general overview of Angular Momentum and its relationship to Entanglement, that spin and orbital angular momentum come into play with the Aharonov-Bohm toroid, or helical coil generator. So that rotation is related to entanglement, meaning that anything in rotation is entangled, also this could mean that a Closed Timelike Curve $\\scriptstyle \\left( \\mathrm { E P R = C T C ? } \\right.$ ) can only occur in rotating spaces so if the universe is rotating it is entangled as a whole, which comes into play with what I call the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:317:0b91fea00a4a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2670, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 318, "text": "and orbital angular momentum come into play with the Aharonov-Bohm toroid, or helical coil generator.

Persinger et al have found that it takes about 8 minutes for the entanglement process to begin in non-local experiments of the A- B Generators, which he also calculated to be equivalent of the Persinger Time to traverse the universe, This process is based in transition from virtual particle to real particle involving dark energy, “entanglement velocity involves the ongoing conversion of dark energy as subthreshold (‘virtual’) photon masses into measurable photon” (Koren, 2015). Virtual particles of the vacuum fluctuations mediate non-local causality (Persinger, 2015), “a transformation of the state of particles occurs when there is a changing EMF that contributes to or defines a boundary condition, Casimir and A-B effectsare at boundary conditions, phase transition is a boundary condition as well. 1μT increase in Magnetic intensity gives us 2 photon emission at 10^( − 18)J (Persinger, 2015). o understand the mechanics further of the A-B Generators it is necessary to review general theories of Electro-Magnetism and the coupling with Gravito-electromagnetics, as well as a general overview of the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the Casimir Effect, of which for the purposes of biological influence are interrelated as Casimir Effect phenomena are argued to occur in the neurons of the Brain by Persinger et al, Norseen, Bandyapadhyay’s Group. There is a direct relationship between photons and entanglement. Photons the Messenger Boson (spin 1) of the electro-magnetic spectrum are related to entanglement and the graviton. In a study on the A-B Generators it was found that entanglement reflects both the mass and velocity of the electron- wave (photon) duality (Koren, 2016, 3337). As the electron and photon represent the duality, a relationship is related to Gravity through its particle the graviton and the photon. As explained by Koren: The ∼ 10²³m ⋅ s^( − 1) value relates the rest mass of the graviton and the rest mass of the photon as intersecting phenomena that may only differ by the proportion of involvement of the entanglement velocity. The product of the upper boundary for the rest mass of a photon (2 ⋅ 10^( − 52)kg, the velocity of light (3⋅10⁸m⋅s−1) and the entanglement velocity (2.8⋅10²³m⋅s−1) is 1.7 ⋅ 10^( − 20)J .

On the other hand, the product of the upper boundary of a graviton is ∼ 2 ⋅ 10^( − 65)kg . In this case the square of the entanglement velocity derived from the electric and magnetic energy equivalents of 0.8 ⋅ 10²³m ⋅ s ⋅ 1 (that does not involve G) is 4.4 ⋅ 10^( − 19)] . This is within the range of the visible wavelength. Clearly if the actual value was 10^( − 66)kg for the theoretical graviton, the energy for the emergent photon and graviton would be potentially convergent. This is another support for the quantitative relationship and perhaps identity between the process labeled as Gravity and that labeled as “light” which persistently exhibits the dual properties of wave and particle” (Koren, 2016, 3337). When an electron shifts Bohr shells it discharges 2 photons of spin-1; a photon is composed of gravitons of Spin 2. An electron is spin % . So, we see 3 bands of spin involved in entanglement. The interaction between photons and gravity, graviton’s identity changes (Spin 2), so it can form the EM properties of photons (spin = 1 ). The electron is a half-concrete (electron) and half virtual particle (photon) as it traverses the Compton Wavelength for the electron orbit. Maxwell’s equations as we understand them today were abridged by Heaveside. The original Maxwell equa-tions comprised dozens of equations, which were simplified by Heaveside to the four main equations below. As far as the potential energy vectors of Aharonov-Bohm effect, these equations were first hinted at in the work of Whittaker in 1904, a one-time astrophysics teacher at the Observatory in Dublin, Ireland. n a 1959 paper, Y. Aharonov and D. Bohm contrary to the conclusions of classical mechanics, the electromagnet-I ic 4-potential (A, Φ) , the motion of an electron beam, even in regions where the electromagnetic field vanishes can still affect a particle. Aharonov-Bohm takes hold at boundaries and in macrostructures in phase shifts of matter, “Attributing the Aharonov-Bohm effect to the four-potential A is possible only where the EM field vanishes.” (Friedman et al, 2010) The application of the A Vector Potential is based on the work of Whittaker in 1904. As explained by Israeli Mathematician Friedman: The Aharonov-Bohm effect is traditionally attributed to the effect of the electromagnetic 4- potential A, even in regions where both the electric field E and the magnetic field B are zero. We argue that the quantity measured by AB experiments may be the difference in values of a multiple-valued complex function, which we call a pre-potential", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:319:5933ee7a7782", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2672, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 320, "text": "al, 2010) The application of the A Vector Potential is based on the work of Whittaker in 1904.

We argue that the quantity measured by AB experiments may be the difference in values of a multiple-valued complex function, which we call a pre-potential [Persinger’s Second Derivative? See below]. The pre-potential is a combination of the two scalar potential functions introduced by E. T. Whittaker. We show that any electromagnetic field can be described by such pre-potential; and give an explicit expression for the electromagnetic field tensor through this potential. (Friedman et al, 2014) Another important understanding to have of the A Vector is that it is applicable to quantum physics, not classical physics, as indicated by Waechter: In contrast to classical mechanics, where the equation(s) of motion contain only the electric and magnetic field, in quantum mechanics the Schrödinger equation explicitly contains the electromagnetic potentials. This fact was known since the beginning of quantum mechanics, but it wasn’t until the publishing of the paper “Significance of Electromagnetic Potentials in the Quantum Theory” by Y. Aharonov and D. Bohm in 1959, that the consequences of this fact received serious attention. (Waechter, 2018) As measured in a given frame of reference, and for a given gauge, the first component of the electromagnetic four-potential is conventionally taken to be the electric scalar potential, and the other three components make up the magnetic vector potential. While both the scalar and vector potential depend upon the frame, the electromagnetic four-potential is Lorentz covariant. More specifically, the involvement of an Aharanov-Bohm effect indicates that for phase- modulation or phase shift to occur the average change in voltage must be near the peaks of capacity but not at the peaks of capacity. Consequently, forcing the systems to its limits or maximum boundaries (-5 to + 5V ), in addition to distorting the signal, would be above the narrow band pass. This has been observed in our systems. Values below the value would not be sufficient to elicit the effect. Because our signals are constructed from a series of numbers (integers) ranging from 0 through 256 (-5 to + 5V ) and pass through the critical zone, perhaps the efficacy of our patterns might be re-evaluated with respect to what proportion of “time” or passes occur within the 4.1 to 4.3V band. This could be considered a metaphor for the duration within the voltage field.” (Koren, 2016) he Soviet researchers learned that there is a conversion between Electromagnetic Waves and Gravitational TWaves, which explains the Soviets’ focus on Gravitational Wave-based non-local cybernetic experiments as early as 1967.

(see Chapter 6 ‘Physics of Neuroweapons’) A Russian researcher, V. Samokhvalov, continuing on the earlier Soviet research in this area, explains the subtle energies which could be overlooked; he comments: According to Einstein’s general theory of relativity, the rotating mass field differs from a non-rotating mass field by additional, so-called, gravimagnetic forces, which affect rotating objects. Taking this fact into consideration, it is assumed that gravimagnetic forces act only if they are close to large masses or in presence of masses moving at relativistic speed, and they do not exhibit themselves in nature because of their extremely small values. However, many researchers in their works mentioned facts, which showed significant non-electromagnetic interaction of small objects, rotating at low speeds, with each other and with the objects, surrounding them. One of the first evidences of such kind was the experiments of Professor N.P. Myshkin, which were carried out at the beginning of the XX century. The effect of change in weight of rotating objects (gyroscopes) and their non-electromagnetic interaction with other objects are described in works by N.A. Kozyrev, V.V. Roshin and S.M. Godin, S.V. Plotnikov, etc. The experimental research…also showed that in nature there is a significant value contactless interaction of rotating small masses and their force effect on closely located objects (masses) at relatively small rotary and linear speeds of rotation. The value of occurring mass-dynamic forces is by 20 orders more than the value of gravimagnetic forces, which act in this case according to general theory of relativity. [see Persinger observation of 20x greater entanglement reactions in his experiments of non-local entanglement] Experimentally determined non-electromagnetic interaction was called mass-dynamic interaction, because it is determined by dynamic mass rotation, having a variable quadrupole moment. [see Einstein’s Gravitational Quadropole equation below] The research, which was carried out, showed non-electromagnetic nature of force interaction, i.e., independence of interaction force effects from electrical conductivity of disc materials and dependence of force interaction value on their rotation frequency. (Samokhvalov, 2016) The deniers of the scientific reality of this technology, which seems to be an information operation aimed at keeping state-secrets secret, have claimed that this is an EM conductive or thermal effect, this is not what the researchers are claiming, they are claiming that there is a potential EM non- thermal effect, A-B Effect, and that is the basis of the A-B Generators.

This is also related to the argument against Thought-Injection or QSK that the magnitudes, here talking about magnetic fields of 1 ⋅ 5μT, are too small in terms of electric conduction, which we see below is not based on experimental findings. There is another A-B Effect that is not EM based; the equivalent in Gravitational Theory, according to many researchers, including R. Chiao, the gravitational equivalent of the Gravitational Aharonov- Bohm effect. So that one does not as seen need to use Electric force in entanglement experiments but rather potentials can accomplish what force can. Chiao has written of the conversion from Maxwell Equations to Gravitomagnetic Maxwell Equations. The gravitoelectric field EG, which is identical to the local acceleration due to gravity g, is analogous to the electric field E, and the gravitomagnetic field BG, which is identical to the Lense-Thirring field (Poynting Vector of Magnetic flux), is analogous to the magnetic field B; they are related to the vector potential h in the radiation gauge as follows: where ρG is the density of local rest mass in the local rest frame of the matter, and jG is the local rest- mass current density in this frame (in the case of classical matter, jG = ρGv, where v is the coordinate three-velocity of the local rest mass; in the quantum case). Here HG is the gravitomagnetic field intensity, and DG is the gravito-displacement field. Since the forms of these equations are identical tothose of Maxwell’s equations, the same boundary conditions follow from them, and therefore the same solutions for electromagnetic problems carry over formally to the gravitational ones.” (Chiao et al, 2002) where εG is the gravito-electric permittivity of free space given by Eq. (35), μG is the gravitomagnetic permeability of free space given by Eq. (32), κGE is the gravito-electric dielectric constant of a medium, κGM is its gravitomagnetic relative permeability, and σG is the gravitational analog of the electrical conductivity of the medium, whose magnitude is inversely proportional to its viscosity (Chiao, 2002) So, it is important to understand there is a gravitational correlate to EM; as shall be pointed out later these potentials exist not in classical scale but quantum scale. It is worthwhile to point out there is a high frequency gravitational wave-based equivalent to this type of remote sensing as adapted see Baker-Li HFGW Military Applications in Ch. 6 ‘Physics of Neuroweapons.’ In which -dE/dt is the generated power output of the GW source, P is in watts, c is the speed of light, G is the universal constant", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:322:7e041e71c15a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2675, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 323, "text": "gravitational correlate to EM; as shall be pointed out later these potentials exist not in classical scale but quantum scale.

The GW power is usually quite small because of the small coefficient multiplier. (Baker, 2010, 20) The GW frequency is 2ω or twice the orbital frequency ω . That is, for ever period of an electron the graviton is 2x , twice the frequency of the electron. Following for a one-meter-long rod spun so fast as to nearly break apart due to centrifugal force, the radiated GW power is only 10^( − 37) watts. One sign that there may be a Gravitational component to the A-B generators is that Kernbach (2017) noticed that energy collected near the tip of the A-B Generator cone. This axial radiation in the z-coordinate (tip point direction) could be explained in that GW radiation is concentrated in the angular portion of rotation, near the axis, which suggests the ability to emit the GW with directionality.

Just like in the purely electromagnetic AB effect, the “flux” of a certain gravito-magnetic field (i.e., the Lense-Thirring field) would be confined entirely to the interior region (indicated in yellow in Figure 1) of the “solenoid,” and would vanish at all points in its exterior (indicated in white). There results a quantum mechanical AB fringe shift due to the “flux” that is observable at point B, which cannot be explained classically.

That means one could shift the interference fringes by changing the angular velocity. Since the gravito-electric field from the mass of the shell does not depend on the angular velocity, a fringe shift will happen despite the fact that the classical force has not changed. Hence the AB fringe shift in the gravitational case could not have had a classical origin. (Chiao, 2013) In an analog to the EM Maxwell equations the A vector potential is equivalent to magnetic field B. In gravitational theory, h is the magnet-like gravitational vector potential, so you can think of h as like A. Vector Potential (h) can arise either from a Lense-Thirring field, or from rotations of a quantum system, such as from a rotating SC ring (solenoid, toroid). Experiments with rotating SC rings are easier to perform than those with Lense-Thirring fields. Phase shift occurs in this experimental setup, “The phase shift, which is nonvanishing for the “solenoid” configuration of Figure 1, is the gravitational AB phase shift. It is closely related to Berry’s phase, since both phases have a common origin in non- Euclidean geometry.” (Chiao, 2013, 6) he vacuum oscillations/fluctuations or what others refer to as the Zero Point Energy field (ZPE) (Norseen, 2002) is interfaced with the Casimir Effect. Scientists have directly related entanglement with the Dynamic Casimir effect of which accelerating modulation or ‘jerks’ are an example (Romauldo, 2019) as we shall read further. Romauldo et al found that the Casimir effect produces a high degree of entanglement, and study that process. Felicetti et al study the Dynamical Casimir Effect in its relation to creating entanglement in bipartite and multipartite entanglement among qubits. The existence of vacuum fluctuations, i.e., the presence of virtual particles in empty space, represents one of the most distinctive results of quantum mechanics. It is also known, under the name of dynamical Casimir effect, that fast-oscillating boundary conditions can generate real excitations out of the vacuum fluctuations. Long-awaited, the first experimental demonstration of this phenomenon has been realized only recently, in the framework of superconducting circuits [C. M. Wilson et al. Nature 479, 376-379 (2011)]. (Felicetti, 2013) For our purposes the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) is of interest as this is the corollary to the work involved with the A-B generators, the pulsating modulation of magnetic amplitudes, which is what a DCE is an equivalent of a generation of photons from vacuum due to the motion of uncharged boundaries. Raymond Chiao of University of California-Merced has proposed the concept of a gravitational laser based on the DCE which we can use to see how pulsations are conducted in the EM version of our toroidal coil,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:324:829ed8f2aa79", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2677, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 325, "text": "is of interest as this is the corollary to the work involved with the A-B generators, the pulsating modulation of magnetic amplitudes, which is what a DCE is an equivalent of a generation of photons from vacuum due to the motion of uncharged boundaries. Raymond Chiao of University of California-Merced has proposed the concept of a gravitational laser based on the DCE which we can use to see how pulsations are conducted in the EM version of our toroidal coil, the A-B Generators. (Chiao, 2017) Many would consider gravitational amplitudes to be so minute that it could never be possible to generate or detect based on their understandings of Einstein’s [Quadropole] equations for Gravity. However, Chiao introduces a Planck scale mechanism which argues for the ability to generate and detect gravitational effects in the laboratory. He introduces the ideal of “relative gravitational permeativity” which is analogous to EM electric permittivity and magnetic permeability, hence ‘permeativity’, as G is, stands in for E and M. Permeativity, argues Chiao, allows for a possibly large quantum mechanical enhancement of the response of a superconductor, such as the solenoid or coil, to an incident tensor gravitational wave field.” (Chiao, 2017) The group has also argued that the quantum amplification process in the DCE is equivalent to the amplification process in a parametric amplifier (paramp). Chiao et al point out that in Einstein’s quadropole equations, used for figuring Gravitation, that the Planck Constant, the quantum of electromagnetic action that relates a photon’s energy to its frequency (h = 6.62607015 × 10 − 34]⋅ s in SI units ), is absent which he modifies to include, placing the equations in a quantum level of existence rather than classical scale. Meaning that Gravitational Waves on the quantum scale (Planck Length 10 − 33 cm ) has greater force then anticipated by the Classical gravitational force. This directly addresses the issues of the assumption by many scientists that none of this is possible due to the low Lorentz forces involved in Electromagnetic force. This is addressed by Dotta when studying Long Term Potentiation in neural networks: The primary effect upon the shift of the spectra power density of the photon emissions following the modified LTP magnetic field exposure suggests that the temporal geometry of the applied field interacts with the temporal pattern of the photon emissions. Pattern is often associated with information and does not require significant addition or subtraction of energy from the system. As succinctly summarized by Cifra et al. [13], a shift in the rate of temporal patterns by which energy is emitted rather than induced by the applied magnetic fields minimizes the counterargument that their intensities are too small to overcome the kT values associated with intrinsic thermal oscillations.(Dotta et al, 2014) It is an important point to understand this when faced with criticisms regarding the lack of sufficient strength from the A Potential", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:325:c115760b9381", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2678, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 326, "text": "or subtraction of energy from the system.

This question of low amplitudes affecting biological objects was also addressed by Djumeava in her studies on using A-B effect to transmit medicines remotely: In the recent decade, low level laser (LLL) therapy has been used to treat various diseases. The question about how the energy from low level lasers works at the cellular and organism levels is still disputable. In 1977 A.C. Tam and W.Happer showed experimentally that two circularly-polarized laser beams attract or repel depending on mutual orientation of their circular polarization. If the direction of rotation of polarization of the two laser beams is similar, then these beams attract, and if the rotation of polarization is opposite, then they repel. These results collided with quantum electrodynamics and could not be explained. Study conducted by A. Bobrov demonstrated the presence of non- electromagnetic component of laser beam which doesn’t shield by electromagnetic screen and spreads in the direction of laser beam’s distribution. In 2012 M.Krinker showed a bio-physical similarity between spinning fields and information imprinted in special carriers. According to the data obtained by the authors of Russian patent, when the spiral light-guide is twisted from the right to the left, the effect of strengthening mitosis in the cells exposed to the non-electromagnetic properties of laser radiation was observed, whereas the light-guide spiral twisting from the left to the right leads to strengthening of synthesis of protein and carbohydrates. In M. Krinker’s experiments a maximal growth of cell took place in case when they were exposed to the counterclockwise field. In our case we also utilized the device with the counterclockwise light-guide. (Djumeava, 2004) The A-B Generators use what is known as a Poynting Vector in EM engineering to accomplish its transmission of potential energies to a receiver or target. Dr. Serge Kernbach has studied the A-B Effect Poynting Vector Emmitter (PVC) in terms of non-local interactions between an emitter and a receiver or target, he reconstructed the generator built by Akhimov and conducted measurements in experiments to understand the phenomenon. The Poynting Vector can be inferred to discern the direction the energy is moving within space-time. Poynting vector σ(S=ExH) represents the directional energy flux (the energy transfer per unit area per unit time) of an electromagnetic field.

The SI unit of the Poynting vector is the watt per square metre (W/m2) . It is named after its discoverer John Henry Poynting who first derived it in 1884. Oliver Heaviside also discovered it independently in the more general form that recognizes the freedom of adding the curl of an arbitrary vector field to the definition. The Poynting vector is used throughout electromagnetics in conjunction with Poynting’s theorem, the continuity equation expressing conservation of electromagnetic energy, to calculate the power flow in electric and magnetic fields. A DC circuit consisting of a battery (V) and resistor (R) , showing the direction of the Poynting vector (S, blue arrows) in the space surrounding it, along with the fields it is derived from; the electric field $\\scriptstyle \\left( { \\mathbf { E } } , \\right.$ red arrows) and the magnetic field ( H̃, , green arrows). In the region around the battery the Poynting vector is directed outward, indicating power flowing out of the battery into the fields; in the region around the resistor the vector is directed inward, indicating field power flowing into the resistor. Across any plane P between the battery and resistor, the Poynting flux is in the direction of the resistor. The magnitudes (lengths) of the vectors are not shown accurately; only the directions are significant. There are 2 types of EM oscillation: harmonic- E/H vary according to sine and cosine law. Modulated- amplitudes frequency or phase vary according to a law. In the case of the toroid coil system, we are dealing with a modulated amplitude frequency device. A-B Generators use orthogonal ExH fields to generate Poynting Vector (S) Although only static electric and magnetic fields exist, the calculation of the Poynting Vector gives a circular flow of EM energy clockwise [coil is wound cw, Persinger is ccw] The flow of circulating energy underlies the popular idea of ‘rotation’ of the S (Poynting) vector which is located in the axial plane (the circulating energy flow contains the angular momentum and creates the magnetic component of the Lorentz force arising when the capacitor is discharged.

It should be noted that Russian researchers such as Sokolova cite the gyromagnetic ‘spin-wave’, as well as the A-B effect in these generators. An gyromagnetic effect arising from the relation between the angular momentum and the magnetization of a magnetic substance. It is the effect which is exploited in the measurement of the gyromagnetic ratio of magnetic materials. The gyromagnetic effect is demonstrated by a simple experiment in which a freely suspended magnetic substance is subjected to a magnetic field. Upon a change in direction of the magnetic field, the magnetization of the substance must change. In order for this to happen, the atoms must change their angular momentum. Since there are no external torques acting on the system, the total angular momentum must remain constant. Thus, the sample must acquire a mass rotation which may be measured. In this way, the gyromagnetic ratio may be determined. Two common methods of determination are the Einstein-de Haas method and the Barnett method. (Abrahams et al, 2019) esearchers have noticed that non-local transmitters and receivers have synchrony, develop the same rhythmic Rpatterns, though driven at different times by local forces. One of the phenomena observed in use of these generators by both Kernbach and Persinger is the synchronization of the emitters, in Kernbach’s case the Akimov Generator, in Persinger’s the use of a circular solenoid and a circular toroid. Kernbach remarks, “It is assumed, as a working hypothesis, that the well-known synchronization effect of coupled oscillators with weak (nonlocal) coupling plays here a key role.” (Kernbach, 2017, 37) He further points to entanglement as the reason for the synchronization, “synchronize emitters and receivers. Here an analogy with the well-known phenomenon of quantum entanglement is assumed. The long-range spinspin interactions are [a] well established research topic.” (Kernbach, 2017) Here he directly mentions the spin theories of Akimov which we know to be the normative physics concept of angular momentum. Another issue related to synchronization was the uptick in responses in detection of AB potentials in sensors when using a desynchronized rhythm, “increasing reaction of sensors was accomplished when frequency desynchronizing between 2 generators increase sensor response.” Like Persinger, Kernbach found that there is a connection to [the] 7 to 8 minute gap between initiation of the field and onset of ‘entanglement’ like activities. Kernbach remarks “there is a 7 ⋅ 8min delay between emitter turned on and reaction through proton tunneling.” (Kernbach, 2017). Here Kernbach, like Persinger, finds a connection to proton tunneling, which in biochemical terms would be the Ca⁺ ion mentioned by Norseen for neurological reactions, membrane channels for positively charged ions.

Here Kernbach, like Persinger, finds a connection to proton tunneling, which in biochemical terms would be the Ca⁺ ion mentioned by Norseen for neurological reactions, membrane channels for positively charged ions. A further example of an Aharonov-Bohm Generator was that designed by American physicist Hal Puthoff, a former researcher at Stanford Research Institute, where also early Remote Viewing experiments were conducted, such as with Ingo Swann, who was tested by Persinger and the basis of the experiment that led to the conclusion of Persinger that remote viewing could be blocked (Persinger, 2002). This generator is different from the Akimov generator in that it uses angled shields for changing the angular components controlling frequency of the signal. Puthoff defines this invention as, “A method of transmitting information that changes as a function of time comprising transmitting a signal having scalar and vector potentials (A, phi) without including an EMF, the signal varying as a function of time in accordance with the information.” (Puthoff, 1998) As can be seen here the coil used in this system does not have a larger base and then condense as it coils in the z axis. This coil has a constant width, which is also used in another version of the generator according to Puthoff, where he uses two toroid coils (patent item ^(#85, 87) ); these coils are the equivalent of the system used by Persinger et al from 2015. Puthoff instructs on how the coils work, “A-B generator coils ^(#85, 87) are driven in parallel by current source, currents are time-derivative phased and adjusted in amplitude to provide a time varying (A, phi) signal [potentials] having no EM component in the same planes as (A, phi) signal radiates.” (Puthoff, 1998) Persinger in his work with these coils has defined based on Tu (2005) phase and group velocities that he describes as: The coils are time derivative (phase velocity) phased and adjusted in amplitude (group velocity) providing a time varying (A, phi) signal having no EM component in the same planes [horizontal, Y coordinate] as the (A, phi) signal radiates. In the countermeasure we are using just one of the coils since we have no need for entanglement with another since it encompasses one object (see Lehman, 2015). The toroid coils are able to induce changes in interference patterns as explained by Puthoff, “it is shown that in certain two-leg electron-interferometer configurations in which the potentials (A,phi) are establish in a regional space, but E and B are absent, it is still possible for the potentials to induce changes in electron quantum interference patterns.” (Puthoff, 1998) As one", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:329:36c3c28282bb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2682, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 330, "text": "of the coils since we have no need for entanglement with another since it encompasses one object (see Lehman, 2015).

The use of a helical structure is also performed in the HFGW detector/transmitter of Baker-Li (Baker, 2010).In this case he is citing the use of FBARs (which are already miniaturized in mobile phones), used to detect gravitational waves according to Baker. Persinger remarks how this relates to entanglement angular momentum “[Graviton] the involvement of a (closed) circular geometry moving in a direction (a helix) around an infinite but bounded perimeter is important single photon with helical phase structures [that] could carry a quantized amount of orbital angular momentum.” (Persinger, 2013). 3. The signal (the PPF) and the noise, or background photon flux (BPF) from the Gaussian beam have very different physical behaviors. The BPF (background noise photons) are from the synchro-resonant EM Gaussian beam and move in the z -direction, whereas the PPF (signal photons) move out in the x-direction along the x-axis. (Baker, 2010, 29) Dr. Baker and his team at GravWave LLC have also developed an interest in gravitational waves and the human brain hoping to use understanding from gravitation brain (Bar, 2007) for exobiological detection of life, as well as the direct brain-to-brain transfer capabilities as a communication device. Their work is at exobiologie.com. This work is based on the theories of Israeli physicist, Daniel Bar, of Bar Ilan University who came up with the insight of gravitational brain waves as quantum fluctuations and stochastic quantization, viewing the brain as an EM structure that is also capable of detecting and transmitting GW. That is, one may physically and logically assume that just as these ionic currents and charges in the brain give rise to electric waves so the masses related to these ions and charges should give rise, according to the Einstein’s field equations, to weak GW’s. From this we have proceeded to calculate the correlation among an n brain ensemble in the sense of finding them at some time radiating similar gravitational waves if they were found at an earlier time radiating other GW’s. We have used as a specific example of gravitational wave the cylindrical one which has been investigated in a thorough and intensive way… (Bar, 2007) n a follow-up study in 2018, Kernbach replicated the experiments of Akimov done in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:330:f050ba3cc6e2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2683, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 331, "text": "to weak GW’s.

In these experiments Kernbach looked at how to monitor a remote biological object. He points out that it is possible to use the experimental setup for monitoring the object via remote non-local technology. Kernbach remarks on this reality, “An unexpected result of this replication experiment represents the potential possibility for a remote monitoring of biological organisms (and possibly nonbiological objects). By introducing nonlocal feedback, the object on the transmitter side becomes ‘entangled’ with the receiver and can thus become non-locally monitored.” (Kernbach, 2018, 46). He was able to base his understandings with the Z-score in the spectroscopy aspect of the experiment on the documentation provided by Akimov in the original 1986 experiment. Through the Z-score monitoring is accomplished: “The statistical Z score was calculated based on the EIS [electrochemical impedance spectroscopy] dynamics of this channel. Thus, the nonlocal address mark was involved in the feedback loop [allows remote monitoring], both in terms of impact and measurement.” (Kernbach, 2018, 43). One further issue noted by Kernbach was the use of Akimov of such ideas as universal addressing of entangled objects, “Akimov vague allusion ‘special spin (torsion) address matrices” (Kernbach, 2018). Kernbach has written of mapping entangled objects so it is not out of the question that it may be possible to have a matrix of entanglement that could potentially be searched and indexed via AB Effect type technology that Kernbach has claimed the Soviet Union was interested in for use in mass control. Other efforts at using A-B Effect technology in Russia is the use of a method known as ‘torsion phase portrait’ (TPP) торсионного фазового портрета (ТФП)) for remote fine field diagnostics. Shkatov in 2009 speaks of the automation of TPP, “the TPP method and its extensions are continuously developing both in instrumental and methodological aspects. It is planned to develop an automated software hardware complex for unmanned periodic TPP, a kind of TPP object monitoring.” (Shkatov, 2009) The simulation and experimental results are in a good agreement and both demonstrate that sweat ducts in the skin could indeed behave as low Q antennas. Thus, the skin spectral response in the sub-Terahertz region is governed by the level of activity of the perspiration system and shows the minimum of reflectivity at some frequencies in the frequency band of 75-110 GHz. It is also correlated to physiological stress", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:331:24331f7318d8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2684, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 332, "text": "unmanned periodic TPP, a kind of TPP object monitoring.” (Shkatov, 2009) The simulation and experimental results are in a good agreement and both demonstrate that sweat ducts in the skin could indeed behave as low Q antennas.

It is also correlated to physiological stress as manifested by the pulse rate and the systolic blood pressure. As such, it has the potential to become the underlying principle for remote sensing of the physiological parameters and the mental state of the examined subject. (Feldman, 2009) [emphasis added] Again, this was a research area originally broached by the Soviet Union then exported to the west like UK-USA and Israel. The use of skin sensing for remote monitoring is of interest as another example of natural toroids within the human body, such as DNA, MTs, etc. Sweat ducts are helical conductive tube structure – homochirality ( 90% right-handed turning direction) which is a dipole antenna like the human eye. Skin is the largest organ of the body, designed as the primary interface, utilizing numerous interactions between us and our environment. The low Q duct antenna which is a 2D antenna array with sub-THz (e.g., 110GHz) range with electrical conductance in the Extreme High Frequency (EHF) range. There is fast proton hopping though distributed H-bond networks along the duct surface, with a time for transport of 10^( − 13) sec. Difference in pH between skin surface and dermis creates a concentration gradient which is a cause of fast current in the duct coil. There are questions that do come up with remote monitoring through the skin, as well as any light-based system of monitoring such as optogenetics, and that is the question of skin tone. AI has proven to have difficulty with darker skin colors, biology and light-based technologies as well as the sun itself affect different skin tones differently. The difference is in radiation absorption. There is a case of those with Ephelides (Freckles) like 20% of Ireland, Scotland and Wales, who have a different melanin composition from most people, where the melanin is usually eumalanin, for darker colors, those with red/brownish hair and freckles have a different form of melanin, pheomelanin, arising with the MC1R, IRF4, BNC2, OCA2 gene adaptation which gives red hair and rust colored freckles, though it offers no UV protection, it is also different in that it contains Sulfur, hence easy burning of Irish, Scots and Welsh where up to 50% of the population carry at least one of these gene markers for pheomelanin, it also allows very little absorption of UV-A, and other emissions, such as X-Rays which are used for behavioral control of neurons (Yamashita et al, 2021) .

Those with eumelanin have an increased absorption of UV and visible light spectrum; eumelanin has increased absorption due to higher molecular weight (Ou-Yang et al, 2004). Finally, the photostability of pheomelanin is different from that of eumelanin. Both absorption mechanisms tend to drop following UV-A exposure for pheomelanin. We therefore suggest that eumelanin and pheomelanin could be differentiated according to their spectral responses to UVA irradiation.” (Ou-Yang, 2004) One important note regarding the generation of melanogenesis and melanosome production from melanocortin (POOMC) then alpha MSH and ACTH, ACTH is part of the Hypothalamic pituitary- adrenal axis, produced in response to biological stress. The hypothalamus is noted as a key ingredient to Havana Syndrome-like effects as noted by researchers such as Persinger. One obscure connection was the use by Nazi Scientists of adrenalin to change the Iris color during their experiments with victims of the Holocaust. It is noted that the iris and choroid contain melanin, and also pheomelanin and eumalanin play a role in the eyes. Further research by Shan et al (2021) has shown in Low Level Light Therapy that the human skin can be affected by the LED version of the Aharonov-Bohm entanglement-based attack, they have shown that skin reception of pulsed light can affect 14Hz Brain entrainment by pulsating photons of coherent and incoherent streams, but always pulsed or phase shifted through the skin of the palms: In this experiment, the average PSD of the subjects in the parietal and temporal cortex locations during session 3 was increased and shifted toward lower frequencies in comparison with the rest stage… phenomenon was caused by LED stimulation which was operated at 10 : Hz . The normalized alpha activity rapidly increased during and after LED stimulation in the LED group… The affected regions were the occipital, parietal, and temporal regions. LED stimulation exerted a latent effect on alpha rhythm. The effect could persist for at least 15 minutes after LED ceased. Based on the experimental results, LED stimulation at the palm has an effect to induce alpha rhythm activity, and the affected regions were distributed in posterior. The influence was like AVS [audio visual stimulation], but the latent time was longer. In the control group, no significant variation in alpha rhythm was observed.

Furthermore, the therapeutic window for inducing specific brainwaves via light stimulation has been found. We believe that the results in this study have practical implications in the medical field. For instance, using a higher dose (or frequency) of light stimulation may have the potential application in enhancing the attention of students. Conversely, using a low dose of light stimulation may improve the sleep problems for people who have insomnia. (Shan, 2021) As Shan et al has noted that there is a medically beneficial application of using near-infrared or infrared pulsed light, it’s incoherent form in LEDs, it can also by extension be used for degrading the biological object. Again, it is worth noting that former Soviet researcher A.B. Babrov developed LEDs to replace the Akimov or Aharonov-Bohm generators, LEDs have their own A-B effects. In terms of results, firstly, the distant monitoring even at the ≈ 3 ?? level is useful when no other sources of information are available. The technique…allows testing several hypotheses about distant macro-objects. Taking into account probabilistic nature of information, and a need of its independent verification, the distant monitoring can be a part of more complex system for working with remote biological, geographic, physical, or symbolic objects. Secondly, when monitoring human persons, volunteers reported about different neurological manifestations – changes in perception, consciousness and sleep patterns, however due to ethical issues no systematic research in this direction has been conducted. It can be assumed that the use of this and similar techniques can raise ethical questions… (Kernbach, 2019) In Ufa State Aircraft Technical University, Ufa Medico - environmental firm “ Light 2^(𝔫) for the period 1990 - 2009 developed a number of devices for measuring ultra-weak electromagnetic fields of the natural field of the Earth and re-emitted by various objects . These devices, represent a selective receivers electromagnetic fields in the range of 5 .to 10kHz , with the calculation of the phase integral shift at the measured frequency . Sensitivity from units to hundreds of picovolts. Devices differ from standard gauges selective fields, so, that instead of resonant LC circuits, a pulse filter is used, providing a “ narrow “ bandwidth in the form of one spectral line, characterizing a specific tuning frequency, and a phase-sensitive detector instead of the amplitude one, which allows you to measure the relative phase shift of the oscillations, allocated by a pulse filter. The IGA- 1 device belongs to developments in the field of ecology, medicine and covert intelligence and can be used: Медико-экологической фирмой “Лайт- 2^(″) за период 1990…2009 г. разработаны и запущены в производство", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:334:6f74cfefe382", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2687, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 335, "text": "filter is used, providing a “ narrow “ bandwidth in the form of one spectral line, characterizing a specific tuning frequency, and a phase-sensitive detector instead of the amplitude one, which allows you to measure the relative phase shift of the oscillations, allocated by a pulse filter.

Эти приборы, представляют из себя селективные приемники электромагнитных полей в диапазоне 5…10κTI_(I) , с вычислением интеграла фазового сдвига на измеряемой частоте. Чувствительность от единиц до сотен пиковольт. Приборы отличаются от стандартных селективных измерителей полей, тем, что вместо резонансных LC контуров используются импульсный фильтр, обеспечивающий “узкую” полосу пропускания в виде одной спектральной линии, характеризующей конкретную частоту настройки, и фазочувствительный детектор вместо амплитудного, позволяющий измерять относительный сдвиг фазы колебаний, выделяемых импульсным фильтром [8…21]. The method for assessing the electromagnetic field of a biological object is based on topological analysis of the equipotential surfaces of a stationary electromagnetic field surrounding the biological object. As a parameter by which the equipotential surfaces are constructed, in contrast to all known literary sources, the value of the phase shift between the reference signal of a fixed frequency and the harmonic component of the received noise signal is used. Thus, the noise signal recorded near the biological object is useful, and the use of the ultra-long radio wave range from 1 to 10kHz as the working range makes it possible to tune out the fast rhythmic-physiological processes (such as ECG, EEG, CRG, EMG, circadian rhythm etc.) and judge the slowly changing stationary field, bearing the imprint of the general functional and morphological state of organs, tissues and systems of the body, as well as responding to drug and other types of therapeutic effects. Способ оценки электромагнитного поля биообьекта основан на топологическом анализе эквипотенциальных поверхностей стационарного электромагнитного поля, окружающего биообьект. В качестве параметра, по которому строятся эквипотенциальные поверхности используется, в отличии от всех известных литературных источников, величина фазового сдвига между опорным сигналом фиксированной частоты и гармонической составляющей принимаемого шумового сигнала. Таким образом, шумовой сигнал, фиксируемый около биообьекта, является полезным, а использование в качестве рабочего диапазона диапазона сверхдлинных радиоволн от 1Ao10 ×Γū позволяет отстроиться от быстропротекающих ритмико-физиологических процессов, ( таких, как ЭКГ, ЭЭГ, КРГ, ЭМГ, цикадная ритмика и т. д.) и судить о медленно меняющемся стационарном поле, несущем отпечаток общего функционального и морфологического состояния органов, тканей и систем организма, а также реагирующем на медикаментозные и иные виды лечебных воздействий.

The countermeasures to this monitoring are part of this project. However, as mentioned before engineers don’t just create weapons without countermeasures and as such the Soviet engineers involved in the early development of these weapons after the fall of the Soviet Union started private business ventures based on countermeasures such as A. V. Okhatrin’s ‘Gamma 7’ system which claims to counteract remote biological influencing or effects. s seen in the Puthoff A-B Generator Phase/Group Velocities are disassociated; this is a product of a photon Awith nonzero-mass. The A-B Generator is a helical toroid in a circle, thus always accelerating, according to Persinger the phase modulation has the capacity to mediate unlimited information with little energy and phase locking is the key to information copies, the patterns in the EM fields. Karbowski points to this mechanism in terms of information, “the coupling of specific temporally patterned magnetic fields with ‘quantum well’ like point durations and a ‘single’ wavelength might be employed as a carrier upon which specific information could be coded which then penetrates into cells and remains there for an hour.” (Karbowski, 2016b). In other research the Persinger Group has found such a phenomenon as ‘water memory’ of potentials. Memory in the brain, a water-based organ, is related to thixotropy and viscosity, viscosity is increased by the A-B Effect according to Sokolova (see Chapter 8: Quantum Consciousness’). One physical attribute to keep in mind is that a toroid with a gap will leak magnetic flux; like the hippocampus and toroids, gapped systems have long range entanglement, as we shall see below in the medical section in dealing with the toroidal hippocampus, which mediates information or memory. Persinger et al, studied the use of point durations in creating their phase modulated EM patterns for use in entanglement experiments. The point duration is either a 1ms or 3ms delay in the wave form at a given amplitude. It is part of the difficult process of designing a pattern that is based on a neurological functional correlate: “Accurate and precise point durations are essential for producing the sensed presence similar ‘temporal sensing’ sensitivity for cells has been shown for frequency modulated (FM) weak magnetic fields. (Rouleau, 2015)” The magnetic moment of the circulating current created by an electron moving in its closed path is 9.274·10-24 A ⋅ m2 (J·T-1 ). Hence the required magnetic field strength would be the ratio or 1.01·10-1 T.

Hence the required magnetic field strength would be the ratio or 1.01·10-1 T. If the square of that value ( 1.02 ⋅ 10 − 2 T 2 ) is inserted into equation (2), the optimalseparation between ideal parallel plates would be ∼ 24 nm . Application of the central limit theorem and assuming the typical standard deviations of ∼ 30% of the central tendency, the range for 95% of the spaces would be between 10 and 37nm . This is the range of the width of a synapse, the interface between neurons. (Persinger, 2014) • Increased free protons • pH increased acidity • proton expand one planck length • changes in pH only during increasing angular momentum in toroid, descending in solenoid array. • 3ms point durations participate in Ca Ion channels (aka CamKII in microtubule) (Persinger 2010, 821) • 3ms gives 1 − 5nT in the E-W component of the static geomagnetic field (Persinger, 2014) On the other hand if the magnetic moment of the proton (1.41·10-26 A·m2 ) is employed, the magnetic field strength required to obtain the energy associated with the hydrogen line is 6.67·101 T. If this value squared (44.5·102 T 2 ) is inserted into equation (2), the resulting width (a) is 0.93 ⋅ 10 − 9 m . This is within the median range of the width of an ion channel found in plasma cell membranes. Most “channels” within the plasma cell membrane are those that mediate the movements of protons. “ (Persinger, 2014) Movement in a circle is uniquely interesting because the process would always be accelerating (m⋅s^( − 2)) and a changing rate of this acceleration (m⋅s^( − 3)) often referenced as “jerks,” would be a second derivative containing the potential temporal non-continuities that could encourage the conditions we assume may be associated with the observed excess correlations. They could spread over the Minkowski four-dimensional field and appear to violate directional causality. In other words the “effects” of these “jerks” could occur before events and appear to violate causal principles but not necessarily the concept of entanglement. The presence of non-local and advanced correlations for geomagnetic effects had been reported by Korotaev and his colleagues (Rouleau, 2015) In this way rotation, which affects, entanglement becomes a key part of the process of the functionality of the toroid coil.

One of the interesting finding is that given the Earth rotates CCW there is more torque in E-W direc tion. Orientating to directions was also a very key part of early Nazi German remote sensing experiments before and during WW2 (see Chapter 3. ‘Neuroweapons’). Since it has definite energy, the gravitational wave is itself is the source of some additional gravitational field [static g-field]. Like the energy producing it, this field is a second-order effect in the hik. But in the case of high-frequency gravitational waves the effect is significantly strengthened: the fact that the pseudotensor tik is quadratic in the derivatives of the hik introduces the large factor λ-2. In such a case we may say that the wave itself produces the background field [static g-field] on which it propagates. This [static g-field] is conveniently treated by carrying out the averaging described above over regions of four-space with dimensions large compared to λ [wavelength]. Such an averaging smooths out the short-wave “ripple” and leaves the slowly varying background metric [static g-field]. (Brackets and underline added for clarity and emphasis.) (Baker, 2010) Returning to the issue of ‘jerks’ from above it is also used in the HFGW system of Dr. Robert Baker (2010). Baker speaks of jerks as a cascade-like effect. The jerks add force (see Chiao et al, 2017), and in a circular constant accelerating circuit the change in force (Δf) , the faster the jerks (<Δ𝔱) the higher the GW frequency, so that the larger the change in f the better. According to Baker, GW waves are too small to use to change frequency, it is better to use EM Waves, which of course could come from GW. The production of gravitons comes through change in mass, so that “each time a mass undergoes a change or build up in force over a very brief time Gravitational Waves are generated.” Baker has used laser pulse approach to generate Gravitational Waves in the laboratory @ THz frequencies 1012 HZ. Persinger’s Group first began using magnetic fields in 1990 when he designed phase-modulated magnetic fields in a circular array of solenoids; in 2013 Burke was the first to test non-local entanglement effects of the generators, then in 2015 they switched to toroids from solenoids. Some of the physical phenomenon they have observed are • appearance of longitudinal photon, the non-local effects for non-gauge fields for the Aharonov- Bohm effect and altered access to Casimir sources. One effect that is dependent on whether solenoids (superconductors) or toroids were used is that of the phase type modulation used: ascending or descending.

One effect that is dependent on whether solenoids (superconductors) or toroids were used is that of the phase type modulation used: ascending or descending. In solenoids entanglement effects are observed in descending changing rhythms, in toroids entanglement effects occur in ascending changing rhythms. The basis of consciousness according to Persinger et al is 20ms , with the base unit of the human brain at 1ms. They use 20ms as the starting point for ascending and descending rhythms in 2ms increments, in this case for a solenoid experiment: The second derivative component (assuming the circular rotation is always accelerating and is a “first derivative”) was programmed by adding + 2ms or -2 ms to the base duration of 20ms . For the accelerating angular velocity (20+2ms) this meant that the duration the field was generated changed through 20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, and 6ms before it began again at 20ms . The total circuit time was 104ms . For the decelerating angular velocity (20−2ms) the duration at each pair of solenoids was 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, and 34ms before starting again at 20ms . This duration was 216ms and was the phase in which “entanglement” effects were conspicuous. Because the circumference of the array of solenoids was 60cm and the total time before the cycle began again was the sum of the 8 durations (216ms) the averaged rotational frequency was between 4.6Hz . (Persinger, 2016). One property observed is that there can be a boost by up to 10x in entanglement when the frequencies are phase matched between two entangled coils, “when the rotational frequency of the circular magnetic fields within the 2 vols of spring water had been phase matched the frequency of the product of the magnetic field intensity and the protons’ magnetic moment, the excess correlations shift towards alkalinity increased by 10x with the non-local volume.” (Persinger, 2016). This effect of a dramatic increase is also observed by Samokhvalov in 2016. Solenoid is a different geometry from a toroid; this geometrical basis gives different rhythms for entanglement. Most of the subjects had volunteered for “relaxation” or “learning” studies so that expectation would be minimal. Approximately 80% of these subjects reported a sensed presence when a slowing frequency-modulated field was first applied continuously with a slightly right hemisphere bias for 30min[utes] followed by the equalized bilateral application of an accelerating frequency-modulated (burst-firing) field for 1 s every 3 s for 30min .

A similar temporal order (slowing frequency modulation and bilateral accelerating frequency modulation presented for 15 min each) of field presentation over the right hemisphere increased the report of sensed presences [46]. Presenting the same field patterns in reverse order was not as effective. (Saroka, 2013) The modulations of the toroid in this project are controlled through Arduino Board programmed in C + + to add or subtract appropriate intervals for entanglement or in this case creating a masking field with one toroid to interfere with non-local signal transmissions aimed at the object surrounded by the masking field. The fields in our studies are usually applied for about 20min to 30min while the subject sits blindfolded in a quiet, darkened room (acoustic chamber). To distinguish the procedure from transcranial stimulation (TMS) whose symmetrical pulsed field strengths are about a million times stronger, the term trans-cerebral stimulation (TCS) has been employed. We had reasoned that the more the complex pattern of the applied fields approached the form of intrinsic cerebral patterns, the less the intensity required to produce subjective and electroencephalographic changes. The rationale was similar to strategically developing molecular structures of pharmacological agents to be congruent with neurotransmitters for receptor subtypes. For analgesic effects in rats, for example, exposures of only 30min to appropriately patterned magnetic fields with intensities of only 1μT were equivalent to a subcutaneous injection of ∼ 5mg/kg of morphine mediated through micro-opioid receptors. (Saroka, 2013) [for more on the pharmacological aspect of this technology see “Entanglement Medicine” git repository https://github.com/autonomous019/ahronov-bohm-cybersecurity] The main difference between TMS and TCS: TMS is 10⁶ magnitudes larger then TCS; however in terms of magnetic field strength TMS is about 5μT whereas TCS is 1 − 5μT so the end product is in the same range produced by different mechanisms in terms of Tesla (magnetic standard units) generated. TMS uses heavy loads, higher voltage, compared to TCS to achieve the same effect. he idea that one can create a methodology to distinguish neurological damage from non-local signals and other brain impairments, such as mild concussions (mTBI), or epilepsy is argued in the following by examining brain waves during impact and gray matter in brain areas impacted.

The patterns of response in these individuals are markedly different than those seen in a group of individuals with usual acute mild traumatic brain injury and from controls with no injury. The results from these tests permitted an objective discrimination of the groups with > 91% accuracy and no confusion between the Havana subjects and the subjects with acute mild traumatic brain injury. This pattern difference may be a useful screen for individuals who report a similar exposure pattern. Furthermore, their distinctive presentation may help guide in treatment decisions to address the mechanisms that contribute to their unusual symptom complexes. At the current time, however, this remains an empirical observation and more work is needed to study the findings. (Balaban et al, 2020) It is interesting that an eye test which also showed disparity in the visual cortex in Verma et al, is affected and can be used as a measure of differentiation. Again, Norseen focused on the visual cortex, conceived as a photon field. Bandyapadhya’s Group in Japan has studied the antenna properties of eyes and DNA (Singh, 2018). Balaban also found that there was a differentiation in pupil size of Havana Syndrome; this was also seen in highly hypnotizable subjects, where their pupil size is also reduced (Kellio, 2011).

In other areas relating to molecular biology a former Yugoslavian scientist, U. of Belgrade, I. Cosic in 1994 proposed an alternative to the JAK-STAT pathway based on molecular resonance: Resonant Recognition Model, also derived from Frohlich, originally molecular resonance was credited to P. Jordan. Readers of Quantum Physics and Quantum Biology that have studied the originator of these ideas, Pascual Jordan, the former Nazi physicist and secret weapons developer, with molecular resonance, which was attacked by L. Pauling. It was Jordan working with Berlin-Brain Institute, the sister institute to the one in Russia that Kropotov worked at in a later era, that first proposed a molecular resonance explanation for molecules being ‘attracted’ to each other. This was rejected by the scientific consensus of western scientists, who adapted Pauling’s ideas. Jordan’s idea was correct but misapplied. At the Brain Institute he worked with the founders of modern molecular biology (Ch. 8 Quantum Consciousness) who were captured by the Soviets after the war and assigned to the Soviet Nuclear program, out of which it is claimed remote biological influence developed in labs run by Germans as Soviet prisoners. So, the Soviets had a more open response to resonance theories and the combination of Quantum Effects on Biology as a recipient of German knowledge in these areas after the war. Kravkov notes the adoption of Resonance by the Soviets, including such concepts as bio-effective frequencies, the resonance effect can be observed if the natural frequency of any structure has a natural frequency of oscillatory or rotational motion, which coincides with the frequency of the incident radiation…. [see synchronization above]. Resonance also takes place in cases when the frequency of absorption of an EM wave of any molecule coincides with the frequency of incident radiation.” (see Chapter. 8) It is also in this area of research that viscosity becomes an engineering issue for heavy water (deuterium); it is easy to forget that the founders of Quantum Physics were mostly Germans at the time, in the 1930s when their theories were first beginning to be validated as the Nazis rose to power. I have argued in earlier chapters that all western remote influencing technology originates from the Nazis.

So, the question then becomes what do such apparently unrelated topics, human brain and production of heavy water for nuclear arms, have to do with each other? Nuclear or atomic reactions are not usually thought of as occurring in our brains or body in general. The reason we think is because our brains are a very large network of electrical reactions, electricity coming from the magnetic interaction with an electrostatic field influencing how the electrons interact, quantum interference. This happens in the water-based neurons of the brain as magnetic fields influence electrical pathways, triggering molecular reactions from either electron or proton tunneling in the neurons themselves, in their neuron’s microtubules as discussed above. Persinger supplies a theory explaining how thixotropy and viscosity influences neurons, including the generation of EEG amplitudes through Casimir Effect; this is a key element as we shall see that EM influences thixotropy (liquid layer separating, phase states, boundaries) which impacts viscosity and may explain the changes in gray and white matter brain volume as seen by Persinger in his independent studies not directly related to Havana Syndrome and those of Verma et al, specifically studying Havana Syndrome. Persinger et al have argued that the process of affecting brain neurons with Aharonov-Bohm generators is one that involves not just the A-B Effect, but also the Casimir Effect and the influencing of electrons with vacuum interference patterns from the Casimir Effect at around 23nm width, also arguing that this affects the 10nm width of the neuron synapse. These vacuum fluctuations, what Norseen refers to as Zero Point Energy (ZPE) have orbits that are half-virtual (wave) and half-real particles (concretization or quantization), out of which come through the interaction of magnetic A Vector Magnetic Potential with electrostatic field (E) electron and proton pumping from the Casimir Effect induced vacuum fluctuations, there is a gravitational analog to this EM version as well. Koren explains the interaction between EM and Casimir: The spatial dimensions that define the synapse and the ion channel were evident when the energies that converged Casimir and traditional magnetic forms were equated. The specific values required the presence of a magnetic field strength that when multiplied by the magnetic moment of the proton or of the electron resulted in the energy of the neutral hydrogen line. Subtle differences in the magnetic moments for the electrons spin and orbit, the proton’s value and the slight discrepancies revealed features that could connect fundamental features of astronomical phenomena with those that contribute to quantum processes in the physical and chemical systems that define the brain.

(Koren 2016) Once measured almost exclusively in large space the ubiquitous 1.42GHz hydrogen line has been detected over terrestrial water. The potential transient emissions of this universal frequency from the human body and brain could be very significant for the interface between these functions, including the units of cognition coupled to action potentials (∼10^( − 20)) per action potential) of neurons, and transmission of information over large distances as either local or non-local processes. The detection of human enhancements of 1.42 GHz transients within a radio-quiet area requires angular velocities of about 3 to 4m per s to and from the receiver. A cell membrane is typically 10nm , which falls within the Casimir Effect scale (.1−25nm) , the relationship between the electron, magnetic A vector potential and protons, in terms of ion channels and transmembrane potentials through which protons (H+) as ions: Na+ , K+ or Cl flow into the cell body. Remembering that water interact with magnetic fields we see the impact of such proton pumping, “In fact the proton shells near surfaces that constitute Pollack’s interfacial water configurations display potential differences that are comparable to those attributed to disparities of concentration for potassium and chloride. Quantitative links between plasma membrane physics and quantum-related values have practical applications.” (Koren, 2016) We have been considering protons through proton channels as the quintessential mediator of transmembrane ion properties and that other ions, such as Na+ , K+ or Cl are epiphenomena secondary to the required water molecules associated with transport of those ions through the membrane. However, in a parity-based universe the proton should be matched with electron properties. We suggest that the states of matter allowing these transportations may be created by the space formed by the A vector potential and the electron drift. This occurrence could optimize the conditions for the type of photon-electron coupling associated with entanglement (Koren, 2016) Effectively the same function that is a source equation for quantum phenomena when applied to a larger rotating aggregate produced predictable quantities of photons as a function of specific intensity weak magnetic fields. That function was the relationship between Bohr’s orbital magnetic moment of ep· (2m)^( − 1) where e and m were the charge and mass of the electron, p was the angular momentum of an electron moving in the orbit, and the quantized relationship.

When j is assumed to be unity [1] the value solves for the Bohr magneton or the orbital magnetic moment of an electron. (Koren, 2016) The second solution involves the A vector (magnetic potential) directly. The relevant property of the magnetic vector potential is that is elicits a phase difference and, potentially, interference between partial waves. The vector potential of the earth’s magnetic field cannot be shielded. According to Bokkon and Salari “oscillations of dephasing non-conductive (fixed) electrons could influence conductive mobile electrons” and as a result coherent transport of the mobile electron spins into surrounding semiconductor protein molecules could occur. This is consistent with Cosic’s delocalized electrons that maintain the coherence of the propagating electromagnetic wave of information along the backbone amino sequences of the proteins in signaling pathways. (Koren, 2016) Koren equates the ability for such transport to that of Cosic’s alternative magnetic molecular pathway using the Resonant Recognition Model which mirrors the electrochemical pathway of JAK-STAT. This is similar to Norseen’s use of MT-10 as electrochemical bio-computation and MT-13 as magnetic bio-computation. In this regard of computation Bandyopadhyay et al have found that there are binary streams of neurons in axon core, neuron membrane. (Ch.8) According to Hameroff (2014) MT cilia are quantum optical devices, MT cilia are also in the retinal rods and cones of the Eye, detect photons quantum information. Dotta (2014) has found that for Microtubules the temporal pattern is more important than amplitude thresholds: The close correspondence between the intrinsic rotational frequency (9.6Hz) of the angular accelerating magnetic fields and the 9.4 to 9.5Hz conspicuous peaks in power density of photon emissions from the microtubules several minutes after removal from the field may suggest a transient “representation” or “memory” of this second derivative, rotational frequency within these aggregates that was later expressed within the photon emissions. The results of these experiments indicate that the strength of the applied magnetic field is not required, as also argued by Cifra et al. [13], to exceed the threshold to compensate for thermal agitation. Research done by Ye et al (2019) in the treatment of seizures studied the effect of EM on epileptic seizures. The effects of time varying (phase/frequency) magnetic field are generally believed to be caused by its induced electric field and the establishment of a transmembrane potential in Aninos 1991 magnetic field alters function of pineal gland-magnetosensitive organ that transduces environmental information of the light-dark cycle and earth’s magnetic field into an endocrine message release melatonin.

(Ye et al, 2019) With the insights of the contribution of the Casimir effect to neuronal firing at the nano-scale of the brain are now ready to see how these neuronal firings that produce EM signals are quantized. The quantization of the shallow level (scalp) of the Brain is performed using EEG, for instance Kropotov’s use of QEEG. There are other ways to study the brain, such as the topological based sLORETA as used by Persinger in some of his studies, fMRI was used in the Verma et al study of Havana Syndrome. Each provides different insights into the functioning of the brain’s various areas, typically referred to as Broadmann Areas, reflecting functional differentiation in the different parts of the brain. EEG is used to estimate the magnitude output of magnetic fields (μT) at the various locations in the brain, such that an area of interest such as EEG location F7 is mapped to the Broadmann Area 44 or Broca’s Area. The waves are categorized into different wave zones, such as theta 4 ⋅ 8Hz , Alpha 8Hz − 12Hz , Gamma ${ \\tt > } = 3 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ ; These waves have a directional flow from rostral- cuadal (front-to-back) axis 4m/s^( − 1) , which recycles every 25ms (Saroka, 2013). These are not definitive or universal measurements as placement of EEG sensors is not universal. Below is a standard mapping of EEG locations; later we shall reference different EEG locations to brain area functionality. EEG is used by Persinger et al to study the effects of non-local entanglement using A-B generators, from these quantitative studies they have formulated a possible profile for non-local transmission in the human brain, called the Harribance Configuration, named after a test subject studied by many others in non-local transmissions. We shall encounter this configuration below. This configuration also bears functional equivalence to areas affected by Havana Syndrome (see below), and in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy patients without Hippocampal Lesions (HL). So that it may be possible to have a loose profile pending further research of non-local brain activity, which could be used for detection and deployment of countermeasures if coming from a directed source. △ cold war warrior with British Secret Services whose specialty was in microwave technology as part of Elec-A tronic Warfare, Barry Trower, once pointed out that a frequency 6.6Hz signal focused on a human brain causes such symptoms", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:346:c5038f8399fd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2699, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 347, "text": "Temporal Lobe Epilepsy patients without Hippocampal Lesions (HL).

This was confirmed by Scott et al, with a frequency of 6.5Hz, , during entanglement experiments with A-B Generators between entangled pairs over long distances, non-local (Scott et al, 2015). They found that EM waves of this Extreme Low Frequency (ELF) when correlated with emotional scoring showed a correlation between anger and this frequency, “…subjective experiences, as measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS), indicated significantly increased excess correlation for scales by which increased anger and decreased vigor are inferred.” (Scott et al, 2015). In this effort to understand the effects of EM on the brain we have both historical testimony of Dr. Trower, and we have experimental confirmation of this impact on the brain from Scott et al. Meaning, EM has an effect on the brain, here delivered via sonic means. A Russian researcher found an alteration in the parietal region when studying the effects of what they termed ‘spin fields’, spin directly related to entanglement, using the same instruments as earlier Soviet scientists, found in EEG studies that there was a difference in alpha rhythm when applying a positive emotional stimulation via a generator: Encephalographic experiments to study the effect of SP modulated by a positive emotional component indicate a change in the zonal distribution of the 𝔞 -rhythm with its highest concentration in the frontal-pretemporal region (in the initial state, the localization of the 𝔞− rhythm is the occipito-parietal region). An increase in the amplitude of the 𝔞 -rhythm up to 50μV and an improvement in its modulation were noted, which indicates an increase in the ability for abstract thinking, an increase in efficiency in making decisions and actions. Based on the results of the experiments, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. Psychotronic systems based on the use of spinor fields are a real fact. Their use is not limited by distance and can cause the following consequences: making erroneous, inadequate political, economic and military decisions; aggravation of social and inter-ethnic relations, etc. 2. Psychotronic systems with modulated SP in a positive emotional component can be used to smooth out negative psychophysical factors in large areas (reduction of terrorist manifestations and crime, drug addiction).

Verma et al shows that the primary areas affected were the visual/spatial circuitry, as mentioned by Norseen BA 17 & 18, which is to say the visual perceptrons, Norseen relates, percepts and imagination are photon fields. (Norseen 1999), and typically aside from the audio cortex, another area affected in Havana Syndrome and targeted by Norseen in his studies, the main inputs to the brain, as well as the human eye serves as a magnetic antenna cavity resonator, or interferometer. Norseen mentions a third area, Broadmann 44, Broca’s area. BA 17,18 visual cortex of the brain becomes of prime interest if a sickness has its source outside the body from an EM based transmission, affecting the interface with the environment, visual/spatial and audio cortex, sometimes also referred to as temporal cortex, having connection to rhythm, people with enlarged Amygdala’s also have a better rhythmic sense (Ch. 11). Verma et al also show that the most affected side of the brain was the right side, which Persinger shows the right temporal lobes to be most affected by non-local effects, also Right Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (RTLE). In RTLE there is a difference as seen below between those with Hippocampal Lesions (HL), that do not match the Non-Local Transmission Profile (NTP) and RTLE-No without HL that does match the profile of NTP as interpreted from the combination of symptoms and effects from Verma and Persinger. Persinger has noted that the right parahippocampal is affected by EM, this may suggest that the difference between RTLE-HL and RTLE-No may have something to do with Hippocampal processing of EM. The para-hippocampal region is most affected by gravito-electromagnetism (Persinger and Saroka 2014); para-hippocampal could serve as singularity, curvature singularities form from colliding Gravitational Waves (Baker, 2010), since there is a gap that radiates magnetic flux with the para-hippocampus having a toroid geometry (Persinger 2013), Persinger speaks of retrieval in Harribance Configuration (HC) experiments from para-hippocampal structures on the right side. In Epilepsy, which has a comorbidity of obesity (also see Ch. 11 for relation of increased EM and obesity in rats as studied by Persinger), additionally death rates from Epilepsy are increasing in the United States (DeGorgio, 2020).

Changes have also been described in the para-hippocampal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, temporal pole, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and perirhinal cortex. It was reported that abnormalities of gray matter are essential to produce reductions in episodic memory recall. Most commonly seen cognitive dysfunctions due to gray matter abnormalities in children are decline in verbal intelligence quotient, freedom from distractibility, and executive function and mental slowness, memory impairment and attention deficits commonly observed among adults. (Saniya et al, 2017) These abnormalities in epileptic patients correlate with the changes observed in gray matter and white matter in Verma et al. not only that the same brain areas were affected in epileptic patients and Havana Syndrome patients, another interesting finding in relation to gray matter is that of Amygdala and the ACC in both highly- and non-highly-hypnotizable groups, with gray matter differences observed (See Ch. 10 ‘Hypnosis in Warfare’). The question of whether a profile has already been seen for non-local monitoring seems to line up between the work of Persinger’s Group and that of the results of Verma et al study of the irradiation of US Diplomats in Havana and the physical changes to their brains, and we can also see a correlation with Epilepsy. • BA 17, O1 and O2 projected to the occipital gyrus and cuneus, visual processing of information from the retina, see retina as antenna section.

There was a change in the Theta band from 5.0Hz to 5.9Hz when the EM circuit was placed around the other twin. Non-local interactions without changing angular velocity EM fields in the second twin. (Scott, 2015, 663) In a suggestion of the involvement of BA 22 another study found audio waves as generators of excess correlation rather than visual stimuli: “Burke (2013) found that when a toroid was placed over the head (level of temporal lobes) of each individual in pairs separated by about 400km .

The effect was not observed with visual stimuli.” (Scott, 2015, 667) In a pilot study regarding an Epileptic patient hearing voices, Persinger notes that the epileptic patient had a unique profile for different seizures. For instance, in one seizure her voice would become more ‘machine like’ and her pronouns shifted from ‘I’ to ‘we’ while also reporting tinnitus. There was a difference between her pronoun use of I in the beta band over T3 and T7, left temporal lobe, with 70milli vols activity. When she used ‘we’ there was a higher (fast) amplitude over T3 and T4; “she reported ‘transmissions’” which usually involved more complex information… When this occurred there was a re-normalization of the EEG. When the transmission ended, the unusual profile of T3 and T4 returned. There was additional similar activity over F7 and F8. During the experiences that would be classically labeled as ‘intrusionist’ the activation score for the low beta power within the right parahippocampal region more than doubled. This area and related hemispheric discrepancy are similar to that associated with panics that can occur suddenly in this group of patients.

Repeated stimulation of the amygdala can prompt after discharges and motor seizure. Potschka et al. found that chronic exposure of rats to a 50 − Hz , 100−μT magnetic field exerted weak inhibitory effects on some seizure parameters in amygdala kindled rats). In another study, application of rTMS during amygdala kindling prevented seizures. A cellular mechanistic study revealed that rTMS administration inhibited kindling-induced changes in the electrophysiological properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.” (Ye et al, 2019) • “Rose and his colleagues found that a temporal pattern of electric current associated with a single priming pulse followed 150ms later by four rapid pulses (equivalent to ∼ 100Hz ) resulted in significant LTP [memory consolidation] when applied to hippocampal slices. When this pattern was transformed to weak magnetic fields in the order of 1μT and applied to the entire animal before learning a spatial task, the disruption of the memory was as powerful as complete depolarization of the hippocampal region by direct current.” (Dotta, 2014) he Harribance Configuration (HC) was the configuration argued by Persinger’s Group for EEG and Brain Wave activity for non-local transmission. The human brain is considered to be a collection of microstates that last 80- 120ms, these microstates are affected by EM differently in different parts of the Brain based on functionality. Some properties of this configuration are that the main EEG sensor areas involved are on the right side of the brain F4, F8, C4, T4 (right temporal lobe where entanglement symptoms occur as well as the locations related to RTLE) according to Hunter et al 2010. Persinger has found that T4, F8, also T6 is an area of concern to entanglement experiments, F8 and T4 most important for non-local interactions between reader and target (receiver and emitter). The technical transmission of the HC uses peak-to-peak intensity 1μT 3ms point durations (protons) [shown to slow melanoma growth]. The HC was digitized into a 3d magnetic field (A Potential).

The signal was transmitted for 20s per 1 min. In power shifts the shift is 2μV shifts in EEG when applying HC, for instance the T4 location shifted up 2μV. In a pilot study they tested the psi abilities of a non-psi person and found increased psi ability, it was a pilot study of Π_(n = 1) , so more experimental research would be needed to see if there is a profile that is manifest with non-local effects such as A-B generators. In a separate experiment in 2016 the group tested entangled gamers to measure their brain waves during flow state, non-local interactions of brain citing the following areas of the brain as being involved: right para-hippocampal gyrus, right occipital, temporo-occipital junction, parietal region, orbitofrontal cortices (Lehman, 2016) Maximal flow state has decreased activation in the left interior frontal lobe (T3), and increased power in 7−8Hz, , 27 − 28Hz , 42Hz , theta and gamma waves affected. The studies have shown that in terms of brain waves, that in various studies from entangled gamers, Harribance, Epilepsy, there is a change in the Theta and Gamma bands of waves. Norseen has focused on 14Hz or 10Hz in the alpha band, this was also shown by Kernbach in his entanglement experiments. However, there is a direct convergence between Persinger’s Group findings and that of Norseen regarding Theta band, which he speaks of as a lower harmonic reflection of the Alpha band: NS Model [Norseen Semiotic] our Alpha [8-12Hz] 10Hz brain maintains a complete NS = O, , IR as a holographic… in our minds eye of Panum’s Fusion Space, accessible to us as mental imagining via signals from the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) and fusiform gyrus.

(Norseen, Laurie, 2002) Here (Rouleau, Fig 2) we can clearly see that there is a spike at 14Hz in the F8 location, the theta spike is in F4. They found that HC applied to dead brains; there is a difference in theta in gray matter, but white matter was unaffected. When applying the C4, T4 components of HC resulted in increase μ of volt power within the theta band in gray compared to white matter. When testing during a live Harribance reading of a target in 1m proximity of each other the reading pair test increased theta in right temporal and parietal regions. (Rouleau, 2015b) When the gamma power increases there is a difference in gray and white matter, citing primarily the T4 location as being involved. Significantly increased beta2 power was observed in the left caudate nucleus (T4 rhythm applied) relative to right caudate nucleus, showing like the Havana Syndrome right side bias in non-local experiments. Also, Beta2 SPD increased in left hippocampal body. When applying the F4 component exposure beta2 SPD increased right temporal stem size on dead brains. Overall, we can see that in both Havana Syndrome, Epilepsy and Non-Local Brain measurements there is a convergence in the Right Temporal Lobe, with specific EEG locations identified, and functional brain areas. In some next steps in studying the problem it is planned to do EEG Machine Learning Analysis on Epileptic patients with symptoms matching those of Havana Syndrome to see if there is any convergence on EEG locations to brain function between the two, aside from the pilot studies of Kernbach and Persinger. • Auditory cortex: Right and Left Superior Temporal Gyrus, Heschl’s Gyrus (BA 22^(*) , 48); Right Thalamus • visual-spatial subnets: R & L Frontal Gyrus, Superior Frontal Gyrus, Precentral Gyrus (BA • 6); R & L Inferior Parietal Sulcus (BA 2, 40, 7); R & L Frontal Operculum, IFG^(*) (BA 44,45, 48); R & L Tem poral Gyrus (BA 37) • Cuneus (BA 17)* • Anterior Insula (no BA, connects to amygdala) • Putamen (BA 8) • Post Central Gyrus (BA 1,2,3) • Middle Temporal Gyrus (BA 21) • Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG)Triangular Part (BA 45)* • Parietal Operculum (BA 40) • Supramarginal Gyrus (BA 40) • Temporal Pole (BA 38) • Right and Left Superior Temporal Gyrus (T3, BA22)^(*)T: 3 also near Insula • Right Thalamus • Left Temporal Lobe (T3, T7) beta band modulation depending on I, We.

In Persinger et al we have studies directly related to the Aharonov-Bohm effect generators used by the Soviets and then available to the highest bidder after the fall of the Soviets. On the other hand, we have a study on victims of a syndrome with all people affected in a Communist country, Cuba. Is it possible that Soviet technology studied by Kernbach and Persinger and the medical studies of Verma et al show a common causality in terms of Havana Syndrome, and from that cause a common list of symptoms. My argument is that this is affirmative. However, this does not necessarily mean that the Cuban government is responsible, as anyone with enough knowledge can access the Black Market, even if for the purpose of sabotaging US-Cuba relations, such as ex-Cuban extremists, or other nation states playing rivals off of each other in a classic reflexive control gambit. From the combined studies we can notice that there are areas that are held in common from epilepsy to Havana Syndrome. The areas that are involved in Norseen’s work with Thought Injection are also in Havana Syndrome, are also prevalent in studying the Epileptic pathway, and are also prevalent in Persinger’s Non-Local entanglement effects on biological objects, the brain through EEG feedback. These areas Superior Temporal Gyrus (BA 22), Visual Cortex (BA 17,18), Inferior Frontal Gyrus, Hippocampus, In general, Right Temporal Lobe is implicated in all studies. Norseen has also mentioned the involvement of Broca’s Area BA 44-5, which come up with Persinger’s study of F7 EEG location involved in non-local left temporal entanglement. This study is a starting point as an attempt to generate a profile of an attack; medical professionals rather than a computer engineer may find this information of use to their work in studying Havana Syndrome.

It’s an interesting question to consider: While we may view the process of hypnotism as a non-invasive parlor game, the reality is that in interrogation in the military intelligence world ‘pressure’ or ‘torture’ is used to induce a suggestive state in interrogates. This is partly what led to the treatment of POW’s during America’s two Gulf wars as ‘terrorists’, although these methodologies were learned by the US from the UK. Little is known in the US or UK about the original hooded men of the Irish in Northern Ireland as recounted by the US DIA in 1972: 2. (U) Recently there has appeared in the press some discussion elaborating on the techniques and procedures for detaining, treating and interrogating prisoners in Northern Ireland (2,3). According to the report, once the detainees are in prison, they come under three types of regime which create in men a state of great confusion, suggestibility, and distress. The first regime contained various methods to produce sensory isolation. The men were made to stand still against a wall with their hands in the air for four to six hours", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:360:095c2a7e0c99", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2713, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 361, "text": "the press some discussion elaborating on the techniques and procedures for detaining, treating and interrogating prisoners in Northern Ireland (2,3). According to the report, once the detainees are in prison, they come under three types of regime which create in men a state of great confusion, suggestibility, and distress. The first regime contained various methods to produce sensory isolation. The men were made to stand still against a wall with their hands in the air for four to six hours at a time. The total length was 431/2 hours. Hoods were placed over the men’s heads to further abolish visual input. Sensory input was further decreased by having loud noise generators turned on in order to mask meaningful sounds. The detainees were, therefore, isolated from their sensory world. 3. (U) The second sensory regime has the effect of increasing confusion and disorientation. Some men were rushed out, hooded and doubled up, past barking dogs, loaded into a helicopter, doors closed, engine revved up, then unloaded, then reloaded, with the procedure repeated three times. In another incident, detainees without shoes were made to move quickly over rough ground by military police. 4. (U) The third type of treatment has the effect of increasing stress and anxiety and reducing resistance to the disorienting effect on the two types described above. It appears the dietary intake was restricted to bread and water at six-hour intervals. Maximum weight loss was achieved it appears. One detainee lost eight pounds in seven days. To accompany the diet restrictions, no sleep was allowed the first two or three days. Forty-eight hours sleep deprivation, in certain individuals, has been known to precipitate psychotic-like states. 5. (U) Psychological torture and physical abuse have been used on Catholic detainees in Northern Ireland. High-frequency sound waves (range not given in report) and sensory deprivation – research methods that have been outlawed for use on humans by the American Psychological Association - were being used to undermine the dignity and destroy the effectiveness of the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland. The case of one 40-yearold released prisoner has been reported. Upon release, the man’s mental and physical condition suggested senility – a condition inconsistent with his health at the time of his internment. The man walks like he is 65, whimpers in the dark and has an attention span so short he cannot carry on a conversation. 6. (U) The Northern Ireland procedure can be expected to greatly increase the pliability of detainees under interrogation since sensory deprivation increases suggestibility and lowers intellectual competence. Stress-isolation techniques can reach the extend of eliciting false confessions where both prisoner and interrogator are convinced the statement rendered are true. It is hoped that the above examples impart to the reader a feeling for the type of mind manipulating procedures that will be discussed later in this report. 7.

(U) since it appears that the research behind sensory deprivation has been put to current use on humans, the interested reader might peruse Biderman and Zimmer’s 1961 publication entitled “The Manipulation of Human Behavior” (4). The book represents a critical examination of some of the conjectures about the application of scientific knowledge to manipulation of human behavior. The problem is explored within a particular reference: the interrogation of unwilling subject. Attention has been focused on interrogation because of the central position this topic has had in public discussions of prisoner of war (PW) behavior. (DIA, 1972, 2-3) As one can see from the report above the purpose of ‘pressure’ is to increase suggestibility. Which is to say hypnotic suggestibility, which sometimes can just lead one to free one’s conscience into a fake world where one will even confess to absolute delusions. A warfighter is going to want to understand how susceptible one is to hypnosis, not just to counteract the rare instances of being a POW but also to counter information or perception management attempts of the enemy at all times in all circumstances. In the following study I will be examining the issue of hypnosis from a physiological perspective identifying differences based in biology between biologically stratified individuals in terms of hypnosis. Again, it is important to remember experiments on remote influencing were conducted in tandem with hypnosis, such as Vasiliev’s experiments. (see Ch. 3) Hypnosis can be defined as ‘‘a procedure during which a health professional or researcher suggests that a patient or subject experience changes in sensations, perceptions, thoughts, or behavior’.’ Hypnosis is seen as a state of focused attention involving focal concentration, and inner absorption with a relative suspension of peripheral awareness and has three components: • absorption: tendency to become fully involved in a perceptual, imaginative, or ideational experience. • dissociation: mental separation of components of experience that would ordinarily be processed together. • suggestibility: responsiveness to social cues, leading to an enhanced tendency to comply with hypnotic instructions, representing a suspension of critical judgment. We have shown that subjects in a hypnotic state reported a phenomenology of an altered state of consciousness: participants reported a higher degree of absorption and dissociation as compared to normal wakefulness and control conditions [See L.L. Vasiliev Russian studies from 1930s]. Other studies have also shown that hypnosis produces alterations in aspects of consciousness and is characterized by modulation of properties of the phenomenal self-consciousness such", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:362:1ddee10be412", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2715, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 363, "text": "enhanced tendency to comply with hypnotic instructions, representing a suspension of critical judgment. We have shown that subjects in a hypnotic state reported a phenomenology of an altered state of consciousness: participants reported a higher degree of absorption and dissociation as compared to normal wakefulness and control conditions [See L.L. Vasiliev Russian studies from 1930s]. Other studies have also shown that hypnosis produces alterations in aspects of consciousness and is characterized by modulation of properties of the phenomenal self-consciousness such as mental ease (i.e., easy flow of thoughts), absorption, reduction in self-orientation and automaticity (i.e., responses are experienced as being produced without deliberation and/ or effort). (Vanhaudenhuyse et al, 2013, 344) By studying coherence of the EEG signal, Kirenskay et al. showed that baseline EEG differed in coherence between subjects with high and low hypnotizability. Indeed, highly hypnotizable subjects were characterized by higher distributed brain regions coherence within delta, theta, and alpha bands. A study conducted by Hinterberger et al. showed the different states of consciousness that can be observed during a complete hypnotic procedure (relaxation-induction-suggestion-waking up) in one highly hypnotizable subject. The dominant pattern highlighted in this study can be summarized as follows: • deep hypnotic state is characterized by distributed reinforcement of activity in all frequency bands. • the awake state showed reduced activity on all frequency bands in central, frontal and parietal areas, while gamma increased in temporal and prefrontal areas (this last pattern is attributed by the authors to a highly relaxed but mindful wake state). (Vanhaudenhuyse et al, 2013, 346) As shall be shown below, the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) plays a significant part in determining not just hypnotic susceptibility but also political ideology to a degree. The ACC is known from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) to have found ACC hemodynamic activation in a wide variety of tasks involving reading, word generation, episodic recall, working memory, emotion (Phan et al., see below), and attention. ACC activation is related to the number of possible responses in a task, suggesting that it may contribute to response choice or “selection-for-action.” This may reflect a basic contribution to motor control or a role in detecting situations that requires strategic intervention because of conflicting potential responses that may lead to errors. Brain mechanisms underlying the modulation of pain perception under hypnotic condition have been investigated by a growing number of neuro imaging studies. In PET studies, the modulatory effect of hypnosis was shown to be mediated by the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In addition, studies have demonstrated increased modulation of the ACC and a large cortical and subcortical network, encompassing prefrontal, insular, and pregenual cortices, pre-SMA, thalami, striatum and brainstem in the context of hypnosis. In a f MRI study, painful stimulation in a normal alert state resulted in brain activation within a network encompassing cortical and subcortical brain areas (i.e., ACC, premotor, dorsolateral,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:363:32c14e549109", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2716, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 364, "text": "PET studies, the modulatory effect of hypnosis was shown to be mediated by the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).

In a f MRI study, painful stimulation in a normal alert state resulted in brain activation within a network encompassing cortical and subcortical brain areas (i.e., ACC, premotor, dorsolateral, prefrontal, primary somatosensory and bilateral insular cortices, thalamus, bilateral striatum and brainstem) while the same stimuli perceived under hypnosis failed to elicit any cerebral activation. We also demonstrated a hypnosis-related increase in functional connectivity between primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and anterior insular and pre-frontal cortices. These results are not limited to healthy volunteers but are also observed in pathological states, such as patients suffering from fibromyalgia or chronic pain. In a combined EEG and fMRI study, Rainville et al. reported a reduction of the hypnosis-related increases in occipital and delta activity when subjects were painfully stimulated. According to theories of hypnosis, one characteristic of hypnotic procedures is the inhibition of afferent nociceptive [pain sensing] transmission. This inhibition can be explained by the dramatically decreased activity in the thalamus that is observed under hypnosis. The thalamus has also been shown to correlate with pain perception threshold while activation of the midline area (i.e. posterior cingulate cortex) correlates with intensity of the stimulation and ACC with unpleasantness of the stimulation. It has been proposed that the reported increased functional connectivity between mid-cingulate cortex, thalamus and brainstem might be related to pain-relevant arousal or attention mechanisms. These observations can lead to the hypothesis that hypnosis involves subcortical gating processes on cortical activation that underlies the decreased subjective pain perception reported by subjects under hypnosis. The basal ganglia are known to encode and initiate basic movement patterns expressed through premotor pathways and have also been proposed to support basic attentional mechanisms facilitating the calling up of motor programs and thoughts. In accordance with the reported decreases in premotor cortex activation in hypnosis, results of the different studies suggest that hypnosis may diminish anxiety, defensive and emotional reactions to pain by reducing activation of both cortical and subcortical areas. The increased modulation of insular activity is in line with role of this structure in pain affect and pain intensity coding. Modulation of frontal area activity may reflect disruption in cognitive attentional, appraisal and memory systems that can influence perception of environmental stimulation during hypnosis. Finally, ACC is a brain area reported in several studies on executive attention, detection of errors, monitoring of conflict between competing cognitive processes and was shown to correlate with the difficulty of the task performed as well as with relaxation state of subjects.

Rainville et al. proposed that engagement of the cognitive and neurophysiologic processes implied in each of those accounts may be accompanied by subjective experience of increased mental absorption as reported by subjects under hypnosis. In addition, ACC has also been considered to be involved in the ‘‘suffering’’ component of pain and affective reactions associated with pain unpleasantness. Its decreased activity during hypnosis reflects the decreased unpleasantness of the stimulation reported by subjects under hypnosis. Finally, the observed reduction in occipital and delta activity during painful stimulation was proposed to reflect disruption of relaxation and/or imagery processes by pain during hypnosis. (Vanhaudenhuyse et al, 2013, 347) We see in the previous, that there are differences during hypnosis in brain waves as well as some of the brain functions involved in hypnosis. There are identifiable elements based on physiological profiles or models that can explain the stratification in hypnosis which is known as ‘highly hypnotizable’ and ‘low hypnotizable’ as well as a mid-range which comprises 60% of any given population, whereas highs are 30% of any given population and lows are 10% of any given population. The Brain patterns associated with Highs primarily engage the brain patterns associated with imagery in the visual cortex, whereas lows, are cognitively engaged with associated cognitive brain activity (Baghdadi & Nasrabadi, 2010, 72). This has been explained to a certain extent according to researchers with rostrum size in the corpus collosum, which is involved in allocation of attention and transfer of information between prefrontal cortices; on the other hand low hypnotizable subjects have a normal sized rostrum. The hypnotic process is not uniform but changes over a hypnotic session through time, “as one progresses through hypnosis, the altered consciousness deepens with time. The deepest hypnotic state is at the latter parts of a hypnotic session.” (Baghdadi & Nasrabadi, 2010, 77) Other researchers have found physiological stratification in Low and High based in the construction of the ACC, specifically the dACC, key to monitoring conflict in neural nets, fMRI measured higher signals in ACC during conflict. Whereas in Highly Hypnotizables, dACC (dorsal ACC) activation is higher than Low Hypnotizables. Recently, we used hypnotic suggestion as an attentional tool to manipulate conflict. Whereas earlier case reports and at least one esoteric study reported promising preliminary findings by using hypnotic suggestions, we used an experimental design using a posthypnotic suggestion, a condition wherein a subject complies with a suggestion made during the hypnotic episode after termination of the hypnotic experience.

Whereas earlier case reports and at least one esoteric study reported promising preliminary findings by using hypnotic suggestions, we used an experimental design using a posthypnotic suggestion, a condition wherein a subject complies with a suggestion made during the hypnotic episode after termination of the hypnotic experience. Although subjects may not remember being told to adhere to a specific instruction, the posthypnotic suggestion is usually summoned on a prearranged signal and can be effective in highly hypnotizable individuals. Posthypnotic suggestions, therefore, unlike hypnotic suggestions, take effect in a conventionally behaving person during common wakefulness. Earlier, we used this system in a laboratory setting and presented behavioral findings showing elimination of Stroop interference. We then replicated our results by using appropriate control for visual accommodation as well as eye movements. Together with other findings, these data led us to conclude that a top-down neural process, rather than optical degradation of the input stimuli, is responsible for this effect. (Raz et al, 2005, 9978) Investigating the Stroop conflict by using fMRI, we compared brain activity with and without posthypnotic suggestion at the ACC both between and within groups. Fig. 1A shows significant interaction between group (highly vs. less-hypnotizable persons) and suggestion (absent vs. present) for Stroop conflict. Further comparisons revealed that whereas for the less-suggestible controls ACC activation was not reduced upon suggestion, within the highly hypnotizable group, suggestion elicited a significant reduction in ACC activation. In fact, although fMRI data from less suggestible individuals showed a significant increase in activation on incongruent trials, no difference in brain activity between congruent and incongruent trials appeared in highly hypnotizable persons given the posthypnotic suggestion. In addition to ACC activity reduction, we found fMRI signal reduction in posterior brain activity within an extrastriate visual area. (Raz et al, 2005, 9980) Positron emission tomography assays of pain show that specific modulatory hypnotic suggestions affect activation of different brain structures: whereas suggesting a drop in pain unpleasantness reduces specific activity in ACC, suggesting decreased pain intensity produces activity reduction in somatosensory cortex. A recent fMRI study extended these findings to illuminate the role of placebo in the context of pain. These collective accounts underline the influence that attention and suggestion can impart to conflict situations, top-down cognitive organization, self-regulation, and effortful control. Consonant with reports showing left and right lateralization for orthographic and non-orthographic stimuli, respectively, our ERP data show that in the absence of suggestion (at 179 msec), posterior brain activity was more left-lateralized (i.e., in line with orthography), whereas the presence of suggestion reversed this trend (at 234 msec). Furthermore, the ERP findings show that suggestion likely influences attention-sensitive electrophysiological components.

Furthermore, the ERP findings show that suggestion likely influences attention-sensitive electrophysiological components. These results seem to indicate that suggestion wields a general dampening- down effect on early visual activity as indexed by electrophysiological components (i.e., P100 and N100), showing both a shift and a reduction in amplitude. Representative snapshots, captured from a time-course video showing cortical electrophysiological activity across the entire brain (Movie 1), illustrate these effects at their respective peaks. Notably, whereas suggestion attenuated earlier components, the P300 remained unaffected. Suggestion may instigate lowered visual system activation by reducing attention either to specific visual stimuli (e.g., words) or to the actual input stream (e.g., dampening down all visual stimuli). The paucity of fMRI signal differences between incongruent and congruent trials together with the ERP data of the highly hypnotizable individuals under suggestion seem to support the latter possibility…. (e.g., overall performance of the highly suggestible participants was 100 msec faster than that of the less-suggestible persons) may be important to consider. Our results show that in highly hypnotizable persons, a specific posthypnotic suggestion to construe Stroop words a nonsense strings reduced conflict, as indicated by both behavioral data and ACC activity reduction. Evidence of reduced ERP under suggestion proposes strong modulation of early occipital cortex activity. This altered visual processing probably affected downstream cognitive activity, including ACC activation. Our results highlight the role of posthypnotic suggestions in altering cognitive processes. This knowledge may pave the road toward illuminating the neural correlates of other suggestion-based interventions. For example, a greater importance has been placed recently on trying to understand the placebo effect. It is important to compare hypnotic suggestions with other methods for modulating cognitive control, including placebo. (Raz et al, 2005, 9982) • dACC deactivation is task dependent, with decrements in activation related to decreased negative affect. dACC activation is associated with appraisal and expression of fear and pain (Etkin et al 2011), as well as a sense of personal agency or will to persevere. • increased connectivity b/w ECN and SN gives amplified task related activity reflecting increases or decreases in anxiety ( Jiang et al, 2017, 4084) [relevant to Highs, higher anxiety, higher connectivity b/w ECN and SN]. 4.

These DMN regions are involved in self-referential processing and episodic memory, while the ECN is involved in cognitive control, and the two networks become anti-correlated during working memory tasks. Dissociation between ECN and DMN in response to hypnotic induction likely reflects engagement in the hypnotic state and associated detachment from internal mental processes such as mind wandering and self-reflection [in RC image of self is hijacked]. 6. Taken together, our findings indicate that cross-network co-activation patterns are modulated by hypnosis. Decreased fALFF in the dACC may reflect reduced context comparison and decreased attention to the external environment, while at the same time connectivity between the DLFPC and the insula is up-regulated, which facilitates somatic surveillance. Further, the decoupling of the DLPFC from the DMN during hypnosis reveals another neural mechanism underlying hypnotic absorption and, potentially, hypnotic loss of self-consciousness and amnesia. (Kihlstrom 2013) Disengagement between frontal attentional regions and striatum-based procedural regions under hypnosis has been showed to improve procedural learning (Nemeth et al. 2013). Thus, effects of hypnosis may be due to separation of certain brain functions (ECN from DMN) as well as integration of others (ECN and SN). Increases in ECN–SN connectivity involving primarily DLPFC and ipsilateral insula occurred during hypnosis among highly hypnotizables, who were at lower functional connectivity levels at baseline. In sum, the naturally occurring and clinically useful hypnotic state appears to be a product of reduced contextual vigilance (dACC activity) and disconnection from default mode resting activity, as well as enhanced coordination of networks engaged in task management and somatic surveillance.

( Jiang et al, 2017) t is not well known but some suffering some forms of epilepsy report hearing voices related to their seizures. I Dr. Michael Persinger has studied this phenomenon performing metrics on the incidents of ‘hearing voices’ in epileptic patients. In his brain scans using sLORETA he has reported that the right anterior insula is associated with aural hallucinations. In our opinion, from the perspective of treatment, the most important observation was the increased power in the delta range within the medial frontal and anterior cingulate region as inferred by sLORETA when the pinwheel was moving as verified by an external observer in her vicinity. Although increased activity in the latter region, particular the right anterior insula is associated with disembodied hallucinatory voices and auditory hallucinations, which Ms. S experienced and attributed to her invisible friends, the involvement of the prefrontal region suggests organization, intent, and an awareness that some process was occurring. This was reflected in her reports that ‘something’ was about to happen in a manner similar to a preictal state [pre-seizure]. The antecedents of these experiences are likely to have occurred within the right temporal lobe for two reasons. First, there was a marked increased coherence within the 6 − 7 ⋅ Hz band between the two regions in the temporal lobes, one of which was near the source of the chronic anomaly. Secondly, she responded with intense sadness and emotion, very similar to what happens after the ‘spontaneous’ display of these experiences, when she was exposed without her knowledge to a 7 ⋅ Hz amplitude modulated experimental magnetic field with intensities similar to those associated with increased geomagnetic activity. Her profile was similar to people who are easily entrained by weak applied, physiologically patterned magnetic fields (Persinger et al., 2009). In fact, her presentation clinically was quintessentially representative of Bear’s (1979) temporal lobe syndrome of sensory-limbic hyper-connectionism that is frequently seen in subclinical and clinical complex partial epileptic patients with foci within right temporal lobe (Persinger 2013b). In our experience, many patients with closed head injuries have reported sensitivity to weak magnetic fields. We have shown this effect with single cases. Subsequent analyses of Ms. S.’s reports for weeks after she left the laboratory showed that the report of the unusual experiences occurred during the 10-minute period after increases greater than approximately 25 nT intensity in geomagnetic activity. A similar threshold has been reported of bereavement apparitions and vestibular experiences during partial sensory deprivation in the normal population.

A similar threshold has been reported of bereavement apparitions and vestibular experiences during partial sensory deprivation in the normal population. Our experiments with other forms of cerebrally applied magnetic fields may help explain why the rotation of the pinwheel diminished [also see strobe effect] when she listened through earphones to music. Many of these small solenoids (of the earphones) applied upon the ears, which are immediately adjacent to the temporal lobes, can generate magnetic field energy levels that are equivalent to the mechanical patterns that generate sound. Whether or not this strategy could be used therapeutically to control unwanted experiences remains to be established. We have counseled patients, who experience terrifying nocturnal sensed presences subsequent to closed head injuries, to quickly activate an acoustic source and to listen to music containing lyrics. This simple temporal lobe stimulation eliminates the experience of a sensed presence. (Persinger & Roll, 2012) Experiences of pain are also associated with altered activity in the anterior cingulate; the same region that is associated with emotional bonding, the feeling of well-being, and the cerebral responses to ‘‘unconscious’’ changes in the environment. (Persinger, 2013, 512) In another project where he studied the effect of sensed presence in the form of a common test for hypnotizability, the tingle test, he found brain measurements that correlate with other findings mentioned: The “chill and tingling” response by a specific and new pattern of magnetic field was observed. The analysis demonstrated that those who received the electromagnetic pattern designed to simulate “dopaminergic burst firing” reported significantly more tingles F1, 9 = 6.48 ; p b .05; eta2 = .42 ) than those exposed to the sham field. In fact, not a single participant in the sham condition reported this experience. To discern whether the field or simply sitting in the chamber influenced activation of the brain in any systematic way, source localization was completed on the data extracted from each raw record. The analysis indicated that there was a significant decrease (𝔭 b.05) in delta (1.5−4Hz) activity within the posterior cingulate and a region encompassing the medial frontal gyrus (BA 11), the dorsal and ventral regions of the anterior cingulate (BA 32 and 24), and the ventromedial prefrontal cortices (BA 25) for individuals who did not receive a magnetic field, i.e., the sham field condition.

Relative scores from baseline at 10, 20, and 30min of field exposure were computed on the sLORETA activation scores pertaining to the above-mentioned regions-of-interest. These scores were subsequently entered into separate multilevel analysis of variance with one between-subjects factor (condition) and 3 within-subject factors (time, region-of-interest, and hemisphere) for the delta (1.5−4Hz) , theta (4–7.5 Hz ), low alpha (7.5−10.5Hz) ), high alpha (10.5−13.5Hz) ), low beta (13.5−20Hz) ), high beta (20−30Hz) , and gamma (30−40Hz) bands. The analysis demonstrated a significant condition by ROI interaction (F3,27=3.10 ; p b .05; partial eta2 = 26 ). Post hoc analyses utilizing four separate one-way analyses of variance indicated that Fig. 5. (Top) There was a statistically significant increase in gamma-band (>35 Hz) bilateral coherence approximately 10–15 minutes after the initiation of the Thomas [pulsed modulation] pattern. (Bottom) The increase was accompanied by an increase in gamma power within the right prefrontal region as well as the anterior portions of the temporal lobe. Because the current experiment did not allow us to assess brain activation at the exact time that the chill sensation was experienced, the relative scores at each time period were averaged together to produce a general activation score for each region-of-interest. Spearman rank-order correlations were then completed between these activation scores as well as the report of a tingly sensation. The analysis revealed that the experience of “vibrations” and “tingling” was positively correlated with activation scores within the medial frontal gyrus (rho = .81, p = .002Ω ) as well as the ventromedial prefrontal cortices (rho=.83,p=.002) . (Persinger, 2013b, 402-3) Recent biomolecular studies have shown that the same field patterns and intensities by which the sensed presence and out-of-body experiences are generated influenced T-type calcium channels and correlative changes in molecular pathways such as slowing of proliferation of cancer cells within cultures. (Persinger, 2013b, 396) In the St-Pierre and Persinger 2006 review, some of the experiments had involved groups who had been administered a norm-referenced interactive suggestibility scale (Hypnosis Induction Profile [see Baghdadi 2010 on EEG Profile of Hypnosis Induction replacing subjective tests, would also allow for deep data-mining to identify susceptibles]) developed by Spiegel and Spiegel. Although some studies had shown that greater stimulation by these physiologically-patterned magnetic fields over the right hemisphere, but not the left, definitely increased suggestibility, this elevation was not associated with the occurrence of the sensed presence.

The point or “pixel” duration was either 1 ms or 3ms . This value is the duration of each voltage that composes the pattern…. Accurate and precise point durations are essential for producing the sensed presence. Similar “temporal sensing” [rhythmic] sensitivity for cells has been shown for frequency-modulated weak magnetic fields. (Persinger, 2013b, 397) [Amygdala in conservatives are more sensitive to rhythms, perhaps more efficiently hypnotizable.] For those patients who are actively experiencing, according to their verbal reports, inner voices application of these physiologically patterned fields with equal intensities across both temporal lobes markedly attenuates the numbers of “different voices” or eliminates their occurrence. Asymmetrical application with greater intensity over the right hemisphere enhances or initiates the experiences. (Persinger, 2013b, 2) The patient had some control over the occurrence of the intrusive voices, although at times they could occur spontaneously. When she “heard” these voices her verbal behavior would become more monotonic (“machine-like”) and her pronoun usage shifted from “I” to “we.” QEEG indicated a persistent (measured on different days) 21 − 23Hz higher amplitude ( ∼ 70μV) activity over T3 and T7 when she referred to “I” at which times she exhibited normal prosody. (Persinger, 2013b, 5) When the “we state” [extrinsic influence] was reported there was marked fast, high amplitude 17 − 23Hz activity from both T3 and T4 as shown in Figure 1. In addition, she reported “transmissions” which usually involved more complex information from these voices as well as series of numbers. When this occurred, there was a “normalization” of the EEG (Figure 2). When the “transmissions ended,” the unusual profile of T3 and T4 enhancements returned. There was additional similar activity over F7 and F8 which was transient. She was not talking during this period. (Persinger, 2013b, 5) During the experiences that would be classically labeled as “intrusions” the activation score for the low beta power within the right para-hippocampal region more than doubled. This area and related hemispheric discrepancy are similar to that associated with “panics” that can occur suddenly in this group of patients.

Anomalous organizations within the right prefrontal could increase the probability that the reconstruction of experiences would be attributed to non-self sources.

Though it seems a binary choice cliché, which seems to be a recurring pattern in cybersecurity, the choice you make actually may reflect your brain physiology more than anything else. In the following section we look into the role of brain physiology in political values, and its correlation to hypnosis.

In a sample of more than 12,000 twin pairs, the development of political attitude was about 40% dependent on genes,47 and, in another large twin study, the heritability of political conservatism was 64.5% for men and 44.7% for women. A few studies have reported an association between specific genes and conservative-liberal behavior or with political attitudes. Genes encoding certain receptors to dopamine, specifically the DRD4 gene on chromosome 11, were associated with variations in conservative/liberal personality traits. Two large studies have linked variations in the DRD4 exon III tandem repeats to political ideology putatively based on the sensitivity to dopamine uptake and the need for higher dopamine.

Among 1,771 students in Singapore, those with two copies of the 4-repeat allele on the DRD4 gene were more politically conservative, and among another group of 1,941 individuals, those with 7R+ tandem repeats, in the context of having more friends, were more politically liberal. These two theories from evolutionary psychology, the parasite-stress theory and the moral foundation theory, plus the limited genetic studies, converge in their deductions. The parasite-stress theory concludes that there are relationships between increased conservative social and sexual attitudes, reminders of cleanliness, and increased physiological responses to disgusting images. The moral foundation theory concludes that people with strong conservative views are most sensitive to violation of sexual and body purity, and those with more liberal views are sensitive to violation of harm or fairness. Together with the genetic evidence, these findings support an underlying neurobiological basis for conservative-liberalism effects on political ideology. (Mendez, 2017, 88) Neuroscientists have studied the difference between the two polarities of ‘liberal’ and ‘conservative’ which we will study later under Reflexive Control in Lefebvre’s two poles of morality. In a study from 2011 Kanai et al studied the physiological measurements between ‘conservatives’ and ‘liberals.’ In these findings they present results that pinpoint specific brain physiological differences between the two. neural activity associated with conflict monitoring in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is greater for liberals compared to conservatives. Thus, stronger liberalism is associated with increased sensitivity to cues for altering a habitual response pattern [the opposite of effective RC] and with brain activity in anterior cingulate cortex. Here we explored this relationship further by examining whether political attitudes correlated not just with function but also with anatomical structure of these regions. To test the hypothesis that political liberalism (versus conservatism) is associated with differences in gray matter volume in anterior cingulate cortex, we recorded structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 90 healthy young adults 61% female) who self-reported their political attitudes confidentially on a five-point scale from ‘‘very liberal’’ to ‘‘very conservative’.’ We then used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses to investigate the relationship between these attitudes, expressed as a numeric score between one and five, and gray matter volume. We found that increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex was signifi- [] FIGURE1.

We regressed out potential confounding variables of age and gender in our analysis (see Experimental Procedures). Therefore, our findings are not attributable to these factors. (Kanai, 2011) Menendez (2017) has found a similar correlation to liberal brain physiology: Neuroimaging studies suggest that political ideology involves conservative-liberal differences in the amygdala, insula, and ACC. Just being interested in politics has increased activity in the amygdala and the ventral striatum, and encoding party preference activates bilateral insula and the ACC. An MRI study of 90 young adults shows that political conservatives, compared with political liberals, have greater gray matter in the right amygdala, and an f MRI study involving a risk-taking task shows that political conservatives have greater activity in the right amygdala. The association of political conservatism with the right amygdala a structure that is bilaterally sensitive to emotional saliency, especially fear, suggests an increased processing of potential signals for threat. Although the anterior insula has a prominent role in the experience of disgust, brain responses to disgusting stimuli may show a more distributed pattern of differences between political conservatism and liberalism, consistent with a differential sensitivity for disgust among political conservatives. The unexpected association of political liberalism with activity in the left posterior insula in one study may reflect an additional role of the insula in the expression of interpersonal trust. Finally, political liberals have greater gray matter and increased ERP activity in the ACC, consistent with a sensitivity for processing signals for potential change. (Mendez, 2017, 88-9) Remembering earlier that ACC in Hypnosis has the following correlations, in Highs the ACC decreases it’s low frequency amplitude in the dorsal area, critical judgement, task management, awareness of the environment is reduced. ACC reduction reduces will to persevere and heightened suggestibility. A difference in the ACC that has a correlation to liberalism or ‘openness’ are open to explore pathways whereas in a diminished ACC one’s exploration or learning is minimized. We shall read about the impact of the Amygdala on learning later below. Correlating this connection in the ACC in Hypnosis with the political profiles of the ACC we see the similarity between Highly Hypnotizables and Conservative differences in the ACC which has lower amplitude in activation. “Moreover, the amplitude of event-related potentials", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:375:81ffae42fea5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2728, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 376, "text": "in the ACC that has a correlation to liberalism or ‘openness’ are open to explore pathways whereas in a diminished ACC one’s exploration or learning is minimized.

(Kanai, 2011)” Conservatives respond to threatening situations with more aggression than do liberals and are more sensitive to threatening facial expressions [also see Norseen 1996 discussion of recognition of ‘authoritarian’ faces by infants, relating it to the amygdala]. This heightened sensitivity to emotional faces suggests that individuals with conservative orientation might exhibit differences in brain structures associated with emotional processing such as the amygdala. Indeed, voting behavior is reflected in amygdala responses across cultures. We therefore further investigated our structural MRI data to evaluate whether there was any relationship between gray matter volume of the amygdala and political attitudes. We found that increased gray matter volume in the right amygdala was significantly associated with conservatism. (Kanai, 2011) Although not consistent, the right DLPFC may have a greater role in resolving good versus bad biases, partisan differences, or conflicts between fairness and self-interest, and, in one f MRI study, there was a clear association of right DLPFC activation with political conservatism. Another fMRI study of depressed patients showed left rather than right DLPFC activation with heightened preferential processing of negative information, and a positron emission tomography study showed left middle frontal gyrus (DLPFC) activation during a negativity bias condition. Finally, noninvasive stimulation of bilateral DLPFC during the incorporation of political campaign information has resulted in a significant increase in politically conservative values, and transcranial magnetic stimulation of the right, but not left, DLPFC has reduced the rejection of unfair offers when they are in conflict with self-interest. Ultimately, the right DLPFC may have a greater role in mediating emotion-based conflicts and may interact with the right VLPFC, amygdala, and anterior insula in forming the neuroanatomical substrates of a conservative complex. (Menendez, 2017, 90) As we shall read later regarding Reflexive Control and other forms of biological influencing, in these findings Liberal structure is designed to break RC Control, whereas Conservative structure is designed to be controlled, as Fast Reflexion in RC Theory is facilitated by the Amygdala, it is a system based on manipulating the Fear responses of controlled subjects. The amygdala is a collection of nuclear groups and is located deep in the temporal lobe. The amygdaloid complex in rat consists of thirteen regions.

The amygdala is a collection of nuclear groups and is located deep in the temporal lobe. The amygdaloid complex in rat consists of thirteen regions. As per ‘Price’s’ nomenclature, amygdala nuclei are categorized into three major groups, such as the basolateral group, the cortical group and the centro-medial group. The different nuclei can be very well distinguished on the basis of cytoarchitecture and are referred as amygdaloid complex. This complex regulates memory, attention, emotions etc. However, the most studied and the best understood function of amygdala is its contribution to the detection of emotional events and the production of appropriate responses (emotional processing). (Narayanan et al, 2017, 2) Additionally, it is important to note how fear/anger is used in systems designed for military simulations such as Lockheed-Martin’s SCREAM platform, see Chapter 4, ‘Lessons from an American Weapons Designer.’ Hypnosis is involved in manipulating the ACC, but in the opposite manner from what is natural to Liberals, whereas liberalism would create more resistance to Hypnosis and Hypnotic suggestion, the altering of the ACC by Hypnotism of Highly Hypnotizables would be in line with conservative physiology. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies relying on the measurement of cortical thickness and/or voxel-based morphometry (VBM). have only focused on frontotemporal circuits as neuroanatomical correlates of music processing. While the role of the amygdala in music processing is largely ignored in structural MRI studies, there is abundant evidence showing that the anatomical structure of the amygdala is correlated with emotional processing. For example, amygdala gray matter volume (GMV) or density is correlated with magnitude of stress and anxiety in the normal population, and the change of amygdala volume is a neural signature of a variety of emotion-related disorders, such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and autism. Finally, lesions of the amygdala severely impair emotional processing, such as emotion recognition, emotion arousal, and emotion judgment.

Together, these results suggested that the right amygdala was most responsive to the Burst X (3000, 3) electromagnetic field pattern relative to its contralateral paired structure in a fixed, unsectioned human brain. (Persinger & Rouleau, 2017) ….our data demonstrate a significant and selective impact of THC on amygdala reactivity to social signals of threat in humans. The findings extend the accumulating evidence on cannabinoid modulation of anxiety in humans and non-humans; and provide evidence for a neuroanatomical site of action for the anxiolytic effects of THC. The current data could prompt the development of new therapies that act on cannabinoid systems to modulate fear behaviors in neuropsychiatric disorders such as social phobia, autism, and schizophrenia, in which social fear or withdrawal, and aberrant reactivity to threat are cardinal features (Phan et al, 2008, 2317) [] Figure2.THCefects onamygdalaactivation.A B_(′) Statisticaltmaps overlaid onacanonical brainrenderingMNlcoronal y-plane = 0 showingrightlateralamygdalaactivationtothreat > nonthreatfacesispresentduringthePBOsessionbutabsent duringtheTHCsesson.C,StatisticaltmapoverlaidonacanonicalbrainrenderingMNlcoronaly-plane = 0) showing greater threat-relatedamygdalareactivityinthePBOrelativetotheTHCsesion [PBO> THC.Foradditionalinformation,seeResults.

Neuropeptide Y within the amygdala, which has been associated with decreasing anxiety, has also been associated with suppression of neurotransmission in single hippocampal cells as well as with electrical seizures.

Autopsy results for temporal lobe epileptic patients indicated that the numbers of neurons expressing this peptide within very specific nuclei of the amygdala was about one standard deviation lower in the patients compared to the reference group. (Persinger, 2010) In Pavlovian fear conditioning, an emotionally neutral conditioned stimulus (CS), usually a tone, is presented in conjunction with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), often foot-shock. After one or several pairings, the CS acquires the capacity to elicit responses that typically occur in the presence of danger, such as defensive behavior (freezing or escape responses), autonomic nervous system responses (changes in blood pressure and heart rate), neuroendocrine responses (release of hormones from the pituitary and adrenal glands), etc. The responses are not learned and are not voluntary. They are innate, species-typical responses to threats and are expressed automatically in the presence of appropriate stimuli. Fear conditioning thus allows new or learned threats to automatically activate evolutionarily tuned ways of responding to danger. The ease of establishment, rapidity of learning, long duration of the memory, and stereotyped nature of the responses all speak to the value of the Pavlovian learning as an approach to the study of fear mechanisms and account for the success achieved with this procedure. Studies from many labs have led to the conclusion that damage to the amygdala interferes with the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear (LeDoux,2003). Contextual fear conditioning involves the Amygdala (LeDoux, 2003). LeDoux explains the role of the Amygdala in the dual conditioning of an audio signal along with a physical conditioning, where the generation of just the signal gives also chemical reactions in the absence of a physical threat, the audio signal triggers the contextual fear condition. LeDoux explains the systems involved in this effect: Areas of the ventral hippocampus (CA1 and subiculum) project to the basal (B) and accessory basal (AB) nuclei of the amygdala, which are also known as the basolateral and basomedial nuclei. Damage to these areas interferes with contextual conditioning. Hippocampal projections to B and AB thus seem to be involved in contextual conditioning. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CE) is the interface with motor systems. Damage to CE interferes with the expression of conditioned fear responses, while damage to areas that CE projects to selectively interrupts the expression of individual responses. For example, damage to the lateral hypothalamus affects blood pressure but not freezing responses, and damage to the peraqueductal gray interferes with freezing but not blood pressure responses. Similarly, damage to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis has no effect on either blood pressure or freezing", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:379:58c3147280e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2732, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 380, "text": "(CE) is the interface with motor systems. Damage to CE interferes with the expression of conditioned fear responses, while damage to areas that CE projects to selectively interrupts the expression of individual responses. For example, damage to the lateral hypothalamus affects blood pressure but not freezing responses, and damage to the peraqueductal gray interferes with freezing but not blood pressure responses. Similarly, damage to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis has no effect on either blood pressure or freezing responses but disrupts the conditioned release of pituitary-adrenal stress hormones. Because CE receives inputs from LA, B, and AB, it is in a position to mediate the expression of conditioned fear responses elicited by both acoustic and contextual CSs. The direct projection from LA to CE seems to be sufficient for conditioning to an auditory CS, since lesions of B and AB have no effect on fear conditioning to a tone. The exact manner in which LA and CE communicate is not clear, but the intercalated cell mass located between LA and CE may be involved. (LeDoux, 2003) Another relationship from LeDoux’s research between the Amygdala in both Hypnosis and in Politics is the question of learning, whereas hypnosis interferes with finding novel pathways and problem solving, we see the role of the amygdala in its relation to learning, finding novel pathways not previously experienced or stored in muscle memory: That the amygdala is indeed important for learning is suggested by studies showing that inactivation of the amygdala during learning prevents learning from taking place. Further, if the inactivation occurs immediately after training, then there is no effect on subsequent memory, showing that the effects of pretraining treatment is on learning and not on processes that occur after learning. The amygdala thus seems to be essential for fear learning and does not modulate its own learning. nother interesting note is that of the obesity epidemic that is affecting England and the United States (UK/ USA) which roughly correlated to a problem with the Amygdala being hammered by constant EM fields in the last 4 decades or so, which is also when the obesity epidemic in these societies began, one could argue that with scientific experimental findings of Loscher et al (2003) and Persinger (2014) that there is a direct connection to obesity and the amygdala receiving excess EM waves and energy. Previous lesion studies have indicated a role of the amygdala in the central regulation of food intake. In the present experiments, twice-daily electrical stimulation of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala in female Wistar rats was found to be associated with a significant body weight gain compared to unstimulated controls. On average, significant increases in body weight were observed after 25 amygdala stimulations, using a kindling paradigm for stimulation.

On average, significant increases in body weight were observed after 25 amygdala stimulations, using a kindling paradigm for stimulation. Compared to kindled rats, in which amygdala stimulations were terminated after about 20 stimulations, extended kindling of the amygdala with up to 280 stimulations led to progressive weight increases and compulsive hyperphagia [over eating even when not hungry]…. The extensive weight gain over extended amygdala kindling provides an interesting new model for experimentally induced obesity. (Loscher et al, 2003) Weekly (1.5hr) exposures to physiologically patterned magnetic fields over 36 weeks had no effect on weight gain while continuous periseizure exposure to 50Hz fields above about 1μT facilitated mild weight gains and protracted aggression. Perinatal exposure to a very weak 7Hz magnetic field or a nitric oxide inhibitor retarded the weight gain induced by the obesity procedure. These results indicate that synergisms during a single episode between neuronal electrical lability and pharmacological states can initiate a process of weight gain that progresses to extreme obesity. We suggest that at least a component of the global “epidemic of obesity” could be related to a synergism between the insidious emergence of amplitude modulations within biologically compatible electromagnetic frequencies from the proliferation of communication systems and the pervasive utilization of pharmacology to treat transient disorders of ontogeny within the human population. (Persinger, 2014) Persinger notes that the most effect is in the basolateral amygdala which mediate specific Pavlovian-instrumental transfer, a phenomenon in which a classically conditioned stimulus modifies operant behavior.The primary function of the basolateral complex is stimulating fear response. The fear system is intended to avoid pain or injury. For this reason the responses must be quick, and reflex-like. To achieve this, the “low-road” or a bottom-up process is used to generate a response to stimuli that are potentially hazardous. The stimulus reaches the thalamus, and information is passed to the lateral nucleus, then the basolateral system, and immediately to the central nucleus where a response is then formed. There is no conscious cognition involved in these responses. Other non-threatening stimuli are processed via the “high road” or a top-down form of processing.

This is the same quantity of energy associated with local (intracellular) glucose utilization. Whether or not such juxtaposition of electromagnetic sources and metabolic derivations of quantum energies would generate an emergent condition that would constitute the “limbic” sensitivity of the type required to produce the insidious obesity measured reliably in our experiments requires further study. However we suggest that the escalation of electromagnetic densities from Western civilization that are now transglobal in nature is conspicuously coincident with the “epidemic” of obesity and the remarkably increased dependence upon pharmacological consumptions for a wide variety of normal challenges associated with ontogeny. Although we do not have direct measurements for the entire population, our clinical experience with a local sample indicates that the proportion of pre- and early post-adolescent females who have been prescribed psychotropic medications at least once exceeds at least about 25% . This value approaches the shift in the distributional curve towards larger body masses. (Persinger, 2014, 279-80) It is obvious that there is a broad and general correlation between conservative voting states and states with higher obesity, as well as diabetes, and from the above we can even see a similar trend in opioid sales, remembering that Nazi scientists created meth-amphetamines. Germans during the Nazi regime were addicts to a commercial version of meth. Of course I could even go into the Boston Brahmin and English sale of opioids to the Chinese as Opium. However, each state should be viewed on its own and analyzed at a much more granular level then these broad correlations; for instance Navajo areas have high obesity and diabetes due to non-Native diet, though largely liberal in political viewpoint. Each area has unique characteristics to be investigated further and no single factor ever seems to convey anything too meaningful. As has been seen from above, political physiology is a reality. What are the implications of liberal and conserva-tive diversities to security protocols? Since each has its own attributes, we may ask: Can a liberal be expected to follow orders or go off to seek another solution? Can a conservative who is susceptible to hypnotic manipulation be trusted with covert missions, high command or situation management with rapidly changing variables? The answer of course is that being conservative or liberal has little to do with the complex that is trust in military organizations. Trust being a complex concept within human consciousness, again when we try to over atomize any particular attribute, we will always be making statistical dead ends, as most of natural existence, including who to trust in the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634244916_cleaned.txt:382:3e5737c16c67", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2735, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634244916_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634244916", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634244916_cleaned", "chunk_index": 383, "text": "who is susceptible to hypnotic manipulation be trusted with covert missions, high command or situation management with rapidly changing variables?

Though, of course, it is good to weigh the obvious physiological differences between the two binary simplifications which again are merely a toy model of the divergent topology of any domain in nature. With knowledge of physiological differences between the binary poles we can anticipate what challenges staff may encounter if they identify as conservative or liberal. The answer is to find people that the community can trust to be professional and to do their jobs with the highest moral and technical acuity, possessing self-awareness not just of their limitations but also their unique gifts, with an imagination that is eager to learn. Kindling: The word kindling is a metaphor: the increase in response to small stimuli is similar to the way small burning twigs can produce a large fire. It is used by scientists to study the effects of repeated seizures on the brain. A seizure may increase the likelihood that more seizures will occur; an old saying in epilepsy research is “seizures beget seizures.” Repeated stimulation “lowers the threshold” for more seizures to occur.

Clarke, Mila Jansen and others regarding an ice water hashmaking method, which had been developed and then later officially patented in December of 2000, by Reinhard C. Delp. He had filed for his patent in February of My interest in a new way of hash making had its first inklings when I was at the 2002 Toker’s Bowl in Vancouver and shared a booth him sell bubblebags, and I tasted many of the samples. The first thing I noticed was the lack of flavor, aroma, and high associated with fine hashish. Also the hashish was often green, which meant it had been contaminated with plant matter. The buds the hash was made from were stronger than the final product. This seemed improbable because after you separate the resin glands, the resultant hashish should be at least ten times stronger than the bud it came from. If you used thirty grams of bud to make hashish, you should end up with three grams of resin concentrate, and twenty-seven grams of plant matter left over. In Nepal it took ten kilos of cannabis to make a kilo of hashish. The bubble bags were being made in Nepal, an original source country famed for its hand-pressed hashish. The technique made me curious, and I started studying the information on making hashish then being taught in grow books. One that I picked up was Robert Clarke’s 1998 book, Hashish! On page 334 he wrote about water extraction: “In the early 1980s, Sadu Sam, a committed California Cannabis enthusiast, developed a water extraction technique.” Clarke also promoted “Holland’s High-Tech Hashish,” featuring a new Dutch product, the Pollinator, “an automated resin-collector.” The book was put out by Red Eye Press, which, since the late 1970s, had published a well-known grow book, Marijuana Grower’s Guide by Mel Frank. I also noticed in Clarke’s book references to smugglers I had known in the 1970s, and felt that the book was basically a lot of second- and third-hand information. I dismissed the book. Then at Christmas 2004, I was given copies of Jason King’s The Cannabible 1&2 (Clarke wrote the Foreword to The Cannabible 1), and though the pictures were wonderful, I took exception to what I read in the Cannabible 2’s chapter on “Water Hash.” Again, the story of Sadu Sam was told, but added was: “In his [Sadu Sam] literature he thanks Nevil [Schoenmakers] the King of Cannabis Castle for discovering this technique. Legend has it that an unnamed American gave the idea to Nevil.” I wondered who that unnamed American was, probably some old smuggler like me who had seen this technique used in Pakistan or Afghanistan.

I had first seen a water separation method used in Peshawar, Pakistan around 1973. They were Danish smugglers, who no doubt learned it from a local hash maker. Basically the plant material floats and the resins sink. This is a method/process of resin separation, and shouldn’t be confused with water-pressed hashish which uses water, instead of oils or other substances, as a binder with dry sifted plant material and resin. I had smoked water-pressed hash in 1968 and 1969 in New York City, and enjoyed it immensely. I did have definite ideas on the subject. I contacted King through email and told him what I thought and that he’d obviously hadn’t spoken to any old-time smugglers. He didn’t reply, but I soon received an email from someone called, “Sam Skunkman.” I told him my story of seeing a water method in Asia in the ’70s. His comment to me, I’ll always remember: “Are those guys still alive?” I then came across an advertisement for the XTR 1000 (which I first thought was another rip-off), and found a site on the Internet, icecold.org, which in 1997 revealed a device, the XTR 420, which used a patented “Ice Water Method, [to] automate the plant resin extraction process.” I called the 800 number and talked directly with the machine’s inventor Reinhard Delp. He said his method was completely different from the traditional hash-making methods. He didn’t grind the material, he used fresh buds or plant matter, and he used ice water. I made arrangements to visit Delp in northern California, and watched him whip up a batch. In just a little time I was smoking the finest hashish I had ever seen in over forty years of being in the business, and soon found myself on a very interesting path – trying to fathom the truth of the matter, and most difficult, speaking up, trying to discuss the subject. Cannabis, after all, was still illegal, and there were many different tales being told. During the Cup, Delp had offers from “an English Pharmaceutical outfit” that promised him the world for an exclusive license of his patent-pending method. He also performed a comparison test with a local hash-making machine, Mila Jansen’s Pollinator. (A machine I have owned and used.) Delp’s process won hands down for quantity and quality. But he refused the “exclusive” and insisted on immediate use for everybody.

But he refused the “exclusive” and insisted on immediate use for everybody. At the end of the Cup, HortaPharm, a Dutch cannabis company founded by David Watson and Robert Clarke set up a meeting with Delp where Clarke said, “We can’t publish that.” And when asked why, responded, “The people can’t handle it, it is too strong.” Reinhard told Clarke that he was full of it, and they fell out. Delp didn’t want to play monopoly games; he had been a political radical in the sixties and felt that his invention was for everyone, not for just a few. The meeting happened at Bill Barth’s place, a much liked, very outspoken fellow, who was unimpressed by Clarke at the meeting. In a High Times May 1998 article (the magazine regularly comes out four months ahead, so this would be around February ’98) the cannabis world was introduced to Delp’s new machine and his revolutionary new process, but Delp wasn’t mentioned at all. His patented ice water method was “watered” down to a “cold-water bath,” and customers are told that they could get a machine from Jansen’s “Pollinator company” in Amsterdam. The Pollinator company out of Amsterdam is now marketing the newest improvement inresin-collecting devices,called the X-TRACTOR. Traditionally.THC resin was collected by drying high-quality cannabis and then sifting it through progressively finer screens until only a powdery residue of resin glands was left.lt was then heated and compressed into blocks of hashish. This work was done by hand for generations.In recent years.however. machines have been developed to do a more efficient job in less time Resembling common laundry dryers. these machines tumble the dried cannabis.shaking loose the resin glands.as wellas smallbits of plant mater.whichare thenfiltered through fine screens and collected for processing into hash The system is more efficient and less time-consuming and labor-intensive than the old method. The X-TRACTOR utitizes the same basic principles,but instead of tumbling cannabis through air to dislodge the resin glands from the plant matter.it agitates it ina cold-water bath to achieve the same results THC resin is insolublein water and is also heavier than water.

Using cold water hardensthe glands and softens the plant matter.making their separation easier.This means more resin can be collected from the same amount of fresh or dried cannabis than if done the old way The X-TRACTOR can also be used to extract essential oilsand fragrant resins from other plant species for use inaromatherapy. medicine cosmetics and foodstuffs.The device comes in several sizes.for the personal connoisseur or the high-volume commercial producer.and can be purchased by writing.calling or visiting the company’s Web site. Then Clarke’s book, Hashish!, was printed in May 1998, where he lays the whole water-extraction method as being “developed” by Sadu Sam. At the end of the section, Clarke denigrates the method: “the wet resin paste must be heated and pressed to remove the water. If all water is not removed, the piece must be consumed immediately, or it will spoil. Also some of the varietal aromas and flavors wash away.” Clarke then talks about a “tool for wet-sieving Cannabis resins”: the Baba Bob’s Aqua-X-Tractor, which was never commercially available, and appears to be Clarke’s invention. Both Sadu Sam and Baba Bob use ground-up dried material, which is fundamentally different from Delp’s X-Tractor. Matter of fact, Clarke didn’t mention Delp’s machine at all in the text, even though he had seen the machine and its method six months earlier. But he may have mentioned Delp’s machine in the captions for Water Extraction: “With the X-Tractor or with Sadu Sam’s, all that is needed are jars, plates, and coffee filters.” Delp’s X-Tractor does use coffee filters, and according to Clarke the Baba Bob’s Aqua-X-Tractor used nylon or polyethylene sieve cloth. According to an email from Clarke’s publisher, James Goodwin, it would have been absolutely impossible for Clarke to mention Delp’s product and/or method. In a 1999 letter to Delp, Goodwin stated: “The editor, Mel Frank, began editing Rob’s manuscript in November of 1994. Sadu Sam’s Secret and Baba Bob’s Aqua-X-Tractor were in the original manuscript as was the accompanying artwork – this is two to three years before your introduction of Xtractor [sic] in November, 1997,” and “As publisher, and for the editor Mel Frank, I can assure you that Rob Clarke added nothing new to the text after 1995.” Does that mean that Clarke", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt:3:d9a2040f18fb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2742, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584146", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "1999 letter to Delp, Goodwin stated: “The editor, Mel Frank, began editing Rob’s manuscript in November of 1994.

I also find it interesting that there are books in the Hashish! bibliography dated 1996 and 1998. Plus the fact that Mr. Goodwin speaks of Mel Frank in the third person, since Goodwin and Frank are the same person. But then there seems to be several folks that are also known as someone else in this tale. Jansen later applied for and received a government grant to develop her own machine: the Ice-O-Lator. Amazingly, Jansen sold her machine with the instructions that were copied directly from the XTR 420. “Sam Skunkman” in an email to Delp stated: “I did help Mila and Bubbleman with development of their products.” There were times Jansen would recognize her contract with Delp, and pay money to an investor in the X-Tractor, but she never paid Delp anything, nothing for his X-Tractors, and nothing for the Ice-O-Lator either. Even though her contract stated quite plainly: “This contract is a licensing for distribution. It refers to equipment using the Ice Watter Method of separating fragrant plants.” The contract specifically didn’t license the XTR 420, but any equipment using Delp’s “Ice Water Method.” Delp states that he had informed Jansen in 1997 about using a bucket and mixer for the process, as he had used that technique during the years he had spent in development. His X-Tractor apparatus he felt was easier to use, more elegant than a bucket and demonstrated the process better. Delp’s “aha” moment had come during a winter at his California home in the early 1990s, when he put raw cannabis into a bucketful of snow. In 1998, Delp went back to Amsterdam to confront Jansen. He found her demonstrating her Ice-O-Lator at the ’98 Cup. When Delp reminded Jansen of their contract, she asked him if he had seen Robert Clarke’s new book, Hashish!, implying that she didn’t have to pay, because Delp’s “discovery” was nothing but old news. In June 2002 before the 15th Cannabis Cup, Hager wrote: “While working on the article [‘King of Cannabis’], I met the founders of Cultivators Choice, an almost defunct American cannabis-seed company.

These two Americans told me about harvest festivals that had been held in California before the CAMP [Campaign Against Marijuana Planting] clampdown of the ’80s. Skunk #1, their favorite strain, had apparently won many prizes. In a 2014 online posting at Abakus Magazine, Hager gives us more data and some changes: “I went off to Holland to meet Nevil and was waylaid by Sam the Skunkman and Robert Clarke… They wanted to give me their spin on Nevil’s operation, and the quality of Dutch homegrown versus Cali .… Truth is, Sam had no idea I’d be inventing the Cannabis Cup later that year, as I didn’t get the idea until I was on the plane home.… When I returned to Holland for the first Cannabis Cup months later, Sam was there to meet me.” In 1986 when he joined High Times, Hager had no deep background in cannabis; he was not a dealer, smuggler, or a grower. He was a journalist, a newbie on the scene. And only knew what folks told him. Sam the Skunkman and Clarke both smoked up a storm, had trusted contacts and talked a great line of patter. Ed Rosenthal knew them, and he had been reporting from the Amsterdam scene in the late ’70s for High Times and other magazines. I am sure that before, during and after Hager, undercover agents have become embedded into High Times; they are sheep-dipped, i.e. going undercover using High Times credentials. Who facilitates this, and who is aware is unknown. Whether it is coordinated is also unknown, but the intelligence gathering capabilities are there, nor is it the first time that intelligence agencies have used media as a front. The “old school” ways of cannabis imports were coming to an end by the time Hager took over in 1986, and by 1990 the glory years of cannabis were over. Ronald Reagan had shut down much of the cannabis imports and had busted out the “good old boy” marijuana syndicates, some that had been in operation since the 1930s.

Gorman wrote in the May ’91 High Times an update about Operation Green Merchant: “Marijuana is illegal today only because the big boys haven’t yet seen their way clear to corner the market once it does become legal. But you can bet they are working on that; marijuana is just too valuable to be kept off the market forever. It’s just a question of working out the details – among which is ridding the marketplace of as many independent growers and as much information as possible. That part of the plan went into effect on Black Thursday – October 26, 1989.” According to Jeff Edwards, in the Winter 2004 issue of Hydroponic Retailing In the USA: “The DEA in the late 1980’s believed that High Times magazine, pot seed merchants, indoor pot growers, pot journalists and hydroponics equipment manufacturers were a criminal conspiracy worthy of a nationwide takedown.” Operation Green Merchant worked many angles. In Hawaii the Feds opened a grow store in Kona, partied, smoked and got to know some growers. They offered growers a deal: we will give you seeds, nutrients, whatever you need. You grow the product, and bring it here, where we will ship it to your people. You collect the money and pay us a share. Only a few went for the deal at first. It went super smooth; all the packages arriving safely, monies paid, and a share given to the grow shop. The following year many more jumped on board, and folks were busted from Kona to Brooklyn. You can only imagine the numbers, hundreds of folks lost everything, many went to prison. Busted were companies who had advertised in High Times or Sinsemilla Tips. “Hippies” had taken over much of the cannabis trade, spiriting it away from the forces in the shadows (criminal gangs, intelligence agencies) and, maybe, “they” wanted it back. According to the UN 2009 Drug Report: The cannabis market is the largest illicit drug market in terms of global spread of cultivation, volume of production and number of consumers.

No type of overt pressure or coercion was used; no plea of any sort that I stop Tips. The only agreement I made was that I wouldn’t contest them stealing my merchandise if they would just get off my back. Fighting the civil forfeiture of the store’s merchandise was going to cost $20, 000, I looked at those numbers and decided it wasn’t worth it. I had wanted to sell the store for two years by that time. Instead of selling it, I had it stolen (by the government). They used the law as a tool of extortion. It wasn’t worth my remaining assets to fight these assholes.’ Gorman wrote about the bust in the October ₉₀ issue of High Times: “Nevil Martin Schoenmakers, operator of Holland’s Seed Bank, was arrested in Australia on July 24, at the request of the U.S. government. At press time, extradition proceedings were underway to transport Schoenmakers to Federal court in New Orleans, where he will face charges of violating the Controlled Substances Act. “The 44-count indictment alleges that Schoenmakers, ‘in concert with at least five other persons,’ knowingly distributed, through the U.S. Postal Service, a total of 1,921 seeds to DEA agents and marijuana growers in the New Orleans area from 1985 to 1990. The indictment also alleges that Schoenmakers, an Australian native who makes his home in Holland, ‘did knowingly … manufacture (grow) more than 1,000 marijuana plants, a Schedule 1 drug controlled substance.’ If convicted on all counts, Schoenmakers (as well as a second, unnamed ‘co-conspirator’) faces a possible life sentence. “Schoenmakers’ indictment is closely tied to the ongoing grand jury investigation of High Times being conducted by U.S. District Attorney John Volz. The government has been seeking to determine whether or not conspiracy charges can be brought against the magazine for allowing advertisers to offer products through the mail which may later have been used in indoor-growing operations in the New Orleans area.” Cannabis Culture, October ^(′)05 : “Using gardening equipment ads in High Times as their roadmap, undercover DEA agents visited hydroponics stores and contacted hydroponics wholesalers.… Congress started passing laws in 1985 that criminalized otherwise legal products if they were ‘intended for illegal use.’” Amsterdam and London became the crossroads to Asia with bus overland travel as far as Nepal.

The big market in those days was London. The highest prices and biggest selection of hashish and weed were available in London, not Amsterdam, but you could get five years in the nick in London; in Amsterdam less than six months. From Bruining’s online autobiography: “Customers lined up in front of our house dealer at the bar, through the shop, 10- 15 meters up the sidewalk. Our booming business inspired others to do the same, and to do it better! In 1975 Maarten Brusselers, an old house friend, opened up The Rusland, a few months later followed by Henk de Vries who opened his first Bulldog.” The police would look the other way; it enabled them to resell the hashish that was confiscated back to the coffee shops. Law Enforcement throughout Europe sold their confiscated cannabis stock to Dutch Police, who in turn would move it through the coffee shops to tourists. As the coffee shop scene grew, the police even setup a clearing warehouse, where you could buy the confiscated stock; then they even opened their own coffee shops. It became big business. After fire took out the Mellow Yellow in 1978, Bruining went on a vacation to the States. While there he met folks that were growing sinsemilla marijuana. At that time the marijuana imported or grown in Holland wasn’t very good, and Wernard brought some Americans back with him to Holland to remedy that. Among them was Old Ed Holloway from Oregon. Old Ed brought with him high-potency marijuana seeds and the sinsemilla technique. He lived with Bruining for five years, and helped him and his associates, known as the “Green Team,” raise Holland’s first sinsemilla crop in 1979 in a plastic greenhouse in Amsterdam. What happened next still reverberates today. From Bruining’s autobiography: “Slowly our production grew up to a couple of hundred kilos a year. The success of the Green Team attracted more and more ‘associates’ who had their own business opinions. In 1984 the Green Team felt we needed some extra input so we send tickets to two Americans, inviting them to come over to Amsterdam for a chat, a guy called the Skunkman and Ed Rosenthal, the famous writer of ‘how to grow sinsemilla’ books.

That’s why the Skunkman was chosen by the majority of the Green Team, while I voted for Ed Rosenthal and his publicity potential. The Green Team planned to grow in a couple of big greenhouses, I figured I did not came to this planet to become a large scale illegal sinsemilla grower, so I abandoned the Green Team and Old Ed went back to the States. “That same year, I started a company of my own called Positronics. I designed a reflector and at the end of a cable a remote ballast and asked a friend of mine to assemble my light systems in a shed in the back of my garden. Positronics was the first grow shop in Europe and the business attracted a lot of people. In the beginning customers were mainly my friends. Later customers came from all over Holland, then from all over Europe and much later from all over the world. Positronics grew quickly to a company that employed 60 people, produced seeds, clones, lights, fertilizers, and sold everything needed for organic growing. We had a vegetarian restaurant and a newspaper called Soft Secrets. I hosted journalists on a weekly basis; they helped us to spread the message of home growing.” Mel Frank: That was something that came later. I have a friend who was in California at that time. He was very good breeder, very conscientious and he was working on Haze, which was already something that he got from other growers, but he consistently grew it, trying to get it to be the best it could be, and also Skunk #1. So, I think it was in ^(′)₈₃ or ^(′)₈₄ he got busted for the second time, he was a married man with two kids – two young kids – and needed to leave the country. He said he just couldn’t live here anymore, he couldn’t do what he did, what was grow dope, so he moved to Amsterdam, and needed a way to get started there, and he came by and asked me if I would give him a couple of pure strains, you know good stuff. I gave him Durbin Poison, which I thought was one of the best things I ever did and Afghani #1 .

By squishy, I mean there are lots of differing stories, contested “facts,” and folks using many names, but after all we are dealing with activities surrounding contraband. A contraband that is an emerging industry. A milieu of narcs, smugglers, middlemen, dealers, growers: energetic entrepreneurs. Outlaws who can be busted by the man. But a basic narrative can be teased from people’s words and printed sources. After time it does get clearer. So far, the Ice Water Method controversy hasn’t been broached in any book except mine, King of Nepal – Ice Wars Edition. Reinhard Delp’s patent and invention have been completely ignored by most books and magazine articles. I have written pieces for Skunk and Treating Yourself magazines, which engendered discussions on several cannabis forums. I have posted on some forums myself: receiving scorn, ridicule and denials. I have been called a rat, and banned from forums. One figure who has stayed out of the limelight is the American named “Skunk Sam” who brought seeds of this variety to Holland, collaborated for a time with Ben Dronkers of Sensi·Seeds, and has since disappeared from view. Skunk is so famous that it’s become a generic term for modern high-potency weed. Most grow guides have sections devoted to breeding. [Mel]Frank and [Ed] Rosenthal’s Marijuana Grower’s Guide is no exception. Almost as soon as Frank began growing marijuana he began amassing a vast collection of seeds and breeding. In the 1970s Frank was getting seeds from Afghanistan, very pungent skunky weed, and some Durban Poison from South Africa, useful because of its fast maturation time. Frank, like most breeders, wanted to select the most potent plants to breed, but back then there were no labs set up to test for THC levels. So he had to get creative. Frank smoked his own marijuana and had his own impressions of the potency but he wanted a larger sample. He gave his friends numbered joints containing different strains of marijuana and asked them to write up a little report after they smoked each one. He asked them to be as regimented as possible about it – smoke at the same time each day and note how long the high lasts (which he figured was a good indicator of how potent the strain was). But it didn’t always work out so well. “One woman wrote, ‘well it was a really shitty day and the dog peed in the bed’ – This", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt:11:cf00de8ff327", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2750, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584146", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "and asked them to write up a little report after they smoked each one.

But it didn’t always work out so well. “One woman wrote, ‘well it was a really shitty day and the dog peed in the bed’ – This is not a diary,” Frank says, still sounding a little annoyed decades later. “I want to know about the dope.” In 1976 Frank and Rosenthal began to breed on a much larger scale. They bought a house in the Oakland hills with a small shed out back. They put in as many windows with frosted glass as they could and covered the inside with reflective material. As we talk, Frank pulls out a stack of yellowing papernotes from his early years of breeding in Oakland in the late 1970s. Unlike many breeders at the time, Frank kept copious notes despite the risk. He felt that if he was ever put on trial, a jury in liberal-minded Oakland would not convict him since his work was geared towards research and seed production, not growing to sell for profit. He looks at his notes on an Afghani (an indica) and Nigerian crossed with a Hawaiian – both sativa dominant if not full sativas. “The hybrids were just so vigorous, they were so good in every aspect, they were wonderful,” says Frank. Another list of seeds that he finds shows strains from Burma, Tibet, China, Thailand, Sumatra, Korea, Indonesia. so sweet that I just wanted to bite it every time I went in the greenhouse,” Frank says. “There was the skunkiest skunk you’d ever had.” (According to Frank, the skunk odor indicates an indicadominant strain.) The pair grew everywhere they could think of. “We grew in the attic, we had it in the windows and in the ground in the backyard and in pots. When I think of it, we were pretty outrageous,” he says. “My sister came to visit and somebody came in and asked if there was any dope around. She said ‘yeah, here,’ and pulled some out from under the couch cushion. It was everywhere.” The seeds he and Rosenthal cultivated were the basis for the strains that he passed along to northern California growers and which they, in turn, began crossing as well, coming up with their own hybrids. As, it turns out, Frank’s seeds were also used by the early seed companies in Amsterdam that shipped seeds all around the world and made it possible for just about anyone to grow their own marijuana. In the early 1980s, Dave Watson, one of the pioneers of marijuana growing and breeding, who would go on to become a pivotal figure", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt:12:4533c1db9fe1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2751, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584146", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "along to northern California growers and which they, in turn, began crossing as well, coming up with their own hybrids.

In the early 1980s, Dave Watson, one of the pioneers of marijuana growing and breeding, who would go on to become a pivotal figure in the industry, was planning to move to Amsterdam and wanted some seed stock to take with him so he could start anew over there. Frank gave him Afghani #1 and Durban Poison. Watson added them to his collection which included Original Haze, Skunk #1, and Hindu Kush. The seeds in Watson’s collection were an important part of the founding of the Amsterdam seed business. A California-based cannabis advocate with a crusty sense of humor, Rosenthal was described by the New York Times as “the pothead’s answer to Ann Landers, Judge Judy, Martha Stewart and the Burpee Garden Wizard all in one.” Well known for his “Ask Ed” advice column in High Times, the unrepentant Yippie was instrumental in steering indoor growers toward high-intensity sodium lamps and other technological gadgetry that he flagged as a journalist. “I just give advice on how to cultivate a better garden. It’s not my fault that marijuana, the plant that is my specialty, is illegal;” he explained. Rosenthal kept his readers abreast of new developments in the cannabis underground, such as the Dutch “sea of green” gardens, wherein dozens of genetically identical plants grown from clones are crammed together in greenhouses under a perpetual blaze of light, hot-wired to the same nutrient regimen and forced to flower in lockstep. These pampered plants had identical hairy calyxes with the same cannabinoid-terpenoid-flavonoid mix, the same resinous medicament. Rosenthal and Dronkers were among the stoned cognoscenti who gathered at the inaugural Cannabis Cup, hosted by High Times in Amsterdam in 1987, underscoring once again that Holland was the place to be if you were into marijuana. What began as a one-day contest evolved into a week-long celebration of all things hemp, an annual psychoactive soirée that attracted thousands of ganja fans from around the world. There were speeches, strategy sessions, new product demonstrations, and lots of pot parties, leading up to the climactic moment when the judges reached their decision and crowned the year’s best cannabis strain, a verdict based on superb look, flavor, aroma, and quality of the high.

The winner of the first Cannabis Cup, the Oscars of pot, was Skunk #l, an Afghan-sativa cross created by David Watson, from Santa Cruz, California. A mercurial genius, Watson had been at the forefront of the great migration of American talent to the Netherlands. Watson’s award-winning weed was a potent, adaptable hybrid and its genetics would be woven into countless modern strains. (In the years ahead, pot prohibitionists misappropriated the term skunk and used it as a generic way of referring to any strong reefer.) Watson “the Skunkman’’ and his perspicacious business partner, Robert Connell Clarke, obtained a license from the Dutch government to pursue advanced scientific research into cannabinoid botany. Their company, HortaPharm, was not a commercial seed bank or grow operation. Formed in 1989, HortaPharm broke new ground in horticultural pharmacology. Watson and Clarke isolated various phytocannabinoids and terpenes in order to explore their medicinal potential. This dynamic duo took cannabis science to a whole other level. They were the first to breed “chemovar” plants marijuana plants that express just one cannabinoid. HortaPharm developed a THC chemovar and a CBD chemovar – and that was just the beginning. They also created a seed library with hemp germ plasm Like all origination myths, there are several different versions of how the Dutch seed business began. All of the versions, interestingly, orbit around the introduction of a unique strain of cannabis called Haze into the world of underground botanists. One version has a Californian named David Watson – who goes by the nom d’weed Sam the Skunkman – bringing Haze genetics to Amsterdam and sharing them with several breeders, including Nevil [Schoenmaker]. Another interpretation has Nevil venturing to Santa Cruz, California, in the late ‘80s, where he encountered two local growers called the Haze Brothers. It was the brothers who introduced Nevil to the powerful Mexican sativa. Both Sam the Skunkman and Nevil have contentiously stuck by their stories in different interviews, although I have to say, just for the sake of argument, that there’s no reason they both can’t be right. Sam the Skunkman could’ve given Nevil seeds of Haze and Nevil still could’ve gotten other Haze seeds from the Haze Brothers. Now for an article that started many questions being raised. A Dutch monthly magazine, HP/De Tijd, published an investigative piece by Bas Barkman and Gert Hage on December 5, 1997. This article gave confirmation of a VPRO radio show that had aired on October 3rd. That show had sent a shock wave through Amsterdam’s cannabis scene, which is still reverberating today.

This is an English translation from the original Dutch: The box was the reason for Sam Selezny’s trip to Holland. He was here by invitation from two pioneers in the weedgrowing industry. Two companions: Michael Taylor and Wernard Bruining, the owner of the first coffeeshop in Amsterdam. Although they already grew some nederwiet, the quality of it was not particularly special, the knowledge they possessed of growing wasn’t extensive enough. “Hedy, can you tell me why you provided David Watson with a license (to grow)?” Lap asked the newly appointed MEP and former minister of Health. Lap had only just before that found out, to his utter astonishment, that Watson, whom he only knew by the name of Selezny, was granted a license to grow marijuana for scientific purposes. In two big greenhouses in Rijsenhout, a village near Schiphol airport, the process was already under way to develop a cannabis plant with a high THC content, which in due course could be used as a basis for medicine. Or rather, it was on those terms that, after years of negotiating, the license was granted. The office and lab of HortaPharm are based in Schinkelhavenkade in Amsterdam. A little green building, a big window which in the evenings is covered with a steel sliding door. Inside it smells of fresh wiet. David Watson is on his guard. He wants to talk, but demands the final say on every sentence written about his firm. It is the end of September, and Watson is waiting for the decision on the renewal of his license. “I want to continue with my research,” he says. “I cannot use any publicity which might be possibly disadvantageous to my business.” The ministry announced at the end of September that, since the minister forbids the medical supply of cannabis, a license to grow cannabis is no longer in line with the health ministries’ policies. Besides that, during repeated inspections of HortaPharm, it was found the Admin was not run according to the requirements. In Schinkelhavenkade however, it is business as usual, the director and only shareholder told us last Monday. He saw the decision of the minister in a different light. “There are people who want it that way,” he said was the cryptic explanation, “but there are also people who want it in a different way.” In the summer two big sites where busted, the third empty upon arrival.

Shortly afterwards stories circulated the two Americans had started again. Within a few months they had set up a new greenhouse. This one was busted too, but again no sign of the Americans. Sirens, SWAT teams, broken doors and a lot of screaming. Two of the approximately fifteen suspects broke down practically straight away under questioning and mentioned the name Watson as the big man and investor behind the wiet operation. Justice didn’t act. Didn’t ask questions about him, didn’t even investigate the large amount of funds which apparently left the country via Luxembourg. Supported by advisers, he started negotiating with the health ministry about acquiring a license. One of these advisors was expolice commissioner K. Sietsema, at that time already active as a private detective. “If I know HortaPharm? If we’re talking about the same firm then yes, “ Sietsema says; “but I don’t talk about my clients, a kind of code of honor” His last bit of doubt disappeared upon discovering that the Australian Police were in possession of a list, compiled by Watson, of renowned Dutch breeders, including a precise description of their products, even mentioning the genetic codes. Handy, with the eye on the plans of the Ministry of Health to make growing indoors illegal. Oppag.2’staat dat op 22 augustus 1991 “Research Seeds D.Watson” eenaanvraag heeft ingediend.

According to Wikipedia: “The business was founded by David Paul Watson in 1990. He was soon joined by David the first license issued by the Dutch government to permit a Cannabis research facility in the Netherlands. HortaPharm B.V. has a partnership with GW Pharmaceuticals to develop Cannabis varieties for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. Research Seeds D. Watson, a sole proprietorship, submitted an application for a drugs “leave” for scientific purposes on August 22, 1991. The name was later changed to HortaPharm B.V. The company was awarded the leave to operate outside national legal statues, specifically the Opium Act, and grow cannabis for research. The leave was granted on September 16, 1994, and ended September 16, 1997. HortaPharm submitted various other leaves, but these were all rejected. There had been many problems, the first government inspection on June 30, 1995 deemed that accurate records were not being kept, and there was a request in writing for HortaPharm to clean up their act. A second inspection took place September 20, 1996; again accurate records were not being kept, and the amount of marijuana was way above the limit of the leave. Plus HortaPharm was using resources and equipment well beyond what the leave permitted. Letters were again sent to HortaPharm. Finally on May 1, 1997, a letter was sent from Netherlands’ Healthcare Inspectorate that restated the leave, strongly demanded that precise records be kept, and warned HortaPharm that if they could not straighten up within eight weeks, the leave would be withdrawn. On June 20, 1997 HortaPharm wrote and said they would be good. On May 26, 1998 HortaPharm submitted a new application for “chemical analytical purposes, breeding and submitted conservation of plant varieties, and import and export.” Following up on the application there was an inspection on April 13, 1999. The inspector found large quantities of marijuana, and “enriched plant material consisting of resin parts with an estimated THC content of over 30% . In addition, the inspector determined that HortaPharm [was] not functioning at a level of quality thinking. There is no quality manual and there are no standardized procedures.” The application was denied on April 14th. Controversial Medi-weed firm HortaPharm has again requested a license from the ministry of Health. The request follows after recently Minister Borst informed the firm they are not allowed to trade in THC.

The request follows after recently Minister Borst informed the firm they are not allowed to trade in THC. HortaPharm has made an appeal in court against that decision. The ministry has had issues with the firm for a few years now. In September 1994 HortaPharm was granted a license. The license meant they were allowed to grow cannabis for research purposes in greenhouses in Aalsmeer. According to David Watson, owner of HortaPharm, the cannabis derived product is significantly cheaper and in the long run better than Marinol, which would make it a serious competitor for the pharmaceutical industry. He doesn’t understand why the Dutch Government does not allow him to have access to this lucrative market. A market which he estimates to be a least a hundred million guilders. HortaPharm also has linked itself with Institut für Onkologische und Immunologische Forschung in Berlin. Both Generics and the Berlin Institute claim HortaPharm’s seeds are beneficial to them. But HortaPharm is not allowed to trade these seeds. Cannabis seed trading is allowed, but not the trading of THC. HortaPharm was provided with a one-time-only export license, for non-commercial research purposes. Watson continues to fight for a trade license in Holland, and has said the commercial part of his firm has been moved to the UK, under GW. Only the delivery of technology and seeds continues from Holland. Then in September a license was granted on the basis that HortaPharm would act “good and trustworthy” under the license. The minister states however that the firm, despite several warnings, didn’t keep to the agreement. HortaPharm grew a significantly larger amount than necessary for THC extraction. During an inspection, 250 kilos of Cannabis, 12 kilos of shredded cannabis and cannabis oil were found. The administration of the firm had not been done according to regulation and plants were not destroyed in the prescribed way. The latter meant a notary act of the destruction needed to have been written. Whether Watson has done dodgey things with his firm has not really been investigated. It is remarkable however that, despite the ministerial warnings, the firm was simply allowed to continue for three years. It is even more remarkable considering the fact that during question time in Parliament last year, minister Borst already claimed there were doubts whether HortaPharm only grew hemp for science purposes.

Office to conduct research into the medicinal uses of cannabis – and Dutch medicinal cannabis plant breeding company Horta-Pharm B.V. Speaking at the International Cannabinoid Research Society (ICRS) conference in Montpellier, Dr. Geoffrey W. Guy, Chairman of GW Pharmaceuticals, said that HortaPharm will provide GW with exclusive access to its entire range of cannabis varieties for the development of medicines. The worldwide rights acquired by GW for an undisclosed sum cover varieties grown to date with certain exceptions and all varieties to be bred in future. Plant registrations arising from the Dutch breeding programme will be owned by GW. Under the agreement GW will be responsible for the development of specific drug delivery technologies to administer the pharmaceutical grade medicinal cannabis. Dr. Guy, said: “There has been much speculation as to the exact role of the various chemical components of cannabis in treating patients with illnesses such as Multiple Sclerosis and AIDS wasting syndrome. In particular THC (the psychoactive constituent chemical) has received much attention. Historical medical reports and more recent work may point to the influence of cannabidiol (CBD) in epilepsy and stroke for example. We wish to explore the therapeutic benefits and the potential for reduction in unwanted effects that may be offered through administration of complete extracts containing various defined ratios of the principal cannabinoids.” Mr David Watson, Chief Executive of HortaPharm commented: “HortaPharm leads the world in its understanding of cannabis botany and has built up over many years the most extensive ‘Living Library’ of Medicinal Cannabis varieties. As soon as Dr. Guy’s clinical research indicates the exact desired composition our scientists can breed and register new medicinal varieties.” “It looks like dope, but really it’s hope,” explains the proprietor, American entrepreneur David Watson. What he means is that many of these plants have been specifically bred not to produce an intoxicating resin or hashish. Indeed, HortaPharm hopes to thwart the aims of the average recreational user. As a result, the seeds that HortaPharm is producing are passed straight on to Britain to take their place in the soil at the ground-breaking facility set up this summer by Dr. Geoffrey Guy in south-east England. “We hooked up with Dr. Guy in January and right now all we are doing is providing the basic building blocks for his work,” says Mr Watson. “We were rather surprised that it would happen in England first.” HortaPharm’s sample plants are analyzed in the laboratory with a gas chromatographer and with each new batch the team homes in on the plant’s distinct chemical components or cannabinoids – THC, CBD, CBC, CBG and THCV.

When Dr. Guy completes his medical research in Britain, HortaPharm will breed plants to supply the right combination of active ingredients for his treatments. “Once Dr. Guy has worked out what he wants in chemical form, we will find him the right physical characteristics, too, by combining desirable features from plants found around the world – high-resin production and resistance to disease,” says Mr de Meijer. In June, Dr. Guy’s company, GW Pharmaceuticals, secured the first British license to grow the plant for medical purposes. By arrangement with the Home Office, the doctor can farm cannabis plants and investigate their properties with a view to marketing a cheap herbal-based answer to the debilitating symptoms of MS, Glaucoma, Parkinson’s, cancer, asthma and Aids. A year ago today the Independent on Sunday launched its campaign to decriminalize cannabis, attracting tremendous public attention. Five months later, the IoS held a march, attended by more than 16,000 people, and organised an influential Westminster Conference to look at drugs legislation. Yesterday, hundreds of campaigners met again in Hyde Park to demonstrate their continuing concerns. But it is the case for legalizing the medical use of the drug which has gained most ground in the past 12 months. Key markers of this shift in public perspective were the positive outcome of the British Medical Association’s report in November last year and the House of Lords’ select committee decision to investigate the question. The committee has yet to publish its conclusions. This week, even more powerful evidence of the useful properties of cannabis was revealed in the work of the research team working under Dr. Ian Meng at the University of California. Researching on rats, Dr. Meng has found the brain stem circuit which is involved in the pain-suppressing activities of morphine, but which is also activated by the consumption of cannabinoids. “The medical arguments are really gaining ground,” says Dr. Meng. “There is some proof now that the drug can help people.” Mr Watson of HortaPharm makes the same point: “Domestic users can make a contribution, but they don’t know the profile of the plant they are treating themselves with. The average hashish in a coffee-shop product is 5 per cent THC. We can already make it 30 per cent. So, what are they doing to it?” He believes the bright future of the drug is contained in the greenhouses of HortaPharm and GW Pharmaceuticals. *HortaPharm B.V. (the Netherlands) and Kenex Ltd.

(Canada) provided controlled substances for research registered and permitted by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy with support from the David and Lucille Packard Foundation and the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station. The study was first presented at the Botanical Society of America Annual Meeting in 2004 at Snowbird, Utah. The back story: On 1/17/2013, the National Cancer Institute updated its Cannabis and Cannabinoids PDQ^(◎) webpage with the following new cannabis and cancer information, which just by coincidence supports the new GW Pharma pre-approved patent and lays the groundwork for GW Pharma’s future new breakout marijuana-based cancer drugs. The potential effects of medicinal cannabis for people living with cancer include antiemetic effects, appetite stimulation, pain relief, and improved sleep. In the practice of integrative oncology the health care provider may recommend medicinal cannabis not only for symptom management but also for its possible direct anti-tumor effect. NCI, according to the government, 19 studies “failed to demonstrate statistically significant associations between marijuana inhalation and lung cancer.” The report also identified a separate study of 611 lung cancer patients that showed marijuana was “not associated with an increased risk of lung cancer or other upper aero digestive tract cancers and found no positive associations with any cancer type.” Despite the Federal government sanctioned and authorized NCI report, Pappas said Congress and the Obama Administration have continued to thwart marijuana research. In an announced effort to displace state medical marijuana laws, the Office of National Drug Control Policy described ‘medical’ marijuana as a ‘myth’ fueling ‘troubling misconceptions’ in documents found on its website. n 2006, I joined International Cannagraphic’s online forums. Someone had started a thread about Reinhard Delp’s Ice Water Method titled, “The ‘inventor’ lawsuits for ice hash kits.” This was started by “Aroma” on March 20, 2006. Which was ironically the same date, twenty-one years earlier, when David Watson was reportedly busted in the Santa Cruz, California area, and then showed up in Amsterdam one month later as Sam “Skunkman” Selezny. Then came a July 1999 article in Hanf, “Water Made Hash – the Water Extraction Method with the Ice-O-Later,” which talked about Jansen, Clarke’s book, Hashish!, and Sadu Sam’s Secret, “a water extraction technique (invented by Nevil from the Cannabis Castle) … He [Clarke] also cites Sadu Sam’s original instructions, which suggest the use of an outboard motor in a 55 Gallon drum.… The Swiss Ice Cold-machine [X-Tractor", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt:21:3a79feb4732f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2760, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584146", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "then showed up in Amsterdam one month later as Sam “Skunkman” Selezny.

For your information we send you a translation of our response to a 7/98 article in “Hanf” a German magazine which relates to your publication: HASHISH! Robert Connell Clarke, 98. Your author’s very unprofessional if not fraudulent behavior in not relating “his findings” to our Xtractor introduction in 97 and instead promoting “his own Xtractor” and now Mila Jansen’s I-O-Later; is causing us considerable damage! You state that Sadu Sam’s advice to “grind” the material is the wrong approach. I would think that you would take this evidence that Sadu Sam’s method predated yours, since your method improved the procedure.

Unlike “HIGH TIMES” (see May 98) Clarke doesn’t mention our surprise introduction of the “XTR $4 2 0 ^ { \\it { p } }$ on your Cup97 in his book.

Delp had received his U.S. patent in 2000, and later his European and Canadian patents in 2006. Delp spent thousands of dollars defending his patents. He has been able to prevail in Germany, and only licensed products are available there. He has gone to court in Canada, getting a judgment against one firm, while other cases are still in the courts. He has had a hard time finding adequate representation in the Netherlands. With Delp’s documents, some Internet research, and my forty years experience in the hashish business, I wrote a new chapter for a new edition of my book, King of Nepal. I called it the Ice Wars Edition. An English writer, Annie Riecken had coined that term in 2001 for the brouhaha while doing research for the Red Eye Express, a small UK indie magazine reporting on the world cannabis scene. After learning about the thread in the summer of 2006, I joined as “Will,” (the forum only allowed aliases), and posted my two cents. Granted, I might have taken a different tack, but my better half had recently passed away, leaving me without her soft reflective grace. Add to that my natural Brooklyn tendencies, plus the outrage I felt at how Delp and others were being treated. And I didn’t care to be called names, so I may have been a bit, let’s say brusque. FYI, I was in Afghanistan pre 1972 also, and the Brotherhood, some who were friends of mine, may have been amongst the first to bring back Indica Afghani seeds to the USA. So did I. Where are the Brotherhood Afghani Indica varieties? I still have mine. And of course the Haze was not developed in Hawaii, it was developed in Santa Cruz, California in the early 1970’s from Colombian and Mexican seeds, by R.L.

Quite a few years later the Ice-o-later and Reinhardt [Delp] showed up in Amsterdam claiming to have invented ice-water sifting. Mila and Bubbleman both came later. But Reinhardt’s method is a slight change to my published water method, I said the colder the water the better, he said use ice water. But his method does not work without water, it is not the ice that makes it work it is the cold water in fact. Ice improves the yield. Anyone I know who works for the police, well I pass the info on to everyone I know. Remember we are patented, we don’t have to be quiet any longer. As you can see these guys are being investigated by the Culture. There is so much back-up evidence they have made a CDROM of the whole situation, over three hundred documented pieces of evidence of major fraud. My name is Joe Pietri [the name was obscured in the forum post] and I don’t live in fear. I live in the light of truth. You are a snitch. You know what a snitch is? A RAT. I will be happy to see you in Amsterdam at the High Times Cannabis Cup and will be happy to give you a chance for you to “stick my foot up his ass.” What a joke. I am laughing because it was me and Rob Clarke that gave Steve Hager at High Times the idea to have the first High Times Cannabis Cup. And by the way I won first place at the first HT Cannabis Cup. This guy is dangerous, he is full of hate and lies. I advise everyone to stay far far away from him. He really thinks it is OK to RAT on people as long as he knows the person is bad according to him.

Begun in 1968, the only U.S. licensed cannabis-growing facility is at the University of Mississippi, where Dr. Carlton E. Turner worked from 1971-1981. Turner graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi, earning a bachelor’s degree in chemistry and master’s and doctoral degrees in organic chemistry. He became one of the nation’s leading experts on the botany and pharmacology of marijuana. Turner headed the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi. He served in the University’s Research Institute for Pharmaceutical Studies, becoming Director of the Institute in 1980. He also worked as a consultant for government agencies and private firms in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, as well as for the United Nations. Turner was appointed Senior Policy Adviser for Drug Policy in July 1981. In March 1982, his title changed to Director of the Drug Abuse Policy Office. He took on the additional title of Special Assistant to the President for Drug Abuse Policy in April 1983. In March 1985, he was appointed Deputy Assistant to the President for Drug Abuse Policy. Turner served as the President’s adviser for drug abuse policy and assisted Nancy Reagan with her domestic and international drug abuse education projects. Turner left the White House staff effective December 31, 1986. The university still produces the marijuana cigarettes for the four legal cannabis federal patients still being served today. The federal government’s Compassionate Investigative New Drug program began in 1976 and stopped accepting new patients in 1992.

The federal government officially recognized cannabis’ medical properties in 1985, when the FDA approved a prescription drug that is made of synthetic THC – Marinol – for nausea. But has kept marijuana as a Schedule I drug. The DEA definition: “Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” From Wikipedia: “The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is a United States federal-government research institute whose mission is to lead the Nation in bringing the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction.… NIDA has a government granted monopoly on the production of medical marijuana for research purposes. In the past, the institute has refused to supply marijuana to researchers who had obtained all other necessary federal permits. Medical marijuana researchers and activists claim that NIDA, which is not supposed to be a regulatory organization, does not have the authority to effectively regulate who does and doesn’t get to do research with medical marijuana. “Jag Davies of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) writes in MAPS Bulletin: ‘Currently, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has a monopoly on the supply of research-grade marijuana, but no other Schedule I drug, that can be used in FDA-approved research. NIDA uses its monopoly power to obstruct research that conflicts with its vested interests. MAPS had two of its FDA-approved medical marijuana protocols rejected by NIDA, preventing the studies from taking place. MAPS has also been trying without success for almost four years to purchase 10 grams of marijuana from NIDA for research into the constituents of the vapor from marijuana vaporizers, a non-smoking drug delivery method that has already been used in one FDA-approved human study.’” What was different now? What had transpired during the last fifteen years? Crude marijuana was now legal in two states. Surely the old biases are going away. But as illustrated by excerpts from another article at leafscience.com on March 12, 2014, it is still a struggle to get cannabis research authorized: These protocols exist because of international treaties to which the U.S. is a signatory, especially the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, which was the first international accord to prohibit the production and supply of cannabis.

Until very recently few cannabis research projects were approved in the U.S. But as shown, Watson and Clarke’s HortaPharm was given an official “leave” by the Netherlands in 1994 to do research, and when the permission was not renewed, they were able to continue their research – under conditions that have never been publicly revealed. Even with HortaPharm having unauthorized equipment, and growing way over their limits, they were never shut down. Matter-of-fact, HortaPharm continue to grow. A February 28, 2014 press release by HortaPharm’s business partner GW Pharmaceuticals: LONDON, Feb. 28, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – GW Pharmaceuticals plc (AIM:GWP) (Nasdaq:GWPH) (“GW”) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation for Epidiolex®, GW’s product candidate that contains plant-derived Cannabidiol (CBD) as its active ingredient, for use in treating children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a rare and severe form of childhood-onset epilepsy. Epidiolex is an oral liquid formulation of a highly purified extract of CBD, a non-psychoactive molecule from the cannabis plant. In November 2013, GW announced that the FDA had granted orphan drug designation for Epidiolex in the treatment of Dravet syndrome. Following the successful follow-on offering completed in January 2014, GW intends to advance a full clinical development program for Epidiolex for the treatment of both LGS and Dravet syndromes. Working with leading pediatric epilepsy specialists in the United States, GW expects to commence an initial Phase 2 clinical trial for Epidiolex in the second half of 2014. This trial, if successful, is expected to lead to Phase 3 pivotal trial programs in both Dravet syndrome and LGS intended to support New Drug Applications with the FDA. LGS is a severe form of childhood-onset epilepsy. Seizure types, which vary among patients, include tonic (stiffening of the body, upward deviation of the eyes, dilation of the pupils, and altered respiratory patterns), atonic (brief loss of muscle tone and consciousness, causing abrupt falls), atypical absence (staring spells), and myoclonic (sudden muscle jerks).

Most children with LGS experience some degree of impaired intellec- tual functioning or information processing, along with developmental delays, and behavioral disturbances. LGS can be caused by brain malformations, perinatal asphyxia, severe head injury, central nervous system infection and inherited degenerative or metabolic conditions. It is estimated that there are approximately 14,000-18,500 patients with LGS in the United States and 23,000-31,000 patients with LGS in Europe. “This orphan designation for Epidiolex, GW’s purified CBD medicine, in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome follows on from the recent FDA grant of orphan designation in Dravet syndrome. We are now in active discussions with the FDA regarding the U.S. regulatory pathway for Epidiolex and believe that this medicine has the potential to meet the significant unmet need of children suffering with severe seizures where all options to control those seizures have been exhausted,” stated Justin Gover, GW’s Chief Executive Officer. “GW is responding to this need with the goal of providing an FDA-approved prescription CBD medicine that physicians have confidence in prescribing and parents can trust for quality, consistency and access.” Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition – generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. The first NIDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. Founded in 1998, GW is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform in a broad range of disease areas. GW commercialized the world’s first plant-derived cannabinoid prescription drug, Sativex®, which is approved for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis in 25 countries. Sativex is also in Phase 3 clinical development as a potential treatment of pain in people with advanced cancer. This Phase 3 program is intended to support the submission of a New Drug Application for Sativex in cancer pain with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and in other markets around the world. GW has a deep pipeline of additional cannabinoid product candidates, including Epidiolex which has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, severe, drug-resistant epilepsy syndromes.

For further information, please visit www.gwpharm.com. The financial terms of this partnership have been established to yield equal long term value to each partner. GW has maintained a significant share of long term product revenues whilst benefiting from a signature fee, an innovative advance working capital facility and milestone payments in the near term to further enhance GW’s cash position. The medicine has been developed by GW to provide a medically acceptable cannabis-derived product for the treatment of the debilitating symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and severe neuropathic pain. The product is a whole plant medicinal cannabis extract containing TetranabinexTM (Tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”)) and NabidiolexTM (cannabidiol (“CBD”)) as its principal components. The medicine is administered by means of a spray into the mouth. In addition to a share of product revenues, GW has received a signature fee and will receive additional fees on regulatory approval in the UK of the initial indications of MS, neuropathic pain and cancer pain, totaling £25 million. In the event that Bayer exercise the option for countries outside the UK, additional milestones shall be payable on a country by country basis. Of the £25 million milestone payments, £10 million can be drawn by GW in advance as an interest-free working capital facility to support ongoing preparations for market launch of Sativex. The facility can be drawn by GW at GW’s discretion until MHRA approval is obtained. On approval, Bayer has the option to convert the facility into a milestone payment or to convert into GW shares at an agreed premium to the share price at the time of conversion. The facility is subject to additional conditions if MHRA approval is not obtained by 30 September 2004. Dr. Geoffrey Guy, Executive Chairman of GW, said: “We are delighted to have entered into this partnership with Bayer. Having recently submitted the regulatory dossier for Sativex to the UK regulatory authorities, this announcement is a further significant achievement for GW. It is GW’s first commercial collaboration and marks the start of a new phase in the company’s history. As a leading global pharmaceutical company, Bayer is well placed to maximize the market opportunity for GW’s product.” Commenting on the commercial terms of the agreement between the two companies, Dr. Guy added: “GW’s commercial strategy is to maximize the value of its products by entering into agreements at a late stage of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt:29:7c1176d16a77", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2768, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584146", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "this announcement is a further significant achievement for GW.

The terms of this agreement reflect the merits of this strategy. Most importantly, GW retains a significant interest in revenues from product sales.” Dr. Christa Kreuzburg, Head of Europe for Bayer Health-Care’s Pharmaceuticals Division, said: “We are delighted that GW has selected Bayer as its marketing partner to bring this innovative medicine to market. Supporting medical professionals with effective therapies for the management of MS and severe neuropathic pain is an area of largely unmet need. I am therefore very excited that Bayer will be bringing a product to market with the potential to make a significant contribution in this area. Our two companies are now working closely to prepare for market launch in the UK. Sativex will enhance our portfolio in the UK extremely well and strengthen the market position of Bayer Pharmaceuticals.” Bayer AG is a German chemical and pharmaceutical company founded in 1863. Its first product was aspirin, and it began marketing heroin in 1895. After World War I, its North American business was confiscated by the U.S. government and later acquired by Sterling Drug. The rest of its world-wide enterprises, became part of IG Farben. After World War II, the Allies broke-up IG Farben, and Bayer AG reappeared. Bayer AG re-acquired its North American franchise in 1994, and the brand rights to Bayer Aspirin. Bayer AG does $13 billion annually in the U.S., and about $55 billion world wide. According to Contract Pharma’s 2013 report, Bayer AG is the fourteenth largest firm in the pharmaceutical industry. Definitely a player in “Big Pharma.” Is the HortaPharm-GW-Bayer triumvirate a long-term operation to patent and monopolize cannabis’ medicinal qualities, concentrating on particular plant strains? Will the forensics developed by HortaPharm be used to track strains, and eventually, to claim ownership of certain strains? And how and why was HortaPharm allowed to continue their work without proper certification? How did the Netherlands get around the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)? The UNODC, established in 1997, oversees the international treaties, establishes protocols, gathers data and releases annual reports on the illegal drug trade. Experiments crossing sativa and indica strains led to the development of “skunk,” a hybrid said to be 75 per cent sativa and 25 per cent indica, which was among the first to capture the THC high of the sativas with the rapid growth cycle and yield of the indicas.97 It remains one of the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt:30:d4884bdebb2f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2769, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584146", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "Drugs and Crime (UNODC)?

He shared his knowledge and his seeds primarily with Ben Dronkers of Sensi Seeds and Eddie, owner of the Flying Dutchmen Seed Company, who remembers, “He was really into seeds, I mean like nobody else was at that time, maybe a few people on earth, and he took a whole lot of seeds here, different strains, and things really happened fast. The old Dutch outdoor grass was forgotten and everyone went with the new genetics. It was the Great Leap Forward.” So who are the informants, and are they informants in the police sense of the word, or are they simply giving information to the author of the UN Drug Report? Are the informants the Dutch seed merchants, or are they Watson and Clarke? Notice also that Pot Planet’s history completely forgets about Nevil Schoenmaker and others. But a bigger question is how does one get to travel in such According to a 2012 USA Today article, Dr. Mahmoud ElSohly had been “the head of the marijuana research program since 1981.” He is listed as a Research Professor in the Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and a Professor of Pharmaceutics. The marijuana growing project is part of the University of Mississippi’s School of Pharmacy, and is currently known as the National Center for Natural Products Research. From the NCNPR’s website: The National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR) was created to bring together an alliance of academia, government, and the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries to integrate research, development, and commercialization of potentially useful natural products. It is the nation’s only university-affiliated research center devoted to improving human health and agricultural productivity through the discovery, development, and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals derived from natural products. [Emphasis not in original.] Dr. ElSohly also profits from the Drug War.

Not a bad guy, I must admit; he did testify before the political bureau in Mississippi about decriminalizing marijuana and lessening the penalties, so anyway for possession. He actually later quit the Reagan Administration because of the drug policies, but he called me up one day. I said, “Sure Carlton.” He’s calling me up; it’s like January or February obviously there is nothing growing then [laughs] so I just went to my last years’ harvest from my greenhouse, and what I used to do was grow all these different varieties and I would seed a branch or selected buds on each plant and then over the winter I would smoke that with a number of friends, I would give them numbered joints, and they would give me a report on the quality and the high, and then I would select one. Mel Frank: One from that, one mother I would plant from that variety for the next year, and that was how I went about my breeding program and it was incredibly successful, that simple way was very successful, so all I had was the seeds and the dregs from buds that the seeds came in so I rounded up a bunch of that stuff and sent it to him with a series from a Mexican variety that I had taken a different sample from each week because I wanted to trace the THC rise and fall, so I never told him that I just included that right in there, and he gave me a report on that. The U.S. government policy, starting in the Nixon and Ford administrations and continuing under Carlton Turner2 (Drug Czar under Reagan 1981-1986), allowed federal medical marijuana, supplied to the individual state marijuana medical programs, to consist only of the leaf of the marijuana plant, even though it’s usually only one-third as strong as the bud and doesn’t contain the same whole spectrum of the “crude drug,” i.e. the THC and CBNs. For example, the leaf ’s relief of ocular pressure for glaucoma patients is much shorter lasting and therefore unsatisfactory, compared to the bud. Also, the leaf sometimes gives smokers a headache.

When Turner delivered his prototype version of the paraquat test kit to High Times, it was a total “Rube Goldberg” type rip-off, “just like the dozen or so phony kits other companies tried to buy ad space for at this time,” wrote Latimer in an article published in 1984. And Turner’s views haven’t changed, appearing on Fox News on March 15, 2013, Former Reagan administration drug czar Dr. Carlton Turner said that the health risks associated with marijuana make the question of legalization a dangerous proposition, and he is currently a vocal opponent to medical marijuana on Florida. Cannabis as a pharmaceutical is nothing new. As you can see in photo, this was how hashish was sold over the counter in the 19th century and prior to prohibition in 1937. On the label one can see its use for anti-spasm. This pure resin was collected from farms in Central Asia for British and U.S. pharmaceutical firms from 1840-1940.

Our programme is to have clone lines whose cannabinoid production will be either exclusively THC or exclusively CBD. Then we’ve got others which have no THC but which produce high concentrations of CBC, CBG or THCV: those are other cannabinoids of interest. We’ll establish in the clinical trials which are most beneficial for different conditions. We can then go back to our clone library to breed plants which will specifically produce these ratios and use those clones for the mother plant of that line of production. That will also give us very secure plant registration rights. “The subject patent specifically covers a method for treating glioma in a human using a combination of cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) wherein the cannabinoids are in a ratio of from 1:1 to 1:20 (THC:CBD) with the intent to reduce cell viability, inhibit cell growth or reduce tumor volume.” Plants are dried and sometimes left for many weeks before processing, by which time the trichomes will have lost much of their more volatile terpene content. Techniques used to make so-called ‘‘modern hashish’’ (Clarke and Watson, 2007) perhaps offer greater opportunities for collecting undamaged glandular trichomes, with more of their secondary metabolites intact. In one method, cannabis material is simply agitated in cold water and the dislodged capitate stalked trichomes collected using sieves. Jansen and Terris (2002) reported that, with a Dutch Government subsidy, this technique had been adapted to make hashish for pharmaceutical research purposes. Separation of capitate stalked Potter’s thesis, with GW Pharmaceuticals support, appears to build an “intellectual” foundation for the apparent ongoing fraud to confuse the origins of, and theft of Delp’s patented process. Dr. Potter is currently part of senior management at GW Pharamceuticals, serving as Director of Botanical Research and Cultivation. As noted before, there is the May 1998 High Times article that introduced Delp’s invention without mentioning him, while promoted Mila Jansen and her Dutch company Pollinator.

The editor of the journal was Ethan Russo, MD, who is currently the Senior Medical Advisor at the Cannabinoid Research Institute, a division of GW Pharmaceuticals. Jansen and Terris are identified as “affiliated with the Pollinator Company,” but the trappings and subsequent citations of the “paper” are of the scientific genre, giving the work undue gravitas. The Pollinator was the first modern machine to be designed for the production of hashish. The industry was previously unchanged for thousands of years due to the fact that silk screens used for sieving had not been improved until the creation of modern technology. The first Pollinator machines were sold from home, but after a couple of years, I [ Jansen]opened a shop as there was a clear demand by many cannabis growers who had marveled at the first public demonstration of the Pollinator machine by Robert C. Clarke at C.I.A. [Cannabis in Amsterdam, a hemp store] Amsterdam, during the 1994 High Times Cannabis Cup event. This gave us more time and space to work on the development of methods to improve the technique of pure hashish production, as previously all the testing was done at the kitchen table. It was in this shop where I made my second breakthrough, the creation of the “Ice-O-Lator®,” a water and ice method of making hashish. In 1997, we practiced at home with jugs of water, but had no satisfactory results. The big revelation did not come until we saw the Extractor.” Designed in the USA, and manufactured in Yugoslavia, this system tended to break down within 8 months, and was very heavy and expensive. All over the world, people could buy buckets and mixing machines. In the summer of 1998, I sewed my first Ice-O-Lator bags. Above Jansen “misspeaks,” mislabeling the name of Delp’s machine as the Extractor instead of X-Tractor, and blurring the machine’s origin. They were built in the Czech Republic, not Yugoslavia.

She laid off her actions to the machine’s bulk, cost and reliability, and her desire to help people. The next part of the paper by Jansen and Terris spells out Delp’s method, confusing his patent, and laying the foundation for GW Pharmaceuticals to use Delp’s process without acknowledging his patent. In his thesis, Potter presented Jansen and Terris as the source for the process, ETP or “enriched trichome preparation,” upon which is based GW Pharmaceuticals’ products. Again from the article by Jansen and Terris: This method of extracting the resin glands from the leaf material involved the use of water and ice. Leaf material is placed in cold water (4^(∘)C) , where it is agitated causing the glandular trichomes to separate from the plant material. Temperature is again of great importance. As the herbal material is agitated in the cold water, hardened resin glands are dislodged more cleanly. Gravity then plays its part as the trichomes sink, and the plant material is left floating on the surface. With the aid of two precise screens (one for the leaf material and the other for the resin) the desirable mature glands and leaf material are separated. One factor that influences the resin glands are ideal growing conditions. Resin glands from plants grown indoors are slightly larger than those grown outdoors, as the plants have more light, nutrients and water. For outdoor growers of cannabis (or older plants where the resin glands have shriveled with drying), I prefer a 187μ screen on top. This will allow the resin glands to pass through while containing the rest of plant material. A pore sized screen of 62 μ as a lower screen will trap the extracted glandular heads. For growers of indoor plants with larger sized glands, I recommend a top screen of 210μ and a 77μ screen for the lower bag. The Ice-O-Lator process is very simple, quick and efficient. The process begins by hanging both Ice-O-Lator bags (making sure the bag with the larger pore sized screen is on the top of the fine screened bag) in a bucket and then adding the plant material, ice blocks and enough cold water to 3/4 fill the bucket. A temperature of between 2 − 4^(∘)C is set before starting to agitate the plant material and ice. After twenty minutes of agitation, the water is left to settle for twenty minutes. In this period, the resin glands sink and any plant material rises to the surface. The top bag may then be gently raised", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt:36:ad39a492f87c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2775, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584146", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 37, "text": "of the fine screened bag) in a bucket and then adding the plant material, ice blocks and enough cold water to 3/4 fill the bucket.

In this period, the resin glands sink and any plant material rises to the surface. The top bag may then be gently raised out of the bucket, allowing the water and resin glands to drain. Lifting the lower bag out of the bucket reveals the collected trichomes once the water has drained. The inside of the bag is then rinsed with water to collect all the resin glands from the top of the screen. The outside of the bag is the wrapped in kitchen paper and pressed to remove the water. The resin glands are then sufficiently dry enough to remove from the Ice-O-Lator bag. The collected resin glands are then placed into a metal kitchen sieve and filtered onto paper below. The resin glands are then ready for complete drying, as moisture may quickly lead to a deterioration of quality due to fungal growth. Once the resin glands are fully dried, they can be stored by pressing, or left in granular form. The Ice-O-Lator has proved to be the most efficient method of separation when taking into consideration factors such as time, purity and quantity. In the “coffee shops” of Amsterdam, the hashish made by this process is highly sought, as its potency and purity have become legendary. Ice-O-Lator bags have been sold throughout the world. Jansen is currently hailed as the “Queen of Hashish” in Europe. When my book the King of Nepal, German edition, came out at the Cannabiz Expo in Cologne in 2004, I met Mila, and she mumbled about being worried about her reputation. I didn’t have a clue what she meant, but I do now. Mila as the ice-hash/bubblehash innovator is a myth perpetrated by High Times and much of the rest of the cannabis industry. By now you can realize the scope of the fraud, when you add the pharmaceutical and other “song and dances,” it must be over a trillion dollars.

The patients in the federal marijuana program were guinea pigs, and are living proof that even the lowest quality pot is good medicine as long as it has the complete cannabinoid profile. You would think the government would process all CBD-rich feral hemp (ditch weed) collected yearly into CBD oil for medicine instead of burning it. Cannabis has been used in Laos and Thailand as medicine for thousands of years. I wonder what the Government of Thailand would say if they knew that GW Pharmaceuticals owns the intellectual property rights to genetics sourced in their country? While at the same time the DEA teaches Thai and Lao police crop eradication? In Laos anything over 10 kilos is currently a death sentence, in a country where cannabis has been sold in the market as a cooking herb and medicine for millennia. The same goes for Nepal, Afghanistan, and India. In India cannabis has been used in Ayurvedic medicine, long before the written word. The British collected cannabis indica resin from central Asia for their pharmaceutical industries up until the 1960s. Cannabis-based medicine is still sold in India by Ayurvedic doctors, as well in Nepal. Prior to prohibition in 1937, a large percentage of prescription medicine were cannabis-based. Pharmaceutical companies such as Parke Davis, now known as Pfizer, Lilly, Merck, Bayer, and many others made their original fortunes from cannabis-, opium-, and cocaine-based medicines. Many veterinarian medicines have been cannabis-based as well, and are still in use by farmers in third world countries today. types, Mexican, Colombian, Afghani, all of which were better and stronger than the hybrid. No one supports native cannabis crop eradication more than HortaPharm. When botanists are sent into the field to collect wild cannabis strains or old farmed strains, they would inject Skunk #1 seeds.

One common misunderstanding is that pharmaceutical companies patent the plants they collect. While obtaining a patent on a naturally occurring organism as previously known or used is not possible, patents may be taken out on specific chemicals isolated or developed from plants. Often these patents are obtained with a stated and researched use of those chemicals. Generally the existence, structure and synthesis of those compounds is not a part of the indigenous medical knowledge that led researchers to analyze the plant in the first place. As a result, even if the indigenous medical knowledge is taken as prior art, that knowledge does not by itself make the active chemical compound “obvious,” which is the standard applied under patent law. teur patented a “yeast” which was “free from disease” (patent #141072). Patents covering biological inventions have been treated similarly. In the 1980 case of Diamond v. Chakrabarty, the Supreme Court upheld a patent on a bacterium that had been genetically modified to consume petroleum, reasoning that U.S. law permits patents on “anything under the sun that is made by man.” The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has observed that “a patent on a gene covers the isolated and purified gene but does not cover the gene as it occurs in nature.” Also possible under U.S. law is patenting a cultivar, a new variety of an existing organism. The patent on the enola bean (now revoked) was an example of this sort of patent. The intellectual property laws of the U.S. also recognize plant breeders’ rights under the Plant Variety Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2321-2582. In 1995, the University of Mississippi Medical Center was granted U.S. Patent 5,401,504 on Use of Turmeric in Wound Healing. The claim covered “a method of promoting healing of a wound by administering turmeric to a patient afflicted with wound.” This patent also granted them the exclusive right to sell and distribute turmeric. In India, turmeric has been “a classic grandmother’s remedy,” applied to cuts of children as an anti-parasitic agent, used as a blood purifier, and for the treatment of the common cold for generations. It is also used as an essential ingredient in many Indian dishes. Turmeric is a folk remedy, part of people’s traditional knowledge. In 1996, The Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), India, New Delhi requested the USPTO to revoke the turmeric patent on the grounds of existing of prior art.

When challenged, the University of Mississippi decided not to pursue the case and transferred the rights to the inventors, two expatriate Indians, Suman K. Das and Hari Har P. Cohly, who filed a response. They pleaded that turmeric powder and paste had different physical properties. In November 1997, the U.S. Patent and Trademarks Office (USPTO) examiner rejected all claims. This was the first time that a patent based on traditional knowledge of a developing country was challenged successfully. The problem lies with the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) system, under the World Trade Organization (WTO). At the end of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations in 1994, IPRs were regulated worldwide under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The system was designed for inventions which are formal, such as those carried out in universities and laboratories, or as part of industrial R&D. As of now, the WTO does not recognize technology innovations by farmers, artisans or grassroot innovators, which happen in an informal setup. These form a large part of traditional knowledge. When the U.S. introduced IPRs, it accused the Third World of “piracy.” The U.S. official stance estimated that royalties lost in agricultural chemicals was $202 million and about $2.5 billion for pharmaceuticals. However, the Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI), in Canada has shown that if the contributions of Third World rurals and tribals are taken into account, the roles are dramatically reversed, they estimated: the U.S. owes $302 million in royalties for agriculture and about $5.1 billion for pharmaceuticals to Third World countries. Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy. It uses the tools of information technology and a new classification system to make available traditional medical knowledge to patent offices in developed countries, so that what was known for centuries is not patented by individuals, companies and research organizations as something they claim to have discovered or invented by themselves.

And, the “licensed facility shall irradiate all pharmaceutical-grade cannabis … before delivering that pharmaceutical-grade cannabis to another person.” Patients and caregivers enrolled in the state’s medical marijuana program, enacted by voters in 2008, would still be allowed to grow and possess medical marijuana under current state law. Those who want the “pharmaceutical grade” medical marijuana would have to surrender their existing medical marijuana cards and could no longer grow their own. In May 2012 the law signed by Connecticut’s Governor Dannel Malloy, requires a licensed pharmacist on site to dispense cannabis. And interestingly enough in both states, there has been much bureaucratic foot-dragging and political problems in establishing their quasi-legal medical marijuana dispensaries that still conflict with federal law. Plus there is the federal hindering of financial and other operational aspects of a now “legal” business. Stalling for time? But isn’t the game over, with Colorado and Washington legalizing recreational use of cannabis? Or could the federal government try to put the genie back in the bottle? Trumping the people’s will and actions for freedom, in favor of overreaching governmental control and profit for commercial interests? In addition to improved breeding and the rediscovery of sinsemilla, the movement towards indoor cultivation has also allowed the application of greenhouse technology to what had traditionally been a field crop.106 Around 1985, some cannabis breeders from the United States fled for a country with more amenable drug policies – the Netherlands. At the time, indoor cultivation of cannabis was just starting to take off in the Netherlands,107 and the fusion of American breeding stock and Dutch agricultural practice sparked a revolution in cannabis breeding and production.108 Today, Dutch ‘seed banks’ sell the product of this breeding over the Internet.… There have also been a number of technological innovations that have lost currency.

The use of carbon dioxide enriched environments to boost yields has largely been abandoned, due to the greater importance of good air circulation in the hot and humid environment of an indoor grow. The use of ‘feminised’ seeds, produced from hermaphroditic mothers, has also lost popularity, as the risk of further hermaphrodites (and thus pollen contamination) is a threat, and it is much easier to work with female clones. Here the UN outlines two frauds, feminized seeds, and the use of CO2 in indoor grows. Parts of the cannabis industry have bilked the consumer for decades through a strong influence, large advertising dollars, in the marijuana magazines. For over thirty years “zombie” growers have been using CO2 in grow rooms, which only created atmosphere for bugs, mold and mildew, which of course the industry created products for. Cannabis is a dioecious plant, having the male and female reproductive organs in separate individuals. So when you feminize seed with chemicals, the males become females the females become males, you still have to sex them, and they are now sexually confused plants. They never reach their true potential. This is applying Monsanto technology to cannabis seed in the hopes of making everyone a seed junkie: one seed, one plant. As well as lowering the overall quality – the plants are sterile. Folks complain that the weed today gets them high for about 30 minutes, looks great, smells great, but no bang for your buck. Take 100 naturally occurring seeds: half you grow out normally separating the males from the females, the other half you feminize chemically, but you still have to sex them. When you grow the females out using the same nutrients and following same growing procedures, the naturally-grown seed produces finer, stronger cannabis, with anywhere between 30 − 50% more quantity and THC, with a longer lasting effect. I tried to publish an article showing these test results but no magazine would touch it, I think because of Dutch marketing influence. They sell these seeds as 100% female, but you still have to sex them – separate the males from ladies? Are people that stupid? No, they have been brainwashed; logic has nothing to do with it. Abstract Twenty-five sets of F1 hybrids [an F1 hybrid means the plants grown from the seed of a cross pollination between types], mainly between “drug strains” of Cannabis (those in which the resin is chiefly of tetrahydrocannabinol[THC]) and “non-drug strains” (those in which the resin is composed chiefly of cannabidiol [CBD]) were examined.

The majority of these were chemically intermediate between their respective parents, showing no dominance toward either parent. We know, then, that the first generation has been degraded by half. If that “mixed-blood” seed is grown hidden again among hemp plants that will again provide the pollen, then the next generation will again lose by half, gradually by this means (it’s called a “backcross” by plant breeders) converging toward the hemp type. But it is unlikely it would get that far, as the material would be undesirable after the first contamination. This is why marijuana growers want to stay away from hemp and an example how the Dutch marketing scam lowers the quality of weed using hype advertising in High Times, Skunk magazine, Treating Yourself, and others. Lowering the quality across the U.S., ruining crops due to hermaphrodites, which seed your crop. Dronkers owns multiple seed banks, including the venerable Sensi-Seeds. Advertising in the trade magazines, many simply sell the same seeds, but with different names. A bulk of the “Dutch” seeds are produced in Spain. Ironically, there is a museum in Barcelona promoting the Dutch way, when cannabis was first introduced into Spain by the Phoenicians 1500-300 BC. It’s as if the Dutch declared a year zero for cannabis, and everything since 1990 has been the Dutch way, with the guiding hands of David Watson and Robert C. Clarke. Clarke stays the academic, while Watson has three personalities: outlaw grower, scientist, and licensed DEA cannabis grow facility owner. With Ed Rosenthal and James Goodwin aka Mel Frank as the industry’s grow-guru gnomes Worldwide, the cannabis industry has been dumbed down, taught “learning curves” for profit that make no horticultural sense. Thirty years of cannabis grow books later, and you have a generation of zombie growers, who have been taught wrong techniques: ones that artificially inflate the price of cannabis. When Colorado opened up, the Dutch were there teaching their methods. If you go today, most every infusion company in Colorado is using the bag resin-extraction technique, which destroys trichomes and dilutes the final product. They market their products as medicine, when much of the medicine has been lost in the process. textbook for Oaksterdam University.

Funny is listening to Oaksterdam Graduates talk so knowledgeable about growing cannabis, when they were never taught photoperiodic control, which is taught in first-year Horticulture 101, standard practice in flower industry for 150 years. In many plant species, the duration of the daily exposure to light (photoperiod) provides cues that help adjust flowering time. In the U.S., indoor grows use $6 billion in energy consumption yearly. Over the course of 30 years that comes to $180 billion. If photoperiodic control would have been taught, that thirty year energy consumption would have been only $45 billion. The other $135 billion could have stayed in growers’ and consumers’ pockets, and that’s just in the U.S. Growers and consumers were taxed and they did not even know it. Fewer hours of lighting are required if the dark period is interrupted in the middle of the night. The light break in the middle of the night restores pfr phytochrome level, and since neither of the two dark periods before or after light break is very long, the pfr level does not diminish sufficiently to permit flowering. Properly lit plants stay in vegetative state, and grow bigger and better with tight nodes. This is according to Nelson’s Greenhouse Operation & Management, a college horticulture text book. In Southern Oregon growers using 18/6 [18 hours light/6 hours dark]schedule in their greenhouses were using as many as ten 1,000 watt light bulbs in a 1,000 square foot greenhouse to replicate the schedule promoted by Rosenthal and others, when all they needed was a 250-watt light bulb to interrupt the dark period for one hour, which keeps the plants in vegetative state. Electric bills of one thousand dollars monthly, and the greenhouse stood out like infra-red beacons, shining night and day for law enforcement. That is why I call these folks zombie growers. They slovenly follow Rosenthal, Jorge Cervantes, and every grow book written in the past 30 years, without ever picking up a true horticulture book. If agricultural businesses went by the cannabis industry’s grow books, your Mother’s Day bouquet would cost you $3000 , and a hothouse tomato would cost $100 a pound to produce. This type of advice has artificially inflated the price of can- Most experts describe Cannabis as a short day plant. It flowers in the autumn, when the photoperiod drops below 12-13 hours per day, depending on the variety and its geographical origin.

Using photoperiodic control you can easily cut five hours of electricity consumption, and with other photoperiodic control techniques even more. It cuts down on the vegetative cycle. Your plants grow bigger faster, and using the times of 10 hours on/14 hours off, they go into flower immediately. Your plants are happier and use less nutrients. It cuts your production costs 75 − 90% . An example of a zombie grower: A young stoner bragging about the feminized seeds he bought in Holland, 100% female seeds. After he sexed them? He got 45 females and 55 males, when I pointed out that the seeds were not 100% female, he screamed at me and showed me the packaging that stated 100% female, though he admittedly got 45 females and 55 males? Logic never came into the picture. Jorge Cervantes is a pseudonym for George Van Patten, a Pied Piper of misinformation. His whole chapter on making hashish is complete hype, all it does is sell nylon bags. Major players in the industry, know that generations born after 1990 would not know what real hashish was, nor was it possible for them to travel the hippie hash trail to see how hash was made traditionally. A new product was created called bubble hash, based on Delp’s Ice-Water The industry uses folks like Van Patten/Jorge Cervantes to spread misinformation translated in every major language. Van Patten also calls himself a horticulturist, yet has left photoperiodic control out of his grow books, though it is taught in first year horticultural courses and has been standard practice in nursery and green houses since the 19th century. Again, the power companies get six billion yearly from indoor-grow power consumption in the U.S. alone, meanwhile, they lit every grower up like Christmas trees for law enforcement. That is how the industry serves the drug war, on the backs of people who believed that were being told the truth by the marijuana magazines.

I started a “12- 1” campaign on Facebook, and the system took off like wildfire. Almost all the grow books state you need at least fourteen hours of light to keep a cannabis plant in vegetative state, my article showed how to keep the plants in this state using thirteen hours, then seven hours, and then I kept them in vegetative state using four hours. It made every grow book ever written wrong. Rosenthal on Facebook called it a theory. As I have stated before photoperiodic control is taught in first year horticulture classes. It is standard practice in nurseries and across the spectrum of agriculture. Rosenthal is not a horticulturist. Zombie growers who follow Rosenthal think him a hero, while he takes them to the cleaners. Nobody has promoted the hype more than Ed Rosenthal. He sold our American cannabis culture to the Dutch, and they sell it back to us. There should also be a statue for President Reagan in Amsterdam, because without his drug policies, the Dutch would not be making an estimated $3.2 billion annually from the cannabis tourist trade. The irony being: Reagan’s nickname was “Dutch.” At the 1997 High Times Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, theintroduction of Reinhard Delp’s innovative Ice-Water Ex- traction was an historic event that was soon shunted aside by interested parties. Delp had arrived in Amsterdam in early November. Just weeks earlier in the middle of September, Watson and Clarke’s HortaPharm had lost its license, but was still operating under circumstances that “cannot yet be made public.” And then eight months later in July of 1998, the “details [were] released of collaboration between GW Pharmaceuticals and HortaPharm.” During summer ’97, a friend was visiting from Amsterdam with his wife and their toddler son. We made the decision to introduce the Ice-Water-Method in Amsterdam. I designed an automatic application, the Xtractor to better demonstrate the method and make it more transparent than the bucket-mixer method I was using before. Mila/Pollinator Co., known to my friend, seemed to be the obvious partner, since they already offered tumblers.… Mila was initially excited about the project and we prepared the introduction together. I prepared the “Xtractor $4 2 0 ^ { \\it n }$ instructions, graph and the “Millennium news” flyer with the help of freelancing graph artist in Amsterdam, borrowed 25k $ $ $ from an American living in Amsterdam, who I introduced to Mila and arranged a 5% fee from the XTR sales from Mila to him for the loan.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt:46:936331b0c5d8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2785, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584146", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 47, "text": "obvious partner, since they already offered tumblers.… Mila was initially excited about the project and we prepared the introduction together.

A small metal company in Zlin, Czech Republic … was to manufacture the first 50 XTR 420, a stainless version in a lockable wood box. I used a simpler prototype, metal stand and plastic bucket housing for the nightly demonstrations I gave at the Heerengracht before and during the Cup. My friend informed me about a request to license the method by an English party. They wanted me to demonstrate the method in a comparison test with a Pollinator. I luckily got a hold of some U.S. surplus top loader washing machines in Germany, and the test was performed in a farm house close to Amsterdam. I yielded more total yield than the tumbler, and only the first ten percent of the dry sifting result was comparable to the “all bubbles” result from the washer. A meeting was arranged by my friend, and the English party told me that I would never have to work again, if I gave an exclusive license. Not only did I stick to the contract with Mila, but I came to Amsterdam to publish to the public, and did not want the method to disappear with a pharmaceutical company. After that, at the end of the Cup week, my friend told me that some guy asked for a meeting with me. We went to a flat to meet … the “guy from HortaPharm.” He demanded not to publish (“We can not publish that.”) and to my question, “Why?” He answered “It is too strong to handle for the people.” [Emphasis not in original] The ice-water extraction method created a new world for scientists by separating the terpene (essential) oils from the resin glands of the cannabis plant. The very process by which GW Pharmaceuticals produces their enriched trichome preparation (ETP), from which they make Sativex and other products. Watson claims to have helped with development of Jansen’s Ice-O-Lator two-bag system, who was under contract with Delp. This began the confusion. So in the end, the quality was reduced to the consumer.

Reinhard Delp was fully aware of the potential of his ice-water method, and the impact its publishing would have. As a California resident he was legally able to use his method with cannabis after the passing in November 1996 of Proposition 215. His intention always was to make his invention available to the public, using the “public” 1997 Cannabis Cup for the introduction. Delp retired from the rat race around the globe in the early eighties, at a time when Amsterdam became a metropolis of snitches, where everything goes, but nothing happens without the man. Amsterdam got too heavy. It was a time of “personal, monetary incentives” for law enforcement. As the Dutch “redistribution scandal” in the nineties finally revealed, Netherlands had become the European hub for confiscated contraband: heroin to supply snitches, hash to re-brand and redistribute. Nothing was left to waste. Free-booting smugglers were lured into traps, lucky to get away with their life. At the 1997 Cannabis Cup, Hager called Delp the “man of the hour” for his invention. The following year, the ’98 Cup, Jansen was rolled out as the inventor of the ice-water method. Delp had been pushed aside. His U.S. patent was granted in 2000, but knockoffs were coming into the States from Canada and Europe. Jansen and GW Pharmaceuticals received government grants and legal support from their respective governments. The Dutch government soon was requiring the coffee shops to categorize “Ice Hash” separately for tax filing. GW developed a contractual relationship with Bayer. High Times and other magazines appeared to support the fraud. Pretentious bag salesmen like Bubbleman appeared everywhere, each with its own media blitz. The solvent free method is based on the specific condition of plant resins and the carrier plant material. While in ice water resins solidify and become brittle, the “contaminating” plant material becomes flexible (dry material after soaking) and stays intact. Besides Hops, the method has excellent results with a variety of plant resins. It became already the dominating method for personal medical use in the field of Hemp use, and is very successful extracting the “oily coating” of Yerba Santa and other “tar weeds.” Dr. Guy said, “There is a considerable body of evidence to suggest that cannabis may have a number of medicinal uses: for the relief of pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis; for pain relief in other neurological disorders, such", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt:48:da43ec035af9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2787, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584146", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584146_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 49, "text": "method has excellent results with a variety of plant resins.

But there have been very few systematic re- The licenses have been issued to enable a full pharmaceutical research programme to be undertaken. In the event of a Product License being granted for a cannabis-based medicine, the Home Office would be very willing to come forward with a change in the controls of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 to allow the prescribing of such a medicine. There has been much debate about the possible medical use of marijuana for certain conditions, including nausea relief for cancer chemotherapy patients and boosting appetite in people with AIDS. Currently, 20 states have legalized smoked marijuana for medical purposes, but the FDA, which assesses the safety and effectiveness of medications, has not approved marijuana as a medicine. There have not been enough largescale clinical trials showing that smoked marijuana’s benefits outweigh its many potential health risks in patients with the symptoms it is meant to treat. Also, to be considered a legitimate medicine, a substance must have well-defined and measurable ingredients that are consistent from one unit (such as a pill or injection) to the next. In addition to THC, the marijuana leaf contains over 400 other chemical compounds, which may have different effects in the body and which vary from plant to plant. This makes it difficult to consider its use as a medicine even if some of marijuana’s specific ingredients may offer benefits. However, THC itself is an FDA-approved medication. Medicines now on the market deliver the benefits of THC without the dangers and unpredictability of smoking marijuana. Scientists continue to investigate the medicinal properties of THC and other cannabinoids to better evaluate and harness their ability to help patients suffering from a broad range of conditions, while avoiding the negative effects of smoked marijuana.

London, UK, January 14, 2014: GW Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: GWPH, AIM: GWP, “GW” or the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform, announced today the closing of its previously announced follow-on offering on the NASDAQ Global Market of 2,441,110 American Depositary Shares (ADSs) and the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 366,165 additional ADSs at a price of $36.00 per ADS raising gross proceeds of $101.1 million (before deducting underwriting discount, commissions and offering expenses). London, UK; 28 April 2014: GW Pharmaceuticals plc, a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform, today announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to Sativex® for the treatment of pain in patients with advanced cancer, who experience inadequate analgesia during optimized chronic opioid therapy. Sativex is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials for this indication. FDA’s Fast Track program facilitates the development of drugs intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions and that have the potential to address unmet medical needs. A drug program with Fast Track status is afforded greater access to the FDA for the purpose of expediting the drug’s development, review and potential approval. According to 2010 study by a British treatment advisory group, the mean cost of Sativex® per patient is estimated at over $6, 000 per year, and this does not include medical appointments or the cost of any unsuccessful medical trials. And Sativex has its problems: its alcohol base has led to the development of painful lesions in the mouth. Delp started an infringement case in Canada despite a warning from the opposing lawyers referring to the deep pockets of their clients.

And no news articles have appeared in the marijuana press. n the ’60s and ’70s water hash was produced in Afghanistan. These hand rolled patties, were processed using the icy water coming from the Hindu Kush mountains. The farmers would process the cannabis traditionally, separating the resin glands from the plant matter, and then would wash the resin glands in ice-cold water which removed the chlorophyll and any plant matter left. The resin may have started green, but after this process it was golden. This they dried and then hand rolled into patties and further dried. It was dynamite, but sometimes it came with a white mold on the outside. This was the first Afghani I saw in New York, 1968- 1969. In 1973 I was working the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. I was living in the Tribal Zone with my connection Abdul Gaffur Khan. Since the overthrow of the King, Afghan farmers and dealers moved into the Pakistani Tribal area. For a higher price, I could buy Afghan resin. Anyway I kept a room at Jahn’s hotel, and one day I heard my Danish smuggler friends were staying at the Hotel Kyber, so I went to visit. They had some hand-pressed hash, and we took a smoke together. I noticed on the windowsill there was a glass filled with water and resin. My friend explained that they took the over-processed green resin in a glass of ice water, stirred it, and let it sit. The plant matter would float on top and the resin would collect on the bottom. He then skimmed the top and removed whatever plant matter was floating there, then he would pour it through nylon cloth and, wringing out the water, he was now left with a golden ball of hash, which he dried in the hot sun, and then hand pressed for smoking. Who knows how long this technique was used in Central Asia. It’s obviously part of Chinese pharmacopoeia, which separated the resin glands from the plant as medicine over 5000 years ago. Same in Indian Ayurvedic medicine, a practice thousands of years old. They have been using hashish as an anti-spasmodic for thousands of years; they have used cannabis to induce appetite in humans and animals for thousands of years; they have been using hashish for migraine headaches for thousands of years; for pain thousands of years; the list goes on and on.

Recently a report came out about the effectiveness of cannabis in combination with morphine when treating pain, as if some new discovery. Reality: they were selling cannabis-morphine mixtures for pain 150 years ago. If you think that O’Shaugnessy invented and was the first to create cannabis tincture and market it, you are wrong, Doctors of Ayurveda have been making tinctures as medicine for thousands of years. Instead of using food grade glycerin as I use today, they used honey. This knowledge that O’Shaugnessy got in India, he applied to British pharmacopoeia. How can they patent genetics or techniques that has been public information for thousands of years? It blows my mind that Mexico, Colombia or Afghanistan have not moved against GW Pharmaceuticals, since the genetics for Sativex came from those countries. How can some Dutch national register Thai genetics, or Afghani? The DEA is the pharmaceutical industries Gestapo? It really upsets me when folks today claim that the cannabis of today is stronger than weed from back in the day. First of all, the analysis today is completely different from 50 years ago, when they ground up seeds and stems as well as the bud to test. Today you can take 1 gram samples from the same larger bud, take them to three different labs, and guess what? You get three different results. I wish I could debate Patrick J. Kennedy when he states the pot of today is not your grandfathers pot, what a crock. You wish you could smoke a Thai stick, or Hawaiian, or mountain-grown Mexican sinsemilla, which was grown organically and as good as it gets. The coffee shop weed they sell as medicine is a joke. It smells great, tastes great, beautiful flavor, great bag appeal, but only gets you high for 30 minutes. I remember a friend thinking I had dosed him with LSD after smoking his first Thai, or Colombian Gold that got us so high with laughter and joy, that the only thing that could bring us down was Chinese food, and even then we were still high. Today it all tastes the same. Back in the day every producing country had its own flavors, taste and high, but cannabis has been homogenized.

Washington state legalized in December 2013 and within a few months had received thousands of applications for grow licenses. Wall street investors came and applied for 30, 000sq foot licenses, invested in warehouses, equipment, the whole nine yards, but they never took into account the number of applications submitted. Washington took everyone’s dough, issued licenses to all eligible applicants, then re-divided the amount of grow space issued per license. So the Wall Street boys who built facilities for 30,000 square feet were only licensed for 21,000 square feet. Oh well they have money to burn anyway. Hopefully they have learned the most important lesson: when it comes to cannabis anything that can go wrong usually does. What? Prohibition and its effects. Surprisingly, back in the day, if you flew in from India, or any other cannabis producing country, you got special attention at U.S. Customs when you entered. Today it’s having Oregon, Colorado, or California license plates in Texas or Louisiana, or any number of states where draconian laws still apply. While prohibition goes through its death throes in the U.S., the drug war rages in Asia and around the globe. The DEA has trained law enforcement everywhere but North Korea, all the while the pharmaceutical industry patents the original genetics that came from these very countries. In Asia cannabis has been, and is still, used as medicine, food, cloth, oil, thousands of years before written history. It’s nothing new that cannabis can cure migraine headaches, improve appetite, heal pain. My hope is that this book wakes up these countries to the enormous fraud perpetrated on their societies. Growers and consumers are taxed by the status quo at the artificially inflated price of cannabis, caused by 30 years of skewed grow books and misinformation by the tightly controlled cannabis media to the tune of over a trillion dollars, and they did not even know it.

Anyone over the age of eighteen and registered in Uruguay’s countrywide database is allowed to purchase marijuana over the counter. There are limits to how much an individual or group can grow and buy every month. Uruguay’s government-grown pot isn’t available until the end of 2014, so the genetically marked plants were not on the market when the government released its official rules and regulations for the legal industry at the end of April. They allow growers to have “illegal” plants as long as they’re registered with the national database. Uruguay’s track and regulation systems are far more comprehensive than either Washington’s or Colorado’s, the only two U.S. states to legalize recreational marijuana. Granted, Uruguay’s legal marijuana system as a whole is more comprehensive. Colorado currently has a similar radio-frequency tracking system for its commercial marijuana, and Washington plans for a system that tracks it from seed-to-sale. Neither Washington nor Colorado requires home growers to register their marijuana though, and Uruguay is the only authority that wants to ensure its citizens are smoking only legal marijuana. Colorado and Washington stop tracking pot at the sale, but Uruguay’s genetically marked marijuana would make it possible to determine if any sample of marijuana originated from legal marketplaces. Marijuana has been associated with humankind for millennia. It has been used both spiritually and recreationally, plus as food, medicine, cloth, and scores of industrial uses. Jack Herer’s wonderful book, The Emperor Wears No Clothes, brought to our attention the political and commercial shenanigans behind pot’s prohibition. This prohibition has had nothing to do with our health, our children or our communities. It has been about keeping cannabis out of the legal marketplace, and the creation of a black market that allows “forces in the shadows” to sell plants, often for more than gold. This has created slush funds that have led to an untoward influence over our civic, commercial and personal concerns. In Pakistan, I was swept up at a hotel, along with other independent smugglers, one of whom then tried to dump his multiple-runner load on me. He told the police that his loads were mine, and informed them that I was an American fugitive. I had been traveling under a British passport. I told the truth of the matter, including about another load that the smuggler who had informed on me had running. He got out of jail on bond and split.

In 1995 I was invited to debate at the University of Miami on medical marijuana by friends who owned a head shop locally. The panel consisted of me, Todd McCormick, Elvy Musika, Irwin Rosenfeld, and a DEA spokesperson Wayne Zucker. I was seated next to the DEA. I had just been spit out of the Gulag, having been brought back from Laos, where I had been held by DEA, who didn’t bring me back until after a civil forfeiture trial in Denver, where I lost everything, even though I had proven that I had made my money legally. But since I was a disenfranchised fugitive, they took everything anyway. I was in Asia when the change was made from the Golden Triangle to the Golden Crescent. I saw them destroy cannabis cultures all across South and Southeast Asia. Countries where cannabis had been legal, where there was no market for hard drugs. There was no such thing as a Nepalese or Afghani junkie. Countries were paid off to change their laws. The last country to do so, where cannabis had been sold openly at the farmers markets was Laos. They opened a U.S. embassy after seventeen-and-a-half years, around the same time that they handed me over to U.S. Customs in 1992. They had no case against me, so charges were later dropped, but all I was left with was two sticks to rub together. There’s somethin’ happenin’ here cheaper than when I was the age of the college students attending? I was his worst nightmare, as I was drug war veteran. I was roundly applauded more than once. DEA agent Wayne Zucker steamed. Little did I know that fifteen years later, a picture of me sitting next to him, taken of that debate by McCormick, would be used to call me a DEA puppet. That is one of the ways they have attacked me, trying to kill my voice. I have been public about my concerns since 2006, and the more I look, the more I find.

Something is going on. [Uruguay President] Mujica said “it’s a complete fiction what they do in Colorado,” which licenses marijuana sellers and producers but allows any adult to buy up to 28 grams at a time. In Uruguay, consumers must be licensed as well, and each purchase will be tracked to ensure they buy no more than 10 grams a week. As an “industry” friend of mine said: The cannabis economy is a pre-determined market and it is led, while hiding economic transformation from those that participate in that market.

I marveled at the striking similarities between our cases, and I empathized with her dire circumstances. On Larry King Live, Ms. Palfrey dispensed a warning to Americans about their corrupt political system: “ … think about it a bit, and you’ll come to the conclusion that we have come to. That there are possible people who have used the service who have become the subjects and targets of blackmail … ” I’m uncertain if Ms. Palfrey witnessed the blackmailing of politicians first-hand, but I was certainly privy to the blackmailing of politicians and sundry powerbrokers. If the Department of Justice, the Secret Service, and the Washington Post had not been fixated on covering up the facts and individuals enmeshed in my case, Americans would have learned the unsavory truth that blackmail is endemic to their political system. The sexual escapades of the D.C. elite are vastly different than the infidelities of the average citizen—thus their susceptibility to blackmail. Before Ms. Palfrey’s trial, she imparted flurries of sound bites to the media intimating that she was the custodian of too many secrets, and the government would be unlocking a Pandora’s Box if it prosecuted her. “I am sure as heck am not going to be going to federal prison for one day, let alone, you know, four to eight years here, because I’m shy about bringing in the deputy secretary of whatever,” Palfrey told ABC. “Not for a second. I’ll bring every last one of them in if necessary.” I, like Ms. Palfrey, thought that the secrets I had amassed over the years would discourage the government from prosecuting me. After the Secret Service’s initial raid and ransacking of my home, and prior to being indicted, I remarked to a reporter: “Somebody set us up because they were scared about what we knew about high government officials…. And anyways, if they do try to indict me, I’ll have some good stories to tell.” I was a mere 29 years old when I dispensed that quote, and, regrettably, I had the aplomb and inexperience of youth, which is an extremely flawed tandem when locking horns with the federal government. I woefully underestimated the ruthlessness and absolute power of my adversary. Ms. Palfrey followed through on her threat and attempted to unfurl her secrets: She presented ABC News with forty-three pounds of printed pages that contained the phone numbers of the thousands of johns who frequented her escort service over the years. Ms. Palfrey had no idea of the names accompanying the vast majority of the phone numbers, and she hoped that ABC would decipher that information.

She felt that the potentially pyrokinetic scoop she handed to ABC would force the government on the defensive and impede its zealous crusade to imprison her. But her counter-offensive spectacularly backfired: ABC refused to follow through on the revelations contained in the 43-pound printout. ABC correspondent Brian Ross announced that “based on our reporting, it turned out not to be as newsworthy as we thought in terms of the names,” even though it would emerge that Palfrey’s patrons included, for starters, a U.S. Senator, a Department of Defense consultant who developed the “shock and awe” doctrine deployed on Iraq, and State Department official Randall Tobias. In a stunning demonstration of hypocrisy, Tobias was the Agency for International Development’s Director of Foreign Assistance, and he managed agencies that required the foreign recipients of AIDS assistance to condemn prostitution. The federal government subjected both Ms. Palfrey and me to crucible that was designed to ensure our silence—or ultimately crush us. “They just destroy you on every level—financially, emotionally, psychologically,” Ms. Palfrey reportedly said of federal prosecutors. In the case of Ms. Palfrey, the U.S. Attorney for the District of D.C. smacked her with a 14-count RICO indictment that included money laundering, racketeering, and using the mail for illegal purposes in connection with a prostitution ring, and she was facing a bewildering fifty-five years behind bars. RICO is an acronym for the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and it was originally designed to dismantle the Mafia, as RICO allows for mob bosses to be I, too, was merely running an escort service, but the U.S. Attorney for the District of D.C. walloped me with a 43-count RICO indictment. I was potentially staring at 295 years behind bars! I was also looking at the possibility of a two million dollar fine, and, as I’ve previously mentioned, the feds were threatening to indict my mother. Although my case and Ms. Palfrey’s share numerous parallels, a major point of divergence is the proficiency of our respective attorneys. D.C.-based attorney Montgomery Sibley represented Ms. Palfrey and Greta Van Susteren represented me. Mr. Sibley vigorously defended Ms. Palfrey, but he had to contend with the feds judicial chicanery and sleight-of-hand. Ms. Palfrey’s initial trial judge had authorized Mr. Sibley’s subpoenas of the White House, State Department, CIA, etc., and he also authorized subpoenas for AT&T Mobility, Sprint/Nextel, T-Mobile USA, and Alltel, which would have mandated those carriers to provide Ms. Palfrey with the names and addresses of the individuals who contacted her escort service.

Inexplicably, Ms. Palfrey’s initial trial judge was replaced by a judge who quashed Mr. Sibley’s subpoenas en masse, and thereby eviscerated the defense’s case. At the outset of my case, my attorney, Greta Van Susteren, seemed very committed to a vigorous defense on my behalf, and she deployed a nearly identical tactic as Mr. Sibley—she filed an eleven-page motion to mandate the release of my clientele list that the government had previously seized from me. Ms. Van Susteren argued that the names of my patrons should be released, because, if the government’s assertion was accurate and my “escort” service was, in actuality, a prostitution ring, my clients aided and abetted a criminal enterprise. But the Assistant U.S. Attorney for D.C. vehemently contested Ms. Van Susteren’s motion with a remarkably disingenuous argument: He contended that the names of my patrons shouldn’t be made public, because the U.S. Attorney’s office feared the “intimidation of government witnesses due to the embarrassing nature of the case.” My trial judge sided with the prosecution and barred the public disclosure of my clientele. After my trial judge acquiesced to the U.S. Attorney’s office, Ms. Van Susteren started to change her tune, and she urged me to take the government’s plea bargain. By then, my family and I had been subjected to a relentless campaign of terror, and I faced life in prison—I felt as if the feds were wielding the Sword of Damocles over my head. At Ms. Van Susteren’s behest, I accepted the government’s plea bargain, and I was sentenced to 63 months in federal prison. The feds also included a caveat that wasn’t overtly stated in my plea agreement: My 5-year sentence was based on the contingency that I not divulge a word about the particulars of my case to the media. Although I’m uncertain whether or not it’s a mere coincidence, I should point out that the individuals who were instrumental in the cover up of my case experienced significant upward mobility: Ms. Van Susteren now has her very own television show on FOX, and the U.S. Attorney for the District of D.C., who imprisoned me and ensured my silence, is now a Vice President of the Raytheon Corporation, one of the world’s largest defense contactors.

As Ms. Palfrey awaited sentencing, she purportedly committed suicide. Ms. Palfrey’s death is mired in conjecture, rumor, and innuendo, and the Internet is rife with speculation that Ms. Palfrey’s suicide was indeed a murder. an Orlando affiliate of CBS interviewed the building manager of the Park Lake Towers in Orlando, where Ms. Palfrey owned a condo. The building manager disclosed that he had talked to Ms. Palfrey just three days before her lifeless body was found in her mother’s aluminum shed. “Jeane Palfrey was a class act,” said the building manager. “Her way out of this world certainly would not have been in an aluminum shed attached to a mobile home in Tarpon Springs, Florida.” The manager also discussed a disturbing conversation he had with Ms. Palfrey: “She insinuated that there is a contract out for her, and I fully believe they succeeded.” The Washington Post was quick to declare that Palfrey had taken her own life—despite the possibility of indications to the contrary. I mention the latter point because the Washington Post reported a myriad of details about my case that were inaccurate—despite the possibility of indications to the contrary—or solely based on the word of federal law enforcement officials. Although I’m unwilling to speculate whether or not the death of Ms. Palfrey was a suicide or a murder, I feared for my life when I was a D.C. madam due to the threats discharged by government officials and also by individuals who were reportedly affiliated with the government. As Ms. Palfrey and I regrettably discovered, Americans have a collective naiveté about D.C. sex scandals, believing that they are the mere dalliances and moral failings of a handful of individuals. Americans have great difficulty accepting that many of our politicians are endowed with a potent alchemy of power, arrogance, and lust—an alchemy that fluently translates into extramarital affairs or illicit sexual encounters. Unfortunately, the federal government has a greater dexterity to cover up scandals and crimes that lend themselves to blackmail in D.C. due to the fact that the capital’s law enforcement is exclusively controlled by various branches of the federal government: The U.S. Attorney for D.C., who prosecutes all D.C. crimes, is appointed by the president. The FBI and Secret Service are also minions of the executive branch, and Congress controls the budget of D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department.

I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that the D.C. press corps played an integral role in the cover up surrounding my case. I’ve already alluded to the fact that the Washington Post aided and abetted the cover up of my case by tainting its reportage with the government’s top-spin, but the Washington Post was by no means the only media outlet that covered up the factual circumstances of my case: Perhaps a number of the high-flyers in the D.C. press corps aren’t mindful of the blackmail that has usurped the American political process, but I’m also aware of nationally recognized pundits who are potentially compromised themselves—because they were patrons of my escort service. I initially thought that if I adhered to the Faustian pact I made with the government and remained mute about the feds’ labyrinth of lies and served my time, I would be permitted to live out the balance of my life in peace, but the government and media have continued to persecute me. Bloggers on the Internet have also taken their queue from the government and the media, and the Internet is rife with lies about me too. Although I’ve transformed myself into a legitimate and very successful businessman, and I am a poster boy for a reformed felon, I’ve been inexorably stalked by a wayward federal judiciary, and a pernicious 20-year assault on my character. Consequently, I have finally decided to rupture my silence and expose the illicit skullduggery I witnessed as a D.C. madam, and also the Byzantine machinations that the government fabricated to ensure my silence and incarcerate me. wenty-nine years before I was christened the “D.C. madam,” I was born in South Williamson, Kentucky, at the Appalachian Regional Hospital on November 27, 1960. My parents, Charles and Joyce Vinson, lived in Nolan, West Virginia, a tiny hamlet nestled in a remote southwest corner of the state. Nolan was built along the banks of the meandering Tug Fork River, which divides West Virginia’s Mingo County and Kentucky’s Pike County. Topographically, downtown Nolan was a linear spattering of two-dozen buildings that were wedged among besieging poplars, sugar maples, red maples, white oaks, and red oaks. Like scores of towns sprinkled throughout the rolling and dense woodlands of West Virginia, Nolan emerged because of the booming coal industry of the 1800s and 1900s. The Norfolk and Western Railway cuts right through Nolan, and thundering trains, laden with coal, were a constant presence in my childhood.

The Norfolk and Western Railway cuts right through Nolan, and thundering trains, laden with coal, were a constant presence in my childhood. Of the thousands of cities and towns scattered throughout the United States, Nolan, West Virginia, seems an improbable candidate to nurture a D.C. madam. Nolan, after all, is in the heart of Appalachia, and the Tug Fork River was the legendary divide between the feuding Hatfields and McCoys. Growing up gay in Appalachia in the 1960s was like being banished to one of the inner circles of Dante’s inferno. Pop culture has eschewed the theme of homosexuality in Appalachia except for the film Deliverance, which isn’t a very encouraging depiction. My parents met in high school, and they married at the age of seventeen. I was their third and last child. My father, Charles, had five siblings, and the Vinsons were an unruly clan that largely consisted of drunkards and scoundrels. I have a tendency to suspect that many of the Vinson men were endowed with an extra Y chromosome. My paternal great grandfather had been a legendary bootlegger and moonshiner, and my paternal grandfather, Walter, and his brothers inherited his ill begotten largesse. The vestiges of my great grandfather’s spoils trickled down to my father and his brothers. Walter was tall, lean, and he had a thick thatch of unruly black hair that was parted to the right. A life of fighting, drink, and infidelity had carved premature grooves and furrows on his swarthy face, and he had a reputation for being vicious. One of my aunts once stabbed him in the stomach with a knife during a drunken fracas, and then she dutifully drove him to the hospital to be stitched up. Of course, by the time they arrived at the hospital, the deep gash on my grandfather’s belly had been amended to a mere “accident.” In contrast, my mother’s family was deeply religious, and they were devoted churchgoers. My maternal grandfather was a Baptist preacher on Sunday, and a life insurance salesman Monday through Saturday. He was quite industrious, as he insured his flock for not only this world, but also for the hereafter. My maternal grandfather died of a heart attack before I was born, and he was survived by his wife, Bessie Mae, and seven children—my mother, her two sisters, and four brothers. Unlike my father’s siblings, most of mother’s brothers and sisters fled West Virginia at their first opportunity. My mother’s four brothers enlisted in the Army or Marines as teenagers.

My father and mother married in 1950, and they settled into a green, two-story house near Route 52, a two-lane “highway” that was the main thoroughfare skirting the fringes of West Virginia when I was growing up. My parents rickety house was furbished with a minimalistic interior decorating style that was popular in Appalachia circa 1950—second-hand, threadbare furniture. Our house was on a hill overlooking the Tug Fork River and the north end of Nolan, and it offered a view of the toll bridge crossing the Tug Fork River into Kentucky and the railroad yard’s handful of Norfolk and Western My brother, Charles Walter Vinson, Jr., was born in 1951. It had been a foregone conclusion that my brother would be my father’s namesake, but he quickly acquired the nickname of Butch. My brother inherited the tall, dark, and handsome features of the Vinsons, and the thoughtful and considerate personality of my mother’s family. Butch was athletic and popular in school, and the girls flocked to him. My sister, Brenda, was born a year after Butch. She was short and overweight. She had brown hair, brown eyes, and a plump face. Whereas my brother was outgoing and personable, my sister was withdrawn and pensive. I came on the scene about eight years after my sister. I was short, bashful, and overly sensitive with blue eyes and blond hair. My appearance was markedly different than my sister and brother, so, even as a child, I felt out of place in the Vinson household. My father often belted out that I didn’t belong in his family, and my earliest memories of the Vinson household are not particularly favorable. My father and two of his brothers had the mineral rights to a tract of land thirty miles west of Nolan in Kentucky, and, after a day of coal mining, it wasn’t uncommon for him to come home in the evening. His flannel shirt and dungarees would be caked by dirt and soot. His taut face had the razor sharp contours that were the product of a life whetted by rage. He would fester in silence as he poured out a tumbler of vodka. He would then sink into the living room’s green couch, watch TV, preferably professional wrestling, and start swilling vodka. After he took his first slug of vodka, his brows would furrow, and his lips would purse.

After he took his first slug of vodka, his brows would furrow, and his lips would purse. As he became increasing intoxicated, his silent festering would yield to racist rants and hollering at my mother and siblings. In fact, it wasn’t uncommon for him to haul off and punch my mother or brother. By the time of my birth, my siblings had learned that their emotional and physical wellbeing dictated that they make themselves scarce when my father was in the house. It was a lesson that I would quickly learn too. My first dog, Brownie, was not only my first friend, but taking him outside to play offered me a safety outlet to escape my father. Brownie was a mutt of the Heinz 57 variety—he had liver coloring and patches of white around his face. Brownie would be the first of my three dogs that met a premature death on Route 52. When my mother broke the news to me that a truck had hit Brownie, I cried every day for weeks. Brownie’s demise was my childhood’s initial lesson on the impermanence of life, and, as I look back on my life, my childhood was certainly drenched in death. My father had a rather morbid pastime of spending hours listening to a police scanner, and then piling my mother and me into his red pick up truck to ogle the scene of a fatal accident. My brother and sister were spared from this morbid pastime, but my mother grudgingly accompanied him to maintain the peace. My father’s forays to the sites of accidents would often be our Saturday night entertainment, and the next morning my mother and I would invariably attend Nolan Freewill Baptist Church. My father and brother never attended Sunday services, and my sister would occasionally accompany us. Nolan Freewill Baptist Church was a single-story, cinderblock building with a pitched roof. The small church accommodated about fifty congregants, sitting in eight rows of wooden pews, and Pastor Ray Taylor was always at the pulpit. Pastor Taylor was short and stout, and he had thinning white hair, frosty blue eyes, and a spherical face. Pastor Taylor sported blue suits, white shirts, and gray ties. If I described Pastor Taylor as a “preacher,” it would almost be a misnomer—he was a screamer. He was a staccato whirlwind of gesticulations as he shouted the “word” at the congregation.

Pastor Taylor looked as if he were in the midst of an epileptic seizure during his sermons except for the fact that he would often and methodically wipe the sweat from his brow and forehead with a white handkerchief. His zeal was like a current of electricity nettling the congregation, and they would throw their hands into the air and start speaking in tongues. I found Nolan Freewill Baptist Church to be utterly confusing, and the services could last for two or three hours. I envied my father and brother insofar as they were spared from attending Sunday services. My maternal grandmother, Bessie Mae, was an avid churchgoer, but she emanated a rarefied love and compassion that I felt was lacking in the lives of many of the church’s parishioners. She lived a few blocks from us, so I quickly learned to take refuge at her house to flee the tyranny of my father. I visited her almost every day. She was 5’6’’, heavy set, and she had a round, fleshy face. Her gray hair was always tucked into a bun, and she wore black-framed glasses. She had the appearance of an archetypical grandmother, and I was closer to her than I was to my brother and sister. Granma Bessie Mae and I would periodically hop into her white Volkswagen beetle and drive east on Route 52 for ten miles to the great metropolis of Williamson, West Virginia, which had a population of around 8,000 denizens. As a little boy, I was overwhelmed and frightened by Williamson’s swell of people walking on the sidewalks and the cars skirting up and down paved streets—Main Street and Nolan Street were the only paved streets in Nolan. Our sojourns into Williamson would be punctuated by a visit to D.C. Murphy, a five-and-dime store with a soda counter. After Bessie May bought me a malted milkshake at the counter, we would peruse the store’s aquariums that held a variety of fish—I was particularly attracted to the goldfish. Granma Bessie Mae also cleaned Nolan Elementary School at night, and my mother and I often gave her a hand. I remember running through the hallways of the school as if imaginary villains were chasing me. I also avoided my father by wandering over to Uncle Oliver’s store, J.R. Vinson Grocery, which was a half block from our house. Uncle Oliver’s store was an unpainted cinderblock building that had two front windows, and each window had “J.R. Vinson Grocery” in black lettering. The store’s glass paneled front door required a skeleton key.

Uncle Oliver’s store was an unpainted cinderblock building that had two front windows, and each window had “J.R. Vinson Grocery” in black lettering. The store’s glass paneled front door required a skeleton key. Two counters, to the left and right of the front door, stretched the length of the small store. The counter to the left accommodated a cash register and a glass-encased candy rack. Shelves steeped with canned foods were behind the counter to the right. A cooler brimming with bottles of soda and milk was in the back. Uncle Oliver had the swarthy features of the Vinsons, but he was taller than my father, and he also had a hefty paunch. He usually wore plaid shirts, black pants, and black shoes. He had a hunched-over physique as he leisurely shuffled around the store. A Camel straight perpetually dangled from his mouth. Uncle Oliver’s store primarily catered to the impoverished of Nolan, who needed credit to make ends meet from paycheck to paycheck, so he had a large “credit rack” that rested next to the cash register. Whenever he wrote a credit slip, he would set his cigarette on the edge of the counter and wet the pencil tip in his mouth. Uncle Oliver had a personality that was more jocular than his brothers, but he didn’t escape the Vinson curse—drink—and he often called on me to be his gofer. Two or three times a week, I would walk into Nolan, traverse the railroad tracks, and pick up a quart or two of Falls City beer for him at his favorite tavern. When I initially made the beer runs for Uncle Oliver, the trains terrified me. I stood at the railroad crossing awed by trembling ground and the massive locomotive barreling towards me. As the locomotive thundered by me and blasted its deafening horn, my heart pounded against my chest like a jackhammer. The scent of diesel fuel also lingered in the air. At the age of six, I started attending Nolan Elementary School. The school was a three-story cinderblock building, and each grade huddled into a single classroom. My first grade classroom had green walls, unfinished wood floors, and a single window. The dark, dingy room accommodated about forty kids. My first grade teacher, Mrs. Reed, was short and overweight. She had an alabaster face, and a thick mane of black hair. Mrs. Reed looked like she applied her mottled makeup with a trowel, and she wore very bright, red lipstick, which imparted the facial appearance of a circus clown. Mrs. Reed was kind and warm-hearted, but she occasionally remarked that I was “too Mr. Chapman, the principal, was", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:9:036f7f32b9be", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2805, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "a single window.

Mrs. Reed was kind and warm-hearted, but she occasionally remarked that I was “too Mr. Chapman, the principal, was in his mid-fifties, and his pasty white skin was generously sprinkled with freckles. He had thinning gray hair, and a pair of wire-rimmed glasses rested snugly on his stern face. Mr. Chapman was a strict disciplinarian, and he once paddled me for talking in class. He unleashed such a furious flurry of paddles on my rump that it dissuaded me from ever talking in class again. Mr. Chapman also had a rather unusual foible that would ultimately alter the trajectory of my life. Nolan Grade School neighbored Nolan Freewill Baptist Church, and Mr. Chapman had an aversion to memorial services at the church that were sparsely attended. If a memorial service at the church had a shortage of mourners, he would march students into the church, single-file, to fill the vacant pews. So, as a child, I sat through numerous services. M.T. Ball was the funeral director who oversaw the majority of the memorial services. The Ball Funeral Home was located in Williamson, and Mr. Ball was a tall, slender older man who wore impeccable three-piece suits. In addition to being meticulous about his appearance, he was exceptionally soft spoken, polite, and courteous. His mannerisms were gentle and benign, and he had the mental dexterity to stop whatever task he was undertaking and give grieving families his undivided attention. Mr. Ball made bereaved families feel like they were truly the most important people in the world as he comforted them like a warm salve. I had never met anyone quite like M.T. Ball, and the process of death started to fascinate me. All of the first grade boys seemed to wear beige khakis or blue jeans, sweatshirts, and tennis shoes, which I also wore. But I had the unsettling sense that I was markedly different than my classmates. I felt as if they had been given a manual on the conventions and mores of being a first grader, and I had been passed over for the manual. I think that the alienation I felt from my classmates was the estrangement I felt in my family seeping into classroom. Luckily, I quickly befriended a couple of classmates who also seemed to experience the estrangement that plagued me—Danny and Kevin. Danny was overweight and a little shorter than me, and he had thick, wavy dark brown hair. He was very quiet and shy, but he was extremely smart.

Danny was overweight and a little shorter than me, and he had thick, wavy dark brown hair. He was very quiet and shy, but he was extremely smart. Kevin had straight, light brown hair, and he was thin as a rail. We lived fairly close to each other, so we walked to and from school everyday. Danny, Kevin and I played marbles and hopscotch during recess. After school, we would walk for hours along the railroad tracks or follow the banks of the Tug Fork River. As we wandered through dense mosaics of poplar trees that seemed to touch the clouds, we thought we were “exploring” wilderness that had yet to be treaded by mankind. It was always an adventure to dash across the Tug Fork River railroad bridge that connected West Virginia and Kentucky. Years later, when I watched the movie Stand By Me, I thought it captured the exhilaration we experienced sprinting across the bridge. We periodically wandered up to a cemetery that was on the outskirts of Nolan. We were always terrified when we tottered around the old cemetery, because, at any given moment, we expected dead bodies to suddenly arise from their graves like zombies and give chase. First grade would ultimately be a devastating lesson on life’s impermanence: Danny and Kevin died within four months of each other. An aggressive brain cancer abruptly purloined Danny’s life, and a speeding car struck Kevin. Their memorial services were held at Nolan Freewill Baptist Church, and Pastor Taylor delivered both eulogies as he stood over their tiny, glistening caskets. Shortly after Kevin’s funeral, I became extremely forlorn, and I wandered over to Uncle Oliver’s store. Aunt Flora, pigs that had been delivered to the store. Aunt Flora was slim, and she was fond of long, pastel flowered dresses. She also wore a dark brown, shoulder-length wig. Aunt Flora was very sharp and articulate, and she had a fundamentally different personality than Uncle Oliver. Although she also attended Nolan Freewill Baptist Church, she was the town gossip. Aunt Flora noticed that I quickly fell in love with one of the baby pigs. He had a bright pink face, light pink skin, very fine body hair, and a tiny curled up tail. She handed him to me like he was a pup, and I cradled him as I walked home. I named him Arnold. Initially, I deposited Arnold in a small cardboard box right next to my bed, and I fed him milk from a baby bottle. During the day, he followed me everywhere.

Arnold quickly became not only my favorite pet, but also my best friend. He had a wonderful personality. Arnold quickly grew to be the size of a small dog, and I fed him table scraps and carrots—Arnold loved carrots. He also relished popcorn. He was extremely smart and affectionate. Indeed, he was far brighter than my dogs, and he was quite easy to potty train. I eventually kept him in a cage in the basement. Whenever Arnold heard me descending the basement stairs, he squealed and his little tail wiggled. When I let him out of his cage, he immediately rolled over on his back—Arnold loved to have his belly rubbed. As Arnold started growing into an adult hog, my mother conscripted my brother build a pen for him in the backyard. I regularly bathed Arnold with the backyard hose, but it was usually to no avail, because he reveled rolling around in the mud. After I gave Arnold a bath, I straddled his back, and he would literally give me piggyback rides around the yard. I had great difficulty making new friends in school after Danny and Kevin died, so the basement quickly became my imaginary kingdom. I practiced the piano four or five hours a day with Arnold curled up at my feet. I also spent hours sketching on the chalkboard and reading books. If I played the piano softly, my father wouldn’t complain about the “noise,” and he would leave me alone. I loved playing the Carpenters’ music, but I also practiced gospel music, because I frequently played the piano at Nolan Freewill Baptist Church. Our house overlooked the Nolan Toll Bridge, and I was inexplicably spellbound by it. At the age of seven, I summoned the courage to venture to Nolan Toll Bridge. The tollbooth collector, Erna Mae, was a portly woman in her mid-fifties, which seemed ancient to me. She was deeply religious, and she wouldn’t touch makeup. Erna Mae unvaryingly wore loose fitting, long-sleeved housedresses that draped her ankles. Her long, grayish black hair was tucked into a bun, and a pair of black-framed, coke-bottle glasses magnified her gentle brown eyes. Erna Mae’s husband was the preacher at the Christ Only Church, where my paternal grandmother, Ada, was a parishioner, so she recognized me even before I introduced myself.

The preachers at the church handled poisonous snakes as they expounded the “word.” Snake handling preachers aren’t uncommon in Appalachia due to their literal interpretation of a passage from the Gospel of Mark: “And these signs will follow those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.” I snuck up to the entrance of the Christ Only Church during three or four services, but I never had the nerve to wander inside. Starting in second grade, I began a ritual that lasted for years. After school, I would walk to Granma Ada’s house, and she would serve me a biscuit with homemade syrup. I then walked over to Nolan Toll Bridge and spent a couple of hours talking to Erna Mae as she collected tolls. The elevated tollbooth had a large glass window, so I could see the trains speeding through Nolan, and also the faces of everyone who stopped to pay their toll. I was mesmerized by the tollbooth’s gleaming, metallic blue cash register—it was a Class 24 Model from National Cash Register—and I thought it was the most amazing machine in the world. A year or so after I made my initial trek to Nolan Toll Bridge, Erna Mae started to let me collect tolls. I was elated as I operated the cash register for the first time—I loved pressing its buttons. The tolls were 3Φ per pedestrian and 15Φ per car plus 3Φ per each additional passenger. I loved watching the different people and perusing the sundry items in their cars and trucks. I wondered about their origins and their destinations. After spending a few hours at Nolan Toll Bridge each day, I walked home and quickly skirted into the basement, where I played with Arnold and practiced the piano. I rarely ventured into the living room to watch television, because I was wary of my father and never quite sure when he might turn up. Besides, the only TV shows I truly liked were Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom and The Lawrence Welk Show, and my father hated both.

Besides, the only TV shows I truly liked were Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom and The Lawrence Welk Show, and my father hated both. If he caught me watching either show, I would be subjected to torrents of his contempt. He often derided me as a “flat-faced sissy.” My mother had been hired as a Mingo County school bus driver, and she was never around in the early evening to protect me from my father, so the basement served as my sanctuary in the Vinson home. Family sit-down dinners in the Vinson household were rarely pleasant. My father’s scorn superimposed on a couple tumblers of vodka would detonate into ridicule of my mother, my siblings, or me. My mother, by her own account, was also never fond of cooking; so after she became a school bus driver, we rarely had dinner as a family. Most of the time our evening meals consisted of TV dinners or sandwiches. But I’ll never forget a sit-down family dinner when I was seven. My father started to taunt my brother for his longish hair. My brother initially attempted to ignore him, but my father’s taunts escalated into scathing rebukes. Finally, a fistfight ignited between my father and brother. After my mother managed to break up their fight, my brother stormed out of the house. A few days later, Butch dropped out of high school and moved to Columbus, Ohio, where he started to work for one of our cousins who owned a furniture store. Second grade was tough for me, because I never found friends to fill the void left by Danny and Kevin’s death, but a syrup saturated biscuit at Granma Ada’s and a few hours at Nolan Toll Bridge with Erna Mae were a welcome diversion from school. In third grade, a gaggle of fifth- and sixth-graders started to bully me. They said I looked like a girl or talked like a girl. They would routinely shove me as I walked down the hallway. At recess, I was especially prone to being bullied, and I quickly learned not to stray too far from our teacher. Throughout my childhood, my father had frequent rows with his brothers about the operation of their mining venture. The rows often flared into fistfights and my father dispensing death threats to his brothers. When I was nine years old, my father and his brothers at last came to an irreconcilable impasse, and my father became a Mingo County Deputy Sheriff. My father loved his deputy sheriff uniform.

The rows often flared into fistfights and my father dispensing death threats to his brothers. When I was nine years old, my father and his brothers at last came to an irreconcilable impasse, and my father became a Mingo County Deputy Sheriff. My father loved his deputy sheriff uniform. He had my mother perpetually starching and ironing his uniforms, and he spent countless hours over the years spit shining his black shoes. After his uniform was satisfactorily starched and ironed to his lofty standards, and his shoes were adequately shined, he would ceremoniously don his uniform. After tucking in his shirt, he stood in front of the mirror for a minute or so appraising his appearance. I suspect my father was so scrupulous about his uniform, because it enabled him to pick up women. Womanizing and vodka seemed to be the primary motivations for his existence, and he never had a shortage of girlfriends. In fact, one of them lived about a block from us. When my mother drove me to piano lessons or when I accompanied her on errands, we occasionally spotted my father driving around with one of his girlfriends. My mother never said a word about his womanizing, because, after he became a deputy sheriff, he was rarely around the house, which came as a great relief to her. His absence came as a great relief to me too. Although my father treasured being a deputy sheriff, his vodka consumption was unaffected, and I think that he was probably more intoxicated than many of the drivers he arrested for driving under the influence. Moreover, the thought of my father carrying a loaded handgun every day was rather unsettling. In the wake of my father’s metamorphosis from coal miner to deputy sheriff, my sister landed a job as a carhop at a drivein. Beehive hairdos were the rage in the late 1960s, so my sister was incessantly teasing her hair as she played her forty-five records. She would occasionally take me shopping, and buy me rings, watches, and chains. She once bought me a black onyx ring that I reluctantly wore to school to appease her, and I was incessantly teased about it. By the age of nine, I felt like a walking zoo, and the jewelry she bought for me only exacerbated those feelings. My sister’s dates also intermittently stopped by the house, and I felt a vague, inexplicable interest in them, even though I wouldn’t be fully conscious of my homosexuality for five or six years.

After school, I continued my ritual of visiting Granma Ada, and then strolling over to Nolan Toll Bridge. But periodically I would stop by our house to feed Arnold or undertake a neglected chore, and O.T. Kent would be sitting in our living room, talking to my mother. Mr. Kent was the Mingo County Schools Superintendent. He had flaxen blond hair and sparkling blue eyes. I thought Mr. Kent bore a striking resemblance to Jim Phelps, the Mission: Impossible character played by Peter Graves. Mr. Kent was like the second coming of Santa Claus to me. He showered me with presents—Matchbox cars, Tonka trucks, Erector Sets, etc. He would also dig into his pockets, pull out a wad of bills, peel off a couple of bucks, and suggest that I buy ice cream or candy. In retrospect, it’s evident to me that Mr. Kent was quite fond of being alone with my mother. Indeed, I would discover twenty years later that he was, in fact, my biological father. As my ostensible father became increasingly enmeshed in the persona of a deputy sheriff and also in the lives of his various mistresses, he receded further and further from the lives of my mother, my sister, and me, so my brother started to periodically visit us on the weekends. Butch may have felt a touch of guilt for the scant time he had formerly spent with me, because we spent hours and hours together during his visits, and they were always a wellspring of merriment for me. I envied my brother’s outgoing and affable personality—everybody seemed to love him. Butch had developed an interest in aviation, and when he visited he frequently had remote control, gasoline powered toy airplanes in tow. He would drive me to the Mingo County Airport in Williamson, and we would spend the afternoon flying the toy planes. As my brother maneuvered the planes with the remote control, I felt a state of wonderment and a seed was planted—I aspired to be a pilot. After the toy planes invariably crashed, Butch let me keep their remnants. I amassed a bedroom chock full of demolished toy airplanes. When Butch was in town, he also took me to the Nolan auction on Saturday nights and to various junk shops around Mingo County.

He bought me broken down cash registers, because I had become absolutely enthralled by cash registers. I just loved operating the tollbooth’s cash register, and I thought National Cash Register was the greatest company in the world. I spent hours taking apart the inoperable cash registers and fixing them. A cash register has thousands of moving parts that can be very sensitive to temperature and dust, so it’s not uncommon for one small gear to “freeze” and render the cash register inoperable. After I fixed a cash register, I would sell it or trade it for two or three broken cash registers. In the fall of fourth grade, I came home to find Arnold missing from his pen. I questioned my mother and sister about Arnold. They shrugged their shoulders, and replied, “Arnold must’ve run away.” I spent that day and night combing Nolan in search of Arnold, but he was nowhere to be found. Following a night of restless sleep, I went to school, and then I sprinted home to once more search for Arnold. Throughout the day and night, I never managed to find him. That night, I hurled myself on my bed and cried for hours. Inexplicably, I had an intuition that I would never again see Arnold. Years later, I came to the realization that Arnold had ended up as bacon, pork chops, ribs, etc. I suspect my brother heard about Arnold’s fate through the grapevine, because shortly after Arnold went missing, Butch visited us, and he gave me a spider monkey named George—I kept him in a cage in our basement. George was cute, but he wasn’t tamed, and he was in the habit of throwing his feces and food around the basement. My mother bought a leash for him, and I attempted to take George on walks and tame him, but he repeatedly bit me. Although George only lasted about a month in our home, I think it’s safe to say he evaded Arnold’s fate. The summer between fifth and sixth grade was marked by two momentous occasions. The first was my first airplane flight: Granma Bessie Mae, my mother, and I flew to Texas to visit my mother’s oldest brother, Clarence. The flight departed from Huntington, West Virginia. I was extremely nervous as I situated myself into a window seat and buckled my safety belt. My mother sensed my anxiety, and she smiled and gently cupped my hand.

After the plane taxied to the runway, it came to a standstill for a few minutes. When its engines started to roar just prior to take off, my mouth parched and adrenaline coursed through my body like an electrical jolt. As the plane sped down the runway, and its nose surged upwards, I felt the uncomfortable sensation of being pressed against my seat. The plane quickly became airborne, and I let out a deep breath. Peering out the window as the city of Huntington receded among the clouds, I experienced an exhilarating liberation: I momentarily felt unshackled from the angst, isolation, and anguish of my childhood. It was truly a blissful feeling. After we transferred planes at the Atlanta airport, we flew to San Antonio, where Uncle Clarence was awaiting our arrival. Uncle Clarence had been a lifer in the Army, and he was retired. He was tall and muscular, and he had a square face and a gray crew cut—he also had grayish eyes. The military had left an indelible imprint on him, and he spoke in a deep, authoritative voice, but he was very nice to me. Uncle Clarence owned a number of Dunkin’ Donuts that were scattered throughout San Antonio, and the majority of our visit consisted of driving around to his various stores. Uncle Clarence quickly noticed that I was captivated by the machine filling the éclairs with custard, and he let me operate it as my grandmother and mother looked on. When we flew out of San Antonio, I felt the same sense of liberation I felt when we departed Huntington. tall: around 5^(′)10^(′) ’, fair skinned, and she had sandy blonde hair. Nina, too, had a beehive hairdo, and I’ll never forget her warm, welcoming smile. After a justice of the peace married Butch and Nina, they moved into the two-story white frame house that was next door to our house. Both my mother and I were elated to have Butch living next door. Shortly after Butch and Nina moved next door, Chattaroy Junior High School was looming on my horizon like a runaway locomotive, and I was absolutely mortified about the prospect of attending a physical education class or baring myself in a locker room.

Recess at Nolan Elementary School had become excruciating enough, and I thought I would undoubtedly be taunted and preyed upon in Chattaroy’s locker room. I expressed my concerns to my mother, and she enrolled me in Sacred Heart School in Williamson for seventh and eighth grade. Sacred Heart was a Catholic school about ten miles from Nolan Elementary School, but it seemed to be in a distant universe. The school had been built fifteen years earlier, and it was in pristine condition. The classrooms were twice the size of the rooms at Nolan Elementary School, yet they accommodated half the students. The school’s walls were painted off-white, and it had tiled floors. Each room also had a wall of windows that allowed sunlight to pour into the classrooms. The school desks’ lacquered veneer retained a sheen that made them look as if they were brand new. An additional perk of Sacred Heart was air conditioning. The Sisters of Saint Joseph comprised the staff of Sacred Heart. They were very strict and ensured that I wasn’t taunted or bullied. Over the course of my two years at Sacred Heart, I found it difficult to form friendships with my classmates, but I slightly bonded with a shy, overweight boy named Chris. I had never been exposed to a Catholic mass prior to enrolling in Sacred Heart, and its rituals fascinated me. The Catholic mass was vastly different than Nolan Freewill Baptist Church. I had grown accustom to Minister Taylor screaming about “fire and brimstone” ad nauseam, so the priest’s soft spoken homily was a pleasant departure. I also liked the fact that the Catholics weren’t disposed to speaking in tongues. Although I attended Sacred Heart, my after school custom of visiting Granma Ada and then the Nolan Toll Bridge was unabated. After collecting tolls with Erna Mae, I would wander over to my brother’s house. Butch’s driving ambition was to become a pilot, so he took flying lessons during the day, and he also worked the graveyard shift as a coal miner. My brother’s life was quickly eclipsed by a newborn too. Consequently, he was usually sleeping when I stopped by his house, but I loved to play with his dog. Frosty had a silvery white head, and my brother had trained him perform a myriad of tricks.

As Butch pursued his dream of becoming a pilot, my mother started to realize her entrepreneurial spirit by opening a convenience store, Quick Mart, on Route 52. Quick Mart was a stand-alone white building with an overhanging black-shingled roof. A modification of the Mingo County liquor laws, permitting convenience stores to peddle beer, inspired Quick Mart. Neighboring Pike County in Kentucky was “dry,” so Quick Mart’s primary commodity was beer, and my mother quickly had a lucrative little enterprise. The store had several coolers overflowing with beer and soda. In fact, the store had so many coolers that it felt like a furnace in the summertime, even though the air conditioner was running full blast. Naturally, I provided the store’s cash register—a Sweda Model 46—and I even worked nights. Working at Quick Mart made me feel like an adult, and I desperately wanted to expedite the process to adulthood. I thought life would become easier. gazed downward. My mother shattered before my very eyes. She burst into tears and started to scream. Her screams tore through me like shrapnel, and I felt momentarily immobilized. My mother’s knees buckled, and she crumbled to floor. She seemingly convulsed as she wailed and sobbed. A mining accident had taken Butch’s life. Butch’s memorial service at Nolan Freewill Baptist Churchwas overflowing with mourners. Our extended family, Niattended. Everyone was stunned that the life of such a vital, vibrant 22-year-old had been extinguished by a fluke mining accident. The mourners’ faces were paralyzed by grief, and their tear-glazed eyes had blank, distant stares. The funeral director was a very nice man, but he didn’t have the ameliorating spirit of M.T. Ball, who had a distinct style of assuring distraught mourners that they would emotionally prevail. I wore my Sunday best to the funeral, and my clothes felt itchy and oppressive. Butch’s funeral had the same surreal quality as Danny and Kevin’s funeral, because it was inconceivable to me that I would never again see my brother. As Pastor Taylor delivered the eulogy, his words were nearly inaudible, and, once more, I had the feeling of being submerged underwater. In the days leading up to the funeral, I heard persistent discussions about whether or not Butch was destined for heaven due to the fact that he never attended church and had rejected the piety of our mother. After the service, my mother made a beeline to Pastor Taylor, and she asked him if her son was ordained for heaven.

Pastor Taylor replied, “Joyce, I had the sweetest feeling when I stood at the head of his casket.” Butch was interred at Mountain View Memory Gardens on a cold, blustery overcast day in October of 1973. Following Butch’s funeral, my mother skidded into an abyss of despair. My father, however, promptly molted his grief, and a week or so after Butch’s funeral he was overjoyed, because he had tickets to a professional wrestling extravaganza in Williamson. My mother was shocked that he was even entertaining the idea of attending a professional wrestling bout, and she insisted that he remain at home and mourn the loss of his son. A screaming squabble suddenly erupted between them. My mother swore if my father chose professional wrestling over his family, it would end to their marriage. My father slapped her, and, without hesitation, drove to Williamson. My mother’s free fall into despair was relentless, and she took a six-month leave of absence from bus driving. She also started popping Valiums like they were Tic Tac breath mints, and she spent interminable hours in bed with the curtains drawn. Every afternoon, after I came home from school, she would drive me to Mountain View Memory Gardens, and we would visit Butch’s grave. As my mother’s grief became a black hole that devoured the joy of everyone around her, I began sleeping at Granma Bessie Mae’s house. A couple of months after Butch’s death, my sister married her longtime boyfriend, Ralph Copley. Ralph was tall and lumbering, and he worked for the Norfolk and Western Railway. He had bright red hair and a red beard, and freckles collaged his blanched skin. Ralph was even-tempered, placid, and exceptionally kind to me. Brenda and Ralph’s wedding ceremony was held at our house, and a cousin, who was a minister, performed the ceremony. My mother’s inexorable grief, superimposed on the overt strife between my mother and father, yielded a wedding that was far from festive. My brother’s wife, Nina, had relocated to her parents’ house after Butch’s death, so my sister and Ralph moved into their former house. Erna Mae’s son, Larry, worked at Nolan Toll Bridge too, and he was also a deacon at the Christ Only Church. He was obese, balding, and in his thirties. Larry’s home was near the Nolan Toll Bridge, and one day he requested that I assist him with a few chores around his house.

Larry’s home was near the Nolan Toll Bridge, and one day he requested that I assist him with a few chores around his house. He was the keeper of the Christ Only Church’s poisonous snakes, so I wasn’t particularly thrilled about stepping foot into his home, but I nonetheless accompanied him. When we walked though Larry’s living room, I noticed a wooden crate that had a wire mesh covering. I glanced into the crate, and I caught sight of two snakes. As I was processing the disconcerting fact that I was in close proximity to a pair of poisonous snakes, Larry suddenly pulled down his pants, and asked me to kiss his penis. I felt petrified by fear, and I froze for a moment or two—I then dashed out of his house. My body was flooded by adrenaline as I ran towards the tollbooth. Erna Mae had been a grandmother, a mother, and a best friend to me, so I instinctively thought that she would comfort me after I conveyed to her the dread I had just experienced. I was a bewildered 13-year-old boy, and, at the time, I was incapable of emotionally deciphering that Erna Mae would have conflicted feelings about her son’s actions. When I approached the tollbooth, Erna Mae immediately noticed my dismay, and she cast a concerned expression at me. I was nearly hyperventilating as I described Larry’s attempt to molest me. Her facial expressions were like a slot machine wheel that cycled through alarm, apprehension, apathy, and then suddenly stopped at wrath. Erna Mae grimaced and suddenly erupted in a cold, hostile inflection that seemed utterly unfamiliar to her as she ordered me to walk home. I would never again be welcome at Nolan Toll Bridge. Although my childhood had been rife with betrayal, desolation, and devastation, I think that may have been its most devastating moment, because the innumerable hours I spent at the tollbooth were the fondest memories of my childhood. In the aftershock of realizing that I was forever banished from the Nolan Toll Bridge, I began working at the Nolan Post Office. Starting at the age of eight, my mother routinely sent me to the post office, which was a couple of blocks from our house, and I befriended Terry Walker who was Nolan’s postmaster.

Terry weighed at least 350 pounds, and he was in his mid-fifties. His face had a bright red hue that even extended to his bald dome. A pair of black-frame glasses with the thickest lenses imaginable rested on his bulbous nose. Terry’s legs had been devoured by polio, so he wore metal leg braces and used two canes to amble around the post office. He had diabetes too. Terry and his sister never married, and they lived in the two-story frame house where they grew up next door to the post office. On weekday afternoons after school and on Saturday mornings, I sorted mail for Terry, and he also sent me on frequent odd jobs and errands. My salary was $25 a week. Despite Terry’s ailments and his physical appearance, he was a very sweet man. He had an omnipresent grin on his face, and he was unceasingly cracking jokes. I didn’t find his jokes to be particularly humorous, but every time he tossed out a punch line he exploded with a booming guffaw. Terry impressed me by the fact that he seemed to be quite contented with his life, even though fate had dealt him several setbacks. As life has dealt me major adversities and cataclysms, I’ve struggled to embrace his buoyant attitude in the face of hardship. As eighth grade at Sacred Heart was culminating, my mother divorced my father. Their caricature of a marriage had essentially unraveled shortly after my brother’s death. Butch’s passing triggered a profound crisis of faith for my mother: She had stopped attending church every Sunday, and the faith that enabled her to endure my father’s antics evaporated. Granma Bessie Mae gave my mother a parcel of land on the periphery of Nolan, and she had a single-story brick house built on it. I felt a tremendous sense of relief as my father’s specter faded from my life. My relief, however, would have a short half-life, because, at the age of fourteen, I started attending Williamson High School as a freshman, and it would be four years of pure, unadulterated hell. The first day I stepped into the locker room for physical education class my worst nightmares were quickly realized. Three freshman whom I had never seen before knotted around me; malice was engraved on their faces. One pushed me into the lockers and snickered, “You should be in the girls’ locker room.” As a freshman, I was repeatedly called a “faggot” and “queer,” and during class I would be subjected to barrages of spitballs. I quickly discovered that I was especially vulnerable to being beaten up and bullied in the bathroom, so I absolutely avoided the bathroom during the break between classes.

I quickly discovered that I was especially vulnerable to being beaten up and bullied in the bathroom, so I absolutely avoided the bathroom during the break between classes. I would use the bathroom only when I was excused during a class. Although it was in vogue to ridicule me at Williamson High School, two of my fellow freshmen, Jimmy and Rod, took considerable glee in my torment. Jimmy was short and chubby, and Rod was tall, slender, and handsome. Jimmy’s father owned a grocery store in Williamson, and he wore stylish clothes that included a seemingly endless array of Polo shirts. Despite Jimmy’s dapper exterior, he had a molten rage roiling inside of him. I’ll never understand if it was nature or nurture or, perhaps, both that filled Jimmy with such hatred. A month or so into my freshman year, I wandered into the bathroom after school had been adjourned for the day, so I presumed I would be safe. But Jimmy and Rod suddenly bounded into the bathroom and blocked the door. They roughed me up, and Jimmy said, “I know you want me.” As they paused to laugh and admire their handiwork, I bolted out of bathroom. After that experience, I would only use the bathrooms in an adjacent building that housed the school’s administrative offices. Despite feeling like an utter outcast at Williamson High School, I mustered the pluck to sign up for the school band in my freshman year. Although my forte was the piano, I had also learned to play the trumpet and the band needed trumpet players. In addition to being taunted by the boys in the band, the band director, who also coached various sports, ridiculed me too. After he started to habitually call me a “sissy,” I quit the band. At Williamson High, I ultimately befriended two popular girls named Peggy and Joyce, and they became my improbable guardians. Peggy and Joyce were extremely beautiful, and they were the school’s heartthrobs. Peggy was a beautiful brunette who had a perfect body, and Joyce had the long red hair and flawless facial features of a stunning Irish belle. Both Peggy and Joyce were extremely assertive, and guys acquiesced to their wishes like trained poodles. Peggy’s father owned a popular bar, and it seemed to me like she was acquainted with everyone at the school. Prior to my friendship with Peggy, I couldn’t walk to my locker without being terrorized. But shortly after I befriended Peggy and Joyce, a couple of kids were tormenting me while I was opening my locker, and Peggy hollered: “Leave him alone!” The", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:24:f07f3af8a1f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2820, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "belle.

But shortly after I befriended Peggy and Joyce, a couple of kids were tormenting me while I was opening my locker, and Peggy hollered: “Leave him alone!” The kids immediately recoiled and left me in peace. Because high school was so difficult for me, I was an average student. My favorite teacher was Mrs. Gentile, and she taught my favorite class—typing. I excelled at typing tests for speed and accuracy, and also at the 10-key adding machine. My marks for the typing and the adding machine were unparalleled. When I was fifteen, I belatedly came to the realization that I was gay. I say belatedly, because it was quite evident to everyone else around me. The primary reason I locked away my homosexuality in the distant recesses of my mind is that every Sunday morning since my earliest memories it had been emphatically declared that homosexuality was unequivocally evil and every homosexual had a one-way, non-stop ticket to hell. My father’s credo, which was nearly indistinguishable from that of the Ku Klux Klan, also deemed homosexuals to be the most malignant form of life on the planet. Although I had become extremely incredulous of the beliefs expounded by Nolan Freewill Baptist Church and my father, their opinions regarding homosexuality had nonetheless left an indelible blueprint on my young psyche. In my sophomore year, southwest Virginia was pounded by a merciless storm. The Tug Fork River Valley had flooded 36 times throughout the 20^(th) century, but the flood of 1977 was without equal. Water surged over the banks of the river, and it submerged almost of all Nolan, Williamson, and most of the surrounding communities. Houses and stores were ripped from their foundations, bridges crumbled, and cars were swept away. We had no electricity for a couple of weeks, and school was suspended for about a month. Although our house was untouched by the flood, its wake of destruction was breathtaking. At the age of sixteen, I landed a driver’s license, which offered me a newfound freedom. My high school years had been devoid of the “normal” pursuits of my peers—such as parties, Friday nights at the high school football game, dating, etc.—and that trend continued even after I had a driver’s license. If I had a few hours to spare, and my mother didn’t need her Galaxy 500, I would visit the Johnson Funeral Home, which was about 30 miles from our house.

The proprietor of the Johnson Funeral Home was Fred Johnson, and I met him via Granma Bessie Mae—she had been acquainted with Mr. Johnson for many years. When I lived with Granma Bessie Mae during my mother’s meltdown after my brother’s death, I confided to her that I aspired to become a funeral director. As a student at Nolan Elementary School, I had been awestruck by the love and compassion M.T. Ball had imparted to mourning families. I yearned to impart that same love and compassion to the bereaved. On my maiden visit to the Johnson Funeral Home, I remember being saturated by anxiety, because I felt my visit to the funeral home was a vital leap in actualizing my dream. As I drove west on Route 44, I noticed a large brick building that had a yellow sign: JOHNSON FUNERAL HOME. The building housed two storefronts: The Johnson Funeral Home and a beauty shop owned by Fred Johnson’s daughter. I parked next to two black Chevrolet Impala station wagons. The Impalas had black, plastic mesh screens on their side windows, and a pair of red lights atop their roofs. Until the late-1970s, funeral homes in West Virginia often moonlighted as ambulance services, so hearses doubled as ambulances. I cautiously entered the funeral home and slowly wandered down a hallway—an office was to my left and a chapel was to my right. After walking into the office, I suddenly stood before a woman who was sitting behind a desk, smoking a cigarette. She had brown hair and wore a mauve colored dress—she was in her late fifties. I think she sensed my nervousness, because she gave me a gracious greeting in the gravely voice of chain smoker as she directed me to take a seat in front of her desk. After I sat down, an uncomfortable silence ensued until Fred Johnson burst into the room. He had dishwater blond hair and a beaming, almost cantankerous smile. He stood a slender 6’2’’ and sported a navy blue, three-piece suit. He thrust out a big paw and firmly shook my hand as he introduced himself. Mr. Johnson was in his late fifties, and I thought that the receptionist was his wife, but she was, in fact, his mother-in-law—his wife was about twenty years younger than him. Mr. Johnson was jovial and animated while he gave me a tour of the funeral home. He seemed to be lodged in a state of perpetual adolescence. After he showed me the chapel, we walked to the end of the hallway,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:26:baca2629d9a3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2822, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 27, "text": "firmly shook my hand as he introduced himself.

Mr. Johnson was jovial and animated while he gave me a tour of the funeral home. He seemed to be lodged in a state of perpetual adolescence. After he showed me the chapel, we walked to the end of the hallway, bypassing a couple of rooms on our left, to a pair of large double doors. Behind the double doors was a vast storage room with twenty-foot ceilings. The storage room was jam-packed with coffins, funeral equipment, signs, etc., and I found it to be rather eerie. Mr. Johnson had an “embalming room” built in a corner of the storage room. I quickly found myself juggling school, working at my mother’s store and the post office, and volunteering at the Johnson Funeral Home. I managed to smuggle the majority of my spare time into volunteering at the funeral home, because I genuinely enjoyed its atmosphere and Mr. Johnson. I initially washed the hearses and performed various janitorial duties. The storage room was cluttered and chaotic, and I attempted to introduce order to it. Surprisingly, the Johnson Funeral Home didn’t have a public restroom, and its only restroom was tucked into a corner of the storage room. The restroom was also cluttered with funeral equipment and jumbles of junk. After using the restroom, I remember a funeral goer remarking to Mr. Johnson, “I wouldn’t let you bury my dog in this place,” and Mr. Johnson replied, “That’s all right—I don’t bury dogs.” I eventually started to assist Mr. Johnson with the removal of cadavers from homes and hospitals and embalming. The first time I assisted him with embalming was Thanksgiving Day 1976. After arriving at the funeral home, I accompanied Mr. Johnson to the embalming room. A heavyset, bearded man in his mid-thirties was splayed out on the stainless steel embalming table. He had been shot in the neck during a hunting accident. Mr. Johnson made two incisions to the cadaver’s carotid artery and jugular vein. He then grabbed the man’s arms and shook them up and down to increase circulation and blood evacuation. As blood surged from the cadaver’s jugular vein, and flooded the embalming table, Mr. Johnson started injecting embalming fluid into the carotid artery. As I watched, I felt slightly terrified. graduated from high school with minimal fanfare—I didn’t even attend the graduation ceremony.

I had never managed to shake the overwhelming angst that seized me each morning when I awoke to attend one more day at Williamson High School—I felt like I was waking up in the middle of traffic every morning. Within a couple of weeks after graduating from high school, I applied for an internship at the Ball Funeral Home, which was housed in a white, two-story Victorian-style house on the edge of downtown Williamson. The Ball Funeral Home was one of only three Williamson funeral homes that survived the flood of 1977, but its business had steadily declined since the flood. I ultimately decided on the Ball Funeral Home for my internship, because M.T. Ball had become an idol of mine. I thought that he was the personification of compassion and the quintessence of a funeral director. Regrettably, by 1979, Mr. Ball had suffered a series of heart attacks and strokes that had left him incapacitated and nearly bedridden, so his wife, Justine, had assumed the day-to-day management of the funeral home. Williamson, and the city of Williamson had been named after her forebears, so she considered herself to be Williamson aristocracy. Mrs. Ball was impeccably primped and preened. Her jet-black hair had hints of silver, and she had perfectly manicured and polished red nails. Although Mrs. Ball looked like she was on the threshold of stepping onto a Broadway stage, she had penetrating brown eyes and a stern demeanor. She had served a stint in the Army during World War II, and she projected an authoritative persona that reminded me of Uncle Clarence. Mrs. Ball was a chain smoker, and her deep, raspy voice sounded like her larynx was made of sandpaper. She commenced the interview by inquiring if I was a homosexual. The Williamson grapevine had obviously preceded my interview. I think the grapevine of a small town has instantaneous communicative capabilities that nearly rival the Internet. My life’s overriding ambition was to become a funeral director, and I needed to fulfill a funeral home internship before applying to mortuary schools, so I adamantly denied being gay. After I convinced Mrs. Ball that I wasn’t a homosexual, she consented to my internship. My starting salary was $5.00 an hour. In addition to an hourly wage, Mrs. Ball provided me with a furnished one-bedroom apartment that was on the second floor of the funeral home.

In addition to an hourly wage, Mrs. Ball provided me with a furnished one-bedroom apartment that was on the second floor of the funeral home. The apartment was rather cozy, and its furbishing was a fusion of the garish interior decorating of the 1970s and a mausoleum. The thick, shag carpeting and walls were canary yellow, and its furnishings, bathroom fixtures, and kitchen appliances were black. Since Mr. Ball had become debilitated, the funerals overseen by the Ball Funeral Home had dwindled, and Mrs. Ball was the funeral home’s only full-time employee. Even the funeral director worked for Mrs. Ball on a part-time basis. So I quickly became a jack-of-all-trades. I answered phones at night, performed janitorial duties, assisted with the removal of cadavers and embalming, facilitated visitations, and I drove the flower car to funerals. I was overjoyed to play such an integral role at a funeral home, and I felt my life was progressing in a promising direction. I also started to attend Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College. I planned on enrolling in a mortician school after I received my associate degree. Junior college was uneventful for me, but I actually began to enjoy school once more, because I could walk through the halls without being taunted. I seemed to be in a state of perpetual motion as I toiled long hours at the funeral home and tackled full-time coursework at the junior college. As Mrs. Ball scrutinized my diligence and attentiveness, her frosty, rigid veneer started to thaw, and she became very much a maternal figure to me. The Balls lived across the street from the funeral home, and Mrs. Ball extended an open-ended invitation to me to have dinner with her family. Over the next two years, I rarely missed dinner with Mrs. Ball and her two daughters. Mr. Ball spent the majority of his day convalescing in bed. He was colorless, wizened, and frail, and I invariably felt a pang of pathos every time I caught a glimpse of him. Although my mother consented to underwrite my tuition and all of my expenses for mortuary school, she had emotionally distanced herself from me since I moved out of her house. I think a couple of factors played a role in her detachment. First, she had ceased being a bus driver and had become an entrepreneurial dynamo: She opened a second convenience store, and she also started an ambulance service and a retail cosmetics store. I think a second source of my mother’s detachment was that she had started a new phase in her life, and she had", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:29:075209bbedee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2825, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "had emotionally distanced herself from me since I moved out of her house.

I think a second source of my mother’s detachment was that she had started a new phase in her life, and she had consciously decided to wean me emotionally. In July 1981, my mother bought me a black Datsun 280Z. The following month, I packed it with nearly all of my worldly possessions and embarked for Cincinnati. By 1981, I had accumulated more than fifty cash registers, but I sensibly decided to leave them in my mother’s basement. As I drove to Cincinnati, I felt tentative and, at the same time, eager. Cincinnati seemed like an immense, foreboding metropolis to me, but I was also extremely excited. I moved into a house that was across the street from the Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science. The house had been haphazardly carved up into four furnished, studio apartments, and mine had beige walls and brown shag carpeting. The apartment barely accommodated a small kitchen and a loft bed. A small desk rested below the loft bed. From the very first day, I thought mortuary school was fantastic, and I delighted in every facet of it. I found the classes— anatomy, physiology, restorative art, etc.—to be captivating, even exhilarating. One class, The History of Funeral Service, was particularly fascinating, and it was taught by Dr. Dan Flory, who would eventually become the Dean of the Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science. He was tall, fair-skinned, soft-spoken, and a very sharp dresser. A friendship that has endured to the present day gradually developed between us. Shortly after my arrival in Cincinnati, I started riding my bicycle around Eden Park. The park has a maze of paved paths that wind around buildings and sculptures dating back to the early 1900s, and I found the sprawling, densely wooded park to be enchanting. I was inexplicably attracted to the park’s large Moorish-style gazebo that was ornately painted in white and indigo and crowned by a spherical finial. A prominent Cincinnati attorney shot and murdered his wife at the gazebo in 1927, and legend has it that her ghost continues to haunt the gazebo. Although I didn’t encounter paranormal activity at the gazebo, I discovered that it was the epicenter of a burgeoning gay scene, but I was acutely shy and hesitant to entangle myself with anyone. After riding my bike to the gazebo every day for a couple of weeks, a tall, muscular man in his early thirties finally approached me. His name was Robert. He had thinning black hair and distinctive Mediterranean facial features—an aquiline nose, high cheekbones, and a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:30:1a2c93dbfaf2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2826, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "the gazebo.

After riding my bike to the gazebo every day for a couple of weeks, a tall, muscular man in his early thirties finally approached me. His name was Robert. He had thinning black hair and distinctive Mediterranean facial features—an aquiline nose, high cheekbones, and a dark complexion. Robert invited me to Friends, a gay bar near the park, and I agreed to accompany him. When we entered Friends, I heard blaring disco music and a spinning mirrored ball scattered flashes of light throughout the bar. The bar was dark, and plumes of cigarette smoke wafted near the ceiling. As we crossed the black tiled floor and walked to a table near the bar, I was dumbfounded to see men kissing and holding hands. After Robert and I sat down, I ordered a coke, because I had never imbibed alcohol before. While I sipped my coke, and surveyed Friends’ patrons, I quickly came to the visceral realization that I wasn’t the only gay man in the world, and I was momentarily overwhelmed by jubilance. I finally had an existential affirmation of my sexuality. Robert and I eventually wandered back to my apartment, and I had sex for the first time in my life. I had disclosed to Robert that I was a “virgin,” so he was particularly caring and measured. His gentle glances, gestures, and caresses unlocked desires in me that had been an impermeable secret for years, and as he explored my body and I timidly explored his, those secrets ruptured into pyrotechnic bursts of bliss. After we made love, Robert delicately embraced me. I was slightly surprised that the sheer joy enveloping me wouldn’t be quelled by shame and apprehension. Robert and I dated for approximately three months. When I discovered that he was a priest, my perceptions of him were irrevocably altered, and we gradually drifted apart. Nevertheless, I continued to patronize Friends on an almost nightly basis. I initially felt socially awkward in the confines of a bar, so I tended to play Pac-Man by myself. But I eventually befriended a couple of guys who were about my age, and they introduced me to Badlands, Cincinnati’s largest gay bar. Badlands was in the warehouse district of Cincinnati, and it was vast. Whereas Friends accommodated maybe 100 patrons a night, Badlands was an undulating sea of 500 men . Over the course of my two years in Cincinnati, I dated ten men whom I met at Badlands. As I negotiated my nascent sexuality, I navigated my first semester of mortuary school with great ease, because I found the curriculum so interesting and stimulating.

Although I was indeed in the midst of actualizing my dream of becoming a funeral director, I also dreamed of becoming a pilot. After I checked out flight schools around the Cincinnati area, I phoned my mother and broached the subject with her. She was initially hesitant, but I assured her that flight school wouldn’t interfere with my studies, so she reluctantly consented to fund my pursuit of a pilot’s license. I enrolled in Cardinal Air Training flight school, and my first solo was in a Cessna 150 on January 19th, 1982. As I soloed, I experienced the same sense of liberation I felt as an 11-year-old soaring out of the Huntington Tri-State Airport to visit Uncle Clarence, and flying continues to be one of the greatest joys of my life. In addition to being a major benchmark en route to my pilot’s license, my first solo flight was a momentous occasion as my brother had been slated to solo just before his death. Despite attending mortuary school and flight school full time, I managed to hit either Friends or Badlands just about every night. I loved attending both schools, and I also loved awakening my libido from its prolonged hibernation. I was only twenty-one at the time, so I had the vitality and boundless energy of youth. I felt like I had transcended the vestiges of my hellish teenage years, and I was floating in paradise. I received my pilot’s license in May 1982, and four months later I graduated from the Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science. I think a rational course of action would’ve been to canvas major metropolitan areas, where gays weren’t considered pariahs, in my quest to be a funeral director. Since I was a child, however, I envisioned myself as a funeral director in Williamson, West Virginia, and my driving ambition imparted blinders that prevented me from seeing that returning to Williamson wouldn’t be optimal. But I ultimately made the irrational decision of venturing back to the future. Upon my return to Williamson, I assumed the mantle of funeral director for the Ball Funeral Home, and I again found myself residing in the funeral home’s second-story apartment. I felt that my newfound upward mobility necessitated a new wardrobe, so after a week or so I strolled into the Man Shop Limited in Williamson, and I bought myself a handful of Brooks Brothers suits.

I felt that my newfound upward mobility necessitated a new wardrobe, so after a week or so I strolled into the Man Shop Limited in Williamson, and I bought myself a handful of Brooks Brothers suits. I had been the funeral director of Ball Funeral Home for three months when I discovered that Mingo County was in need of a medical examiner. At the time, Mingo County was a cauldron of corruption, and Johnnie Owens was its Democratic political boss. He was the county’s de facto behind-thescenes mover and shaker. My mother and Johnnie Owens were old friends, dating back to grammar school, and I mentioned to her that I had an interest in becoming the Mingo County medical examiner. A few days after our conversation, I received a phone call from Johnnie Owens, and then I met with him at his office in the Mingo County Courthouse in Williamson. Johnnie Owens was short and stocky. As he sat behind an enormous oak desk, he emanated an imposing persona, even though he was casually dressed in black slacks and a white button-down shirt. Although he spoke in a tranquil drawl, he had piercing obsidian eyes. Owens wasn’t a man who parsed words, and he quickly inquired if I would like to be Mingo County Medical Examiner. After I reconfirmed my ambition to him, our meeting concluded. A couple of weeks later, the chief medical examiner of West Virginia phoned me, and I quickly found myself the new Mingo County medical examiner. I was offered an office at the courthouse in Williamson, but I declined the offer, because I felt that my office at the Ball Funeral Home could also facilitate my responsibilities as the county’s medical examiner. Shortly after my appointment, I bought a 1977 Cessna 172. My father had constantly demeaned me as “worthless,” and the abuse and cruelty I had suffered at Williamson High School only served to reinforce my father’s degradations. By the age of twenty-two years old, however, I had actualized my life’s wildest dreams by becoming a funeral director, medical examiner, and a pilot, but my wildest dreams had a secret caveat: I had to live a lie. I embraced the illusion that wedding my work would nullify my sexuality, but I occasionally flew my Cessna to Cincinnati, rented a hotel room, and visited Badlands and Friends. As the Mingo County Medical Examiner, I had a beeper, and I was on call twenty-four hours a day, 364 days a year. I often had to venture to the most remote corners of Mingo County, in the middle of the night, to make official pronouncements of death.

I often had to venture to the most remote corners of Mingo County, in the middle of the night, to make official pronouncements of death. If I determined that a death was due to natural causes, I would issue an immediate a death certificate. But if I determined that the death was accidental, I would order toxicology testing before issuing a death certificate. In the rare event of a suicide, perceived foul play, or a death that occurred in a correctional institution, it was mandatory that I order an autopsy. Mingo County was sparsely populated, and I tended to approximately 80 deaths a year. The county compensated me on a per case basis, and I continued to be the full-time funeral director at the Ball Funeral Home. Despite an income of around $60, 000 a year between the two jobs, I still lived in the apartment on the second floor of the Ball Funeral Home. I didn’t have to pay rent or utilities, and I had dinner with the Balls on most nights. The Balls felt like family to me. As I managed the Ball Funeral Home and met my re-sponsibilities as Mingo County Medical Examiner, my She developed an undying friendship with an affluent widow named Ethel Polis. Mrs. Polis was extremely religious, and she shepherded my mother back into the fold. My mother’s newfound religious conversion had a major affect on my life. First and foremost, she began to have reservations about my sexuality, which I found rather disconcerting. Secondly, Mrs. Polis and my mother decided to travel the world and spread the “word.” Their first stop was Haiti. Although my mother thought I was immersed in the wages of sin, she presented me with the deeds to her house and a handful of buildings she owned in Nolan before she embarked for Haiti. My mother also handed me sole proprietorship of a convenience store. My estranged father, Charles Vinson, had since “retired” to a life of ubiquitous vodka consumption, and he became extremely homicidal, because he didn’t receive a cut from the spoils of my mother’s religious rebirth. He dispatched death threats to me via the phone, and he even barged into the convenience store brandishing a pistol. After I secured a restraining order against him, he sued me. Given my father’s homicidal bent, I felt it was prudent to quickly settle his lawsuit. I sold the properties in Nolan, and I gave him the proceeds from one of the buildings.

I sold the properties in Nolan, and I gave him the proceeds from one of the buildings. By 1985, Mrs. Ball had started to appear elderly and frail, so I floated her a generous offer to purchase the Ball Funeral Home. I thought she would welcome my offer with open arms, because it would afford her a comfortable retirement, but she became bellicose and downright nasty. Rage distorted the prim contours of her face as she snapped that she would never sell the Ball Funeral Home to me. After that exchange, our relationship disintegrated, and I decided to make my entrepreneurial leap: I resigned from the Ball Funeral Home and opened the Vinson Funeral Home. The Allen Funeral Home in downtown Williamson had been vacant since the flood of 1977, so I signed one-year lease for the building. I had it refurbished and brought up to code, and I purchased a hearse. I continued to be the Mingo County Medical Examiner. Much to my chagrin, Mrs. Ball equated my entrepreneurial leap with matricide. She vowed that I would suffer severe consequences, and I seriously underestimated her wrath. Mrs. Ball quickly recruited funeral home owners in the Williamson area, and they jumped on her bandwagon due to economic self-interest: They were already contending with a dearth of funerals and a new funeral home would only exacerbate their plight. I think that the funeral homes around Williamson realized that the upstart Vinson Funeral Home would be a threat to their livelihoods when Williamson’s police chief died, and his family arranged his funeral through my funeral home. The funeral home directors formed a vicious circle, and they conscripted a prominent Williamson attorney to write a letter to the West Virginia medical examiner that accused me of using my position as Mingo County medical examiner to solicit business, which was absolutely false. Whenever I visited the scene of a death, I would hand out my medical examiner’s card to the family of the deceased—I never handed them my personal business cards. As the smear campaign against me intensified, M.T. Ball, Jr., returned to Williamson. He had been charged with falsifying a prescription in an adjacent county, and he decided to lay low at his mother’s house. M.T. Ball, Jr., had been the Balls’ prodigal son, and he occasionally visited his family while I worked at their funeral home. Shortly after M.T. Ball, Jr., arrived in Williamson, one of his friends barged into my funeral home—he said his car had broken down and requested to use my phone.

Ball, Jr., arrived in Williamson, one of his friends barged into my funeral home—he said his car had broken down and requested to use my phone. I thought his behavior was rather odd as he repeatedly dialed a number and then abruptly hung up the phone. Unbeknownst to me, he had repeatedly phoned the Ball Funeral Home. I should say it was unbeknownst to me until I was charged with making harassing phone calls to the Ball Funeral Home. Although the charge was a misdemeanor, I was innocent and decided to fight it. But the magistrate overseeing the case was a friend of Mrs. Ball’s, and he promptly found me guilty. I appealed his decision, and I ultimately agreed to a plea bargain: I would resign as Mingo County medical examiner and the misdemeanor charge would be dropped. As Ball et al. were besieging me, a dour widow named Mrs. Marcum visited me. She was a short, bony woman in her early fifties, who had the ravages of Appalachia hardship carved on her face. Mrs. Marcum’s husband had been a coal miner who died of natural causes. Since her husband’s death, Mrs. Marcum had been quickly reduced to welfare. The state of West Virginia subsidized the funerals of welfare recipients to the tune of $650 , even though the average cost of an interment was around $3, 000 , so funeral homes in the Williamson area had declined to perform Mr. Marcum’s funeral. I felt sorry for Mrs. Marcum, and I consented to carry out her husband’s funeral. Although the state specified that the deceased of welfare recipients were to be interred in wooden, cloth-covered caskets, I buried Mr. Marcum in a metal casket. I had performed three state subsidized funerals prior to Mr. Marcum, and I used metal caskets for those funerals too, because I thought that wooden, cloth-covered caskets looked dreadful and highlighted the deceased’s indigence. I believed that an individual should be buried with a baseline of respect and decency. Despite upgrading the caskets for state subsidized funerals, I billed the state its standard $650 . Mr. Marcum’s body was interred at Mountain View Memory Gardens, where Butch had been buried. I carried out Mr. Marcum’s funeral flawlessly, but its aftermath would mark the beginning of the end for me Williamson. A couple of weeks after Mr. Marcum’s burial, I received a call from the manager of Mountain View Memory Gardens.

He sounded exasperated as he told me that Mrs. Marcum had phoned the cemetery several times a day, demanding that her husband’s body be exhumed. Mountain View Memory Gardens had finally acquiesced and requested that I pick up the body. I collected the remains of Mr. Marcum later that day. After her husband’s funeral, Mrs. Marcum had been notified about the Black Lung Benefits Act, which is a federal program that provides monthly benefits to coal miners with black lung disease or their surviving dependents, and she required an autopsy to determine if her husband had died of black lung disease. I explained to Mrs. Marcum that the state wasn’t authorized to perform an autopsy on a death due to natural causes, so the autopsy had to be performed by a pathologist in private practice. I eventually found a pathologist in Beckley, West Virginia, which is more than 100 miles from Williamson, to perform the autopsy. I then informed Mrs. Marcum that the pathologist’s fee would be approximately $2, 000 , but she dawdled. After three or four weeks, I broached the subject with Mrs. Marcum once more, and she refused to shell out a nickel. Mrs. Marcum eventually approached Mrs. Ball or vice-versa, and, needless to say, the former provided the latter and her clique with the fodder to taint the upstart Vinson Funeral Home. The newspaper reported that I kept Mr. Marcum’s body at my funeral home for ^(α)42 days,” because of Mrs. Marcum’s inability to pay me. Unfortunately, the newspaper neglected to mention that I had previously buried Mr. Marcum, and also the exact circumstances for Mr. Marcum’s prolonged respite at my funeral home. After I funded Mr. Marcum’s autopsy out of my own pocket, I thought that would be the end my difficulties, but I was woefully wrong. In the wake of being charged with making harassing phone calls, I was then charged with a second misdemeanor—obtaining state monies under false pretenses. The statutes specifying that wooden, cloth-covered caskets be used for state subsidized funerals were extremely stringent, so upgrading the four welfare recipients, including Mr. Marcum, to metal caskets was technically illegal, even though I didn’t charge the state beyond its standard $650 fee. After I repatriated my charges for the four funerals to the state— $2, 600 —that misdemeanor charge was dropped too. But the latter onslaught essentially doomed the Vinson Funeral Home.

Throughout my brief tenure as the proprietor of the Vinson Funeral Home, the Williamson Daily News was invariably derisive when it reported on my travails. The newspaper’s articles made me out to be the Beelzebub of funeral directors. I think the Williamson Daily News’ skewed coverage of me was primarily due to its lead reporter on the Henry Vinson beat being the sister-in-law of one of Williamson’s funeral home owners. Although bad press saturated me, and I had to contend with the ire of Williamson’s judiciary, I was never disciplined by the West Virginia Board of Funeral Service Examiners, because, at least, it realized that I hadn’t committed any improprieties. I realize that I’m a two-time convicted felon—albeit my second conviction was a government frame as I will explain— and I also realize that some of the circumstances precipitating my demise as the Mingo County medical examiner and, for that matter, a mortician in West Virginia ultimately boil down to a he-said, she-said quandary. But I think there’s one incontrovertible indication that a mendacious smear campaign was waged again me: Mrs. Marcum’s daughter declared that I was the illegitimate father of her child! I subsequently decided to follow my mortuary fortunes to Washington, D.C. Despite the fact that my life’s ambition was to be merely a funeral director in Williamson, West Virginia, I regrettably discovered that being the focal point of petulant morticians dedicated to preserving their market share and of a hostile small town newspaper was just a dress rehearsal for my sojourn to Washington, D.C., where I became the focal point of malevolent feds dedicated to preserving their secrets and of a duplicitous Washington Post. Indeed, I would find that the Justice Department, Secret Service, and the country’s media elites are infinitely more malicious than the bullies at Williamson High School or the morticians of Williamson. So Washington, D.C. was, unfortunately, upward mobility—Henry Vinson style. When I embarked for D.C., I left the vast majority of my possessions at my mother’s house, but my 280Z was laden with clothes. The drive was about eight hours, and I spent the first four hours smothered by a thick pathos as I contended with a relentless cascade of tears. I had naively assumed that I would be in Williamson for the duration of my life, and I felt a strong bond to the various families I had served as a funeral director. I thought I was abandoning them. However, I had grudgingly embraced the fact that I had to leave Williamson if I were to have a future as a funeral director.

However, I had grudgingly embraced the fact that I had to leave Williamson if I were to have a future as a funeral director. Given the vagaries of my life, I’ve never automatically defaulted to the idea that the future is friendly. But as I drove through Virginia on Highway 81, my pathos gradually started to fragment—albeit bit-by-bit. I started to feel a tenuous sense of liberation as I came to the realization that D.C. had the potential to be a fresh start for me. Throughout my years in Williamson, I had to don a guise of lies everyday to conceal my sexuality, and it had become increasingly cumbersome and untenable. I decided to discard the lies about my sexuality in my D.C. incarnation, and as the capital drew nearer and nearer I started to feel a sense of exhilaration that had been absent from my life since Cincinnati. I also sincerely thought that I could bid adieu to the events that had precipitated my demise in Williamson. I didn’t realize that those events were a specter slumbering in the shadows that would awaken nearly four years later to haunt me. cialized in high-rise commercial buildings, and their divorce left her comfortably situated. Aunt Josephine had four children, but her oldest son, Gus, died in a freak construction accident when he was seventeen years old. So Aunt Josephine and my mother shared a bond that had been forged from the deaths of their oldest sons. When we visited Aunt Josephine, she and my mother spent hours commiserating over the losses of their sons. Like Aunt Josephine, my mother never transcended the death of her son. Until the day she died, she had “BUTCH” inscribed on her personalized license plates. Silver Spring is a suburban, bedroom community of D.C., and Josephine lived in a split-level brick house on a street that was lined with oak trees. Before departing Williamson, I phoned and told her my plans to relocate to the D.C. area. Her three children were in their early thirties, so she had an empty nest, and she generously offered to accommodate me. After I rang the doorbell, Aunt Josephine greeted me with a hospitable hug. She was in her mid-fifties, lithe, and stunningly attractive. She had shoulder length brunette hair and loving bronze eyes. She had been gifted with all of the beauty genes that had rippled through my maternal grand parents’ gene pool. Aunt Josephine directed me to an upstairs bedroom, where I deposited my clothes.

Then we sat in her living room, talking about our family, my mother, and my plans. Aunt Josephine, like my mother, was extremely religious, but she was more cheerful and upbeat than my mother. Although I felt grateful for Aunt Josephine’s hospitality, I didn’t want impose on her, so I immediately started looking for employment and a flat. I contacted a fellow mortician named Jeff who had also grown up in Williamson. Jeff was ten years older than me, and our paths hadn’t crossed until we met at a funeral directors tradeshow a few years earlier. When we met, Jeff was working as a funeral director in Charleston, West Virginia, and I found him to be quite gracious. Although Jeff was gay, he had been living a secret life with a wife and two children. Jeff ’s penchant to preserve his secret life had gradually eroded, so he divorced and moved to the D.C. area. Jeff and I shared the mutual inferno of growing up gay in rural West Virginia, and also a passion for death care. Our common denominators translated into an instant friendship. I had been at Josephine’s for few days when I rendezvoused with Jeff for dinner at a Bob’s Big Boy in Lanham, Maryland. He lived about ten miles from Aunt Josephine in Lanham. Jeff was pudgy and medium height. He had thinning dark hair and dark eyes, and his round, ruddy face had extensive acne scarring. He had an extremely extroverted, alpha male personality. As we had dinner, Jeff suggested that I contact the Chambers Funeral Homes, which were headquartered in Riverdale, Maryland. He had briefly served as a funeral director there, and he said that Chambers was in need of a funeral director. Jeff also had a one-bedroom apartment, and he offered his couch to me. So within a week of arriving at Aunt Josephine’s house, I moved into Jeff’s apartment. The day after I met Jeff at Bob’s Big Boy, I phoned the Chambers Funeral Homes and arranged an interview for the following day. The Chambers Funeral Homes had three branches around the D.C. area, and I interviewed at their Riverdale headquarters. The Riverdale branch was housed in white, three-story colonial mansion with a mansard roof. As I entered the funeral home, I stepped onto a plush red carpet, and an elderly woman with shoulder-length gray hair in a lavender dress, sitting at the reception desk, gave me a genuine, heartfelt smile as if I", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:40:2a1fb0923af2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2836, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 41, "text": "Homes and arranged an interview for the following day.

As I entered the funeral home, I stepped onto a plush red carpet, and an elderly woman with shoulder-length gray hair in a lavender dress, sitting at the reception desk, gave me a genuine, heartfelt smile as if I were a prospective bereaved patron. I introduced myself, and she motioned to a chair that was next to her desk. After I sat down, she ambled up the stairway, and I panned the funeral home’s pristine, opulent interior. The funeral home had a lavish interior that was unlike the funeral homes in Williamson. Accordingly, the Chambers Funeral Homes were vastly different than the funeral homes of Williamson in terms of volume: Williamson had maybe 100 funerals a year, and the Chambers Funeral Homes supervised four or five funerals a day. Shortly after I sat down, William Chambers III skirted down the stairs. He was tall, corpulent, and balding. William III, whose nickname was Billy, greeted me with enthusiastic brown eyes and a smile that was brimming with white teeth. He wore a brown three-piece suit. After he thrust out his thick, silky soft right hand and introduced himself, I followed him up the stairs, where he ushered me into his second floor office. Given the funeral home’s posh interior, I was surprised that his suit was relatively inexpensive. Billy interviewed me for an hour or so. He didn’t have the refinement and polish of many of the funeral directors I had previously encountered, but he was very down-to-earth, and he had a great sense of humor. In fact, he is one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met. Billy hired me on the spot, and a few days later I was a funeral director at the Chambers Funeral Homes. Billy managed the funeral homes with his two younger brothers—Tommy and Robert. Robert managed the Silver Spring, Maryland branch. The Chambers Funeral Homes had a fabled history in the D.C. area. The three Chambers brothers were fourth generation morticians. Their grandfather, William W. Chambers, Sr., was extremely flamboyant, and he founded W.W. Chambers Company in the 1920s. W.W., Sr., had a panache for advertising. One of his promotional campaigns included an advertising calendar featuring the reproduction of a nude young woman that stated “Beautiful Bodies by Chambers.” He also proffered a motto that W.W.

The Chambers’ grandfather bequeathed the business to his son—W.W., Jr., who spent six months out of every year in D.C. and six months in Pompano, Florida. W.W., Jr., was fond of yachting, and he lived a leisurely life. He was short with slicked back gray hair. When he was in D.C., he drove his blue Cadillac around to the family’s three funeral homes and flower shop every day. Dressed in impeccable suits, he floated in and out of the funeral homes. His sons and the funeral homes’ employees treated him as a visiting dignitary, and Billy essentially ran the business’ day-to-day operations. I initially found the funeral home to be daunting due to its sheer volume. The Chambers Funeral Homes oversaw around 1,500 funerals a year. My initial tasks were transporting cadavers to the funeral home and embalming. The latter is my least favorite facet of being a mortician. I find formaldehyde extremely malodorous, and the scent of an autopsied cadaver isn’t very pleasant either. Billy quickly realized that my strong suit as a mortician was counseling grieving families, and I eventually started to work with families. I was sincerely devoted to comforting mourning families. I’m fond of helping families set up their ideal service, and then implementing it perfectly. I generally worked from 8 : 00 A.M . to 5 : 00 P.M . seven days a week, because I loved being a funeral director and my social life was fairly nonexistent. I wasn’t familiar with the D.C. area, so Billy would draw me meticulous and intricate maps when I led funeral processions with the hearse. I had been employed by the Chambers Funeral Home about a month when I was tasked with leading a funeral procession down the beltway to a cemetery in Quantico, Virginia. The procession consisted of approximately forty cars, and I veered onto the wrong exit. I pulled over on the exit ramp, and explained my miscue to the startled family. The entire procession then followed me as I circled back to the correct exit. It’s always been extremely important for me to implement flawless funerals, so I found that tremendously embarrassing. A second unforgettable mortuary moment occurred on Christmas day 1986. I was embalming an emaciated elderly man who had been autopsied. The medical personnel who performed the autopsy had left a needle in the cadaver’s superior vena cava.

A second unforgettable mortuary moment occurred on Christmas day 1986. I was embalming an emaciated elderly man who had been autopsied. The medical personnel who performed the autopsy had left a needle in the cadaver’s superior vena cava. The needle sliced my forearm, and, as I pulled my forearm from the cadaver, the cut brushed against the cadaver’s ribcage. In 1986, hospitals generally didn’t provide cause of death documentation that accompanied a cadaver to the funeral home since HIV was extremely rare. Within a week of performing the autopsy, I received the man’s death certificate, and I glanced over it as I sat at my office desk. The death certificate stated that the man had hepatitis A and B, and he died of AIDS. I was devastated. I immediately contacted a physician, and a blood test confirmed that I contracted hepatitis A and B, but fortunately I evaded HIV. Although I felt extremely ill for several weeks, I managed to drag myself to work every day. I crashed on Jeff ’s couch for the next six months as I acclimated to D.C. I eventually found a one-bedroom, basement apartment on the 1700 block of New Hampshire Avenue Northwest in a postwar, seven-story brick building, which was five blocks from DuPont Circle. The apartment had beige walls and a newly lacquered hardwood floor. I didn’t have the inclination to retrieve my furniture from Williamson, so I opted for a shopping spree at Ethan Allen. Once I had my new apartment comfortably furnished, and it started to feel like home, I visited West Virginia and retrieved my Cessna. I stored it at the Montgomery County Airport in Maryland. Around that time, I started visiting D.C.’s National Air and Space Museum every Saturday morning. The National Air and Space Museum has the largest collection of historic aircraft and spacecraft in the world, and I found it enthralling. It also had an IMAX theater that I thought was amazing: I found myself watching Threshold: The Blue Angels Experience every Saturday for weeks on end. Although I wandered through the museum nearly every Saturday throughout my tenure in D.C., I never tired of the exhibits, and I liked to have lunch in the museum’s cafeteria. The D.C. gay scene was a major departure from my prior experience. The gay bars had hundreds and hundreds of patrons, and walking through DuPont Circle, I glimpsed gay couples holding hands in public. I dined in restaurants whose patrons were primarily gay.

I also noticed that many gay men appeared to have successful careers. I finally felt like I had the right to be gay. I eschewed all pretenses of being straight. I accepted my sexuality on a level that was unparalleled to the acceptance I had realized when I was in Cincinnati. Following my move, Jeff and I continued pal around D.C. Although Jeff had a placid exterior, he was a wild man, who loved to drink and hit the bars. I was considerably more conservative, and I’ve never cultivated a taste for booze. It’s very difficult for me to imbibe the first drink. After the first drink has made my palate less discriminating, I have less difficulty with the second drink, but three drinks is generally my limit. When Jeff and I would hit a bar, I nursed a drink or two as I watched him pound down ten to twelve drinks in staccato succession. Jeff quickly introduced me Shooters, an exotic dance bar, on the corner of Massachusetts and 20^(th) Street Northwest, near DuPont Circle. Shooters was on the third floor of the Rigs Bank building, and as Jeff and I climbed the stairs to Shooters, I had no idea that I was about to be transported to an alternative universe. When Jeff opened the door, I instantly collided with a tsunami of blaring music. We seated ourselves at a mahogany bar with brass fixtures that extended for about 30 feet. Shooters was wedged in a narrow room, and the mahogany bar nearly stretched the distance of the room. Shooters had black walls, and it was dimly lit—except for the spotlights illuminating the six Adonis-like men who danced and gyrated atop the bar. The dancers were perfect manifestations of the male physique, and they were scantily clad in jock straps and tube socks. The men sitting at the bar and milling around tucked bills into their tube socks as they danced. Shooters was like a Dionysian dreamscape to me. I never mustered the courage to visit Shooters by myself, because I was still painfully shy and awkward in the context of social milieus, but Jeff and I hit Shooters two or three times a week. Crossing the threshold of Shooters was the first event in a chain of events that transformed me from a mild mannered mortician into a D.C. madam.

On most mornings I bumped into Robert Chambers, who was the youngest of the Chambers brothers. Although he managed the branch in Silver Spring, Maryland, he lived next to the Riverdale branch, and he briefly popped into the Riverdale branch in the mornings for mail and various miscellanies. After Robert collected his mail, and chatted with Billy for a few minutes, he would hop into his blue Mazda RX7 and drive to Silver Spring. Robert was a youthful looking 35 years old. He had bleached blond hair and brown eyes, but he wore blue contact lenses. He was medium height and very slender. Robert had a fashion sense that was markedly different than his brothers. The first time I was introduced to Robert he wore a black Brooks Brother’s suit, a pink shirt, and a pink tie. Robert lived with his wife and three children, but his mannerisms were extremely effeminate, and his brother Tommy incessantly teased him about being gay. Robert had a quick wit, and our morning interactions initially consisted of cursory greetings and superficial, witty banter as he darted in and out of the Riverdale branch. But after a couple of months, Robert and I started having protracted conversations. One night, after work, Robert and I made a trek to Shooters. Robert was quite familiar with Shooters, and he struck me as terribly discontented due to his secret life. The Silver Spring branch was housed in a three-story brick building located near the bustling intersection of Georgia Avenue and Fenton Street. The ground floor had a regal marble foyer and thirty-foot ceilings. An office was to the left of the entrance, and a picturesque chapel was situated behind a wall of frosted glass. The basement accommodated Robert’s office and my office and arrangement rooms, where Robert and I discussed funeral arrangements with clients. The basement also featured a large show room that consisted of thirty different caskets that clients could consider purchasing. During my first six months at Silver Spring, Robert and I regularly hit Shooters, and Jeff would often accompany us. I gradually found myself becoming infatuated with one of Shooters’ dancers. He was around 5’8’’, breathtakingly handsome, and he had a magnificent physique. Though all of the dancers at Shooters were breathtakingly handsome with magnificent physiques, this particular dancer had shoulder length black hair, a smooth, dark complexion, and blue eyes that sparkled like sapphires", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:45:b951106b034b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2841, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 46, "text": "that clients could consider purchasing.

Though all of the dancers at Shooters were breathtakingly handsome with magnificent physiques, this particular dancer had shoulder length black hair, a smooth, dark complexion, and blue eyes that sparkled like sapphires floating in white enamel. His eyes were mesmerizing. I was far too shy to initiate a conversation with the dancer, but Jeff sensed that I had taken a fancy to him. After Jeff stuffed a handful of bills into his tube socks, he invited the dancer to sit with us. Jeff introduced himself to the dancer, and then he introduced me. The dancer’s name was Jimmy, and his tube socks were bulging and overflowing with bills. Jeff cajoled me into inviting Jimmy on a dinner date—and Jimmy accepted. row house about three blocks from Capitol Hill, and it had a garish, chic interior. The tables and chairs scattered throughout the cozy restaurant didn’t match. In fact, the silverware and plates didn’t match either. Our tall, tattooed and pierced waiter was the human embodiment of Two Quail’s garish chic. I ordered stuffed chicken breast, and Jimmy also ordered stuffed chicken breast. After dinner, as we sipped on red wine, Jimmy divulged that he was an escort as well as a dancer. I had never met an escort before, and I was stunned. Jimmy then piped that he made between $1, 000 and $2, 000 a day as an escort. I’m fascinated by business, and I was particularly captivated by Jimmy’s disclosures, so I plied him with questions. He was quite candid as he discussed the various nuances of the escort business. Jimmy then informed me that an escort service that employed him, Ebony and Ivory, was for sale. When I inquired about the figure, I initially thought the price would be astronomical, but, surprisingly, Jimmy replied the owner sought a mere $10, 0000., I surmised that if Jimmy made $1, 000 a day, I could probably make my investment back in a couple of weeks. Jimmy intuited that my internal ten-key adding machine was crunching numbers, and he proposed that I meet the owner of Ebony and Ivory. I replied that I had to give it a little thought. As I drove home that night, I ruminated about purchasing Ebony and Ivory, which was certainly out of character for me. I was puzzled by Jimmy’s description of Ebony and Ivory’s owner and his operation of the business, because it seemed that the escort service was run in an inept, slipshod manner. According to Jimmy, the owner was lackadaisical about answering the phones, and only fielded calls when he felt like it.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:46:b5afbf5c3ed3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2842, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 47, "text": "I had to give it a little thought.

According to Jimmy, the owner was lackadaisical about answering the phones, and only fielded calls when he felt like it. When I returned to my apartment, I flipped through the D.C. Yellow Pages and found Ebony and Ivory under male escort services. The fact that the business was advertised in the Yellow Pages gave it legitimacy in my eyes. A few days later, I phoned Jimmy, and he consented to set up a meeting between the owner of Ebony and Ivory and me. Jimmy lived in a townhouse on Maryland Avenue, where he rented a room. After I rang the doorbell, Jimmy greeted me in his customary white T-shirt and beige shorts. His bedroom was overflowing with plastic elephants, porcelain elephants, bronze elephants, ceramic elephants, etc. The artwork on the walls depicted elephants, and he collected books on elephants. Jimmy’s grand plan was to open a boutique that catered exclusively to elephant aficionados. In retrospect, I should’ve realized that Jimmy had an affinity for drugs, but my prior interactions with druggies were practically nonexistent, so I thought his grand plan was the byproduct of eccentricity instead of synthetic opiates. I was in the midst of a sharp learning curve. After I collected Jimmy, we rendezvoused with the owner of Ebony and Ivory, Richard, at his condominium in the Car Barn on Capitol Hill. The Car Barn was a sprawling brick building that been used to store D.C. buses in the 1960s, but in the 1970s a private developer converted the building into condominiums. I parked on 14^(th) Street Southeast, and I felt extremely anxious as Jimmy and I walked to the Car Barn. Richard greeted us at the door of his condominium. He was maybe 53 ’, and he had thick black hair and sunken, brown eyes. He was clad in a white robe and wearing slippers. His skin was sallow, and he was emaciated. He looked like a skeleton that was enveloped by a thin veil of clay as he slowly crept into the living room. As we sat in Richard’s living room, I discretely panned Richard’s two-story dwelling, which had beige walls and hardwood floors. His condominium was furbished with contemporary furnishings, and its walls were tastefully garnished with post-modernist art. Richard was barely treading over death’s abyss, and he was forthright about the fact that he was dying from AIDS. He slowly enunciated his words, and his mannerisms were labored.

Richard had become too physically incapacitated to contend with the operation of his escort service, so he wanted to extricate himself from it. I inquired about advertising, and he replied that he advertised in various venues, but he was uncertain about which were cost effective. After our hour-long meeting, I concluded that Ebony and Ivory had the potential to be a lucrative business if it were competently managed. But I balked at making a definitive decision, and I told Richard that I would give him a yea or nay within the week. When the meeting with Richard concluded, Jimmy and I met a friend of Jimmy’s for dinner. Jimmy’s friend, Chris, was an extremely handsome man in his mid-twenties. He was tall and slender with flaxen, blond hair and blue eyes—he looked like a Swedish model. Chris was an escort too, and, over dinner, he and Jimmy ranted about the various glitches and difficulties they encountered working for escort services. I was still tangled up in ambivalence about whether or not I should purchase Ebony and Ivory until Chris revealed that on rare occasions he made upwards of $10, 000 a day as an escort. Chris’ disclosure was the critical mass I needed to purchase Ebony and Ivory. I wrote Richard a check the next day. After I bought Ebony and Ivory, I started to receive ten to fifteen calls a day for escorts, and I became very, very busy. Initially, I had a beeper, and I personally fielded all the calls placed to Ebony and Ivory. After I talked to a prospective patron, I phoned Jimmy, who handled the arrangements for an escort to be sent to the patron’s location. As it turned out, all of Jimmy’s friends were escorts, so I had an instant pool of employees. Our average session was $150 : The escort received 60 percent, I received 40 percent, and I compensated Jimmy with a weekly salary. The business didn’t seem overly outlandish to me, because I was accustomed to being on call 24 hours a day. Plus, I exclusively dealt with consenting adults, so I didn’t have ethical quandaries about running an escort service. My primary ethical concern was the safety of the escorts, and I gave them strict instructions to phone me before and after their appointments. In mortuary school, I found the marketing classes particularly interesting, and I pondered various strategies to nurture my business. One night I found myself paging through the D.C.

In mortuary school, I found the marketing classes particularly interesting, and I pondered various strategies to nurture my business. One night I found myself paging through the D.C. Yellow Pages and phoning escort services. Escort services are often fly-by-night ventures, and their owners often abscond without paying their phone bills. So as I phoned the escort services in the D.C. Yellow Pages, I noticed many of the numbers had been disconnected. After I installed the Merlin phone system, Jimmy arranged escort appointments from my apartment throughout the day, and I arranged escort appointments throughout the night. I loved being a funeral director, so I never even considered quitting the Chambers Funeral Homes. Indeed, Robert and I were the business’ frontrunners in funeral sales. At the sprite age of twenty-six years old, I was a funeral director by day and a D.C. madam by night. The Yellow Pages’ ads significantly enlarged my business. So I renewed the various ads in the Yellow pages the following year, and I purchased additional ads under five categories: escorts, entertainment, companion, gay advocacy, and travel companion. I also advertised in the Washington Blade and D.C.’s weekly City Paper. By the end of 1987, I started to reap more than 100 calls daily. The sheer volume of calls made my Merlin phone system obsolete, and I acquired a T1 phone line, which offered me a bank of 100 phone numbers that I had the capability of activating or deactivating. The T1 essentially gave me a mini phone company in the humble confines of my living room. After I acquired the T1, I placed scores of personal ads in the City Paper on a weekly basis that were accompanied by different phone numbers. The T1 allowed me to see the various phone lines that lit up, and answer the phone according to the respective ad that elicited the phone call. I also competed with myself due to the various ads I had placed in the Yellow Pages, so the T1 allowed me to distinguish those various phone numbers too. I had up to 20 escorts working on a given night, and I ultimately installed a chalkboard in my living room. A quick glance at the chalkboard enabled me to identify the escorts working on a given night, and if they were out on calls. The chalkboard enabled me to track the escorts’ whereabouts too, because their safety was a paramount concern for me. I also bought a Macintosh II, and I had a program written that identified patrons by their phone numbers.

I also bought a Macintosh II, and I had a program written that identified patrons by their phone numbers. So when they phoned, I would type their respective phone numbers into the computer, and it would instantly reveal their preferred escorts or their respective preferences. As the volume of calls for escorts started to escalate, I found the beeper to be inadequate, and I eventually had a phone installed in one of the funeral home’s showroom caskets. The phone rested under the casket’s lower lid, so it was concealed from the funeral home’s employees and clientele. Only Robert and I were privy to the casket hotline. I found that one phone could suffice during the day, because the vast majority of my calls came at night. The T1 typically didn’t start lighting up until 8 : 00 P.M . I have to confess that I found my escort business to be intoxicating. People of unsurpassed beauty surrounded me, and they made me feel like the most important person in their life since I was integral to their livelihood. My sexuality had been a nightmare for me in my earlier years, and now, finally, I had scores of people affirming my sexuality. It marked the first time in my life that I felt unconditionally accepted for simply being me. I had moved light years beyond being a high school pariah. And yet I never managed to transcend the indelible sense of estrangement that I felt as a child and teenager, and I continued to be plagued gnawing insecurities. I subconsciously thought that those insecurities would be quelled if I excelled as a funeral director, but, after excelling as a funeral director, I was still plagued by insecurities. Now I attempted to quell my insecurities by excelling as the proprietor of an escort service. Although being a funeral director by day and a D.C. madam by night was very demanding, I nonetheless phoned my mother every night while I manned the phones, and I also made a trek to Williamson once a month. When I flew to Williamson, I generally departed early in the morning and returned in the evening. I managed to have dinner with Aunt Josephine about once a month too. I started to receive frequent calls from Paul Balach, who was the Secretary of Labor’s personal liaison to the White House. Paul phoned me prolifically, and our chats evolved into relatively protracted conversations. He eventually invited me to lunch at Mr. Henry’s, a Victorian pub and restaurant on Capitol Hill that attracts D.C. movers and shakers.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:50:5d96c2f7ca08", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2846, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 51, "text": "generally departed early in the morning and returned in the evening.

He eventually invited me to lunch at Mr. Henry’s, a Victorian pub and restaurant on Capitol Hill that attracts D.C. movers and shakers. Paul was tall, middle-aged, and overweight. He had thick, wavy black hair, and his face had fleshy jowls. Paul knocked back three or four screwdrivers as we ate lunch. He was naturally clumsy, and the screwdrivers exacerbated his clumsiness. During our first lunch, he knocked over a bottle of ketchup and spilled a glass of water. Despite his clumsiness, I found him to be a generous, kindhearted soul. He even gave me a pair of presidential cufflinks. I sincerely liked Paul, and we started to regularly lunch at Mr. Henry’s. I think Paul had major self-esteem issues, because he seemed to fall in love with every escort I sent to him. Paul was especially smitten by an escort named Michael Manos, and I discovered he bought Manos a car and lavished him with jewelry. Paul wasn’t independently wealthy, and I just hated to see him being taken advantage of by an escort. I felt it was incumbent on me to convey to Paul that Manos didn’t love him, but rather loved his money. My intervention, however, didn’t assuage Paul’s largesse, because he was so smitten by Manos. The vast majority of the escorts I employed were absolute sweethearts, but unfortunately Paul had fallen in love with a nasty piece of work. Manos was svelte with blond hair and blue eyes, and he hailed from upstate New York. Before becoming an escort, Manos had worked at a Benetton clothing store, so his preppy apparel and his charming personality were quite disarm- Indeed, Manos certainly managed to con me. He initially requested to crash on my couch for a night or two, and that night or two turned into months. As I became increasingly aware of Manos bilking Paul, I told Manos that Paul was a friend of mine, and he should cease and desist bamboozling Paul into thinking that he loved him. Manos consented to quit conning Paul, but it was merely a ruse, because he eventually stole Paul’s MasterCard and started forging his checks. When I found out about Manos’ latest antics with Paul, I gave him the boot from my apartment and I fired him. Manos vowed to exact vengeance on me as he stormed out of my apartment. Following his departure, I realized that he had stolen my wallet. After I threatened to involve the police, Manos retuned my wallet three days later via a courier.

Following his departure, I realized that he had stolen my wallet. After I threatened to involve the police, Manos retuned my wallet three days later via a courier. But he would purloin my identity at a most inopportune time. I generally had extra escorts on call during the weekends because of my increased call volume on Friday and Saturday nights. But occasionally I found myself inundated by calls on weekday nights and didn’t have the escorts to cover all of the calls. On those rare instances, I would personally respond to calls. One weekday night, I found myself responding to a call at Georgetown’s Papermill Condos due to a shortage of escorts. After exiting the elevator at the penthouse, I knocked on the caller’s door. A short, heavy-set bald man cautiously cracked the door open and scrutinized me though a pair of thick, brownframed glasses that significantly magnified his eyes. He then invited me into the spacious apartment, and we exchanged introductions. He introduced himself as Alan. His apartment offered a magnificent view of the Potomac River, and it was tastefully furnished. The coffee table in the living room was five feet in diameter and made of solid granite. The walls were adorned with photos of Alan and various presidents and congressmen. We sat down on his living room sofa, and he chopped up several lines of cocaine. After he partook of a line, he offered me a toot, but I demurred. Although I found Alan to be a very intriguing, intelligent man, I sensed that he was smothered by loneliness. The following week, he invited me to Geppetto’s, which is spacious restaurant in Bethesda, Maryland, specializing in Italian cuisine and Sicilian pizza, and I accepted his invitation. Alan was a lovely man, and a friendship gradually developed between us. We regularly met for lunch or dinner. Alan and I had only one sexual encounter, but he became a prolific client of my escort service, and his predilection was for boy-next-door types. After I had routinely dined with Alan for approximately six months, I was following the 1988 presidential returns on television, and answering phones, when I discerned the inflection of a voice that was acutely familiar. I craned towards the television, and I noticed that the voice belonged to Alan Baron. I had no idea that the man I had befriended was, in fact, Democratic big-shot Alan Baron. At the time, he was the publisher of the Baron Report, a weekly newsletter on politics.

At the time, he was the publisher of the Baron Report, a weekly newsletter on politics. Alan was also a political pundit for the Wall Street Journal, and he frequently appeared on MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour. He even served a stint as the executive director of the Democratic National Committee. Despite all of Alan’s worldly success and influential friends, I felt sorry from him, because he was such a lonely man. A month or so after I met Alan Baron, I was fielding calls on a weekday night, and a prospective client phoned me from the Omni Hotel on Wisconsin Avenue. He requested an 18-yearold with minimal body hair and a slender swimmer’s physique. I found his request to be disconcerting for a couple of reasons. First, he essentially sounded like he desired an underage boy, and, second, none of the escorts working that night remotely corresponded to his desires—except me—so I decided to visit the Omni Hotel. door—he had given me a pseudonym over the phone. As we sat on the sofa in his hotel room, he pointed to an end table that had $200 in cash splayed on it. His gesture signified to me that he was seasoned veteran of escort etiquette. After I scooped up the money, he then started to hug and kiss me. Congressman Frank was extremely out of shape, and he had a very hairy body. I found my interaction with the congressman to be a rather dysphoric experience. U.S. Representative Larry Craig from Idaho also became a frequent flyer of my escort service. Craig preferred escorts who were quite masculine with a plethora of body hair—bear types. Craig certainly bamboozled the conservative voters of Idaho who ultimately elected him to the U.S. Senate, where he developed quite a reputation for voting against gay legislation. Craig voted for a constitutional ban of same-sex marriage, and he voted against expanding hate crimes to include sexual orientation. In fact, the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest gay and lesbian civil rights organization, gave him a zero percent concerning his stance on gay-rights legislation. So Senator Larry Craig proved to be a major hypocrite. In 2007, Senator Craig was arrested for lewd conduct in a restroom at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, because he attempted to pick up an undercover police officer in a bathroom stall. I was stunned to hear that Craig’s repressed yet runaway libido compelled him to cruise for sex in an airport bathroom.

Despite Craig’s compulsive appetite for homosexual sex, as evinced by his soliciting sex in a public restroom, he had a nearly 30 year run as a U.S. congressman and senator in Washington, D.C. had been in business for a year or so when I answered the casket hotline. The caller said his name was Craig Spence, I and I found him to be quite garrulous. Typically, the initial phone call placed to me by clients was brief, and they often provided a pseudonym, but Spence disclosed that he was a lobbyist who lived in D.C.’s upscale Kalorama neighborhood. He made a point of mentioning that he had a black MasterCard, which carried a $1 million line of credit. Spence then told me that he had bought two houses in the posh neighborhood, and built a corridor between the two. Spence said that he lived in one of the homes, and his “security” lived in the other home. He requested a young, boyish escort—18 or 19 years old. I phoned Jimmy, and he sent an escort to Spence’s home. Two hours later, Spence phoned again, requesting a second escort, which Jimmy quickly dispatched to his residence. At the time, I found my conversations with Spence extremely perplexing, and I will forever ruefully regret the day that he contacted me. Spence started phoning me almost every day, and he spent up to $20, 000 a month on escorts, becoming my most prolific and lucrative client. The vast sums he spent on escorts translated into well over 100 sessions a month. I was puzzled by his exorbitant expenditures, so I questioned the various escorts who had been dispatched to his residence about their respective encounters with Spence. Some described bacchanalian orgies. Other escorts who had one-on-one encounters with Spence described his penchant for extreme depravity. He was fond of being shackled, fettered, and whipped, and he also had a predilection for being beaten up and urinated on. Spence was certainly an enigma to me, because I sincerely wondered how he became so deranged. The revelations unfurled by the escorts who called on him prompted me to send only extremely seasoned escorts to his house. I had been interacting with Spence over the phone for a couple of months when he invited me to his Kalorama home. Given the anecdotes that were conveyed to me by the escorts who had dealt with Spence face-to-face, I felt apprehensive when I drove to his home.

Given the anecdotes that were conveyed to me by the escorts who had dealt with Spence face-to-face, I felt apprehensive when I drove to his home. As I slowly prowled down Wyoming Avenue, I noticed Spence’s two-story brick home. Walking to the front door, I took a deep breath and rang the doorbell. A tall, muscular man in a pricy blue suit answered the door. He was in his early thirties, and he had a square, chiseled face, somber blue eyes, and dark brown hair. After I introduced myself, he invited me into the marble foyer, and then shepherded me to a second floor office. An oriental rug rested on the office’s marble floor, and intricately carved teakwood panels decorated the walls. As I was directed to a seat in front of Spence’s desk, I glanced at the photographs on the walls. The photographs were quite formal, and they showed Spence standing next to various older men in suits. The only individuals I recognized in the photographs were Ronald Reagan and Bob Dole, and both were standing next to Spence with gaping smiles. I was slightly surprised that he didn’t seem to have pictures of his family or family members. Craig Spence sat behind an immense cherrywood desk, wearing an Edwardian-cut, plaid suit, white shirt, and black silk tie. Although Spence was in his forties, he had a youthful, blanched face. His thinning, sandy brown hair was parted to the left, and he had a well-groomed brown moustache. A pair of brown-framed designer glasses rested on the end of his nose, and he glanced upward, over his glasses, as he focused his icy blue eyes on me. He leaned forward in his chair and introduced himself without extending his hand. Spence certainly didn’t come across as the reprobate described by the escorts, but rather he appeared to be a refined gentleman. After Spence’s perfunctory introduction, he launched into a longwinded soliloquy. His initial remarks were a resume of sorts: He said that he was a lobbyist as well as a consultant for various interests in Japan and the health care industry. Spence then told me that he had “friends” who were perched at the pinnacle of power. He emphatically stated that he held the reins to omnipotence, and he had the ability to make a “life altering” phone call. He repeatedly reiterated that he could make “life altering” phone calls. Spence said that his security force consisted of off-duty Secret Service agents. The man who had ushered me into Spence’s office stood just outside the office door. When Spence called for him, he quickly skipped into the room.

When Spence called for him, he quickly skipped into the room. After Spence told him to show me his credentials, he whipped out his Secret Service badge and credentials, which I scrutinized. Spence then gestured for him to leave the office, and he followed Spence’s orders like a trained poodle. After Spence concluded expounding on his power and connections, he discussed my role in his grand vision. He made it crystal clear that my escorts were interacting with the most powerful men in the country, so the caliber of escort was imperative to him. He required the highest quality escorts, who were punctual and impeccably dressed. He required escorts who were articulate and appeared to be college graduates. He required that I diligently screen and qualify escorts to meet his lofty standards. Spence barked out his demands as if he were barking out orders in Marine boot camp, and he emphasized that it was a privilege for me to provide him with escorts. Spence struck me as extremely smart and also very manipulative. He was a morass of arrogance and extreme narcissism that I had never encountered before. He indeed believed that he resided at the center of the universe, and I was merely a pawn in his grandiose game of chess. Spence certainly didn’t impart a warm and fuzzy feeling during our initial meeting. In Shakespeare’s King Lear, Gloucester and Edgar have a dialogue, and Edgar declares that the “Prince of Darkness is a gentleman.” As I departed Spence’s home that day, I felt like I had just met the Prince of Darkness. Spence continued to phone me almost everyday, and about a month after our initial meeting he again summoned me to his home. I was met at the door by one his security personnel, who escorted me into the living room, which was beautifully furnished and decorated. The living room had a glossy, hardwood floor that was adorned with exquisite oriental rugs, and its walls were garnished with high-priced neo-classical paintings. His living room also had towering bookshelves. Spence and an African-American man in his forties were reclined on the living room’s chocolate colored sofa, and I was directed to a leather chair that was adjacent to the sofa. Spence was casually dressed in designer jeans and a pink Polo shirt, and, after I sat down, he introduced me to Larry King, his African-American friend.

Spence was casually dressed in designer jeans and a pink Polo shirt, and, after I sat down, he introduced me to Larry King, his African-American friend. King was rather obese, and he wore a resplendent navy blue suit that I thought was either an Armani or Brioni. He had meticulously coifed straight black hair and a trim goatee. His large-framed designer glasses had tinted lenses that partially obscured his beady, darting eyes. A thick gold chain draped his neck, and he had a bulky gold ring that was encrusted by diamonds. King exuded a pomp and flashiness that even surpassed that of Spence. Spence gave me a chilly reception as King looked on with a sinister smile. Spence then started our meeting by excoriating me, because one of my escorts had belatedly arrived at his home. I explained to him that I had taken a three-day vacation, and I wasn’t able to tend to the phone with my customary alacrity. Spence snapped that if he thought I needed a vacation, he would send me on a vacation. As Spence excoriated me, he was hunched over a china bowl on the living room’s large, circular crystal coffee table. The china bowl was brimming with cocaine, and he was dipping a gold coke spoon into it. Spence eventually offered me a toot of coke, but I declined. After Spence had taken two or three toots of coke, he started to chatter about his exalted status and clout—specks of cocaine littered his mustache. King also chimed in about his exalted status and clout too. I felt like Spence was putting on a show for King, but King wasn’t an individual who acquiesced to being out-boasted. They pumped themselves up like cartoonish parade balloons that were on the brink of bursting. Although I found their boasts to be almost comedic, I refrained from laughing. King then made a number of disclosures that I found to be absolutely bizarre. He revealed that he and Spence operated an interstate pedophile network that flew children from coast-tocoast. King also discussed that he and Spence had a clientele of powerful pedophiles who actually took pleasure in murdering children. In fact, King seemed to be obsessed with the subject of murdering children. I sincerely thought that I was talking to a pair of psychotics on the run from a psychiatric hospital. After Spence and King conversed about their rarified statuses and their extreme pedophilic perversities, Spence shifted gears and started to sincerely inquire about my life. He asked where I was born and where I attended college. He then questioned me about the particulars of my escort service.

He asked where I was born and where I attended college. He then questioned me about the particulars of my escort service. In the context of our earlier discussion, Spence’s questions seemed like non-sequiturs to me. Though I answered Spence’s questions truthfully, I was uncertain about the motivation for his inquiries, because Spence struck me as an individual who generally had a self-centered, utilitarian reason for every action. I also found it nearly impossible to believe that Spence’s seismic narcissism made him constitutionally capable of taking a sincere interest in me. I thought that either he had a duplicitous reason for plying me with seemingly heartfelt questions or I was witnessing a miracle tantamount to the parting of the Red Sea. As Spence inquired about my life, King sipped his drink and was ominously silent, but an unnerving smile was etched on his face. When Spence finished quizzing me about my life, he stood up and gestured for me to accompany him. I stood up and followed him. King remained seated on the sofa. Spence walked toward a large mirror that was situated on living room wall, and opened a closet door that was in the corner of his living room. He popped open a secret panel that was embedded in the closet, and he stepped into a small room that was behind the mirror. I cautiously paused at the threshold of the closet, but Spence waved his right hand, signifying that I should follow him into the surreptitious room. The mirror on the living room wall was, in fact, a two-way mirror, and the room had a video camera on a tripod that was pointed toward the living room and also a wall of video monitors. Spence leaned over one of the video monitors, and, after tapping a few of its buttons, he replayed the concluding minutes of our conversation. At that moment, I felt shrinkwrapped by cellophane, and I found it difficult to breath. As I silently stared at the monitor, Spence casually smiled and explained to me that his entire home was bugged for clandestine surveillance, and “CIA operatives” had installed the concealed video cameras throughout his house. He couldn’t help himself from crowing that his surveillance equipment was stateof-the-art, and the camera that captured our conversations was embedded in the living room’s thermostat. Spence then divulged that he blackmailed the rich and powerful.

Spence then divulged that he blackmailed the rich and powerful. I remained stunned and speechless as I watched myself discussing my life and escort service on the video monitor, but, after a few minutes, I started to swell with anger. However, I didn’t express my anger to Spence, because, at that moment, I was undeniably frightened of him, and I’m also not a confrontational person. Once Spence had flaunted his blackmail equipment, he dispensed a grave threat about the “consequences” if I uttered nary a word relating to his concealed cameras. He then dismissed me. I walked out of his house in a state of shock. My mouth was parched, and an adrenal chill coursed through my body. A montage of the video footage of me discussing my life relentlessly overwhelmed my thoughts as I drove home that night. I was utterly dumbfounded by King’s disclosures too. I have to confess that I was in a state of denial about King’s revelations, because they were so bizarre. I found it hard to believe that people could be such unequivocal monsters. But Spence had videotaped me discussing the particulars of my life and my escort service, so I was now susceptible to blackmail. I no longer viewed Spence as a mere client—I felt he controlled me. Indeed, he started to tell the escorts I sent to his home that I worked for him. The escort service had started out as a carefree venture that was enjoyable and exciting, but Spence had imbued it with a sinister gravitas. Spence’s unbounded egocentricity and bravado aside, it was quite evident to me that he had stratospheric connections, so I felt compelled to remain mute about our second meeting. I liken my interactions with Spence to family, sit-down dinners at the Vinson household with my father: I didn’t think it was a recipe for a happy ending. Spence continued to phone me almost everyday for escorts. And three weeks following our second meeting, he once more summoned me to his home. Driving to Spence’s home that night, I was fraught with anxiety and unsure of the next surprise he planned to spring on me. One of Spence’s security personnel greeted me at the door, and he directed me to the living room. Spence was in the midst of hosting an unbridled orgy that had the ornate trappings of an inaugural ball. Magnums of Dom Pérignon and china bowls brimming with cocaine were scattered throughout Spence’s living room.

I think the majority of the participants were military personnel, because military uniforms were littered on the floor and strewn over furniture. A three-star general who was fully clothed sat next to Spence on the sofa. He was heavyset and around six feet tall. He had gray hair and distinguished facial features, and he nonchalantly conversed with Spence as if they were seated in a D.C. restaurant. Spence was wearing an Edwardian-cut pastel plaid suit, a white shirt, and a blue tie. The orgy consisted of approximately thirty people who were at various stages of disrobing, and they were also tangled up in various sexual acts, ranging from oral sex to intercourse. Six or seven of the male escorts worked for me, but I also noticed six or seven women in their early twenties who were also escorts. Four nude men in their twenties surrounded a very attractive female escort who was on the floor squatted on all fours. One of the men entered her from behind as she performed oral on a second man. Two men looked on, masturbating while waiting their turn to be with her. I seated myself next to Spence, on the same chair I had sat on during our previous meeting, and he was quite congenial to me. I think he wanted me to behold one of his bacchanalian orgies in full bloom, and that was the primary impetus for him summoning me to his home. As Spence occasionally surveyed the orgy with a smile and a seeming sense of accomplishment, he and the general discussed a health care interest of theirs in Japan. Spence was a consultant for Becton, Dickinson & Company, which manufactures a gamut of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products, but I was unable to discern if his conversation with the general related to Becton, Dickinson & Company. Although Spence came across as friendly, I felt extremely uncomfortable and guarded, because I was cognizant of the fact that everybody in the living room was probably being videotaped. I conversed with Spence for about ten or fifteen minutes, and I politely excused myself. Driving home that night, I reflected on the orgy. The male and female escorts were treated as if they were merely meat, and I felt utter disgust. My disgust was compounded by the fact that the orgy was most likely being videotaped.

He was hunched over the china bowl on the living room’s coffee table, tooting cocaine with his gold coke spoon. Between toots of cocaine, Spence expressed his irritation with the performance of an escort. He elaborated on the hefty sums he spent on escorts, and he snapped that he expected every escort sent to his home to meet his exalted expectations. He reiterated that I was privileged to have him as a client. Once more, I was guarded about my disclosures due to his concealed cameras. excursion of the White House. When Spence finished discussing the White House tour, he dismissed me with a wave of his arm as he took a toot of coke. I had great difficulty believing that Spence actually arranged an after hours excursion of the White House for an escort, so I asked the escort in question about it. He confirmed that Spence pulled up to the White House gate, and Secret Service personnel instantly waved him through the gate. Since my second meeting with Spence, I had ruminated about Spence’s disclosure that CIA operatives had installed his blackmail equipment. When Spence initially disclosed that statement to me, I was too stunned to attempt to discern if it were true. And over the ensuing weeks, I vacillated between credulity and incredulity. But after sitting next to a three-star general in the midst of an orgy that was most likely being videotaped, and having an escort confirm Spence’s after hours tour of the White House, I had a tendency to believe that he might be telling the truth, because, after all, his equipment was state-of-the-art and also because of the power he wielded. I thought John Q. Citizen would have great difficulties acquiring such high-tech equipment, and I didn’t think a single individual could pull off everything Spence managed to pull off. I started to believe, and subsequent events confirmed, that Spence’s enterprise had the blessing of officials poised at the pinnacle of the federal government. The day Spence introduced himself to me on the casket hotline irrevocably altered the trajectory of my life, and, over the years, I’ve struggled to understand the phenomenon of Craig Spence.

The day Spence introduced himself to me on the casket hotline irrevocably altered the trajectory of my life, and, over the years, I’ve struggled to understand the phenomenon of Craig Spence. Prior to 1989, Spence seemed to be immune to bad press despite the fact that he was an outright sociopath. A 1983 New York Times profile of Spence, “Have Names, Will Open Right Door,” described him as “something of a mystery man.” The New York Times profile noted Spence’s puzzling personality and stratospheric social connections, but it didn’t offer an explanation of his wealth and power. Spence rarely discussed his personal life with me, and he occasionally discussed his familial roots, so it’s difficult to comprehend how he accumulated the juice and guile to blackmail the elite and influential. Spence occasionally mentioned that he was an only child who descended from Boston bluebloods, but I’ve read that he was most likely born in upstate New York. It’s also been reported that he attended Syracuse University before enrolling in Boston College. A former Boston College classmate told a reporter that Spence covered his tuition with student loans, which almost certainly excludes him from the ranks of Boston bluebloods. He graduated from Boston College in 1963 with a degree in Communications and Broadcasting. After his college graduation, Spence started out as a press assistant for Massachusetts’ governor, and then he became a press secretary for the Massachusetts’ state speaker. Spence eventually moved to New York City, landing employment as a correspondent for WCBS, New York City’s CBS affiliate. In 1969, he made the leap to ABC as a Vietnam correspondent. After leaving ABC and Vietnam in 1970, Spence relocated to Tokyo. While in Tokyo, it’s been reported that he supported himself as a freelance radio correspondent throughout the mid-1970s. Spence then somehow reinvented himself by forging a business relationship with Japanese politician Motoo Shiina. Shiina was in the Japanese parliament, and he wasn’t a political hack of the five-and-dime variety. He came from an aristocratic family that had primed him for political eminence. Shiina’s father, Etsusaburo, was an affluent businessman and Japanese powerbroker, who had been appointed to key positions within the Japanese cabinet. When Motoo Shiina and Spence teamed up, Shiina was the president of the Policy Study Group (PSG), a Tokyo-based venture that was subsidized by monies from both the Japanese private and public sectors. PSG’s primary purpose was to facilitate Japanese business interests by creating alliances among Japanese businessmen and influential Americans and captains of industry. In 1979, Spence became the “overseas representative” for PSG. Shiina provided Spence with a hefty salary and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:62:8e50a1305e52", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2858, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "appointed to key positions within the Japanese cabinet.

PSG’s primary purpose was to facilitate Japanese business interests by creating alliances among Japanese businessmen and influential Americans and captains of industry. In 1979, Spence became the “overseas representative” for PSG. Shiina provided Spence with a hefty salary and coughed up $345, 000 for Spence to buy his Kalorama home. The Kalorama home was to serve as a residence for Spence and also be “Shiina’s embassy” in D.C. and the American headquarters of PSG. In 1983, the honeymoon between Spence and Shiina abruptly ended. Shiina demanded that Spence vacate his Kalorama digs, but Spence refused. In court papers, Shiina stated the following about Spence’s home: “I was advised that staying at the house while Spence was there could be damaging to my reputation.” Four years later, I came to the same conclusion as Shiina. Spence, however, had leverage on Shiina, because the money Shiina transferred to purchase the Kalorama home had been transferred into the United States illegally via Hong Kong, so Spence’s lawyers eventually forced Shiina to back down, and they ultimately worked out an arrangement: Spence would compensate Shiina for the home when he decided to sell it. So Shiina was essentially Spence’s first blackmail victim—at least on record. If Spence were willing to extort one of the most powerful men in Japan, he wouldn’t think twice about blackmailing a mortician from West Virginia. Since my second face-to-face encounter with Spence, I had truly come to look upon him as the Prince of Darkness. I and I also felt that he had the power and connections to crush me. But I managed to provide him with escorts that were a facsimile of his exalted expectations, and we ultimately arrived at a détente of sorts. Although I had to regularly assuage his outbreaks of grandiosity and insanity, he continued to spend up to $20, 000 a month on escorts. The worries and anxieties posed by Spence notwithstanding, my escort service continued to flourish. But the rising volume of calls proved to be a problem for Jimmy. He had become increasingly dysfunctional due to the fact that he had started popping Dilaudid like jellybeans. I repeatedly attempted to intervene, but his love for Dilaudid had even eclipsed his love for elephants. My expanding business and Jimmy’s burgeoning dysfunction prompted me to hire a second person, Travis, to operate the phones. Jimmy had introduced me to Travis. He was a tall, thin 21-year-old who had thick blond hair and gentle blue eyes. Travis was strikingly handsome, but he didn’t have the one-on-one people skills to thrive as an escort.

But he had a simpatico personality, so I gave him an opportunity to work the phones. He excelled at talking to clients and also directing the appropriate escorts to them. Travis generally answered the phones after 1:00 a.m., when I folded for the night, until Jimmy showed up the next day. At that point, Jimmy’s hours had become extremely elastic. On a Saturday afternoon, after I had lunched at the National Air and Space Museum, I was sitting in my apartment, watching television, answering phones, when I received a call from a man named “Tony” who said he was a friend of Craig Spence. Tony requested to meet with me, and I suggested that we rendezvous at a restaurant or at his home, but he replied that he would drop by my apartment. Although I had never disclosed the whereabouts of my apartment to Spence, Tony said he knew exactly where I lived. Within in an hour, I heard the roar of motorcycles. Peering out my living room window, I noticed three men parking their motorcycles in front of my apartment building. I then heard a heavy rap on my apartment door. I answered the door, and Tony introduced himself. He was flanked by two hulking men in their early thirties. Tony was in his mid-thirties. He had a swarthy complexion and jet-black hair. He cradled a black motorcycle helmet in his left arm and wore a black leather jacket and black leather chaps. His bearded face almost had a cubist appearance due to multiple cosmetic surgeries. Cosmetic surgery had significantly reduced his nose to a mere wrinkle that seemed disproportionate to his face. He appeared to be Italian, but he had the same icy blue eyes as Spence that sent a shiver down my spine. I had a flash of intuition that I had seen Tony before, and, as I momentarily gazed at his face, my memory of him quickly congealed. I recalled seeing Tony on my third visit to Spence’s house—he had been one of the orgy’s participants. I also recalled walking out of a Benetton clothing store near the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and P Street shortly after my third visit to Spence’s home, and seeing Tony and the two hulking men leaning against a wall, staring at me. I distinctly remembered their unwarranted attention. We exchanged glances, but I felt intimidated by them, so I didn’t utter a word.

I distinctly remembered their unwarranted attention. We exchanged glances, but I felt intimidated by them, so I didn’t utter a word. I promptly came to the uncomfortable realization that Tony was cognizant of where I lived, because he had probably been following me. Tony seated himself in the chair in front of my desk and reclined as if he owned the apartment. The men who accompanied him seated themselves on the sofa. Tony’s cohorts were silent, but he was quite talkative. Although Tony appeared to be quite masculine, he had a high-pitched voice, and he spoke with sweeping gesticulations that were slightly effeminate. I discerned that he was most likely gay, but he was hard-boiled gay. Indeed, he’s the most hard-boiled gay man I’ve ever met. He came across as seemingly omniscient and intimidating. Tony initially mentioned that he too ran a gay escort service, and he had catered to Craig Spence for years. He said that he “worked closely” with Spence, and his “blessing” was the primary reason I had acquired Spence as a client. Tony, like Spence, also discussed his extensive power and connections, even though he didn’t infuse his braggadocio with the grandiosity of Spence. Tony then looked me straight into the eye and snapped that I should be weary about ever crossing him, because he had the technology to overload my phone lines and render my phones inoperable and the government connections to shut me down at his whim. He also mentioned that he was aware of my day job at the Chambers Funeral Homes, which I found rather distressing. Tony ended our conversation with a friendly request that, at the time, I found to be perplexing. He said that he didn’t have the ability to process credit cards, and he inquired if I had the means to process credit cards. After I replied that I would look into the possibility, Tony concluded our meeting. Since I thought that he and Spence were most likely in cahoots, I thought I should attempt to placate his request. In hindsight, it’s apparent to me that Tony’s request was a disingenuous ploy. The following week, I phoned my mother, and I told her that I had started an entertainment business. I inquired if she could process credit cards for me through her ambulance company. Tony phoned shortly after I talked to my mother, and we met at Annie’s Paramount Steakhouse, which is near DuPont Circle. When I arrived, Tony and his two brutes were seated at a table in the back of the steakhouse, sipping drinks.

When I arrived, Tony and his two brutes were seated at a table in the back of the steakhouse, sipping drinks. Tony’s brutes were again wearing black jogging suits, but the tops of their jogging suits were strategically unzipped, exposing their shoulder holsters and guns. I was taken aback as I briefly stared at their guns. My glance subsequently grazed their faces, and each flashed a menacing grin. After I ordered a coke, Tony inquired if I had acquired the means to process credit cards. I gave him an affirmative nod. Tony responded with a rare smile, and he handed me a dozen credit card vouchers. He then knocked back the rest of his drink and stood up. His brutes then stood up and silently followed him out of the restaurant. Shortly after my second meeting with Tony, Spence summoned me to his home. One of his security personnel directed me to the vacant living room, and I sat in my customary chair. A few minutes later, Spence and Tony walked into the living room. They seemed to be in a jovial mood as they sat on the sofa. Spence initiated the conversation by saying that Tony was his right hand man, and Tony had taken care of “a lot of business” for him over the years. Apparently, Spence was aware of my newfound ability to process credit cards, because he piped he would “fix any problems” I encountered. Although my feelings at the time were amorphous, I nonetheless had a vague intuition that I was like a lamb being led to slaughter. At the end of our meeting, Spence invited me to a Capitol Hill party, but I declined. And during our subsequent meetings, he invited me to various events and parties, and I declined those invitations too. I didn’t have a desire to meet Spence’s powerbroker friends due to the fact that I thought Spence was wicked, and I felt that soirées among Spence’s friends would be awkward and cumbersome. Spence eventually started to become miffed that I didn’t have an inclination to attend events and parties with him. He repeatedly told me that I should ingratiate myself to his powerbroker friends, but I repeatedly evaded his invitations by voicing various obligations at the funeral home.

Tony and his two brutes would be sitting at a table in the back of the restaurant, nursing drinks. The two brutes always accompanied Tony—we never met one-on-one. When we rendezvoused, Tony provided me with a new batch of signed credit card vouchers to process, and I would hand him the cash from the previous batch. I didn’t feel quite right about my mother processing credit cards, so I quickly asked Robert to create a merchant account through the Chambers Funeral Homes to process credit cards. The merchant account that we used was called Professional Services, so my clients who used credit cards were billed for various funeral accessories, and Robert received a 20 percent cut of the revenues. Tony eventually provided me with the name and phone number of a credit card processing company in Miami, Florida. He said that a friend of his worked for the company, and his friend would walk me through the process of setting up a merchant account. When I phoned the company, Tony’s “friend” was gracious and helpful as he facilitated the creation of a merchant account for me. I found this chain of events extremely puzzling. I wondered why Tony hadn’t used his friend to establish his own merchant account. During our weekly meetings, I occasionally asked Tony for information on clients whose behaviors perplexed me. Tony would run a complete background check on the requested individual, providing me with the individual’s home address, his place of employment, his income, etc. For example, I had a client named Vernon Houk, who periodically holed up in D.C. hotel and ordered up to five escorts a day, and he was also into unprotected sex. Tony told me that Houk was the director of the Center for Environmental Heath at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I was slightly perplexed that Houk was a high flyer at the CDC, but yet he was so into unprotected sex. Spence later told me that Tony had a shadowy CIA affiliation, and he was part and parcel of Spence’s blackmail enterprise. Spence also told me that Tony’s brutes had been Special Forces operatives. Tony, however, was like a phantom to me, even though he led me to believe that he was affiliated with the government. I made inquiries about his identity, but I never managed to learn even his last name. Like Spence, Tony frequently alluded to his power and connections, although, unlike Spence, he said very little that was definitive.

Like Spence, Tony frequently alluded to his power and connections, although, unlike Spence, he said very little that was definitive. Spence could be quite candid about his blackmail enterprise and occasionally provided the names of his targets, but Tony never discussed blackmail with me. However, given the events that later unfolded, I’ve come to believe that Tony was part and parcel of Spence’s blackmail enterprise. After we had met five or six times, Tony started alluding to contract hits that he had carried out. I found Tony’s disclosures to have an incomprehensibility that rivaled that of Spence and, for that matter, King. Following his disclosures about contract hits, his brutes and the guns that they toted made me all the more frightened of them. Shortly after Tony abruptly barged into my life, I had a suspicion that my phones were tapped. As I talked to clients and escorts, I heard incessant clicking sounds. I ultimately noticed a large box van that was parked across the street from my apartment. Most of the men who skirted in and out of the van wore blue industrial overalls and hard hats, but I occasionally spotted men wearing suits shuffling in and out of the van. According to my escorts, Spence had graduated from tooting cocaine to smoking crack, and I started to find our interactions to be increasing onerous due to his escalating madness. Spence was never the quintessence of sanity, but, prior to his crack addiction, he maintained a semblance of sanity that made our interactions slightly rational. After his crack addiction, however, I cringed every time we met face-to-face. His physical and emotion deterioration were striking too. He started to appear gaunt and sickly, and he became increasingly paranoid. He repeatedly remarked that his security personnel were out to murder him. One night he summoned me to his home, where I found him and Larry King sitting on the sofa. I was essentially blackmailed during my first meeting with Spence and King, and I found my subsequent meetings with the tandem quite unpleasant, because they attempted to coerce me into ensnaring children for them. King had previously mentioned that he flew children into D.C., and the escorts I employed confirmed that minors were in attendance at Spence’s orgies. Despite my earlier state of denial, I had come to the horrifying conclusion that Spence and King operated an interstate pedophile network for their powerbroker cronies.

But I absolutely refused to aid and abet their abuse of children, despite Spence’s potential to blackmail me or perhaps even kill me. As we sat in Spence’s living room, Spence and King once more broached the subject of me procuring children for them, but they started becoming extremely aggressive. Although I emphatically told them that I wouldn’t pander children, their demands escalated to an inexorable crescendo: Spence and King finally demanded that I pluck destitute children off the streets of D.C. and deliver the children to them. After I realized that they weren’t willing to cease and desist about the issue, I excused myself and walked out of Spence’s home. Leaving Spence’s house that night, I decided I needed to extricate myself from Spence, King, and Tony. Spence’s crack addiction had made him extremely irrational, and pandering children was a line that I absolutely refused to cross. I also never felt comfortable dealing with Tony, and his request that I process credit cards never made sense to me. I decided to quit providing Spence with escorts and processing Tony’s credit card vouchers, so I stopped returning their calls. Every time Spence or Tony’s numbers came up on the casket hotline’s caller ID or on the T1, I wouldn’t answer the call. Spence had seemingly infinite resources, and I optimistically thought that he would simply start using a different escort service, but I was regrettably wrong. I quickly discovered that my Faustian pact with Spence and Tony didn’t have an exit clause. As I departed my apartment for work one morning, I noticed Tony and his two brutes across the street leering at me. Needless to say, I was terrified. Departing work, I again spotted the trio across the street from the funeral home. Driving home that night, I repeatedly peered in my rearview mirror, but I didn’t notice them following me. However, when I returned to my apartment, Jimmy told me that the phones had been malfunctioning. Tony had computerized automatic dialers that repeatedly dialed my main numbers and overloaded my lines. He sent my escorts out on bogus calls too. Jimmy and Travis had also received death threats as they answered the phones throughout the day. I had never edified them about the ominous partnership between Spence and Tony, but now I felt it was incumbent on me to explain Spence and Tony and their rarified caliber of psychopathology.

I told Jimmy and Travis that I wouldn’t begrudge them if they said farewell to the escort service. But both opted not to quit. My primary phone numbers were down for the balance of the night, so calls sporadically trickled into the T1. As I watched television, I heard intermittent pounding on my windows, which provoked petrifying surges of terror. I crawled into my bed around 11:00 p.m. I attempted to sleep, but my nerves were too frayed, and I stared at my bedroom’s ceiling for an hour or so. Just as I started to cross the threshold of sleep, the deafening blasts of gunshots were discharged outside my bedroom window. The next day, I again noticed Tony and his brutes parked outside the funeral home. Throughout the day, I was a nervous wreck as I counseled a couple of families about their upcoming funeral arrangements. I attempted to maintain a calm exterior to the bereaved, even though I felt utterly exhausted, and I couldn’t prevent myself from ruminating about my own upcoming funeral arrangements. I made it back to my apartment around 6 : 00P.M ., and Jimmy told me that the phones were again malfunctioning. Jimmy left my apartment around 7 : 00 P.M ., and, a few minutes after his departure, I heard a knock on the door. I thought Jimmy was knocking on the door, because he was prone to forgetfulness. When I opened the door, Tony’s two brutes barged into my apartment. One knocked me down, and they proceeded to punch holes in the wall, upend furniture, break my apartment’s windows, and rip drawers from the desk. They were like cyborgs programmed for Armageddon. I thought that Tony’s brutes had been ordered to kill me, and I was absolutely mortified. As they demolished my apartment, I lunged towards the phone and dialed 911. A few minutes into the melee, Tony casually walked into my apartment, smoking a cigarette. I had the phone’s receiver in my right hand, and he quickly realized that I had called the police.

My escort I service had started out as a blithe, carefree adventure, but it had morphed into a larger than life leviathan that was beyond my control. I had created a Frankenstein, and I was impotent to guide its course. I could only sit by and watch as it controlled me. I was a victim of my own success and over my head. I felt I couldn’t turn to law enforcement, and I also felt that walking away wasn’t an option either, because Tony would invariably hunt me down and kill me. I reluctantly decided to start dealing Spence and Tony once more, because I had come to believe that my self-preservation dictated that I didn’t have a choice in the matter. But Spence never again insisted that I provide him with children. As my escort service started spiraling out of my control, Robert began to experience trouble with his family, even though they weren’t aware of our credit card arrangement. Although Robert went through the motions of being a heterosexual, I think his family had a mounting awareness of his secret life, because his father treated him like a second-class citizen. Robert and his family eventually reached a critical mass of irreconcilable differences, and they fired him. Robert and his wife and children had been living in a home that was owned by the funeral home. Following his termination, he purchased a house in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. After Robert found himself in the ranks of the unemployed, the credit cards I furnished him became his primary source of income. Robert’s father and brothers then pressured me to side with them against Robert, but Robert had become my closest friend, and I wouldn’t disparage him. The pressure to take sides in the Chambers’ family squabble became too distressing for me, and I eventually tendered my resignation to the funeral home. Though I had felt a calling to be a funeral director since I was child, my escort service had mutated into such a burdensome knot of complexities that resigning from the Chambers Funeral Homes actually came as a relief. Shortly after Tony and his brutes ransacked my apartment, I rented a two-story, colonial house on 34^(th) Place. The house’s first floor had a spacious living room, dining room, and kitchen, and the second floor had three bedrooms.

The house’s first floor had a spacious living room, dining room, and kitchen, and the second floor had three bedrooms. I settled in the master bedroom, and Jimmy and his copious collection of elephants moved into the second bedroom. I was concerned about Jimmy’s escalating dysfunction, and I thought I had the potential to help him if he were in close proximity to me. I converted the third bedroom, which overlooked a second-story deck, into an office. Although I operated my escort service out of my new office, I didn’t relinquish my apartment on New Hampshire Avenue. I left a phone system in the New Hampshire apartment, and Travis regularly answered phones from the apartment. I attempted to make my relocation as clandestine as possible, so I opted not to move furniture from my apartment into the house, prompting a shopping spree at Ethan Allen. The 34^(th) Place house was on a quiet cul-de-sac, and I had deluded myself into thinking the move would enhance my safety, even though in my heart of hearts I was cognizant of the fact that Tony and Spence would find me wherever I resurfaced. And unfortunately moving into the house didn’t assuage the ubiquitous state of terror that had descended on me. Around the time I started renting the house on 34^(th) Place, Spence sold his Kalorama home, and relocated to a pair of condominiums on Massachusetts Avenue. The condominiums he purchased were side-by-side. Initially, he lived in one of the condominiums, and his security personnel lived in the adjacent By that time, Spence was freefalling in the throes of crack addiction, and he had become an utter lunatic. Whatever shadowy, sub rosa network that had floated his lavish lifestyle and his security detail had clearly rescinded its backing, because Spence was in the midst of major financial difficulties. He no longer had the resources to spend $20, 000 a month on escorts. Indeed, he had difficulties financing escorts solely for himself. Spence began phoning me numerous times throughout the course of a day, demanding that I comp him escorts. When Spence sold his Kalorama home, my contacts with Tony started to wane too. Tony then suddenly vanished from my life just as suddenly as he had appeared. His various phone numbers were abruptly disconnected, and I never heard from him again. I was perplexed by Tony’s vanishing act and also by Spence’s harsh reversal of fortune. Although I felt a tremendous sense of relief when Tony receded from my life, I couldn’t help myself from wondering if those events had foreboding implications for me.

I was perplexed by Tony’s vanishing act and also by Spence’s harsh reversal of fortune. Although I felt a tremendous sense of relief when Tony receded from my life, I couldn’t help myself from wondering if those events had foreboding implications for me. In January 1989, I received a puzzling phone call from a woman who worked for the Government Accounting Office. A patron of my escort service, Donald Gregg, had wracked up recurrent credit card charges for funeral accessories with his government-issued MasterCard, and the GAO employee had numerous questions about the charges. I was caught off guard by her questions, so I was uncertain of the appropriate response. I ultimately advised her that the charges were of a personal nature, and I suggested that she contact Donald Gregg. Right after the GAO contacted me, I phoned Spence and told him about the particulars of the call. He replied that he would be in touch. Donald Gregg wasn’t an average, run-of-the-mill government apparatchik. He had been a CIA agent for 31 years, and he played an integral role in the Phoenix Program, a nefarious CIA initiative that slaughtered over 25,000 South Vietnamese who were in many cases mistakenly thought to be collaborating with North Vietnam. When Gregg was soliciting gay escorts from me with his government issued MasterCard, he served as Vice President George H.W. Bush’s national security advisor. In 1983, Gregg had a secret meeting with CIA agent Felix Rodriguez and Vice President Bush in the White House, where the trio hatched a covert scheme to provide military aid to the Contras in Nicaragua, which ultimately morphed into Iran-Contra. CIA agent Rodriguez, too, had an infamous reputation, because he had been a cog in the dark machinations of the Phoenix Program, and he also helped hunt down Che Guevara in Bolivia and pilfered the watch from the dead Guevara as a trophy. Gregg and George H.W. Bush were old friends, and after the latter became president, he appointed Gregg to be the United States Ambassador to South Korea. So Gregg was someone that the Bush I administration felt inclined to protect from the fact that he procured gay escorts on the government dime. Craig Spence hinted to the Washington Times that Donald Gregg had arranged his late night tours of the White House, but Gregg vehemently repudiated Spence’s allegations as “absolute bull.” Indeed, Gregg didn’t seem to hold Spence in high esteem. “It disturbs me that he can reach a slimy hand out of the sewer to grab me by the ankle like this,” Gregg said of Spence. In the article, Gregg said that he had met Spence only once, but, given the events that subsequently unfolded,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:73:bf4f1b3fd9b5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2869, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 74, "text": "the Washington Times that Donald Gregg had arranged his late night tours of the White House, but Gregg vehemently repudiated Spence’s allegations as “absolute bull.” Indeed, Gregg didn’t seem to hold Spence in high esteem. “It disturbs me that he can reach a slimy hand out of the sewer to grab me by the ankle like this,” Gregg said of Spence. In the article, Gregg said that he had met Spence only once, but, given the events that subsequently unfolded, I’m inclined to believe that Spence and Gregg had more than one contact. Three weeks or so following the phone call from the GAO, Spence summoned me to his condominium. I hadn’t seen Spence in two months, and I was shocked by his physical deterioration. He was emaciated, and his complexion was ashen. I later learned that in addition to a crack addiction, he had contracted AIDS. After Spence ushered me into his house, he motioned to a settee that was in his living room. As I sat down, Spence seated himself on his chocolate sofa next to man in his late fifties, who had balding black hair and brown, round-framed glasses. He wore a blue, pinstripe suit, white shirt, and a red tie. A miniature U.S. flag was pinned on his lapel. Spence introduced the man to me by his name and also disclosed his title. He was in the cabinet of George H.W. Bush. I feel that the Bush administration had decided to pull out a big gun to eradicate any traces of Gregg’s affinity for gay escorts, because Gregg had been so instrumental in Iran-Contra and because he was en route to becoming the United States Ambassador to South Korea. Spence had dropped the name of the cabinet member months earlier, when he revealed that he routinely provided him with adolescent boys. At the time Spence dropped his name and his perverse predications, I thought his disclosure broached incomprehensible, and I was fairly skeptical of it. But on the other hand, the vast majority of Spence’s illicit activities seemed incomprehensible to me until I actually witnessed them. Our conversation focused on the GAO conundrum, and Spence and his “friend” quickly cut to the chase. They told me to write a letter to the GAO detailing blood studies I had conducted on behalf of Gregg. They explained that my occupation as a mortician would be a satisfactory guise for the letter. I felt that I was potentially being set up for GAO embezzlement charges, and I balked at their demands. I replied that they certainly had the means and wherewithal to cover for Gregg, so the onus of covering up his extracurricular activities shouldn’t fall on me. The man sitting next to Spence then uttered a question that I will never forget: “I can withstand a background investigation … can you?” I responded, “Yes … I can withstand", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:74:dc24132b10de", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2870, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 75, "text": "for the letter.

The man sitting next to Spence then uttered a question that I will never forget: “I can withstand a background investigation … can you?” I responded, “Yes … I can withstand a background investigation.” My response essentially concluded the 20-minute meeting. Spence was quite irate with me when I refused to write their letter, and he berated me as he showed me to the door. Unbeknownst to me, I would never see Spence again. I’ve since confirmed that Spence’s friend was indeed in Bush’s cabinet. He was obviously attempting to aid and abet Spence’s cover up of Gregg’s extracurricular activities, even though Spence was freefalling in crack addiction. I have great difficulties believing that a man of immense power would put his cabinet position, career, and family on the line to help a degenerate crack addict even if they were friends and the latter once provided him with adolescent boys. It only makes sense if the cabinet member A few days after my meeting with Spence and his “friend,” I flew to Bolivar, Tennessee, to attend an air-training seminar at the Bolivar Aviation School. On February 29^(th) , a few days after my arrival in Tennessee, I received a frantic phone call from Jimmy. He blurted out that the Secret Service had smashed down the door of the house on 34^(th) Place, and the agents had held him at gunpoint as they ravaged the premises. Jimmy said the agents arrested him for possession of narcotics, and he had spent the night in jail. Over the years, I’ve found flying to be a serene, meditative experience, but I flew back to Maryland the next day in a frenzied state, and then I drove into D.C. The Secret Service had sealed the house on 34^(th) Place and also my apartment on New Hampshire. As I drove by both locations, I came to the painful realization that I couldn’t withstand a background check. I concluded that I needed to find a place to sleep, and, needless to say, I didn’t think phoning Aunt Josephine would be prudent. I ultimately contacted Richard Rausch, who was the doorkeeper for the House of Representatives. Richard was a client who had grown to be a close friend. Richard told me that he had heard about the raid, and he unhesitantly offered to accommodate me. He had a two-bedroom apartment on 2^(nd) Street Southeast that was around the corner from the Library of Congress. As I drove to Richard’s apartment, I pondered the possible scope of my troubles, and I felt considerable ambivalence about my predicament.

As I drove to Richard’s apartment, I pondered the possible scope of my troubles, and I felt considerable ambivalence about my predicament. The Secret Service had conducted the raids, so a part of me thought that I had incurred the wrath of the federal government. But conversely, I also thought that the feds would be unlocking a Pandora’s Box if they indicted me due to my first-hand knowledge of Spence’s illicit activities, which included the malfeasance of the Secret Service, high-ranking military personnel, congressmen, and at least one member of the presidential cabinet. And, of course, blackmail and the interstate trafficking of children. Richard greeted me at the door of his apartment with a cheerful hug. He was a tall, thin 53-year-old who appeared much older due to years of chain smoking and his unadulterated love of Jack Daniels. Although Richard’s speech and mannerisms were very polished and refined, his lifestyle had carved premature furrows on his face. Stepping into Richard’s apartment was like entering a time warp to the 1960s. The living room was sparsely furnished with an orange couch and an orange chair. Various trinkets from the Kennedy administration were tacked up on the light green walls of his living room. Books were stacked up towards the ceiling, and magazines dating back to the early 1960s overflowed the living room into the hallway. Although Richard’s apartment smelled like an ashtray, I was very grateful to him for providing me with a sanctuary. Richard had an insuppressible élan that made me feel I would prevail through my current dilemma, and he also possessed a great sense of humor. He often alluded to his mother’s vast fortune, and he frequently referred to being transported to a seemingly carefree nirvana “… when mother dies.” Richard was originally from Iowa, and I never knew whether or not his mother had a vast fortune, but “when mother dies” was a recurrent punch line to his witticisms and amusing anecdotes. Shortly after I arrived at Richard’s, both the Washington Post and the Washington Times phoned me, but I shunned their requests for interviews. I was slightly surprised that neither state nor federal law enforcement contacted me in the wake of the raids, which reinforced my belief that the government was too apprehensive to prosecute me due to the illicit malfeasance I had witnessed over the years.

When the government didn’t show an inclination to indict me, I continued running my escort service—albeit at a greatly reduced volume. I scaled back my business by 75 percent. Travis was game to resume answering the phones, so I rented an apartment for him that was near DuPont Circle. I had been at Richard’s for three months, and I hadn’t heard a word from the feds. After they lulled me into a false sense of security, I contacted the Secret Service, requesting that it unseal the house and apartment, and also return the items that it had impounded. The Secret Service, however, was inflexible and refused to unseal the house and apartment or return any of my possessions. Indeed, the Secret Service wasn’t even willing to return the presidential cufflinks that Paul Balach had given me. In June, the U.S. Attorney for the District of D.C., Jay Stephens, impaneled a grand jury to investigate my escort service and me. Stephens told the media that the crux of the investigation involved prostitution and credit card fraud. When I read that the investigation would focus on credit card fraud, I had the disconcerting answer to a lingering question that had truly baffled me: Tony’s request that I process credit cards. In 1989, the Secret Service was an arm of the Department of the Treasury, and it was tasked with investigating credit card fraud. After the U.S. Attorney announced that the grand jury would be largely investigating credit card fraud, I was suddenly stricken with the epiphany that Tony had led me down the primrose path of processing credit cards, so the Secret Service could control its investigation of me when it decided the time was ripe to take me down. The media reported I used umbrella organizations in Florida, West Virginia, and the D.C. area to process credit cards. I later learned that the credit card processing service in Miami, Florida was a front for a Secret Service sting. I’m fully cognizant of the fact that I can’t prove Tony’s existence, because he was essentially a phantom, or, perhaps, I should say, a spook. He wafted in and out of my life, and he was circumspect about not leaving his existential fingerprints. But without Tony’s intrusion, it doesn’t make sense that I would use a credit card processing service in Miami, Florida, that was a Secret Service front, because Robert was thoroughly willing to process credit cards for the 20 percent cut he received from their proceeds.

Shortly after the grand jury was impaneled, the feds initiated their reign of terror against my family, friends, and the patrons of my escort service, but, surprisingly, they largely left me alone. The Secret Service executed search warrants on my mother and sister. My mother and sister were living in Williamson when a Secret Service motorcade slowly and conspicuously rolled through the streets of Williamson. Secret Service agents wielding machine guns smashed through the front door of mother’s house and spent two hours ransacking her home. After Secret Service agents besieged my mother, they then besieged my sister and her husband with the same modus operandi. They smashed through the front door of their home, and, holding my brother-in-law at gunpoint, they ransacked their house. I had stashed a Macintosh, which stored all of my records, at my sister’s. When the Secret Service found the computer, my sister told me that one agent exclaimed: “We hit the mother lode!” The Washington Times reported on the campaign of terror and intimidation Secret Service agents unleashed on my mother and sister. But the Secret Service’s campaign of terror against my family didn’t conclude after its agents executed their search warrants. Secret Service agents made repeated visitations to my mother and sister after the initial raids on their homes. My mother decided to flee the mounting pressure, and she visited her siblings in San Antonio, Texas. By 1989, Aunt Emma Jean and Uncle Harold had joined Uncle Clarence in San Antonio, and my mother sought refuge with Aunt Emma Jean. Secret Service agents actually followed my mother to San Antonio and conspicuously parked across the street from Emma Jean’s house throughout my mother’s visit. My mother’s plight was truly heartbreaking for me. Throughout the years, as I sat at my desk answering the phones every night, I regularly phoned my mother, and we talked for hours. My problematic exodus from Williamson and her reimmersion in religion had strained our relationship, but my near nightly calls to her had positively reshaped our relationship. I think that she was much more aghast at the fact that I was running a gay escort service than at her brutalization by the Secret Service’s thuggery. Although my mother deeply loved me and accepted my heartfelt apologies, I felt acute anguish over her predicament. The Secret Service also extended its reign of terror to the escorts I employed and to some of my patrons.

The Secret Service also extended its reign of terror to the escorts I employed and to some of my patrons. During this period, a number of patrons phoned me and related tales of Secret Service intimidation. Secret Service agents had visited their homes and told their spouses that their husbands were patrons of my escort service. Patrons who had become personal friends, such as Alan Barron and Charles Dutcher, started distancing themselves from me. I eventually found myself under surveillance by, presumably, the Secret Service. Black sedans with tinted windows parked across the street from Richard’s apartment. They made absolutely no effort to conceal their surveillance, and it was woefully obvious to Richard too. But he was undaunted. “When mother dies” he said, “we’ll be able to disappear without a trace.” In addition to unleashing a reign of terror, the government started spinning a propaganda campaign to cover up the factual realities of my case. The U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia told the media that Washington D.C.’s Metro Police learned of my escort service, because a “local hotel” complained about suspected prostitution activities, and the Secret Service only became involved in the case to assist D.C.’s Metro Police Department in its investigation of credit card fraud. If the Secret Service was mobilized only after the Metro Police requested that it assist with a credit card fraud case, I find it rather mystifying that the Secret Service ultimately spearheaded the investigation. Since the February raid, I had shunned repeated attempts by the media to interview me, but the government’s reign of terror against my family and friends made me increasingly livid. So I finally dispensed a few choice quotes to the Washington Times. “Somebody set us up because they were scared about what we knew about high government officials. I think it’s because they wanted to get our files. We had some very big-name clients in all walks of life—on Capitol Hill, the military, and even the White House. You’d be surprise.… And anyways, if they do try to indict me, I’ll have some good stories to tell.” As I retreated from the maddening crowd at Richard’sapartment, I felt that the truth would eventually emerge itics that had swallowed me, even though I wasn’t quite sure if the truth would set me free or result in my premature demise.

But the enterprise of Spence et al. was so vast that I thought it would be nearly impossible to cover up. For example, the pedophile network operated by Spence and King was transcontinental in scope. Child welfare personnel in Nebraska attempted to expose the network, but their pleas were simply ignored by state law enforcement. A Nebraska senate subcommittee ultimately investigated King’s interstate exploitation of children. A rash of mysterious deaths, including the enigmatic death of the subcommittee’s investigator, followed in the wake of senators’ efforts, and both federal and state authorities would declare that King wasn’t involved in the abuse or pandering of a single child. At the end of June, the truth indeed started leaking out via the Washington Times, which initially struck me as an unlikely wellspring for the truth, because of the newspaper’s archconservative bent, and its partisan support for the Bush administration. The Washington Times managed to obtain a cache of credit card vouchers that had been processed by Robert through Professional Services, and the credit card vouchers presented its reporters with a constellation of names. Various clients phoned me, and much to their chagrin relayed that Washington Times reporters had recently contacted them. On June 29th, the Washington Times published a front-page article that focused on my escort service and also on Spence’s shenanigans. The banner headline read: “Homosexual Prostitution Inquiry Ensnares VIPs with Reagan, Bush.” And the headline was followed by a subheadline: “Callboys Took Midnight Tour of the White House.” The article’s first sentence read: “A homosexual prostitution ring is under investigation by federal and District authorities and includes among its clients key officials of the Reagan and Bush administrations, military officers, congressional aides and U.S. and foreign businessmen with close ties to Washington’s political elite…” The article’s second paragraph discussed one of Spence’s “middle-of-the-night” tours of the White House. Although the article didn’t directly name Spence, it remarked that the tour’s host was a “high-profile client” of my escort service. The Washington Times was certainly diverging from the government’s spin, because its reportage significantly deviated from the U.S. Attorney for D.C.’s stock response that the grand jury he impaneled in June to investigate me was primarily focusing credit card fraud and prostitution. In fact, the Washington Times article even mentioned that the U.S. Attorney for D.C., Jay Stephens, had a potential “conflict of interest” in his investigation of me due to the fact that he was the former deputy White House counsel to President Reagan, and the names of several of his “White House", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:80:0175f324fad3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2876, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 81, "text": "deviated from the U.S. Attorney for D.C.’s stock response that the grand jury he impaneled in June to investigate me was primarily focusing credit card fraud and prostitution.

The article also noted that the U.S. Attorney’s office stated that it would no longer cooperate with the Washington Times inquiry, even though it had initially consented to cooperate with the newspaper’s investigation. Unfortunately, the article outed Paul Balach and Charles Dutcher as homosexuals, which I thought was completely unnecessary. Paul immediately tendered his resignation as the Secretary of Labor’s political personnel liaison to the White House. We had lunch a few weeks after the article was published, and I felt terrible for him. He was absolutely devastated. Paul’s eyes welled with tears as he told me that he had been given the option of resigning or being fired. Paul’s career never recovered, and he eventually committed suicide. The next day, June 30th, the Washington Times launched a story about Spence’s blackmail enterprise that was complimented by a banner headline: “Power Broker Served Drugs, Sex At Parties Bugged For Blackmail.” The article’s first sentence certainly summed up some of my experiences with Spence: “Craig J. Spence, an enigmatic figure who threw glittery parties for key officials of the Reagan and Bush administrations, media stars and top military officers, bugged the gatherings to compromise guests and spent up to $20, 000 a month on male prostitutes, according to friends, acquaintances and records.” The article quoted various sources who were cognizant of Spence’s Kalorama home being wired for clandestine surveillance. Three of the people in the know included a “former bodyguard,” a former “Reagan administration official,” and a “friend” of Spence’s who discussed Spence “spying on guests” through the eight-foot two-way mirror in his living room. The article quoted a fourth individual, a “business associate” of Spence’s, who said of Spence: “He was taping and blackmailing people.” The article also commented on a discussion between two friends of Spence’s—CBS correspondent Liz Trotta and a Georgetown University law professor—who attended a party at his Kalorama home. The article said that they expressed their concerns to each other regarding Spence’s deteriorating physical condition and behavior. And later in the evening, Spence told them that he had been listening to their conversation, and he didn’t appreciate them talking behind his back. After the article illuminated Spence’s bugged home and his penchant for blackmail, it discussed his predilection for cocaine, noting that one of Spence’s friends described him as an unabashed “coke freak.” The article then discussed the blizzards", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:81:b3dd61107d67", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2877, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 82, "text": "The article said that they expressed their concerns to each other regarding Spence’s deteriorating physical condition and behavior.

After the article illuminated Spence’s bugged home and his penchant for blackmail, it discussed his predilection for cocaine, noting that one of Spence’s friends described him as an unabashed “coke freak.” The article then discussed the blizzards of cocaine that Spence used to regale his partygoers. The Washington Times heard conflicting accounts about the genesis of Spence’s cocaine connection. The newspaper reported that “several friends” said Spence boasted that U.S. military personnel smuggled the cocaine into the country from El Salvador, and other friends said that Spence acquired his stash of coke from “midlevel dealers” in D.C. The Washington Times article outed Spence as the puppeteer behind the late night tour of the White House too: “One man who was on the tour but asked not to be named for fear it would damage his business said it was cleared by a uniformed Secret Service guard whom the man had seen attending Mr. Spence’s parties as a bodyguard.” And the newspaper would later report on additional late night White House tours that were choreographed by Spence. Finally, the article alluded to Spence’s CIA connections, noting a “businessman” who dealt with Spence told reporters that Spence often bragged that he worked for the CIA. Spence would tell Washington Times reporters that the CIA employed him, and the newspaper would eventually have intelligence sources confirm that Spence was indeed a CIA asset. Moreover, Spence later told the Washington Times that “friendly” intelligence agents had installed the blackmail equipment in his home. The Washington Times articles on Spence validated that he spent up to $20, 000 a month for escorts, his home was wired for blackmail, Secret Service agents moonlighted as his bodyguards, and at least one Secret Service agent gave Spence late night access to the White House with an escort in tow. The newspaper confirmed many of the events that I had witnessed firsthand. The Washington Times eventually named a number of the powerbrokers who attended Spence’s Kalorama soirées. His guests were a veritable who’s who from the media and politics. Media pundits such as Eric Sevareid, Ted Koppel, and William Safire were in attendance at Spence’s parties. High-flying politicians—including Senators John Glenn of Ohio and Frank Murkowski of Alaska—attended his get-togethers too. Spence’s home was also a lure for various Republican movers and shakers, attracting former ambassadors Robert Neumann, Elliott Richardson, and James Lilly. Then-CIA Director William Casey and John Mitchell, the disgraced former attorney general under Richard Nixon, were personal friends of Spence who frequented his soirées. promised.

But on the other hand, many of Spence’s partygoers were lubricated on alcohol before they had illicit drugs and a wide variety of sexual playmates, including children, dangled in front of them. If his partygoers succumbed to their temptations, they were undoubtedly compromised. An individual merely discussing illegal activities in Spence’s home—like me—had the potential to be compromised. As the Washington Times bore deeper and deeper into the enigma of Spence, I was astonished to read about the eddies of his sordid life in black and white—on the front-page of a newspaper. The levy of lies that had suppressed the truth about Spence for years was starting crumble, and I pondered its implications for me. I felt that it would be difficult for the government to cover up Spence’s illicit activities now that the toothpaste was out of the tube. I also had a tendency to think that the government wouldn’t take a chance on indicting me, because a trial would only publicize Spence’s complicity with high-ranking federal officials and his connections to the Secret Service and perhaps even the CIA. But I wasn’t quite sure if the Washington Times’ articles about Spence enhanced my safety or endangered me. I felt a potential risk to my life was CIA Director William Casey’s patronage of my escort service. The Washington Times reported that William Casey attended parties at Spence’s house, and Casey and Spence were “friends,” but its reporters weren’t aware that their friendship had a common denominator that entailed procuring gay escorts from me. William Casey started to phone me for gay escorts in 1986. Like Barney Frank, his preferred escort was an eighteen-year-old with minimal body hair and a slender swimmer’s physique. Although he requested that I provide him with underage escorts, I told him that I wouldn’t acquiesce to that request. Casey met with the escorts at the Ritz-Carleton Hotel, when it was near DuPont Circle. After he was nude and splayed on a bed, he had the escorts rub oil over his body as he kissed and fondled them. Casey was old and withered, and the escorts didn’t particularly savor their encounters with him. Casey came to my attention, because he wasn’t able to have an erection, and the escorts that I employed were perplexed by both his elaborate rituals with the oil and his erectile dysfunction. Casey died of cancer in May of 1987, so, when the Washington Times started to break stories about Spence and my escort service, Casey had drifted to the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:83:4e02a433bd60", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2879, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 84, "text": "kissed and fondled them.

Casey died of cancer in May of 1987, so, when the Washington Times started to break stories about Spence and my escort service, Casey had drifted to the hereafter. Nevertheless, I was worried that his CIA cronies would want to bury his secret dalliances with young men—even if that involved burying me. I believe that the government responded to the Washington Times articles about Spence with a propaganda counter-offensive mounted by the Washington Post. The Washington Post’s first assault on the Washington Times was a protracted article, “The Shadow World of Craig Spence,” published in the middle of July, and it was a concerted effort to dismantle the Washington Times reportage on Spence. The article mocked the earlier headline floated by the Washington Times—”Power Broker Served Drugs, Sex at Parties Bugged for Blackmail”—by providing the veritable, unadulterated truth about Spence’s get-togethers: “People sat around in a perimeter after dinner discussing trade policy, where American policy makers were ushered into circles of foreign visitors to make serious talk; parties to which Koppel would sometimes send a stand-in; parties so dull that even Dossier magazine wouldn’t run the photographs.” The Washington Post even recycled quotes from a profile of Spence it had published in 1980: “Not since Ethel Kennedy used to give her famous Hickory Hill seminars for great minds of our times during the days of Camelot has anyone staged seminars successfully on a continuing social basis in Washington.” I don’t doubt that Spence hosted drab cocktail parties and seminars, but he also hosted no holds barred orgies. The Post neglected to mention that the Washington Times collected irrefutable proof in the form of credit card vouchers that Spence spent up to $20, 000 a month on escorts from my escort service. I seriously doubt that Ethel Kennedy spent up to $20, 000 a month on male prostitutes. The Post’s “The Shadow World of Craig Spence” also dismantled the idea that Spence’s house was bugged for blackmail, but its hatchet job was transparently disingenuous. The Post deployed a contrivance it coined the “skeptical guest” to debunk the notion that Spence’s home had clandestine surveillance. The Post’s “skeptical guest” was an unnamed source, and the Post even neglected to mention the source’s gender or his or her relationship to Spence. According to the Post, the “skeptical guest” was in attendance at a party in Spence’s Kalorama home when a friend of Spence’s, CBS correspondent Liz Trotta, “got down on her hands and knees in the living room and found wires and cables all over the room at floor level. She", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:84:b0f6aa81a634", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2880, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 85, "text": "Spence’s home had clandestine surveillance.

She also found metal fasteners that could have been listening devices, she says, clipped to the bottom of a coffee table. A skeptical guest who witnessed this—who was familiar with the architecture and furnishings—said that one of the so-called bugs was a button-release on the table and that to his knowledge, there were no bugs.” Given the onslaught of erroneous press I’ve received over the years, I’m reluctant to ascribe inordinate intelligence to many in the media, but common sense would dictate that a veteran CBS correspondent could distinguish a bug from a “button-release” on a table. But, perhaps, because of the skeptical guest’s expertise on “architecture and furnishings,” he or she was able to provide the Post with the definitive truth? I’ve previously mentioned a Washington Times article that discussed former CBS correspondent Liz Trotta and a Georgetown University law professor Richard Gordon discussing Spence’s fading health during a party at his home, and Spence later expressing his umbrage to them for nattering behind his back. The Post’s “skeptical guest” just happened to attend that party too. And once more, the Post relayed the unequivocal truth from the perspective of the skeptical guest: “Spence confronted them later that night. ‘I heard every word you said,’ Gordon recalls Spence saying. ‘You’re conspiring against me. I’ve got this corner bugged.’ And then he pointed to the ceiling. ‘There was never a bug hanging over Professor Gordon’s head,’ says the same skeptical guest, who was also at that party. Another person there says that it was so obvious that Gordon and Trotta were gossiping about Spence all night he would not have needed bugs to guess what they were saying.” (I have to agree with the “skeptical guest” on at least one point: the “bug” probably wasn’t “hanging” over Trotta and Gordon’s heads. It was most likely embedded in a light fixture or the crown molding.) After the Post deployed the skeptical guest and “another person” to debunk the fact that Spence’s house was bugged for blackmail, it descended into a rather absurd commentary: “Some believe that Spence may have been up to something with the electronic equipment that friends observed in the house. But Spence’s clairvoyance, it seems, was strongest when his bodyguards were present and within earshot of the supposedly bugged conversations.” So now the Post acknowledged that Spence had “electronic equipment” in his home, even though in the preceding paragraph", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:85:8387389974b9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2881, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 86, "text": "and “another person” to debunk the fact that Spence’s house was bugged for blackmail, it descended into a rather absurd commentary: “Some believe that Spence may have been up to something with the electronic equipment that friends observed in the house.

The Post wanted to have its cake and eat it too by conceding that Spence had electronic equipment in his home, but ridiculing the fact that his home was bugged. And the Post’s remark about Spence’s “clairvoyance” being heightened when his bodyguards were within “earshot” was rather disingenuous too. The Post doesn’t question why Spence had a need for bodyguards. But in all likelihood, Spence needed constant protection, because he was the point man for blackmailing some of the most powerful men in the country—powerful men who almost certainly had access to their own thugs. Given Spence’s penchant for blackmailing the powerful, I think his longevity had the potential to be violently curtailed if his private Praetorian Guard didn’t vigilantly safeguard him. Later in the article, the Post described Spence’s bodyguards as “clean-cut college guys who also tended bar, parked cars and drove Spence around. Spence later started hiring Army men and Marines, especially large, well-built ones.” I’m aware of Spence collecting bodyguards from the military, but the article made no mention of Spence’s bodyguards being pulled from the ranks of the Secret Service, even though the Washington Times had been meticulous about nailing down that Spence had Secret Service agents moonlighting as his bodyguards. The Post’s “The Shadow World of Craig Spence” portrayed him as a high society bottom feeder who was more of a name-dropper than a powerbroker with high powered connections, and the article also attempted to dispel the notion that he was affiliated with the CIA. The article caricaturized Spence by having his friends discuss his rants of self-importance and name-dropping, which wouldn’t be too difficult. After the Post made Spence appear as a mere cartoon character it dropped in the following paragraph: “Like the tales of espionage, the allegations about bugging were a regular subject of discussion among his friends. And again, they got their information from him [Spence].” A week after the Washington Post demolished the Washington Times’ reportage on Spence’s illicit activities, I found myself in the Post’s character assassination crosshairs. Earlier in July, in the wake of the initial Washington Times articles, I granted the Post an interview, because I sincerely thought it was taking the torch from the Washington Times and following a parallel avenue of inquiry. But the Post’s article on me, “From", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:86:4d94c78546e3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2882, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 87, "text": "his friends.

Earlier in July, in the wake of the initial Washington Times articles, I granted the Post an interview, because I sincerely thought it was taking the torch from the Washington Times and following a parallel avenue of inquiry. But the Post’s article on me, “From Small-Roots, a Big City Scandal,” expended considerable ink dismantling my credibility, and it was also riddled with falsehoods. The article’s second paragraph dredged up the fallacious cover story about my exodus from Williamson. “First the 25-yearold funeral director was charged with making harassing phone calls to a competing funeral home. Later the state claimed he was overcharging on pauper funerals. Then there was the small matter of the exhumed coal miner’s remains he didn’t rebury for 42 days. He finally left town.” And, unfortunately, that was only the Post’s initial character assassination salvo. The Post reported that the Mingo County prosecutor had given me the option of being charged with “misappropriating state funds” or resign as the Mingo County Medical Examiner, which is an absolute falsehood. I opted to resign as the Mingo County Medical Examiner, because I faced the specious misdemeanor of making harassing phone calls to the Ball Funeral Home, which I’ve previously explained. The Post then reported that I said I left Williamson on the day I resigned as Mingo County Medical Examiner—yet another falsehood. I continued to run the Vinson Funeral Home after I resigned as the Medical Examiner. The Post also inserted bald-faced lies when it discussed my introduction into the escort business. The article reported that my entrée was answering an escort ad in the Washington Blade for Don’s Capitol Escorts! The Post reportedly interviewed Donald Schey, who was the proprietor of Don’s Capitol Escorts, and Schey reportedly said that I was one of his “busiest escorts.” I find this account mindboggling due to the fact that I’ve never even met Donald Schey. The Post then reported that in 1987 I took over answering “Schey’s telephones for a fee.” And then I made my leap to being the proprietor of an escort service later that year when I bought a “service” for ^(′′)$2, 000^(′′) from a man who was dying of AIDS. The only morsel of truth in the Post’s account of me becoming a D.C. madam was that I bought an escort service from a man dying of AIDS. The Post then injected a whopping lie when it purportedly quoted me: “’I’ve had sex before with people who came to put in the telephone, but that doesn’t mean C&P [telephone company] is into prostitution—and they charge $45 for a 15-minute installation,’ said Vinson.” It’s certainly not my intention to disparage telephone linemen, but", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:87:3e2fbe59ce85", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2883, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 88, "text": "morsel of truth in the Post’s account of me becoming a D.C. madam was that I bought an escort service from a man dying of AIDS.

In the paragraph where the Post discusses my scheming to monopolize Washington’s gay escort services, it said that I agreed to process credit cards for other services, including “Metro Date,” which was a “service” I had previously attempted to purchase. Yet again the Post’s reportage derailed itself from reality—I started Metro Date! The article reported that I “bought an expensive new sports car and mailed $500 a month home” to my mother. The Post’s latter comments are outright lies. I drove my 280Z to Washington, D.C., and I never sold it or traded it in for “an expensive new sports car.” Moreover, I never sent my mother $500 a month. My mother’s various business ventures and real estate holdings had made her a millionaire, so it just doesn’t add up that I would send her $500 a month. I could cite additional lies in “From Small-Roots, a Big City Scandal,” but I think it’s evident that the Post’s article on me was not fair and impartial, or, for that matter, even truthful. The Washington Post’s denouement to stamp its imprimatur on the cover up of Spence’s activities, “The Bombshell That Didn’t Explode; Behind the Times’ ‘Scoop’ and Press Coverage of the Call-Boy Ring,” was published in early August. This article had the same cynical tone and tenor as the Post’s previous articles, but now the newspaper conscripted the Los Angeles Times and New York Times to jump on its bandwagon. “We checked into it; we sent reporters out when they raided the house in February and again when they had the eviction,” said the Washington bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times. “We never did turn up with anything that looked like a national story.” After the Post quoted the Los Angeles Times bureau chief, the New York Times’ Washington bureau chief endorsed the Post’s spin. “I don’t take the Washington Times seriously as a journalistic entity, so I view with suspicion almost anything that they do,” he said. “I don’t deny a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:88:1652da5d723f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2884, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 89, "text": "in February and again when they had the eviction,” said the Washington bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times. “We never did turn up with anything that looked like a national story.” After the Post quoted the Los Angeles Times bureau chief, the New York Times’ Washington bureau chief endorsed the Post’s spin. “I don’t take the Washington Times seriously as a journalistic entity, so I view with suspicion almost anything that they do,” he said. “I don’t deny a raid on this house and that there’s obviously some kind of investigation going on. But so far I haven’t seen any evidence that it means what they say it means.” In addition to the New York Times and Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post buttressed its propaganda campaign with sources that were delighted to reinforce its disinformation—government sources. The Post wrote of its first source: “… a key law enforcement official came to lunch at the Post and assured the staff that the investigation was primarily on credit card fraud.” As I recall, several administration officials, including the U.S. attorney general, were telling the media that Watergate was much ado about nothing, so I find it perplexing that the Post was all ears about Spence’s blackmail enterprise, but it was vehement when contesting the administration’s official position about Watergate. The Post’s “The Bombshell That Didn’t Explode” article weighed in on the newspaper’s meticulous reporting on its Spence profile—“The Shadow World of Craig Spence.” The Post’s editor of the “Style section,” where the Spence article was published, expressed his kudos for the story, saying that the Post “took the time to get [the story] done the way it ought to be done, and I’m very proud of the story—a very interesting, sophisticated, classic Style story on a very interesting Washington phenomenon.” Perhaps the Style section was the right fit for the Spence article, because I’m not aware of the Post having a Powerbroker Blackmail section. ony vanished two or three months before the Secret Service raids, and Spence, too, would ultimately recede. But his vanishing act would culminate in a surreal sequence of events that was patently Craig Spence. After the federal grand jury investigating me served Spence with a subpoena, he scrambled to whereabouts unknown. While Spence was AWOL, various accounts had him surfacing in Florida, Boston, and New Hampshire. In July, Spence materialized in New York City with a near bang: the NYPD arrested him for possession of a handgun, cocaine, and a crack pipe. Spence was ensconced at Manhattan’s upscale Barbizon Hotel on the Upper East Side, smoking crack with a 22-year-old male prostitute, which was certainly a consistent pattern of behavior for him. Spence then placed a frantic 911 call.

Spence then placed a frantic 911 call. The NYPD officers who reportedly responded to the call bounced into Spence as he darted out of his hotel room. “This guy Craig Spence comes running out of the room screaming that the other guy has a gun,” one of the responding NYPD officers told a reporter. “Spence claimed the kid had taken the gun and intimidated him and snatched $6, 000 out of his hand.” The NYPD charged Spence with criminal possession of a pistol and possession of an illegal drug, and he was thrown in downtown Manhattan’s “the Tombs,” a vast jail that serves as a repository for those awaiting arraignment or trial. Three days after his arrest, Spence was released on his own recognizance, but he was staring at an eight-year sentence. I harken back to the Washington Post comparing Craig Spence and his seminars to Ethel Kennedy and her seminars, but I don’t ever recall reading a newspaper account about Ethel Kennedy being arrested for possession of a handgun and crack cocaine. In the wake of Spence’s arrest in New York, a pair of Washington Times reporters scurried to New York City, and they eventually found Spence at a friend’s posh East Side apartment. The reporters noted that the powerbroker had fallen on hard times: he wore a grubby white knit shirt, crumpled khakis, and ramshackle Reebok running shoes, and he was uncharacteristically unshaven. Spence eventually gave the reporters a protracted interview that was bizarre even by Spence’s standards, which were indeed bizarre. During the interview, Spence clenched a dispenser of double-edge razor blades. He ultimately dispensed one of the razor blades, and used it to caress his arms. Spence then shoved the razorblade toward the chests of the reporters. “I am not a person to fool with,” he snapped. “You should know that by now.” When Spence finished threatening the reporters with the razorblade, he embarked on an extended soliloquy of self-importance that was quite familiar to me. He mentioned that he had performed a myriad of assignments for the CIA, and his assignments were critical to covert actions in Vietnam, Japan, Central America, and the Middle East. “How do you think a little faggot like me moved in the circles I did?” Spence asked. “It’s because I had contacts at the highest levels of this government. They’ll deny it, but how do they make me go away when so many of them have been at my house, at my parties, and at my side?” Spence wasn’t enthusiastic about testifying before the grand jury that was investigating me.

He told the reporters that he would “never be brought back alive” to testify before the grand jury. Spence managed to live below the media’s radar for a few months after his debacle in New York City. In October, however, he threw an extravagant birthday party for himself in D.C., and fortunately I wasn’t invited. “The rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated,” he said to his friends at the party. Shortly after his birthday party, Spence delivered a “video postcard” to various friends and associates. In the video, Spence was seated on a leather chair in his dining room, and he waxed philosophic about the government, intelligence community, and life’s changing fortunes. He also parceled out a parable about the intelligence fraternity: “Some of you may know when it comes to the intelligence community, there is no such thing as coincidence. Now, I’m not sure I’ve seen the whole picture yet myself.” Spence eventually ended his “video postcard” with buoyant nationalism: “I’ll close by telling you I’m sure that in the end the truth will come out, and this too will pass. Now, I may be naïve about my optimism, but I’m an American, proud of my country, and confident of the fairness of its people. So take heart, good friends, and share that pride and that confidence with me. Good night and God bless.” A few weeks later, Spence’s lifeless body was found in a hotel room at Boston’s Ritz-Carlton. He wore a black tuxedo, white shirt, bow tie, white suspenders, black socks, and shoes. Next to Spence’s body was a newspaper clipping about then-CIA Director William Webster’s attempts to protect CIA agents who were summoned to testify before government inquiries. Spence also taped a suicide note on the room’s mirror: “Chief, consider this my resignation, effective immediately. As you always said, you can’t ask others to make a sacrifice if you are not ready to do the same. Life is duty. God bless America.” The suicide note also had an uncharacteristically considerate afterthought: “To the Ritz, please forgive this inconvenience.” I only wish Spence had been that polite when he inhabited the world of living. The letter taped to the mirror ended with a Japanese phrase: “Nisei Bei,” which means second-generation American. So on the threshold of death, Spence finally confessed to his humble origins.

I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that the U.S. attorney for D.C. took an inordinate interest in Spence’s death. Although the Boston Medical Examiner’s Office routinely released the cause of people’s death within days of their passing, a top-ranking Boston city official said that the U.S. Attorney for D.C. requested that Spence’s death certificate not be released. A second But a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney was mum about the U.S. attorney’s unorthodox demand: “The investigation is ongoing before the grand jury. I cannot make any comment about it.” The Secret Service was the government entity that did the heavy lifting to cover up Spence’s activities with regards to threats and intimidation, but, as I will later explain, the U.S. attorney for D.C. was the government entity that finessed the cover up. The Internet is rife with speculation that Spence was murdered or “suicided,” but I’m not of that belief. Spence was dying of AIDS, and it’s evident to me that the shadowy network that had floated his ultra-posh lifestyle, and also his vast expenditures on escorts, drugs, and bodyguards had rescinded its finances, because he had become too dysfunctional. So suicide was essentially his only option. After my personal interactions with Spence, I came to the conclusion that his shadowy network was affiliated with the CIA, or perhaps a rogue element within the CIA. It was almost effortless for the Washington Post to annihilate Spence’s credibility, because he had become an absolute lunatic in his final days. I’ll be the first to admit that Spence was never the paragon of mental health, but before he plunged into crack addiction he had the potential to be remarkably cogent despite his seismic narcissism and amoral personality. Spence’s cogency was evinced by the various feats he managed to accomplish, and his amoral personality was an occupational requisite for a blackmail artist who procured men, women, and even children for his blackmail targets. The Washington Post focused on Spence’s personal confessions, government disavowals, and such contrivances as the “skeptical guest” when debunking Spence’s intelligence connections and his blackmail activities. The newspaper conveniently omitted or ignored the numerous sources that had been painstakingly amassed by the Washington Times concerning Spence’s intelligence connections and his blackmail activities, and also the fact that the Washington Times had intelligence sources confirm that Spence was indeed a CIA asset. I also have a tendency to think that William Casey’s involvement with both Spence and gay escorts is perhaps additional corroboration that Spence’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:92:3917d8098597", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2888, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 93, "text": "the “skeptical guest” when debunking Spence’s intelligence connections and his blackmail activities.

I also have a tendency to think that William Casey’s involvement with both Spence and gay escorts is perhaps additional corroboration that Spence’s blackmail activities were affiliated with the CIA. I’ve had years, in and out of prison, to ponder the maelstrom of skullduggery and intrigue that overwhelmed me like a tsunami, and also the Washington Post’s cover up of Spence’s crimes. I’m not a “conspiracy theorist,” but rather I’m someone whom the vagaries of fate placed near the epicenter of sprawling conspiracy. I think I’ve demonstrated that the Washington Post aided and abetted the government’s cover up of Spence’s enterprise, and over the years I’ve come across a very interesting relationship between the Washington Post and the CIA as I’ve attempted to understand the conspiracy that engulfed me. Shortly after the CIA was formed in 1948, the agency initiated Operation Mockingbird, which was a campaign to influence popular perception through various front organizations and the media in the United States and abroad. Frank Wisner, head of the CIA’s Office of Policy Coordination, oversaw Operation Mockingbird, and Wisner boasted that he was the maestro of a “mighty Wurlitzer” that was “capable of playing any propaganda tune he desired.” The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America, published by Harvard University Press, provides a sweeping overview of Operation Mockingbird. But a second book, Katharine the Great, written by former Village Voice journalist Deborah Davis, is a biographical sketch of Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, and it focuses specifically on the clandestine connections between the CIA and Washington Post. According to Katharine the Great and numerous sources, the CIA’s Frank Wisner tapped then-Washington Post publisher Philip Graham to be the CIA’s Operation Mockingbird point man to infiltrate the media. Graham in which they conferred about the availability and prices of journalists: “You could get a journalist cheaper than a good call girl, for a couple hundred dollars a month.” (I’ve often heard the comparison between journalists and prostitutes, but I think that comparison potentially denigrates the profession of prostitution. Most prostitutes aren’t willing to destroy a life to turn a trick, but many journalists will handily destroy a life to land a story—even if the story is about trivial nonsense.) “By the early 1950s,” Davis wrote in Katharine the Great, “Wisner ‘owned’ respected members of the New York Times, Newsweek, CBS, and other communications vehicles, plus stringers, four to six hundred in all, according to a former CIA analyst.” Davis also noted that Philip Graham stocked the Washington Post with writers and editors who had", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:93:68c81af11e2a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2889, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 94, "text": "a life to turn a trick, but many journalists will handily destroy a life to land a story—even if the story is about trivial nonsense.) “By the early 1950s,” Davis wrote in Katharine the Great, “Wisner ‘owned’ respected members of the New York Times, Newsweek, CBS, and other communications vehicles, plus stringers, four to six hundred in all, according to a former CIA analyst.” Davis also noted that Philip Graham stocked the Washington Post with writers and editors who had “intelligence backgrounds.” In addition to spotlighting the relationship between the CIA and Philip Graham, Davis examined the connections between the CIA and Ben Bradlee, the Washington Post’s executive editor from 1968 to 1991. Bradlee was the executive editor of the Post during the newspaper’s exposure of Watergate and also when it covered up Spence’s network. Bradlee has been portrayed as the Post’s salty editor who spurred on the “boys”—Woodward and Bernstein’s—quest for truth as they toppled the Nixon administration. But Davis reported on a different side of former naval intelligence officer Ben Bradlee. Bradlee was a descendant of Boston bluebloods, and he landed at the Washington Post as a young reporter in 1948. After three years at the Post, Davis reported that Graham pulled a few strings to help Bradlee become a press attaché stationed at the U.S. embassy in Paris. While in France, Bradlee developed a number of overt, yet interesting, ties to the CIA. He divorced his first wife and married Antoinette Pinchot, whose sister was married to CIA agent Cord Meyer. Davis asserts Meyer was a “principal operative” in Operation Mockingbird. Bradlee’s new wife was also a close friend of the CIA’s James Jesus Angleton who at the time was responsible for the collection of foreign intelligence in Europe. Angleton was later chief of the CIA’s Counterintelligence for more than twenty years. I’ve personally experienced guilt by association, and I’ve concluded that it’s often an ill-fated formula for speculation. But in the first printing of Katharine the Great, Davis wrote that Bradlee “produced CIA material” when he was a press attaché in Paris. According to Davis, Bradlee churned out CIA propaganda regarding the Rosenbergs’ case as a response to the French newspaper, Le Monde, which ran a story declaring that the U.S. had framed Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, who were the couple accused of imparting A-bomb secrets to the Soviets and sentenced to death. The Le Monde article outraged the CIA chief in Paris, because the agency was having difficulties selling the Cold War to a European public who feared that the McCarthy witch-hunts were ushering in a new wave of fascism. After Bradlee read Katharine the Great, he quickly dispatched a threatening letter to Davis’ publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, one of the largest book publishers in the world. Bradlee’s letter made some very unbecoming statements about Davis: “Miss Davis is lying … I never produced CIA", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:94:9f89aeab9855", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2890, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 95, "text": "article outraged the CIA chief in Paris, because the agency was having difficulties selling the Cold War to a European public who feared that the McCarthy witch-hunts were ushering in a new wave of fascism.

Bradlee’s letter made some very unbecoming statements about Davis: “Miss Davis is lying … I never produced CIA material … what I can do is to brand Miss Davis as a fool and to put your company in that special little group of publishers who don’t give a shit for the truth.” William Jovanovich, president and CEO of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, apparently didn’t want to be branded in that “little group of publishers who don’t give a shit for the truth” by one of the most powerful newspapers in the country, so he ordered 20,000 copies of Katharine the Great to be destroyed, even though the Harcourt Brace Jovanovich catalog announced that Katharine the Great would be their top non-fiction selection and the publisher even nominated the book for an American Book Award. After Jovanovich turned 20,000 of Katharine the Great into pulp, he received a letter from Katharine the Great: “The whole theme of the book is so fanciful,” wrote Katharine Graham, “that it defies serious discussion: that Ben, Phil (her deceased husband), and others worked for the CIA …” Davis sued Harcourt Brace for breach of contract. The case was eventually settled, and the rights for the book reverted back to Davis, but she couldn’t find a major publisher who had the nerve to flirt with Katharine the Great. Finally, about seven years later, a small publisher in D.C. republished the book. In the interim, Davis sent several Freedom of Information Act requests to the government and landed some interesting documentation from the State Department about the fact that Bradlee “produced CIA material.” The State Department documents uncovered by Davis stated that three days after the Le Monde article appeared, the Paris CIA chief dispatched Bradlee to New York to collect documentation from the federal prosecutors on the Rosenberg case, so the CIA could mount a counter-offensive in the European press. Bradlee ultimately wrote a 30,000-word rundown and analysis of the government’s case against the Rosenbergs with the CIA’s topspin. After Bradlee’s tenure as a press attaché, he became a Paris-based foreign correspondent for Newsweek. I’ve already mentioned Davis reporting that the CIA’s Wisner said he “owned” several media outlets, including Newsweek. In 1957, Bradlee returned to the United States, and he continued to write for Newsweek as a Washington bureau correspondent. Bradlee’s career at Newsweek took an upward but enigmatic twist in 1961.

The cover story purports that Newsweek was up for sale, and Bradlee made a late night phone call to a man he barely knew—Philip Graham—and inquired if Graham wanted to purchase Newsweek. It just so happened that Graham thought it was an outstanding idea, and seventeen days later he shelled out $15 million to acquire Newsweek. He then made Bradlee Newsweek’s Washington bureau chief. After Graham’s suicide in 1963, Graham’s widow eventually bestowed the title of managing editor of the Washington Post on Bradlee in 1965. (Interestingly, Frank Wisner committed suicide two years after Philip Graham.) Church Committee hearings that investigated a plethora of domestic and foreign crimes committed by the CIA. Although Bernstein wrote his Rolling Stone article under the auspices of uncovering the Church Committee’s cover up between the CIA and media, I believe it’s within the realm of reason that Bernstein’s article covered up the Washington Post’s links to the CIA. Bernstein’s Rolling Stone article made no mention of Bradlee’s ties to the CIA, and, in fact, almost exonerates the Washington Post staff of any ties to the CIA: “All editors-in-chief and managing editors of the Post since 1950 say they knew of no formal Agency relationship with either stringers or members of the Post staff. ‘If anything was done it was done by Phil without our knowledge,’ said one. Agency officials, meanwhile, make no claim that Post staff members have had covert affiliations with the Agency while working for the paper.” Ironically, if it were not for the conservative Washington Times with its neo-religious, anti-homosexual slant, I would have zero corroboration about the blackmail enterprise of Spence et al. I forgot to mention that the Reverend Sun Myung Moon owned the Washington Times, and I think it’s a rather sad commentary on the American media when a Moonie-owned media outlet is the only news source providing Americans with the truth about a blackmail enterprise that’s subverting their political system. Meanwhile, as I was ensconced at Richard’s apartment, the grand jury that was “investigating” me wendedthrough the summer, winter, and into the spring of 1990. I became exceedingly perplexed by the duration of the grand jury.

My mother and sister were also sent letters that threatened to indict them. I ultimately came to the conclusion that the authorities overseeing my case were scheming to isolate me, and the government’s tactics of uncertainty and intimidation were taking a toll on my emotional wellbeing. I started to suffer from insomnia, and I eventually acquired a prescription for Xanax to help me sleep. As I would learn, the grand jury process has the potential to be seriously flawed, even though the phrase “grand jury” has authoritative connotations—like the gods on Mount Olympus have sent down a decree. A grand jury makes the initial decision to indict (formally accuse) a criminal defendant to stand trial. But unlike a standard trial, a grand jury proceeding is cloaked in secrecy: Grand juries aren’t open to the public, and the identity of the witnesses who testify and the content of their testimony are never disclosed. Moreover, there is no cross-examination or presentation of the defense’s case. The special prosecutor of a grand jury calls the witnesses, questions the witnesses, and selects the evidence that is shown to the grand jurors, and grand jurors are normal, everyday citizens who have shown up for jury duty and have been funneled to a grand jury. Generally, only witnesses and evidence deemed relevant by special prosecutors are presented, and special prosecutors are in a unique position to influence grand jurors’ judgments in a particular direction. Commenting about the powers of persuasion a special prosecutor has over grand jurors, a former chief appellate judge of New York state once famously remarked that a special prosecutor could persuade grand jurors to “indict a ham sandwich.” Jay Stephens, the U.S. Attorney for D.C., appointed Alan Strasser, the Assistant U.S. Attorney for D.C. and chief of the felony trial division, to be the special prosecutor of the grand jury investigating me. Strasser received his bachelor’s degree in economics from Yale University in 1974, and he was a 1977 graduate of Harvard Law School. He joined the office of U.S. Attorney for D.C. in 1980. Despite Strasser’s lofty academic credentials, the grand jury he directed served a ham and swiss on rye to the public. He never called Robert, Jimmy, Travis, or me to testify before the grand jury that was ostensibly investigating our operation of an escort service. At the time, I thought it was rather odd. I’m also not aware of Strasser calling the escorts I employed to testify. Unfortunately, my mother was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury.

Although I processed a modest number of credit cards through her ambulance service, she had zero knowledge about the operations of my escort service. The ever-dogged reporters of the Washington Times questioned many of Spence’s partygoers and other individuals who were enmeshed with Spence. The reporters even managed to ferret out witnesses who had been called before the grand jury, and some of them broke their vows of secrecy on the condition that the Washington Times grant them anonymity. A Washington Times article, commenting on the grand jury’s intrigues, confirmed my lingering suspicion that the grand jury proceeding was a ham and swiss on rye. The article revealed that the newspaper’s reporters had contacted “a number of principal witnesses and active participants in the case” and “discovered that few of them had been interviewed, and only a handful had Washington Times reporters interviewed “a longtime acquaintance of Mr. Spence’s” who had been called before the grand jury. The article mentioned that he “had spent considerable time as a guest in his [Spence’s] home,” and he was “a participant in one of the late-night White House tours.” The Washington Times reported that the “witness was not asked any questions about credit cards, Mr. Spence’s alleged involvement with the homosexual call-boy ring or about the ring itself.” The witness told the reporters that one of the grand jury’s primary concerns was establishing if Spence had been in the possession of purloined White House china that dated back to the Truman administration. Spence was involved in pandering children, pandering adults, blackmailing powerbrokers, procuring illicit drugs, etc., so I find it mindboggling that one of the grand jury’s primary concerns was whether or not he had absconded with some of the White House’s Truman china. The Washington Times even commented about the grand jury being askew: “The grand jury investigation begun in June by U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens was described as a ‘credit card’ probe. It is not clear, however, how vigorous federal prosecutors have been nor where the case may be headed.” The Washington Times article that questioned the vigor of federal prosecutors in the grand jury proceedings sought answers from Jay Stephens and Alan Strasser, but its reporters hit a firewall when both refused to comment.

In July of 1989, Van Susteren’s office was located on 22nd Street Northwest near DuPont Circle. Ironically, her office was about a block from Shooters. Driving to her office the morning of our initial meeting, I distinctly remember the radiant sun, azure sky, and gentle breeze. Despite the near perfect weather, I felt suffocated by anxiety and worries as I watched the denizens of D.C. absorbing the pristine morning. I longed for a life that allowed me to appreciate a beautiful day, and I hoped Van Susteren would enable me to restore my life to normalcy. Van Susteren’s office was housed on the second floor of a three-story brownstone. A receptionist greeted me as I walked in, and she directed me to a sofa. The reception area had hardwood floors, beige walls, and an austere decorum. When I sat on the sofa, I glanced at an adjacent end table that was arrayed with magazines. As I contemplated paging through a magazine, Van Susteren strolled into the reception area and amicably introduced herself. She was short, casually dressed in blue jeans, and she had a thick mane of blond hair. Shortly after we made eye contact, I noticed her asymmetrical smile. We exchanged a brief introduction, and I followed Van Susteren into her office. After I sat down in a well-cushioned chair in front of Van Susteren’s desk, she seated herself behind her desk. Her office had the same austere decorum as the reception room. The beige walls displayed her various degrees, and I noticed three or four cardboard boxes, filled with files, resting on the floor next to her desk. She came across as very sharp and articulate, and I was quite impressed. She gave me an overview of her education and some of her prior cases. Van Susteren discussed her judicial pedigree—her father had been a judge. But she neglected to tell me that her father was also the best friend of crazy Joe McCarthy and his campaign manager for the U.S. Senate. As she spoke, I was transfixed by the asymmetry of her mouth. Our initial meeting lasted about three hours, and I described the nuances of my life over the preceding", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:99:e2cd466a506a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2895, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 100, "text": "gave me an overview of her education and some of her prior cases. Van Susteren discussed her judicial pedigree—her father had been a judge. But she neglected to tell me that her father was also the best friend of crazy Joe McCarthy and his campaign manager for the U.S. Senate. As she spoke, I was transfixed by the asymmetry of her mouth. Our initial meeting lasted about three hours, and I described the nuances of my life over the preceding three years. I explained the connection between Spence and the Secret Service. I discussed the relationship between Spence and Tony, and elucidated their blackmail enterprise. I named several powerful and affluent men who procured escorts either through me or through Spence, and I edified Van Susteren about the pedophile network that was operated by Spence and King. In addition, I mentioned the threat that had been parsed out to me by a member of George H.W. Bush’s cabinet. I handed her credit card receipts, copies of checks, and lists of my clients too. After I provided Van Susteren with a comprehensive panorama of everything I had witnessed, I was surprised that she didn’t seem distressed or stunned by my disclosures. Indeed, she seemed to remain emotionally flat-lined throughout my revelations. She said that she had previously handled sensitive cases like mine in federal court, and she told me that the government would be averse to baring such sordid details in court—she felt that I would most likely end up with probation. Van Susteren impressed me with her aplomb and also with her quick, snappy answers to my numerous questions, so I left her office feeling a sense of tranquility that I hadn’t experienced in months. Later in July, the Washington Post published its mendacious, “From Small-Roots, a Big City Scandal,” and I reassessed if Van Susteren was the right lawyer for me. After all, a Washington Post reporter had steered my mother to her. In fact, the Washington Post article left me quite ambivalent about who I should trust, and I reassessed my relationships with just about everyone in my life. For a few weeks, I tussled with the question of whether or not I should continue to retain Van Susteren, but I ultimately deluded myself into thinking that the Washington Post reporter had probably heard of Van Susteren due to her excellent reputation. The stress of my predicament and the negative press had left me emotionally threadbare. I desperately wanted to have faith in her. Van Susteren and I kept in touch on a regular basis as the grand jury wended into the summer of the following year. After the grand jury had been impaneled for a year, I started to have an extremely uneasy feeling. But Van Susteren repeatedly assured me that I was most likely eyeing probation.

After the grand jury had been impaneled for a year, I started to have an extremely uneasy feeling. But Van Susteren repeatedly assured me that I was most likely eyeing probation. She said that if I were indicted, she would make a motion for the government to release a list of my clients, and that would force the government to be reconciliatory towards me. On the second to last weekend in July of 1990, I flew to Williamson and spent the weekend with my mother, and Van Susteren phoned on Sunday. She said that the grand jury had indicted me, but she wasn’t privy to the charges, because it was a sealed indictment. The authorities generally seal indictments to ensure that they’re content isn’t made public before the indicted suspects are apprehended to safeguard against their flight from the law. I certainly wasn’t a flight risk, nor had I given the government indications that I was a flight risk, so I was puzzled by the sealed indictment. Van Susteren directed me to rendezvous with her at her office the following day. My mother and I awoke at 6 : 00 A.M . the next morning, and we drove to Washington, D.C. We were extremely anxious about the unspecified charges that were looming over me in D.C., and our drive was marked by a stifling silence. Van Susteren greeted us at her office, and she phoned either Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Strasser or the Secret Service. She offered to deliver me to the courthouse, but her offer was vetoed, and within 20 minutes four Secret Service agents were standing in Van Susteren’s office. I immediately recognized one of the agents—“Paul Ware.” He was about 5^(′)10^(′′) and in his late thirties. He had short, dark hair, parted to the side, and an olive complexion. A black suit seemed to loosely drape his stiff, slender frame. Over the preceding months, Ware had routinely and overtly followed me. My mother recognized him too, because he had also followed her. The Secret Service agents were hostile to me when they arrived at Van Susteren’s office, and I felt like they looked upon me as a treasonous enemy of the state. One of the agents flashed a pair of handcuffs, and Van Susteren requested that he cuff me from the front. The agent, however, ignored her request and cuffed me behind my back. The agents then escorted me to a black sedan, and pushed me into the back seat. Two agents sat in the front seat of the car that transported me, and two agents followed us in a second black sedan.

The agents then escorted me to a black sedan, and pushed me into the back seat. Two agents sat in the front seat of the car that transported me, and two agents followed us in a second black sedan. As we drove past the White House, Capitol Hill, and DuPont Circle, I experienced a very peculiar sensation. I felt like the Secret Service sedan was suspended in time, and I momentarily had an out-of-body experience as I came to the realization that my life would be forever transfigured. The Secret Service agents drove me to D.C.’s federal courthouse, and they silently ushered me through the courthouse. After the Secret Service agents booked me, I was deposited in a holding cell that held around 20 inmates. The altered state that I had experienced in the Secret Service sedan was punctured by the harsh reality of the holding cell. I had been in the holding cell for a couple of hours when a pair a U.S. marshals retrieved me. The marshals had the same stern demeanor as the Secret Service agents as they escorted me to a courtroom. As I entered the courtroom, I noticed my mother standing next to an African-American man in his mid-thirties. He was a bail bondsman that Van Susteren had introduced to my mother. The marshals escorted me past my teary-eyed mother to the defense table where Van Susteren stood. As I sat down, I glanced at Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Strasser. In addition to overseeing the grand jury that indicted me, Strasser would be in charge of prosecuting my case. The thirty-seven-year-old Strasser was tall and corpulent. He had curly brown hair and a fleshy face that was accentuated by extremely dense eyebrows. He seemed to grimace when we made eye contact. Shortly after I seated myself, Judge Harold Greene strolled into the courtroom. The 67-year-old Greene was short and compact. He had a black comb over, and he wore large brown-framed glasses. When Judge Greene seated himself at the bench, he leafed through my indictment. Judge Greene was quite surprised that the grand jury had walloped me with a 43-count RICO indictment. RICO is an acronym for the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and it was originally designed to dismantle the Mafia, because RICO allows for mob bosses to be tried for crimes that were sanctioned on their behalf. Judge Greene may have been surprised by my RICO indictment, but I nearly fainted. I was staring at 295 years in a federal prison! After Judge Greene voiced his astonishment that a mere prostitution case resulted a sealed 43-count RICO indictment, Strasser said something to the effect that my", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:102:472a413ff162", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2898, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 103, "text": "Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and it was originally designed to dismantle the Mafia, because RICO allows for mob bosses to be tried for crimes that were sanctioned on their behalf.

After Judge Greene voiced his astonishment that a mere prostitution case resulted a sealed 43-count RICO indictment, Strasser said something to the effect that my case had special circumstances. Strasser ultimately argued that I should be held without bail, but Van Susteren countered that I wasn’t a flight risk, and I had voluntarily surrendered myself shortly after being notified of the indictment. Judge Greene granted me bail, and I was released on a $30, 000 surety bond. Judge Greene then mandated that I report to a probation officer once a week, and I had to receive express authorization from him to venture outside of the D.C. area. Over the course of the hearing, I repeatedly ruminated about the 43-count indictment, and its potential 295-year sentence. After the hearing, I voiced my utter bewilderment to Van Susteren, and she assured me that the indictment was much ado. She reiterated that she felt I was probably eyeing probation. When the hearing concluded, I had dinner with my mother. I said little, because, despite Van Susteren’s assurances, I was dumbfounded by the fact that I potentially faced life in prison. Following dinner, my mother drove me to Richard’s apartment, and she spent the night with Aunt Josephine. Despite a Xanax, I had great difficulties sleeping. Given my childhood affection for Arnold, I’ve never been particularly fond of ham, but the federal grand jury was a rather unsavory ham sandwich that I would somehow, someway have to digest. In the wake of my arraignment, the government walloped Robert, Jimmy, and Travis with multiple RICO counts too. The Secret Service had a list of my clients, but not a single client was indicted. The grand jury also neglected to indict the Secret Service agents who catered to Spence’s wishes. Robert, Jimmy, While I was being subjected to the government’s Machiavellian malevolence, I also had to contend with the revenge of Michael Manos, who embarked on a check-writing spree with my pilfered identity towards the end of 1988 and into 1989. Manos had vowed revenge, and he was exacting it at a most inopportune time for me. Manos’ check writing spree unfolded over D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, and, consequently, I faced various criminal counts in those jurisdictions for passing bad checks. Manos theft of my identity and his check-forging extravaganza at my expense certainly aided and abetted the government’s declaration that Henry Vinson was a miscreant of nearly unparalleled magnitude.

I realize that I might provoke incredulity if I speculate that the government may have been well aware of Manos’ check forging exploits with my pilfered identity, and it opted to idly stand by as he wracked up offenses in my name. But the Washington Times reported that Manos had plundered Paul Balach’s checking account for $4, 000 and also illicitly used his MasterCard, but the D.C. authorities didn’t prosecute Manos for a single count of identity theft or larceny against Paul. Moreover, at that time, I had a nest egg of $500, 000 , and I was the target of a federal grand jury, so it doesn’t make sense that I would run around the D.C. area kiting checks. Shortly after Manos left D.C., he did a 15-year prison stint in his native New York for kidnapping, robbery, criminal possession of stolen property, and larceny. Following Manos’ release from prison, he was strapped with parole for life, but he skipped on his parole. Manos then commenced on a nationwide odyssey of stolen identities, fraud, and embezzlement. He turned up as “Christian Michael de Medici” in Atlanta, where he pedaled a massive mortgage fraud that swindled a bank and private investors. Once Atlanta became too hot for Manos, he incarnated himself in Dallas as “Mladen Stefanov,” media mogul, restaurateur, and scion of a Greek tycoon. After Manos conned and defrauded a wave of marks in Dallas, he fled to California. Federal authorities finally pinched him in San Francisco, and they found 30 phony credit cards and a fake Bulgarian driver’s license. He was extradited to New York where he served a year for parole violations, and then he was extradited to Texas where he spent six months in the pokey on fraud charges. When Manos was released from a Texas jail in June of 2011, he perpetrated his most audacious makeover—a D.C. lobbyist. He wielded a bogus clientele that included big tobacco and the Republican Party. Once more, Manos was arrested and extradited to New York for parole violations. As I’ve followed the criminal career of Michael Manos, I wasn’t alarmed that he impersonated a lobbyist for the Republican Party, because he and Craig Spence had a very cozy relationship, and both were ethical eunuchs. met with Van Susteren at her office shortly after I had been indicted.

Van Susteren said that she would file a motion that would compel the U.S. Attorney for D.C. to publicly release the names of my clientele, and her motion would abate the government’s zealous prosecution of me. When our conversation rolled around to Michael Manos and his theft of my identity, she suggested that I plea bargain to his offenses and make restitution. Although pleading guilty to Manos’ crimes struck me as counter-intuitive, Van Susteren’s rationale was that it would be optimal for me to be free and clear of those offenses as she dealt with my 43-count federal quagmire. The angst and apprehension of the preceding year that culminated in my indictments had left me existentially exhausted, and I acquiesced to Van Susteren’s recommendations. As I was in the midst of making restitution for Manos’ larceny, I had a status hearing before Judge Greene, which is an informal discussion between the judge, the prosecution, and the defendant about the progress of a case. When I departed the status hearing, I was arrested at the courthouse by Virginia authorities for the various offenses that Michael Manos had committed in Virginia. Secret Service agent Paul Ware was conspicuously present when the Virginia authorities arrested me. Van Susteren made her vaunted move in the middle of August 1990 by filing an 11-page motion that would force the U.S. Attorney’s office to release the names of my clientele, which had been seized by the Secret Service via search warrants and subpoenas, but Strasser stonewalled her motion. He refused to release my client lists, because “he fears intimidation of government witnesses due to the embarrassing nature of the case.” The government had been the primary intimidator of my clientele, so I found Strasser’s rationale for quashing Van Susteren’s motion to be extremely ironic. If the government was unwilling to release the names of my clientele, Van Susteren put forth an alternative motion that would prohibit prosecutors from entering the seized items into evidence for the trial. In early October, Judge Greene ruled on Van Susteren’s motions. He released the documentation to Van Susteren, but he banned its public disclosure. After the ruling, Van Susteren started to undergo a metamorphosis. She eventually advised me to start cooperating with the government. I found her change in strategy to be perplexing.

I’ve since wondered if Van Susteren’s maneuver to publicly expose my clientele had been her one-trick pony or if she had sub rosa motivations. By that time, however, I was utterly spent, and I obsequiously complied with Van Susteren’s counsel. If she had recommended that I jump off the Empire State Building, I would’ve booked the next flight to New York. I ultimately pled guilty to conspiring to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and credit card fraud, and I agreed to “cooperate” with government. Although those two counts carried a maximum aggregate sentence of 25 years, Van Susteren assured me that my cooperation would result in a “downward departure” from the sentencing guidelines and probation was the likely outcome. In addition to persuading Robert, Jimmy, and Travis to cooperate with government, my cooperation entailed a series of debriefings in December of 1990 at the Secret Service’s D.C. headquarters. The debriefings were conducted in a nondescript conference room over the course of two weeks. The conference room had tan walls, no windows, and brown indoor-outdoor carpeting. Paul Ware sat at the head of a long, rectangular conference table, and I sat directly to his left. Various men were also seated around the conference table. I was told that they were affiliated with the D.C. Metro Police, U.S. Postal Service, and the Internal Revenue Service, even though my intuition is that they most likely provided false affiliations. As I reflect on my debriefings in retrospect, I find it astonishing that Van Susteren, acting as my attorney, didn’t accompany me to a single debriefing. At the time, however, I was very naïve, and I was merely following directions to avoid imprisonment. Agent Ware controlled the debriefings, and the other men sitting at the table occasionally chimed in with a question, but they were generally taciturn and stoic as they scribbled my statements on yellow legal pads. Ware and his associates seemed to have a rather limited agenda, and, when I offered information that conflicted with their agenda, Ware abruptly stifled me. At first, they wanted to gauge my honesty and relationship with Spence, so Ware asked me if I ever met Spence’s wife and children. I replied that Spence wasn’t married, and I sincerely doubted that he had children. Ware then asked me specifics about Spence’s Kalorama home, which I answered quite thoroughly. After Ware concluded that I wasn’t lying about my relationship with Spence, he started to broach the subject of blackmail. He inquired what I knew of Spence’s blackmail", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:106:66eac18d3d71", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2902, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 107, "text": "At first, they wanted to gauge my honesty and relationship with Spence, so Ware asked me if I ever met Spence’s wife and children.

After Ware concluded that I wasn’t lying about my relationship with Spence, he started to broach the subject of blackmail. He inquired what I knew of Spence’s blackmail activities, and I discussed the concealed bugging equipment that was scattered throughout his house. When I started to offer information about Tony being part and parcel of Spence’s blackmail enterprise, I was cut off by Ware. He didn’t want to hear about Tony. I then attempted to discuss the pedophilic blackmail enterprise of Spence and King, and again I was thwarted. Ware also stymied me when I started to discuss the cabinet member in the Bush administration who might’ve been the target of pedophilic blackmail. Ware was quite interested in the Secret Service agents who were in cahoots with Spence, and he interrogated me about the Secret Service agents I had met at Spence’s house. He questioned me about my social interactions with the agents, and I replied that the only time I knowingly interacted with Secret Service officers was at Spence’s home. Ware also inquired about the sexual preferences of the Secret Service officer who guarded Ware expended hours tossing out names, and garnering feedback on the respective individuals he mentioned. He had a multitude of questions about Paul Balch and Charles Dutcher. Ware asked me where I acquired my presidential cufflinks, and I told him that they were a gift from Paul Balach, and, unbelievably, he inquired about the Truman china. I replied that I had no idea who stole the Truman china. Ware wasn’t interested in Tony, who was responsible for innumerable illicit activities, perhaps, even including murder, but the Truman china was of paramount interest to him. Ware and the panel had numerous questions about an escort named Jeff Gannon, which also perplexed me, because I had only met Gannon on a handful of occasions. Gannon had been an acquaintance of Jimmy’s, and I initially met him at Shooters. Although Gannon was an escort, I never employed him. When I talked to Gannon, he maintained he was an escort and a journalist, and he also claimed to be servicing officials in the upper echelons of the Bush administration. He even disclosed that he spent nights in the White House. His stories were quite outrageous, so I didn’t give them much credence. I gave Ware and the panel the limited amount of information that I was privy to concerning Gannon, and I also discussed his extravagant braggadocio.

Although I was surprised about Ware’s inordinate interest in Gannon, I didn’t give it a second thought until fifteen years later when Gannon actually surfaced as a White House reporter. Gannon started attending White House press conferences in early 2003. At the time, he had never published an article, he wasn’t associated with a news organization, and he moonlighted as a homosexual escort, but, remarkably, the Secret Service granted him one-day press passes for nearly two years, which enabled him to sidestep the extensive background checks required for permanent passes. Gannon came under the scrutiny of the White House press corps at a 2005 presidential press conference when he asked President George W. Bush a ridiculously partisan question about the Democrats bleak view of the economy, mentioning that a couple of Democratic senators had “divorced themselves from reality.” Bush took Gannon’s question quite seriously, giving a protracted response, but it elicited the ire of White House reporters, who started delving into his background, and they quickly discovered that he was a gay escort. By 2005, Gannon ostensibly worked for Talon News, a virtual news service that didn’t have a physical office. The story of Jeff Gannon took an interesting twist after he was outed as a gay escort, because Democrats in the House of Representatives began digging into his connections to the Bush White House. A pair of House members filed Freedom of Information Act requests that inquired about Gannon’s access to the White House, and their FOIA requests revealed that Gannon spent a lot of time at the White House. Gannon made over 200 appearances at the White House during his two-year stint as a “White House reporter,” attending 155 of 196 White House press briefings. Over a period of tewnty-two months, Gannon checked in with the Secret Service, but he failed to check out on fourteen days, and on one of those days a press briefing wasn’t even held. Although the Secret Service said that there wasn’t a “deviation from Secret Service standards and procedures” regarding Gannon’s bizarre access to the White House, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee proffered a resolution that would’ve required Bush’s Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to surrender documents relating to the security investigations and background checks involved in granting Gannon access to the White House.

The Secret Service was aware of Gannon being a gay escort in 1990, when I was being debriefed, and yet it granted him seemingly unfettered access to the White House from 2003 through 2005. I’ve always been fascinated by the fact that Gannon failed to check out of the White House on fourteen visitations. So perhaps Gannon was telling me the truth when he said that he actually spent nights at the White House? After Ware and his colleagues had finished “debriefing” me, I met with Van Susteren approximately once a week. Our discussions gradually began to transcend my legal predicament, and we started to talk about various aspects of our personal lives. Van Susteren eventually told me that she was a Scientologist. I had never met a Scientologist before, so I was both surprised and intrigued by her disclosures about Scientology. Life has the potential be exponentially stranger than fiction, because in early 1991 I found myself on an Oklahoma-bound flight to Scientology’s Narconon rehab, which was located near Newkirk, Oklahoma. Although I’ve never suffered from chemically dependency, I had a well-founded distrust of the government’s intent. So I hoped that graduating from Scientology’s Narconon program would demonstrate to Judge Greene that I had made an assiduous effort to turn around my life, and I would receive leniency from him even if the government reneged on its proposed agreement with me. A Narconon staff member was awaiting me at the Tulsa International Airport, and we drove to northern Oklahoma. Narcanon was housed on the campus of a former boarding school for Native American children that closed in the early 1980s. The campus’ yellow limestone buildings were like an archipelago of civilization on the remote, sprawling prairie. I was aware that Narconon was affiliated with the Church of Scientology, but I didn’t realize that the ensuing months would essentially be the D.C. madam meets L. Ron Hubbard on the prairies of Oklahoma. Upon my arrival, I was quickly drenched in the specter and teachings of L. Ron Hubbard. I initially had great difficulties digesting the Scientology dogmas. According to Hubbard, an alien overlord named Xenu was in charge of a “Galactic Confederacy” 75 million years ago that consisted of 76 planets, including Earth. Xenu’s planetary confederation was desperately overcrowded, so Xenu devised a genocidal plan. He lured billions of the confederation’s citizens to government offices under the pretense of a tax inspection, and he dosed them with paralyzing drugs and flew them to earth, where they were murdered.

He lured billions of the confederation’s citizens to government offices under the pretense of a tax inspection, and he dosed them with paralyzing drugs and flew them to earth, where they were murdered. The souls or thetans of the murdered aliens were then captured and brainwashed, and they eventually incarnated as earthlings. Although Scientology’s theology initially struck me as extremely bizarre, I found the staff nonjudgmental and compassionate, and Narconon was a welcome respite from the inexorable heat I had faced in the government’s D.C. pressure cooker. The men and women clients of Narconon had their respective dormitories, but we attended the same classes, which consisted of about 20 clients, and we also communed in the dinner hall. Shortly after my arrival at Narconon, I was assigned an “auditor,” who would be the recipient of my deepest and darkest secrets. The auditing process is designed to “clear” Scientologists of their “engrams,” which are mental impressions of traumatic events. The auditor records the details associated with an engram, and Scientologists believe that this confession process diffuses the engram’s negative affects on our lives. The Scientologists take being cleared very, very seriously, so I certainly had my work cut out for me while I was in Oklahoma. My auditor, Lawrence, was an elderly man with white hair, and he was a chaperon as well as a confessor. Under his careful supervision, I spent hours and hours writing out my various traumas and transgressions. As my auditing process progressed, Lawrence introduced me to Scientology’s E-meter, which measures electrical resistance and skin conductance. An individual’s skin conductance varies with his or her concentration of sweat, so skin conductance is used as a proxy for psychological or physiological arousal or stress. As the engrams are diffused through the auditing process, the E-meter theoretically measures less and less arousal and stress. After I had been at Narconon for four months, a Scientology adept whom I had never met decided that I was cleared, and a party was thrown on my behalf. The party was quite festive, and it even included a blue and white cleared cake. Believe it or not, I actually started to enjoy my hiatus among the Scientologists. The human experience can be fraught with grueling circumstances, and people often grope for credos or belief systems that will gift-wrap their problems with a tidy bow and offer novel solutions. I think that most people experience excruciating impasses in their lives that leave them highly susceptible to various alternative belief systems or cults.

At that particular time in my life, I faced an existential crisis that seemed insurmountable and hopeless, and, groping for relief, I was highly susceptible to the pat solutions offered by the doctrines of Scientology. Although Scientology had declared that I was cleared of engrams, the federal government had yet to decide if I were cleared of imprisonment. A federal probation officer flew out to Oklahoma and conducted a presentence interview, and a few weeks later my presentence report arrived in the mail. I read the report in my dormitory room, sitting on my bed. It recommended a sentence between 63 and 78 months in a federal prison! When I read the presentence report, I was overwhelmed by dread and stunned. A prison stint of five or six years was, apparently, an engram that had yet to be thoroughly cleared, and I immediately phoned Van Susteren. She said that the Justice Department had ruled that I had provided “substantial assistance,” and she assured me that I would receive a downward departure from the recommendations in the presentence report. Judge Greene set June 12th as my sentencing date, so I flew back to D.C. on June 11th. My mother met me at D.C.’s Washington National Airport, and we spent the night at Aunt Josephine’s house. The next morning I donned a blue Brooks Brother’s suit, white shirt, and a blue tie, and I rendezvoused in the kitchen with my mother and Aunt Josephine. My mother was wearing a tan pants suit and Josephine wore a turquoise pants suit. After breakfast, I drove my mother’s car to the courthouse. My mother sat in the front seat and Josephine was in the backseat. Our mood was upbeat, because Van Susteren had said that even if the government slapped me with a six-month sentence, I would be able to self-report to the designated institution at a date specified by Judge Greene. When we arrived at the courthouse, I rendezvoused with Van Susteren who was standing outside the courtroom, and she had a distressed look on her face. As I had feared, the government decided to pull a dirty trick at the eleventh hour. Shortly before my sentencing, Strasser filed a memorandum with Judge Greene asserting that I should be sentenced above the guidelines, because I hadn’t screened the escorts I employed for HIV, and thus had perpetrated untold death and misery.

So I was extremely apprehensive as I followed Van Susteren into the courtroom to face Judge Greene. After I expressed contrition for my crimes, Judge Greene launched into a protracted diatribe about the downward departure that had been proposed for my “substantial assistance.” “Why propose this departure?” Judge Greene asked. “I can’t recall a single case in which the government has asked for departure before just because somebody pleaded guilty and got others to plead … I don’t think it’s warranted…” Van Susteren interjected that I had turned over a new leaf, but Judge Greene brought up the litany of Michael Manos offenses that I had pled guilty to at her behest. He barked out that my offenses included “false checks, false pretenses, theft over a period of years, and plus the long track record in the running of this conspiracy.” My sentencing had suddenly taken on the surreal proportions of a horrific nightmare, and Judge Greene had yet to address Strasser’s memorandum about Henry Vinson being the progenitor of the HIV virus in Washington, D.C. Judge Greene asked Strasser if he were aware of anyone who had contracted HIV from an escort whom I employed, and Strasser couldn’t mention a single individual, which demonstrated that his memorandum to Judge Greene had been unfounded. Judge Greene then sentenced me to 63 months in a federal prison, and he ruled that I be immediately remanded into custody. As the U.S. marshals escorted me out of the courtroom, my mother was weeping and Aunt Josephine was comforting her. As I sat in a holding cell, waiting to be transferred to the federal prison in Morgantown, West Virginia, I attempted to decipher the antics that had just transpired in the courtroom and Strasser’s eleventh hour memorandum. Trial judges generally have access to law enforcement’s debriefing of a suspect, so I wondered if Greene realized the immense scandal I had prevented by plea bargaining and his courtroom antics had been merely grand theater for the press or perhaps the Justice Department and Secret Service had kept Greene in the dark concerning the scope of my cooperation. When Van Susteren was representing me, I thought that she was sincerely acting in my paramount interests, but the government ultimately accomplished its primary objectives: my silence and incarceration.

In retrospect, however, I caught a fortuitous break from Judge Greene, because Scientology had nearly purloined my mind, and five years in a federal prison is preferable to a lifetime sentence of Scientology. As a teenager, I was horrified of physical education classand locker room pranks. Now I was sentenced to five years in prison, which made physical education class look like a walk in the park on sunny spring day. In addition to the loss of my freedom, I had to contend with the eradication of my individuality. I was stripped of my own clothes, shoes, and even my watch. My name was abruptly reduced to a number—or the generic “inmate.” My future quickly became a nebulous uncertainly that I avoided contemplating, because I was solely focused on surviving the present—sometimes day-to-day and sometimes moment-to-moment. After a week in D.C.’s city jail, I was one of sixty prisoners who were belly-chained, handcuffed, and leg-shackled and escorted to a bus in the jail’s basement. When we seated ourselves in the bus, we were chained to our respective seats and then driven to the federal prison in Lorton, Virginia, which served as a transit center for federal prisoners in the D.C. area. The drive to Lorton was less than an hour, and I didn’t utter a word while I stared out the bus’ barred windows. As I watched the facial expressions of the D.C. commuters driving their cars to work, school, or countless other destinations, I came to the brutal realization that my former life had become null and void. I was incarcerated at Lorton for three days before again being belly-chained, handcuffed, and leg-shackled and marched to a bus with sixty additional prisoners. We were driven to the federal prison in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. I was at Lewisburg for nearly a week, and then I was driven to Morgantown with about a hundred other prisoners. The federal prison at Morgantown was thankfully a minimal security prison, but my reputation as the D.C. madam preceded me. The majority of Morgantown’s inmates were privy to my case due to the incessant newspaper reportage on me. The inmate population didn’t overtly embrace homosexuals. I was initially treated as an extraterrestrial by many inmates and repeatedly called a “punk,” which in inmate jargon is synonymous with queer or faggot. I felt like I was back in high school, but I couldn’t escape to my mother’s house after school had been adjourned for the day. My cellmate, Muhammad, was a fiftyish African-American man, who had received a 10-year sentence for the possession and distribution of cocaine. Muhammad hailed from Detroit, and he had spent several years in prison.

Muhammad hailed from Detroit, and he had spent several years in prison. Although Muhammad sprung from the mean streets of Detroit, I was grateful that he never looked upon me with contempt or hostility. Muhammad also eased my transition to penal life by explaining the unwritten prison mores to me. I initially had great difficulties sleeping, because I had to listen to my fellow inmates nocturnal snoring and coughing. After lights out at 10 : 00 P.M ., I spent hours tossing and turning every night before I finally managed to drift into sleep. I eventually started to acclimate to the din that ricocheted into my cell on a nightly basis, and my insomnia gradually started to allay. Every inmate was allotted a “job,” and I was assigned to be a cook in the officers’ dining room. I quickly learned that the rationale for my assignment was that the inmates weren’t receptive to a punk handling their food. Although inmates wouldn’t speak to me when we were in general population, a number of them made advances towards me when we were one-on-one. I had been at Morgantown for less than a month when an inmate followed me into the infirmary’s bathroom and stood in front of the door. I had a sudden flashback of Jimmy and Rod at Williamson High School. After he attempted to kiss and grope me, I started to scream my lungs out. It was only a matter of time before a guard barged into the bathroom, so he eased off, and I managed to dash out of the bathroom. I regularly experienced those types of incidences during my first three or four months at Morgantown. As I was departing the officers’ dining room one afternoon, a young guard approached me—he was around 28 years old. He exposed himself to me, and he ordered me to perform oral sex on him. When I refused, he said that making a complaint against him would be pointless, because nobody would believe me. I had to cope with prisoners attempting to impose themselves on me, but the thought of guards starting to impose themselves on me was particularly bewildering. Following my impasse with the guard, I marched straight to the prison’s Special Investigative Services (SIS) office, which investigates the activities of inmates and employees, and I made a formal complaint against the guard. SIS conducted an investigation of my accusations, and it ruled in my favor.

SIS conducted an investigation of my accusations, and it ruled in my favor. The guard in question had worked at the prison for a mere four or five months, and he was fired. My mother rented an apartment in the city of Morgantown, and she visited me weekly. Her visitations were an enormous boost to my morale. Despite my mother’s religious beliefs, she had come to the realization that I didn’t choose to be a homosexual, but rather I was born a homosexual just as she had been born a heterosexual. She had also come to the realization that Butch and I had fundamentally different personalities, and she relinquished her hopes that I would ultimately grow up to be like Butch. My mother became a fountainhead of unconditional love and support throughout my years in prison, and I’m forever grateful to her. After three or four months at Morgantown, I eventually started to adjust to my life in stir. Morgantown’s recreation room had a piano, and I spent hours playing it. The recreation room had a wide variety of sheet music that included ballads and folk songs that were native to West Virginia, which I taught myself to play. Just as I had retreated to the basement as a child to flee my father’s tyranny and play the piano, I retreated to the recreation room’s piano to flee the difficulties posed by my fellow inmates. I also devoted hours and hours to reading. I enjoyed reading Robin Cook and Patricia Cornwell mysteries, and I read numerous books on marketing and advertising too. I eventually befriended an inmate named John, who had been a pilot in the Air Force. Our shared love of airplanes and aviation was the incipient bond that enabled us to forge a friendship. John was tall with thick gray hair and intense blue eyes, and he had a military demeanor that reminded me of Uncle Clarence. John had been a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force, and, following his retirement, he joined the Pennsylvania State Police. John was married, and he had four children. He was busted flying cocaine across the United States, which led to his imprisonment. We dined together every day, and we spent hours talking to each other about everything from flying to the vicissitudes that resulted in our respective incarcerations. As a funeral director in Williamson, I befriended a member of the West Virginia Board of Funeral Service Examiners, and he was a friend of the prison’s “housing manager.” The board member I", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:115:a2805b6ece63", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2911, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 116, "text": "was married, and he had four children.

As a funeral director in Williamson, I befriended a member of the West Virginia Board of Funeral Service Examiners, and he was a friend of the prison’s “housing manager.” The board member I befriended must have spoke highly of me, despite my travails in Williamson, because the housing manager was receptive to cultivating a friendship with me. He eventually assigned me to be the “production clerk” of the prison’s onsite factory, which mass-produced furniture. I oversaw each facet of the factory’s production of chairs, tables, credenzas, etc., and I was responsible for ordering every square foot of wood and every screw and hinge that would eventually be modeled into furniture. I have a meticulous nature, whether it be as a funeral director or operating an escort service, so given the intricacies of the job and my painstaking attention to detail and precision, I found the job to be quite challenging, and I poured hours into the task. As I became increasingly focused on the job, my days at Morgantown started to melt away relatively quickly. initially incarcerated, I had major difficulties comprehending the 43-count indictment and the government’s draconian tactics towards my family and me. I also had difficulties understanding why none of the patrons who frequented my escort service were indicted for crimes relating to prostitution. Moreover, after my indictments, I gave the remnants of my escort service to Jeff, my friend and fellow mortician from West Virginia, and he ran the escort service until his death in 2002. Jeff never encountered a single legal problem during the decade or so he operated the escort service. I now realize that my interactions with Spence, Tony, and King—and knowledge of their perfidious endeavors—were a fait accompli that precipitated my downfall. At the time of my imprisonment, however, I didn’t see that causal relationship with the clarity that I see it today, because my last couple of years in D.C. were a nonstop kaleidoscopic montage of nightmares that prevented me from examining my predicament with a modicum of detached introspection. I was also perplexed by how quickly Van Susteren lost her pizzazz and yielded to the government. I thought I had cultivated a friendship with her, but after my incarceration we never again met face-to-face, even though we talked on the phone as she appealed my sentence. Van Susteren ultimately appealed my sentence on the grounds that the government had offered “a half-hearted, watered down argument” in support of my downward departure despite acknowledging my “substantial assistance.” But the appellate court ruled that Judge Greene was the principal arbitrator of my sentence, and he", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:116:acc1501c892f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2912, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 117, "text": "to the government.

Naturally, the appellate court noted the crimes committed by Michael Manos in my name for an additional reason to justify its decision. As my doomed appeal wended through the appellate process, I was abruptly called into the SIS office, where I was introduced to a pair of extremely hostile FBI agents. After the FBI agents escorted me to a small room that was adjacent to the SIS office, one of the agents snapped out my Miranda rights. Their intimidating tactics puzzled me, and I was particularly stunned to hear my Miranda rights. The FBI agents then started to grill me about Illinois Congressmen Dan Rostenkowski and Mel Reynolds. In 1994, Rostenkowski was indicted on corruption charges and Reynolds was indicted for the sexual assault of a sixteen-year-old, obstruction of justice, and solicitation of child pornography. The agents were absolutely convinced that I was privy to the crimes of both Rostenkowski and Reynolds, even though I truthfully told them that I had never met either man, and I wasn’t aware of their criminal activity. The FBI agents didn’t believe me, so they continued to grill me about Rostenkowski and Reynolds. I certainly didn’t want to run afoul of the FBI, but the agents remained incredulous of my repeated disavowals. Within seventy-two hours of my meeting with the FBI agents, I was charged with inciting a riot at the prison and thrown into solitary confinement. The charge certainly caught me by surprise, because I’m inherently reticent and reserved, and I was especially reticent and reserved while I was in prison. I spent a month in solitary at Morgantown, and it was hellish. I was given a few magazines to read, but that was the scope of my contact with the outside world. Every morning I woke up in a barren cell, and spent the remainder of the day staring at the walls. At times, I felt as if I were on the precipice of losing my mind, so I attempted to transport my mind back to the present as the future seemed like a barren apocalypse. Following a month in solitary, I embarked on a bizarre odyssey of the federal penal system. I was inexplicably transferred to Lewisburg, which included being piled on a bus with several prisoners, and of course being belly-chained, handcuffed, and leg-shackled.

Upon my arrival in Lewisburg, I was thrown into solitary confinement. I was then flown from Lewisburg to the federal prison in Oklahoma City, and I immediately landed in solitary confinement. After a stint of solitary in Oklahoma City, I was flown to the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, where I was immediately deposited in solitary confinement. itary shower, a huge African-American inmate also entered the shower room. His face was laden with homicidal intent, and both of us were locked in the shower room. I had nowhere to run, so I cowered into a corner and sat down. The inmate tossed a few glances in my direction, but, thankfully, he left me alone. I was then ushered back to solitary. The federal government can certainly be an unforgiving and malicious foe. I spent a month in solitary at Terre Haute before I was flown to the federal prison in Manchester, Kentucky, which was a medium security prison. I served the balance of my sentence—18 months—at Manchester. At Manchester, I was mainstreamed into the general population. Although I wouldn’t describe the collective mindset of the inmate population at Morgantown to be particularly socially enlightened, they nonetheless seemed Gandhi-like when compared to the inmates of Manchester. I found that many of the inmates at Manchester were cut from the same cloth as my father’s family, and they were plagued by extreme racist and homophobic ignorance. So I primarily kept to myself at Manchester as the days passed like quicksand seeping through an hourglass. My mother continued to visit me on a weekly basis, even though Manchester was a five-hour commute from Williamson. On July 5, 1995, I was released from Manchester. As I walked out of the prison, I felt the blazing July sun strafe my face, and, peering upwards, I noticed a cerulean sky that was unblemished by clouds. My mother was waiting for me in the parking lot. She wore a lavender pants suit and tears were streaming down her cheeks. When we made eye contact, tears started to well up in my eyes too. She greeted me with a prolonged hug and a labored smile. Although she was eternally thankful that I was being paroled from prison, her smile was labored because my government-sponsored nightmare and its complementary intimidation and harassment had taken a major toll on her. After we hugged, we hopped into her maroon 300 Series Mercedes, and I felt", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:118:7dc4f8e51e72", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2914, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 119, "text": "suit and tears were streaming down her cheeks.

Although she was eternally thankful that I was being paroled from prison, her smile was labored because my government-sponsored nightmare and its complementary intimidation and harassment had taken a major toll on her. After we hugged, we hopped into her maroon 300 Series Mercedes, and I felt an indescribable euphoria as we drove out of the prison’s parking lot. Following I-79 south through the dense woodlands of West Virginia, we started to discuss my future. I told my mother that I didn’t have a definitive plan, because prison, especially my various relocations and bouts of solitary, had reduced me to being primarily focused on surviving the present. She proposed that I manage her ever-expanding real estate fiefdom, and I gratefully accepted her offer. Over the years my mother had become one of the largest real estate proprietors in the Williamson area. After driving for about four hours, we dined at an Olive Garden in Huntington, West Virginia. Olive Garden isn’t exactly Five Star dining, but the capellini pomodoro that I ordered was a delightful departure from years of prison gruel. After dinner, my mother drove me to a federal halfway house in Charleston, West Virginia. The conditions of my parole mandated six months at the halfway house and three years of probation. The halfway house was a nondescript, two-story house with beige vinyl siding in a lower socioeconomic neighborhood of Charleston. The house’s first and second floors had been chopped up into large dormitory style rooms that accommodated ten bunks. The terms of my parole also required me to find employment. My parole officer abruptly vetoed the idea of me working for my mother. So Dr. Diane Shafer, an orthopedic surgeon who practiced in Williamson, ultimately hired me to be her file clerk. Diane grew up in Pennsylvania, and she had been employed by Appalachian Regional Hospital before entering private practice in Williamson. Diane had befriended my mother years earlier, and she occasionally spent Saturday or Sunday afternoons lounging around my mother’s backyard pool with my mother and her friends. I initially met her when I was 16 years old. Diane was tall with curly brown hair that draped her shoulders. She was brimming with élan, and she had a wonderful sense of humor. house. She had purchased a spacious Tudor home in Williamson that was surrounded by thickets of shrubs and encircled by a white picket fence. Her house in Williamson also had a backyard pool.

Over the course of my 9-year absence from Williamson, my mother had developed an affinity for motorcycles, and she had three in her garage, including a Harley Davidson. I found it extremely difficult to be back in Williamson. Everyone in town was aware of my subsequent fate in Washington, D.C., and again I was treated like a pariah by most of Williamson’s denizens. When I wasn’t working at Diane’s clinic, my early days in Williamson resembled my days at Manchester: I primarily kept to myself and worked out. Diane eventually expanded her one-physician practice to include four physicians. As Diane was expanding her practice, I started to “manage” my mother’s real estate ventures. I put manage in quotes, because my mother was a very headstrong woman and a micromanager, and every business decision, whether it was major or minor, had to receive her blessing. Her metamorphosis from the browbeaten wife of a drunk to a strong-willed, resolute entrepreneur was quite striking. My mother purchased a two-story building on 2^(nd) Street in Williamson that had previously housed an orthopedic surgery clinic, and she renovated the second floor to accommodate Diane’s burgeoning practice. She had the first floor renovated into additional physician offices too, and also into a one-bedroom apartment for me. My apartment had beige walls and beige carpeting, and I garnished its walls with postmodern oil paintings. The living room had an entertainment center that featured a bigscreen television, and a sprawling L-shaped sectional couch. In the months following my release from prison, I had the unsettling sense that the government would, at any given moment, capriciously swoop down on me like a hawk, accuse me of an unsubstantiated parole violation, and toss me back into prison. I was also plagued by nightmares of inexplicably finding myself in solitary confinement. But after a year or so, I started to transcend the omnipresent angst that had shadowed me since the Secret Service raid and throughout my incarceration. By the summer of 1996, I started to feel that perhaps the government’s reign of terror against me had subsided, and I had the self-assurance to purchase a 1989 single-engine Mooney M20, which was fitted with a six-cylinder, air cooled engine manufactured by Porsche. The plane was red, gray, and white, and I thought it was the most beautiful airplane in the world. I had never flown a single-propeller plane that offered such exquisite performance, and whenever I landed the plane, it often attracted on-looking aviation aficionados. Shortly after I purchased the Mooney M20, I flew to Cincinnati for a weekend visit. At the airport, I bumped into a tall African-American man who was", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:120:4bc00aee9f91", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2916, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 121, "text": "fitted with a six-cylinder, air cooled engine manufactured by Porsche.

I had never flown a single-propeller plane that offered such exquisite performance, and whenever I landed the plane, it often attracted on-looking aviation aficionados. Shortly after I purchased the Mooney M20, I flew to Cincinnati for a weekend visit. At the airport, I bumped into a tall African-American man who was in his late twenties. He had a masters degree in Community Planning, and he was an executive for a hospital in Cincinnati. Although I have tendency to be reticent and coy, I felt an instant attraction to him, and I actually initiated our conversation. Popular culture is abounding with tales of love at fist sight, but I had never experienced that phenomena. In fact, I was 36 years old, and I had never been in a significant relationship, because that level of interpersonal trust was a seemingly insurmountable obstacle for me. But that day, I truly experienced love at first sight, and I also met a man whose aura of honesty and integrity disarmed my issues with mistrust. He’s been my partner since 1996. As I felt the exhilaration of being in love for the first time in my life, I floated an idea by my mother that was extremely ambitious. A vast building in downtown Williamson, encompassing a city block, had been vacant for a few years. The building had formerly been a clearinghouse for building supplies, and I suggested to her that we convert it into a state-of-the-art rehabilitation center and gym. My mother loved Williamson, and she felt a strong civic obligation, so we embarked on the Tug Valley Rehabilitation Center. With my mother virtually gazing over my shoulder, I oversaw the gutting of the building and its comprehensive renovation. We designed the facility to offer orthopedic, cardiac, pulmonary and diabetic rehabilitation, outpatient physical therapy, and supervised fitness training. We ultimately equipped it with treadmills, stationary bicycles, rowing machines, Nordic Tracks, StairMasters, elliptical trainers, weights, and a HydroWorx exercise pool. The Tug Valley Rehabilitation Center took about a year to com- As I was in the midst of overseeing construction on the Tug Valley Rehabilitation Center, the Charleston Gazette published an extremely caustic article about me. The article dredged up my incarceration, and it was also littered with unfounded allegations about Diane, including that Diane and I “may” have been married. The article then accused me of faking my death, and it stated that I used the N-word racial epithet when the newspaper’s reporter talked to me. The media has never been magnanimous towards me, but that article had an especially vicious sting, because I’m not a racist and my lover is an African-American.

Although the Charleston Gazette article rattled me, I continued to forge ahead on the Tug Valley Rehabilitation Center. After the facility’s completion, its state-of-the-art features attracted patients from the Williamson area and also from southeast Kentucky. We also charged a monthly fee or a daily fee for the gym. Gyms had previously failed in Williamson, because the area didn’t have the populace to support a gym. But housing a rehabilitation center and a gym together proved to be an enormous success. As the Tug Valley Rehabilitation Center and my relationship flourished, I sincerely thought that I had finally transcended the government’s Byzantine machinations that had wreaked such havoc on my life. I even acquired a helicopters license, and I bought a helicopter. My mother absolutely loved helicopter rides in the fall as the rolling woodlands of West Virginia exploded with reds, oranges, and yellows. One day, however, a journalist who was writing a story about Spence and King and their interstate trafficking of children visited me. I grudgingly met with him to be polite. After we talked for ten or fifteen minutes, he portended that I would be incarcerated within the next couple of years. He told me that I was privy to too many secrets, and I had become too successful and thus credible, so the government would incarcerate me to diminish my credibility. Although he appeared to be quite sane, I nonetheless thought he was crazed: I was leading an exemplary life, and the mere thought of the government incarcerating me again was unfathomable. n January of 2000, an undulating swarm of approximately 40 federal agents surged into my mother’s office building on I2nd Street. The agents were from a collage of federal agencies: FBI, IRS, Medicaid, Medicare, and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia. They ostensibly made the raid to serve a search warrant on Diane’s office, because the government alleged that she had been engaged in fraudulent billing practices. Although the agents ransacked a number of offices, they quickly focused their attention on me. A handful of agents eventually escorted me to my apartment, and I found myself sitting on my living room’s L-shaped sofa with a handful of feds. After we sat down, the investigator for the U.S. Attorney’s office and an FBI agent started to grill me. The U.S. Attorney’s investigator was in his early fifties, and he had salt and pepper hair.

He had menacing grayish eyes, and his taut facial expressions and mechanical mannerisms were that of a Marine boot camp sergeant. The FBI agent was in his mid-thirties, and he had black hair and cutting brown eyes. Both men were tall, thin, and wore the inexpensive suits that I’ve come to believe are almost mandatory for federal agents. The agents detained me in my apartment for three or four hours. They said that I wasn’t under arrest, but they wouldn’t allow me to phone my attorney. Indeed, they wouldn’t even allow me to retrieve a glass of water. The agents started the conversation by inquiring about my employment history. I realized that they were alluding to my days in D.C., and I promptly disclosed my former incarnation as a D.C. madam. The crux of the agents’ interrogation pertained to Diane. They said that Diane was overbilling the government and insurance companies, and if I came clean about Diane’s billing practices, they were authorized to immediately grant me immunity from prosecution. I told the agents that they had one minor glitch in their supposition: Diane didn’t overbill the government or, for that matter, insurance companies. The agents weren’t very receptive to the truth, and it made them rather caustic. The feds’ raid quickly ricocheted around Williamson, and my lawyer, who was the former mayor of Williamson, heard that the feds had besieged me in my apartment. So he walked from his office over to my apartment, but the agents wouldn’t even let him enter the building. Once more, the U.S. government had mutilated my Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. After the agents grilled me, they stormed out of my apartment. I was stunned by the agents’ harassment, and I felt exhausted after they huffed out of my apartment. Following their departure, I sunk into my living room’s couch and stared out the window on the threshold of tears. Although I had been through several hellish ordeals courtesy of the federal government, and I had spent years in federal prison, I didn’t have the icy, jaded heart of a hardened ex-con, so the day had left me emotionally tattered. After the raid on our office building, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Southern West Virginia impaneled a grand jury to supposedly investigate Diane’s billing practices, and it started dispensing subpoenas.

Given my prior experience, I was acutely concerned about the grand jury’s deliberations, but my concerns were assuaged by the fact that I wasn’t engaged in any illicit activities. So I genuinely felt that I was exempt from being indicted. But as the grand jury wended for month after month, I started to have flashbacks of being holed up in Richard’s apartment as the government prepped my inferno. A year or so after the feds raided Diane’s office, and, as the grand jury was in the midst of its deliberations, I received a phone call from Armando Acosta, a general care physician who had previously leased an office from my mother. Armando was a native of Cuba, and he had a thick accent. He was in his mid-fifties, around 5’8’’, bald, and morbidly obese. When Armando initially approached my mother to lease an office, he told her that his medical license had been suspended due to his failure to pay child support, and he was in the midst of financial difficulties. Although my mother was an astute businesswoman, she was also a kind-hearted soul, and she cut a check for his child support arrears and a few of his other outstanding debts. After his medical license was restored, he leased an office from my mother in the same building that housed Diane’s clinic, and he moved out of the office about six months after the feds raid. I hadn’t talked to Armando since his exodus from my mother’s building, and I was quite surprised to receive a call from him. I consented to rendezvous with Armando, even though I didn’t have a stellar opinion of him: I had heard murmurs that he sexually harassed his staff and even his patients. I’ve been thoroughly skewered by innuendo and falsehoods over the years, so I’m reluctant to judge a man based solely on insinuations, but the numerous intimations swirling around Armando warranted my suspicions. After Armando phoned me, I met with him in his red, 1960s Pontiac Bonneville convertible. As I took a seat in Armando’s car, I noticed he was very edgy, and his eyes repeatedly darted to the left and to the right. Armando had a spicy, bombastic Caribbean persona, but it was eclipsed by his acute agitation. After a few minutes of superfluous small talk, Armando offered me a paper bag that was swollen with $10, 000 in cash. He said that the cash was a token of gratitude for my mother helping him to restore his medical license.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:124:ce76f880ccaf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2920, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 125, "text": "a seat in Armando’s car, I noticed he was very edgy, and his eyes repeatedly darted to the left and to the right.

He said that the cash was a token of gratitude for my mother helping him to restore his medical license. Armando was parsimonious by nature, so his largesse made absolutely no sense to me. I declined his offer and returned to my office. Sitting at my desk, I repeatedly ruminated on Armando and his paper bag of cash. I ultimately came to the conclusion that the feds were using Armando to entrap me. The feds using such a transparent ploy was deeply troubling to me, but, conversely, their ploy demonstrated that the grand jury hadn’t managed to indict me—yet. After Armando attempted to entrap me, he was indicted for tax evasion and molesting his patients. In fact, the feds even managed to glean pictures of him molesting patients from an office surveillance camera. Armando was given a sentence of 51 months and sent to prison in November of 2001. The government’s game plan had been to use Armando to entrap me, but, given Armando’s conviction, I thought it would be nearly impossible for the government to resurrect him as a credible witness. The grand jury, however, persisted with its deliberations. By the summer of 2002, the grand jury continued to dispense subpoenas. On the first Friday night of July 2002, I had dinner with my sister and mother at my mother’s house. My sister looked fatigued, and she complained of a stomach ache. After we helped her to one of my mother’s vacant bedrooms, I returned to my apartment. My sister had a massive coronary that night, and my mother found Brenda’s lifeless body on the bed the following morning. On Saturday morning, I received a distraught phone call from my mother, and I raced to her house. Out of breath, I found my mother collapsed on the living room sofa, bawling. Over the years, as a funeral director, I had consoled innumerable grieving mothers, but my mother was inconsolable. When I realized that my words were hopelessly effete, I huddled her into my arms, and, sharing her grief, I also started to sob. My sister’s memorial service was held at Nolan Freewill Baptist Church. My mother, however, was too grief stricken to attend my sister’s memorial service and burial. Pastor Ray Taylor was at the pulpit, wearing his customary blue suit, white shirt, and gray tie.

Pastor Taylor may have been old and wizened, but he effortlessly launched into fiery oratory. between us. She also blamed me for the unbridled viciousness that the Secret Service had visited upon her and her husband and son—and rightfully so. I had made amends to her on several occasions for the hellish ordeals she had endured due to the Secret Service, even though my amends were received with lukewarm acceptance. She was also reluctant to visit me during my imprisonment. Brenda ultimately visited me in prison on a handful of occasions, and her visitations were invariably the result of my mother’s prodding. We had a friendly, civil relationship, but, as she lay in her coffin, I felt terrible that we had drifted so far apart. I then found myself reflecting on Butch. Although I had sporadic reminiscences of Butch, I hadn’t intensely reflected on him in years. Butch, Brenda, and I had survived my father’s drinking and madness, and that gave us an impermeable bond. I suddenly found myself lost in a montage of memories that included Brenda playing 45 records and teasing her hair, and Butch driving me out to the airport to fly toy airplanes. The memories were accompanied by an inescapable anguish and heartache that shadowed me from Nolan Freewill Baptist Church to Mountain View Memory Gardens, where Brenda was interred. Butch had been interred at Mountain View Memory Gardens 32 years earlier. Following Brenda’s death, my mother skidded into the same abyss of despair that had engulfed her in the wake of Butch’s death. She spent days in bed with the curtains drawn. I visited her every day, but she found it nearly impossible to pry herself out of bed. After a few weeks, I was able to coax her to a restaurant for dinner. As we dined, my mother was nearly catatonic and merely picked at her food. Just as my mother was starting to marginally recover from Brenda’s death, the grand jury indicted me for conspiracy to defraud the United States. The government’s zeal to indict me was demonstrated by the fact that it had stooped to using Armando, a veritable paragon of honesty and virtue, to finger me as a conspirator who aided and abetted his income tax evasion. Although the grand jury didn’t outright indict my mother, it named her as the “First Known Individual” who played an integral role in the grand conspiracy to succor Armando’s evasion of the Internal Revenue Service.

As it turned out, Armando hadn’t paid his income taxes for a number of years, so the mere act of my mother (AKA, First Known Individual) cutting checks on his behalf constituted “impeding, impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the Internal Revenue Service…” A major dilemma of the government’s case was that my mother and I weren’t privy to Armando’s outstanding tax problems, even though Armando had spun quite a yarn about how the Vinsons had colluded to abet his income tax evasion. The feds asserted that Diane—not my mother or me—had been sent a letter alerting her of Armando’s tax obligations. Diane claimed that she never received a letter from the government, but the government nonetheless maintained that it had sent the letter. The government, however, couldn’t provide proof of Diane receiving the letter, because it hadn’t been sent via certified mail. Although my mother was the person who cut the checks to help out Armando, my name was on the company’s checking account too—ergo my indictment. But my conspiracy to defraud the United States didn’t cease and desist with the checks that my mother cut on Armando’s behalf. The indictment claimed that I passed Armando cash after collecting it from his patients and also from various insurers, and I “prepared” false income tax returns for him. The government encountered a couple of hitches with the latter assertions: I never collected cash from Armando’s patients, and I’ve never prepared my own income taxes—let alone Armando’s. The government only indicted me on one count to defraud the United States, but it swarmed me with nine offenses that constituted the indictment, and I would have to defend myself against every one of those offenses. If the prosecutors sowed the seed of beyond a reasonable doubt in the jurors’ minds for just one of the offenses, I would be found guilty of the indictment. The feds also named my mother as an unindicted co-conspirator, and I had the disconcerting feeling that they would indict her without hesitation.

After my attorney reviewed the case, he was astonished not only by the bizarre nature of the indictment, but also by the great lengths the government took to manufacture it. We poured hundreds of hours into preparing my defense, and a critical facet of my defense would be my mother testifying that she and I were not aware of Armando’s prior tax violations. But the Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia told my lawyer that if my mother were called to testify at my trial she would be indicted too. In fact, I had an inkling that if the case even proceeded to trial, my mother would be indicted even if she didn’t testify on my behalf. As I’ve previously mentioned, the federal government can be an unforgiving and malicious foe. My attorney was new to the Twilight Zone of American jurisprudence, and he was stunned that the feds were threatening to indict my mother. He also saw that my resolve to fight the case was starting to erode once the feds upped the ante to include my mother. My mother had just started to recover from the loss of her daughter, and I couldn’t take a chance on her being indicted. When my attorney realized that I would plea bargain to protect my mother, he recommended a strategy that was somewhat similar to the one proffered by Van Susteren. He suggested that I check myself into a detox, so I would be eligible for a downward departure due to the “diminished capacity” of chemical dependency. I was ambivalent about his suggestion, but I reluctantly relented to spend a night in a detox. After all, one night in a detox was infinitely superior to five months at a Scientology boot camp. After my arraignment, I was released on a signature bond, and I was mandated to undergo urine testing twice a week. During my three years of supervised released, after my first incarceration, I had been urine tested for three years, and I never tested positive for illicit substances. Following my arraignment, however, I had rotator cuff surgery, and I was prescribed a painkiller, and my urine test came back positive for the prescribed painkiller. Although the feds were aware that I had had surgery the previous week, the assistant U.S. attorneys who were threatening to indict my mother argued that my bond be revoked, because of a “serious continuing drug dependency” that I", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt:128:3b07d33ab0af", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2924, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584290", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584290_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 129, "text": "had been urine tested for three years, and I never tested positive for illicit substances.

A U.S. magistrate quickly revoked my bond, and I found myself incarcerated at the West Virginia Southern Regional Jail. In retrospect, I should’ve realized that the government would use everything at its disposal to punish me. I ultimately entered into a plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney. The judge sentenced me to 41 months in a federal prison. Although Armando had pleaded guilty to tax evasion and also to molesting a number of his patients, he was given a sentence of 51 months—a scant ten months more than me. Once more, I felt that my imprisonment was orchestrated at the highest levels of the Department of Justice. The media had a field day with my indictment and subsequent plea of guilty. In addition to reporting on my “income tax scheme,” the Charleston Daily Gazette and Charleston Daily Mail recycled previous newspaper reportage on me. Both newspapers, of course, mentioned my days as a D.C. madam. The Charleston Gazette called me the “rambunctious former Mingo County coroner.” When I ponder various adjectives to describe me, “rambunctious” doesn’t immediately come to mind. The Charleston Gazette also reported that as the Mingo County coroner I “left a body in an unrefrigerated vault for more than a month” and I also made “harassing phone calls to a former employee.” The Charleston Gazette was obviously reporting on the impasse with Mr. Marcum’s body and the phone calls I had allegedly made to Mrs. Ball, but it couldn’t even accurately report on the those apocryphal accounts. So I was subjected to a new wave of media apocrypha. After my sentencing, I once more embarked on an odyssey of federal prisons. My first stopover was Oklahoma City, and then I was transferred to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. I was eventually transferred to Morgantown, where I served the balance of my sentence. The first time my partner visited me while I was incarcerated was one of the most humiliating moments of my life, even though he had a box seat as he watched the government railroad me. I felt an unquenchable shame as I greeted him in my government issued orange jumpsuit. Although I was a seasoned veteran of the prison industrial complex, I found my second incarceration to be extremely more arduous than my first for a variety of factors.

I felt an unquenchable shame as I greeted him in my government issued orange jumpsuit. Although I was a seasoned veteran of the prison industrial complex, I found my second incarceration to be extremely more arduous than my first for a variety of factors. First and foremost, my mother was suffering from various ailments, including arthritis and heart disease, and I desperately hoped that she didn’t die after outliving two of her children and having a third child in prison. Second, I was unequivocally in love, and it was devastating to be separated from my partner. And finally, I hadn’t committed a crime, especially a crime warranting 41 months of imprisonment. At least my prior incarceration had been the consequence of unlawful behavior, even though I was ultimately the fall guy for a sprawling government conspiracy. I was released from Morgantown on February 5, 2005. I felt a burst of bliss when my glance grazed the smiling faces of my mother and partner in the prison’s parking lot. I gave my mother a protracted hug, and then I gave my partner a protracted hug. The love of mother and partner had never wavered throughout my second bout of American injustice, and I was afloat in a palpable joy as we exchanged hugs. Our parking lot reunion became quite emotional, and a deluge of tears quickly overwhelmed us. We had a surprisingly upbeat conversation as we drove to the federal halfway house in Charleston, West Virginia, where I was mandated to spend the next six months. Although the circumstances surrounding my second incarceration had been particularly vicious, the government was less draconian with me throughout my second stint of supervised released. After about four months at the halfway house, I was allowed to spend the balance of my federal custody under house arrest in my apartment, and I was even permitted to work for my mother too. The government may have been less draconian to me during my second stint of supervised release, but, after my second incarceration, I was stalked by an omnipresent angst, because of the well-founded yet disconcerting realization that I wasn’t immune to government persecution and imprisonment even if I lived my life by the letter of the law. And as I was transitioning from the halfway house to house arrest in May of 2005, I quickly felt the punitive sting of wayward law enforcement via my mother.

The emergency room physician who attended to her was exceptionally attentive and considerate, and he promptly became her primary care physician. My mother thought he was an excellent physician, but the federal government nonetheless charged him with illegally dispensing controlled substances while he was employed at Williamson Memorial Hospital. Although my mother was stunned by the charges, she elected to post a hefty bond for his release, because he lacked a family to post the bond. Thus far, the physician’s legal troubles have no relationship to me, except for the fact that he treated my mother and that my mother posted his bond. But rather unsavory behind-the-scenes skullduggery quickly enmeshed me in the predicament. though my mother explicitly said that Vinsonian Investments LLC owned the property. After my mother pointed out the clerk’s error, the clerk wrote “LLC” over “Inc.” Regrettably, the clerk’s miscue enabled a crooked West Virginia magistrate to charge my mother with forging the bond agreement, because “LLC” was written over “Inc.,” despite the fact that the clerk had changed the document. (In West Virginia, magistrates are elected to office, and they are not required to have legal training, even though they conduct a wide range of judicial proceedings.) After my mother was charged with forgery, I gave her a ride to the courthouse to resolve the quandary. Mother was suffering from both congestive heart failure and spinal stenosis, so she had great difficulties walking. When I collected my mother at her house, she wore a turquoise pants suit and cradled a portable tank of oxygen. I gingerly helped her into my car, and we embarked for the courthouse. My mother was extremely stressed over the matter, and it exacerbated her shortness of breath. So she hugged an oxygen mask to her face while we were en route to the courthouse. Following our arrival, the Mingo County District Court judge who should’ve been overseeing the magistrate was conveniently nowhere to be found. A friend of my mother’s, who was a Mingo County Family Court judge, attempted to locate the judge, but he wouldn’t respond to her phone calls. My mother then met with the magistrate to resolve the issue. When my stunned mother emerged from the magistrate’s office, she told me that the magistrate informed her that her forgery charges would be dismissed if she said that I had forged the bond document!

My bewildered mother refused to accommodate him, and he summarily issued a warrant for her arrest. Shortly after she stepped out of the magistrate’s office, she was arrested and handcuffed right in front of me. As she was handcuffed, her facial expressions were disfigured by dread. My mother was being victimized yet again because of me, and I was overwhelmed by scorn. Tears welled up in my eyes, and I exploded with disdain. When I became increasingly vociferous, I was quickly informed that I too would be arrested if I didn’t rein in my outbursts. After my mother’s arrest, she was transported to the Southwest Regional Jail in Holden, West Virginia, where she was strip searched and thrown into a jail cell. In a frenzied state, I raced to the Southwest Regional Jail, and I posted her bond. Although she only spent about four hours in jail, the experience was traumatizing to her. My mother’s case was ultimately brought before a magistrate who wasn’t corrupt, and he dismissed the charges. The Charleston Gazette had a field day with my mother’s arrest. The first sentence of the article mentioned my mother and noted my “guilty plea to federal charges in 2003 kept her from facing trial …” Predictably, the article commented on me pleading guilty to racketeering for the operation of a Washington, D.C. escort service, and, of course, it remarked on the apocryphal story that I left Mr. Marcum’s body “unrefrigerated” for forty-two days. When the charges against my mother were dismissed, the Charleston Gazette ran a terse write-up about her exoneration that was buried in the deep recesses of the newspaper. My trials and tribulations have demonstrated to me that truth and the reality manufactured by the media are often diametric, because the truth is frequently obscured by a levy of lies. From time to time, however, the levy harnessing the lies eventually cracks, and torrents of truth flood into the public consciousness—albeit belatedly. The truth about the utter corruption of the judge and magistrate who contrived my mother’s arrest eventually emerged, but, unfortunately, it was years after the fact. The corrupt judge who was the architect of my mother’s arrest had an affair with his married secretary, and, when she extricated herself from the affair, the judge conscripted a West Virginia state trooper to plant drugs on her husband. The state trooper balked at his scheme, but he was willing to arrest the husband on trumped up larceny charges.

Magistrate Crum would eventually become the Mingo County Sheriff, and a 37-year-old man who claimed that Crum had molested him as a teenager murdered him. Prior to becoming a Mingo County magistrate and the Mingo County Sheriff, Crum was the sheriff of a small town in southeastern West Virginia, where he allegedly raped a 19-yearold woman in the backseat of squad car while two of his subordinates sat in the front seat of the car. A few hours after the alleged rape, the woman arrived at the emergency room of Williamson Memorial Hospital, where she told the staff she had sustained injuries during the rape. But after the young woman was subjected to a succession of threats, she withdrew her rape allegations against Crum, and the West Virginia State Police cleared him of the rape.

Although Fitzgerald wasn’t granted a second act, Americans have granted numerous sports stars and entertainment personalities second acts after they’ve been enmeshed in various personal and legal troubles. However, I felt a small town like Williamson would never grant me a third act, and upon my release from prison my problems with Magistrate Crum sanctified my suspicions. I was also distressed by the wave of malicious press that had skewered me prior to my second incarceration. The West Virginia media had so spitefully blighted my name that I longed for the anonymity that a larger city would offer me. Over the years, believe it or not, I’ve been almost as troubled by the media’s pernicious portrayal of me than by the government’s pernicious persecution.

Things like NOPD officers coming and going out of Juan’s apartment in the middle of the night, and Juan coming over to the Hawes’ apartment and asking to use their telephone so that he could call Cuba and Miami, and having packages delivered to their address, claiming that they contained orchids which might perish in the heat.2 “It was a more innocent time, and we were more naive,” Owen said to me in a somber moment of reflection. The net of all of this was that Owen’s concern over Juan Valdez’s behavior became so acute that he wrote a letter to the FBI to report that behavior as suspicious, suggesting that they investigate Valdez. According to Owen, the FBI ignored his warning, and the man who was helping Lee Oswald dispose of something under highly suspicious circumstances was not investigated. The question remains: What were they flushing down Juan Valdez’s toilet? In Me and Lee, 3 Judyth Vary Baker explains how she and Lee would kill mice in David Ferrie’s apartment, cut out the tumors, grind them up in a blender, put the puree into test tubes, and prep slides to be examined by microscope. Judyth would then transport these materials to Mary Sherman’s apartment for her review. By August, Dr. Alton Ochsner, who was directing their project, continuously ramped up “the count” of mice to be killed from 50 mice-per-day to 500 mice-per-day. Therefore, the quantity of biological material being brought to Mary Sherman’s apartment increased dramatically. It is my conclusion that the toilets were flushed in Juan Valdez’s apartment because Lee and Juan were disposing of the cancerous biological material from Mary Sherman’s apartment. Several years before my conversations with the Haweses, a was one of the NOPD homicide detectives who investigated the Mary Sherman murder. I had written about him in my first book. After reading it, he wanted to discuss the Mary Sherman murder with me. He was friendly and complimentary about my research, and said with a tinge of regret in his voice, “In those days, we were not focused on forensics the way they are today. Back then, motive was more important.” Frank went on to add that he had solved 104 of the 107 homicide cases assigned to him by the NOPD. From this, I concluded that the real point of his phone call was to make sure that I knew he was a competent homicide investigator, and not some flake. He also reminded me that in 1963, before he became a detective, he was a patrolman working the Canal Street beat on foot, and that he and his partner had arrested Lee Harvey Oswald during a street incident on August 9th.

Indeed, I later found Hayward’s name on Oswald’s arrest record. Once Frank was comfortable talking to me, he finally confided that he had wanted to arrest Juan Valdez for Mary Sherman’s murder. “There was just something about him that did not add up,” Hayward said, “but we did not have sufficient evidence to make the charge stick, and you can’t arrest someone on a hunch.” Frank said that he was mystified by all of the phone calls that he got from a wide spectrum of law enforcement agencies (FBI, Justice Department, Louisiana State Police, etc.) who called him repeatedly to inquire about any progress investigating the Mary Sherman murder. Frank had since passed away, but I remembered his comments about Valdez clearly. I mentioned these comments to Owen Hawes as we spoke, reminding him that it was Juan Valdez who said that he had smelled the smoke from Mary Sherman’s fire from a heating vent. Then Owen dropped his next bombshell: There was no central air in the Patio Apartments. Owen was an engineer experienced in building design and construction; he said that the Patio Apartments had only window units located on the outer wall, and no central system at all, not even for heating. I was getting the picture. Valdez’s apartment was the closest to St. Charles Ave. and Mary’s apartment was the farthest from St. Charles, and there were no central air ducts. Juan Valdez was, therefore, the least likely person in the complex to smell the smoke from Mary Sherman’s fire, unless he had been roaming around the courtyard of the Patio Apartments at 4 : 00 a.m for some reason. Maybe Juan Valdez knew more about what happened to Mary Sherman than he admitted. Owen Hawes then said that his own name was mentioned in the police report about the burglary of Mary Sherman’s apartment that happened months before her murder. Owen was concerned that the report falsely stated that Owen had noticed Sherman’s apartment door ajar and had contacted Mary’s friend Carolyn Talley about it. Owen had done neither of these things, and suspected that Juan Valdez had used his name when questioned by the police. I was aware of the burglary, but had not been able to pin a date on it.

I asked Owen how he knew his name was in the Burglary Report, and he told me that he had a copy of the document. He offered to send it to me, and I accepted. What I found astounded me! Had I realized the importance of this document, I would have been looking for it vigorously. But I didn’t; I was lucky. It was handed to me because of our conversation about Juan Valdez. The date of the burglary thundered at me: August 31, 1963. It was a date that I knew well. udyth Vary Baker was the young cancer researcher whose Jspecialized skills were needed to weaponize cancer for a bio-weapon, and she was the one who transported “the product” of their cancer research to Mary Sherman’s apartment for her review. I had extracted what facts I could about Judyth’s story from her ill-fated 2006 book called Lee Harvey Oswald: The True Story of the Accused Assassin of President John F. Kennedy by his Lover, which was withdrawn after only 85 copies were printed. But even then, this August 31, 1963 date meant nothing to me. It was only after my publisher acquired the rights to Judyth’s memoir and asked me to build a timeline for the second draft that I started paying closer attention to the dates. Today, that book is known as Me & Lee: How I came to know, love, and lose Lee Harvey Oswald by Judyth Vary Baker. I think it is an extremely important book. One of its great accomplishments is that it nails both the dates and the purposes of Oswald’s often overlooked trips to Clinton and Jackson, Louisiana. The first date in this constellation is August 28, 1963, the date that Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King gave his “I have a dream” speech in Washington, D.C. during the Civil Rights March. Because of this, CORE (the Congress on Racial Equality, a national organization based out of the University of Chicago) had planned voter-registration drives for blacks all across the country, especially in the South, for the following day, August 29, 1963.

Thursday, August 29^(th) was selected as the date, and Clay Shaw drove David Ferrie, Lee Oswald and the bio-weapon to Jackson, Louisiana. There they would need to get past the guards and fences surrounding the East Louisiana State Mental Hospital (a facility for the criminally insane) to inject the bio-weapon into specially selected “volunteer” prisoners. The logistical problem was that the prisoner(s) who were to be injected were still in nearby Angola Penitentiary and needed to be transferred to the hospital in Jackson for that purpose. Jackson, Louisiana (not to be confused with Jackson, Mississippi) is a tiny town where a black Cadillac might attract unwanted attention to the men transporting the bio-weapon. Clinton, Louisiana, however, was just down the road from Jackson and was a slightly larger town with a courthouse where cars like black Cadillacs were frequently parked by lawyers, judges and politicians. It was here that Clay Shaw planned to wait for a phone call that said the prisoner had left Angola and was en route to the hospital in Jackson.5 Once the prisoner had left, Shaw would proceed to Jackson to rendezvous with the van from Angola so that he could follow it onto the mental hospital grounds, as if his black Cadillac was part of the official convoy from Angola. What Shaw and company expected to find in Clinton that day was an empty square in front of a small-town courthouse on a hot August afternoon. What they encountered, however, was a crowded square with a bunch of angry whites watching an unwanted black-voter registration drive, with the town’s marshal surveying the scene. So, instead of waiting quietly in the center of a lazy small town in rural Louisiana on a hot August afternoon, they had driven into the center of a hotbed of civil rights activity with everyone watching, as will be discussed in more detail. Finally, the pay phone rang. Shaw got his call, and the black Cadillac headed to the hospital in Jackson where someone (presumably Ferrie) injected the prisoner(s) with the cancer weapon. Once that was done, Shaw’s team started the long drive back to New Orleans.6 Their work in Jackson was finished for the moment, but it would be two days before anyone would be able to tell if the bio-weapon had worked.

To find out, a blood test would need to be done 48 hours later. And not just any blood test: a blood titration test. These were exotic tests that only a few people in the country even knew how to perform … one of these people was Judyth Vary Baker. Two days later, at 11:00 a.m. on August 31, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald began driving Judyth Vary Baker from New Orleans to Jackson, Louisiana,7 so Judyth could perform the blood tests on the prisoner(s) to confirm that the cancer cocktail had “kicked in.”8 It had. At the end of the day, Lee dropped Judyth off at her house at 1032 Marengo Street at 10 : 00 p.m . This was the end of Judyth’s involvement with the project, which had proven itself by this time. What is clear from reading Me & Lee is that by the end of August 1963, the development phase of the bio-weapon was over. All that remained was to test it on humans, and that involved the 48-hour blood tests that Judyth needed to perform. Before Judyth even tested the patient’s blood for cancer, Mary was headed out of the country. And by the time the day was over, the evidence that might have connected Mary to the project was stolen from her apartment. So what was stolen from Mary’s apartment? And why? These are 1963 dollars. In current value over $12, 000 of “Miscellaneous” items had been stolen! That’s 71% of the total! How unusual! In an effort to make sense out of this, I contacted Judyth Vary Baker, who had been in Mary’s apartment in 1963, and I asked her what had she seen in Mary’s apartment that could have been worth that much money. Judyth sent me back a list of laboratory equipment, including an expensive oil-immersion microscope and a rotating wheel that held test tubes, with their current prices that added up to $12, 000. I think it is safe to say that Mary’s medical equipment was the target of the burglary. All of Mary’s medical equipment had been removed from her apartment. A heavyset Cuban-looking man had been seen near the scene. The net effect was that evidence connecting Mary Sherman to the bio-weapon plot had been “sanitized.” Neither Judyth nor Mary could expose Dr. Ochsner’s involvement without the evidence, and the evidence was now gone.12 7 Lee said he had something to do earlier in the morning, necessitating their rather late starting time.

See Me & Lee. The result was that Ochsner became furious and banished Judyth from medicine. Ochsner knew the type of trouble that a public exposure of their experiments would cause. He may have been the person who arranged for Mary’s apartment to be burglarized in order to destroy the evidence. n one level this book is a cold-case investigation into the 1964 murder of Dr. Mary Sherman in New Orleans — a murder which remains unsolved and is remembered as one of the most mysterious ever committed in a city that has known so much mystery and so many murders. But there is more to this story than murder and mystery. Understanding the death of this one woman unravels much of our nation’s secret history. It illuminates the darkness. It connects great medical disasters of our time to important political events of the day. It unveils the contamination of hundreds of millions of doses of the polio vaccine with dozens of monkey viruses. It spotlights the epidemic of soft tissue cancers that swept our country. And it exposes dangerous secret experiments which used radiation to mutate cancer-causing monkey viruses. It connects leaders of American medicine to the accused assassin of the President of the United States. This one murder helps us understand why we have been lied to with such conviction for so many years — and why those lies are likely to continue. But this is not a murder mystery: fascinating perhaps, but hardly entertainment. For me, writing this book was difficult, stressful and dangerous. What began as an investigation into this single murder morphed into consideration of epidemics which killed millions of people and which cost billions of dollars. It became an investigation into an underground medical laboratory that was accidentally discovered during an investigation into the JFK assassination — a laboratory which secretly irradiated cancer-causing monkey viruses to develop a biological weapon.

This story seems to have followed me throughout my life, and its recurring pattern is eerie indeed. Had I realized its importance, I would have paid closer attention. What I do remember are fragments that I pieced together later in life: a name here, an incident there, pieces of a puzzle often separated by years of unrelated distractions. I even remember sitting on Mary Sherman’s lap once as a child. She and my father worked together at Tulane Medical School in New Orleans. They had taken a British doctor out to dinner and then to our family’s home for an after-dinner drink. When she died in the summer of 1964, I saw my father cry for the first time. As a Navy doctor during World War II, my father had seen more than his share of burned and broken bodies. Someone (I don’t know who) had asked him to go to the morgue to look at Mary Sherman’s body to get a second opinion on her unusual death. He came home from the morgue that day, fixed himself a drink, sat down in his chair, and cried silently. I wondered what was wrong. My mother told me that a woman he knew from the office had died. It was only later that I learned it was Mary Sherman. Seeing my father cry was memorable for me — a once in a lifetime experience. Having spent his career amputating limbs and standing in an Emergency Room making life-ordeath decisions about people pulled from mangled vehicles, he was not prone to show much emotion. I mention this incident here because it is important to our story. It is how This key fact in the case was never told to the press. Why not? Can you imagine the O.J. Simpson trial without telling the public Nicole’s throat was cut? Why was the press not told the most obvious fact in this case? Who was trying to protect whom? Were there powerful forces controlling the story from the beginning? If so, what did they not want us to know? And why did they not want us to know it? That same summer, I overheard my father complain bitterly when he learned about certain activities going on at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital. His anger and frustration seemed out of character for this deep-keeled man.

His anger and frustration seemed out of character for this deep-keeled man. I remember his words: “We fought wars to keep people from doing things like this.” In the summer of 1964 my father learned something about what had been going on at the USPHS hospital. I do not recall if this was before or after Mary Sherman’s death, but it was around that time. He was particularly insulted by the idea that it was taking place on the grounds of the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital, a facility that was supposed to protect the American public from deadly diseases. When he vented his frustration to my mother, she reminded him that there was probably nothing he could do about it “at this point.” His response: “It’s just that I gave up so much to keep stuff like this from happening.” I have always understood this comment to be about leaving the Navy and ending his admiral-track career. Despite this high price, he remained dedicated to the idea of medical ethics, a commitment he acquired from his father — a bio-chemist, veterinarian, and medical doctor who helped develop the first anthrax vaccine. Thus he was not only not a part of these secret radiation experiments, but was also disturbed to learn about them. In the late 1960s, I heard about Mary Sherman’s connection to an underground medical laboratory run by a suspect in the murder of President Kennedy. I was told they were using monkey viruses to create cancer. The possibility of this being used as a biological weapon was clear. The dark specter of unleashing a designer virus on the world haunted me. I even offered a sarcastic comment at the time: “The good news is if there’s a bizarre global epidemic involving cancer and a monkey virus thirty years from now, at least we’ll know where it came from.” In 1971, during what might be described as a deathbed conversation, I confronted my father about Mary Sherman. He was getting ready to go to the hospital. For the first time in his life, he was going as a patient. His cancerous lung was scheduled to be surgically removed in the morning. We both knew that, due to his fragile health, he would probably not survive the surgery. We discussed it. We both realized that this would probably be the last conversation we would ever have with each other. He stoically gave me instructions about caring for my mother.

I listened and pondered the strength of this quiet man who had seen so much death in his professional life. I studied the courage with which he faced his own. When he finished, I acknowledged his requests and confirmed my willingness to carry out his instructions. Then I said that I had a few questions of my own. Questions that I would never be able to ask him again. Questions that I thought were important for him to answer, so that the truth would not die with him. I asked him to tell me about Mary Sherman and about all that spooky stuff that was going on at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital. “Wasn’t she some kind of cancer expert?” I ventured. “I’m hardly in a position to stop you,” he said with the casual resignation of a man who never expected to see another football game. Then he collected his thoughts and, in a grave voice, he gave me this warning: “Ed, I need you to listen to me carefully. I will not be able to say this to you again. If you do figure out what happened down there and decide to tell the world what you found, I need you to realize that you will be crossing swords with the most powerful people in our country. And you should think twice before crossing them.” The 1980s ushered in the epidemics that I had feared in the 1960s. The mainstream scientific community stated that AIDS was caused by the unexplained mutation of a monkey virus. They estimated the date of the mutation to be around 1960. The logical question (who had been mutating monkey viruses around 1960?) was not even asked in the press. And, yes, I was concerned about what I had heard in New Orleans. It all sounded so similar. Could there be a connection? And if there was, was there any point in speaking up about it? Trade places with me for a moment: If you were in my shoes, would you have? I went to medical libraries and read scientific articles hoping to find facts that would make my fears unfounded. I was anxious to find a flaw in my own argument, which would enable me to walk away from a project that was starting to consume all of my free time. I did not find the flaw, but I did find something else.

I did not find the flaw, but I did find something else. As I poured over the official cancer statistics from the National Cancer Institute, I saw the dimensions of the massive epidemic of soft tissue cancers that had swept our country. An epidemic that had been all but ignored by our watchdog press. An epidemic that could reasonably be explained by the cancer-causing monkey viruses that had contaminated the polio vaccine of my youth. Whatever I felt my options were prior to that moment, they suddenly narrowed. I also noticed that names connected to the polio vaccine were names connected to Mary Sherman and to the investigation of the JFK assassination. I began to suspect that these secrets were somehow intertwined. A web of secrecy surrounding our national health. Interlocking secrets that protected each other. Secrets which presented serious accountability problems for the people in power. I remembered the warning my father had given me. I could see how unwelcome this news would be in many circles. In the 1990s I found documentation and witnesses to support much of what I had heard as a child. My fears were now based in facts. I met highly-credentialed scientists who understood both the history and the science behind these events clearly, and they took my concerns seriously. Some quietly helped me find people who knew things that I needed to know. They helped me connect the dots. In July 1995 I self-published my story as Mary, Ferrie ℰ the Monkey Virus: The Story of an Underground Medical Laboratory. I could only afford to print 1,000 copies, but I hoped that getting the story out might attract a publisher. After the first thousand books were gone, I could not afford a reprint. Still without a publisher, I switched tactics and started photocopying comb-bound manuscripts in batches of ten. This new technique enabled me to update the book with new information as I found it and kept me in print for years. A handful of orders trickled in each week. By the end of 1999, a second thousand books had been shipped. With copies in all fifty states and five foreign countries, I felt that “the cat” was now “out of the bag,” and I could finally go back to my advertising career and try to make a living — which I did in 2000.

They were investigating a woman who said that she had been in the underground medical laboratory that I had written about in my book. That she knew Mary Sherman. That she had been trained to handle cancer-causing viruses. That she had been part of the effort to develop a biological weapon. That she knew Lee Harvey Oswald. Would I meet with them for an off-camera interview? I accepted. Three years later, in November 2003, the History Channel aired a story about this same underground medical laboratory. It mentioned Dr. Mary Sherman, David Ferrie, and Lee Oswald, but not my book. The episode, featuring a young woman who had handled the cancer-causing monkey viruses for the secret project, was part of their series The Men Who Killed Kennedy. A week later the History Channel reversed course. The episode was withdrawn from circulation, and has not been aired again. Our story comes from a fermenting mash of science, secrecy, patriotism, power, paranoia and extremism. It is not a pretty picture. It involves death, disease, covert wars, and the quiet hand of power. In our path sit innocent people who I am sure would prefer not to be involved. I apologize to them in advance. Then there are others who claim to have forgotten everything they know about this matter or who know but refuse to talk. To them I offer no apology. This story casts a shadow that is so dark and so long that I have chosen to tell it simply. Some have said that it has the nightmarish quality of an anxiety dream. I prefer to see it in a different light. It is, as songwriter Jackson Browne once said, “the fitful dream of some greater awakening.” We are just beginning to wake up to the responsibilities of being a free society. It is much more complicated than dropping bombs on an obvious enemy. It is time we began to question what the people of power did with the trust and money we gave them. I doubt we will ever hear the Surgeon General stand up at a press conference and acknowledge this operation.

Reasons capable of destroying careers and toppling governments. A full exposure here would threaten the treasure of our nation’s wealthiest corporations, the reputations of some of the powerful political figures of the day, and the precious confidence we give our national institutions. While we can understand why they kept these matters secret, we have a different goal. To investigate such secrecy is a formidable task. We tread lightly for we walk upon tender ground, over the bones of children, through sour rooms of tumor-bearing mice, and into the blood-stained bedroom of one of our nation’s most respected cancer researchers. It is here we search for knowledge that was not meant to be known. We will use published sources and official records as best we can. At times we examine these more closely and in greater detail than anyone before us. But we must be prepared to look beyond the official paper trail and to use less certain methods to find our way. Methods like oral history, personal testimony, feeble press accounts, censored government documents, and our own capable and curious intellects. Complicating our task further is the catastrophic flood of 2005 that followed Hurricane Katrina. Irreplaceable documents (like the crime-scene photos) and precious physical evidence (like the blood-soaked gloves found in Mary Sherman’s apartment, which could still yield DNA or other clues) may have been lost forever when the waters of Lake Pontchartrain engulfed the city of New Orleans. Yet we can proceed with what we do know. As you will see, plenty of evidence had been collected previously. You will find this book as much of a personal odyssey as a journalistic work. But that’s what happens when you investigate a murder only to discover an epidemic. Either way the destination is the same. I will tell you why I am deeply suspicious of certain activities that occurred in New Orleans in the 1960s, and why you should be too. We will begin with what I personally saw and heard over the years. To that we add years of research. Then we get questions. Fair and honorable questions. Questions which deserve answers. Questions which have their own purpose, their own energy, even their own dignity. Questions which will eventually help us coax this Orwellian monster out of its swamp of secrecy.

This particular day, my father and I had been sailing on his boat, the Interlude, a modest double-ended wooden sloop whose leaky hull showed its age. The Interlude was a noticeable step down the status ladder from the larger, newer, more glamorous boats which flanked it on the pier. Boats tend to be metaphors of their owners, and this was no exception. It was an unpretentious boat for an unpretentious man. My father was dressed in his habitual sailing clothes, baggy khaki pants, a blue cotton shirt, and a dark blue baseball cap that covered his short-cropped head of completely grey hair. This attire was as close as he could get to his old Navy uniform, and he wore it whenever he sailed. With his omnipresent cigarette in hand, he shuffled down the concrete pier in a casual gait with me at his side. This quiet man honored simplicity and enjoyed the peace that followed a long, terrible war. This rumpled façade concealed a complex and accomplished man who had witnessed more than his share of human suffering. The son of a country doctor, he graduated from Harvard Medical School in the late 1930s and then served as an officer in the U.S. Navy, in both the Atlantic and the Pacific, during World War II. By the end of the war, he was planning medical support for an invasion of Japan, where they anticipated one million American casualties. In 1946-47, he was stationed (with his wife and infant daughter) in the smoldering Philippines. Upon returning to the States, he left the Navy and specialized in orthopedic surgery. After several moves, he settled in New Orleans in 1952. Now he made his living teaching at Tulane Medical School, performing surgery, and working with crippled children. He sailed to relax.1 gypsy, looking every bit like the Ancient Mariner himself. Never before had I seen such a character in person. His leathery skin held a deep brown tan set off sharply by his tattered sun-bleached pants cut below the knee. Long curls of grey hair haphazardly fell from under the bandanna tied around his head. On his shoulder sat a small, mischievous monkey about twelve inches tall, tethered on a leash. As we passed, the pirate smiled at us; his I had heard my mother mention that monkeys occasionally carried rabies. I reasoned to myself for a moment: Dogs could carry rabies, but we had a dog.

I decided to give the monkey pet idea a second try. “Like rabies?” I countered. I was puzzled by his comment. I wondered how my father, an orthopedic surgeon whom the children in my family jokingly referred to as “Old Sawbones,” knew about weird monkey viruses which were still being researched at the leading edge of medical science. So I asked him, “Where did you learn about that?” He paused to take a long drag off his cigarette and seemed to be thinking about the question. In the interim I decided to speculate: “Did you learn about that in the Philippines?” “No,” he said, blowing out his cigarette smoke in a short breath. “I don’t suppose there’s any harm in telling my tenyear-old son,” as if talking to a cloud. Then he turned to me and said, “They’re researching monkey viruses down at the med school. Some of the more deadly ones are coming in from Africa.” Africa?!!! I may have been ten years old, but I did not need Joseph Conrad to tell me that Africa was mysterious. From what I had seen in school and on television, Africa was a wild, poverty-stricken continent riddled with starvation and horrifying diseases. It was also full of bizarre forms of life which defied your imagination, like ants the size of your foot and snakes as long as your car. I was not interested in catching any weird fatal virus from Africa, no matter how cute the monkey. I wondered if the pirate knew the danger he was in. The fact that these diseases obviously concerned my father more than rabies made a huge impression upon me. His comments ended my desire for a pet monkey, but they were the beginning of my curiosity about the monkey virus research being conducted in New Orleans. My first real question arose from my dad’s cautiousness: Why were Tulane’s doctors not supposed to talk about the monkey virus research program? Several days after the pirate incident we had a substitute teacher at school. In the middle of the day she turned her attention to science and started talking about germs and diseases. She reviewed the basics about how germs caused diseases and how our bodies fought back. She went on to explain the differences among bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

She reviewed the basics about how germs caused diseases and how our bodies fought back. She went on to explain the differences among bacteria, fungi, and viruses. As her lecture continued, she confidently explained how modern medicine had triumphed over bacteria and fungi with medicines and antibiotics. Then she moved the discussion to the frontier of medicine, where researchers were battling the mysterious world of viruses. I raised my hand to make a contribution to the discussion: They were researching viruses down at Tulane Medical School. (I knew the monkey subject was taboo, so I did not mention it.) “No,” she said immediately, and turning toward the entire class, she said, “That’s wrong,” in a definitive voice. “Tulane is just a college and its purpose is to teach students, not to do research. Virus research,” she continued, “is a very complex subject and is only done by very intelligent specialists at faraway places like Harvard and Johns Hopkins universities and at special government research centers which have special equipment.” I was embarrassed by her response, but there was nothing I could do about it. I knew she was both right and wrong. Tulane’s faculty was full of people from Harvard and Hopkins. My father was one of them. Many of them were doing research. For over 100 years the reputation of Tulane had been based on battling tropical diseases like yellow fever and malaria. It was true that the names Harvard and Johns Hopkins were in the news more often than Tulane, each time announcing some medical breakthrough or at least updating the public on their progress in fighting some dreaded disease. Other than announcing its pathetic football scores, Tulane’s name hardly ever appeared in the local press. Public news about Tulane Medical School was basically non-existent in the 1960s.2 The teacher had stated the public’s perception accurately enough. More importantly, I knew that nothing I could say would change her mind. More than likely she just could not grasp that idea that something “local” might be important. Beaten for the moment, I held my tongue. “Not everybody wants publicity,” he patiently explained. “Yes, some people do research because they want to be famous and tell the world how great they are; but other people are not interested in publicity, and they do research to get information and knowledge. It’s just part of being involved in academic medicine.” While I understood that he was trying to communicate the nobility of quiet scholarship, his answer did not make sense to me. Such an explanation might explain the bragging of an upstart school, but it did not explain why we heard about research from first-class schools like Harvard and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:14:a3cd507a2e15", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2944, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "world how great they are; but other people are not interested in publicity, and they do research to get information and knowledge.

Such an explanation might explain the bragging of an upstart school, but it did not explain why we heard about research from first-class schools like Harvard and Hopkins, but not Tulane. I thought about his comment for a minute and asked, “What sort of people wouldn’t want the public to know about their research?” He hid his exasperation with my relentless questioning in his quiet bedside manner, and said that much of the research at Tulane was financed by money from drug companies and from the U.S. government. These grants were frequently for experiments with drugs that were not yet ready for the public. Therefore, there was no reason to tell the public about them. That still did not answer the question to my satisfaction. Sooner or later those drugs would be ready, but somehow I knew we still would not hear about them. The not-ready-yet argument was as true for Harvard and Hopkins as for Tulane. But I did understand his main points clearly. First, Tulane did not have enough money to fund its own research and was dependent upon others, like drug companies and the U.S. government, who consequently dictated what was to be researched and what was to be talked about. And secondly, Tulane Medical School did not get publicity because it did not want publicity. While this was not much of a victory for me, at least I understood why the teacher and the public did not know about Tulane’s virus research programs. The possibility of public panic over an accidental epidemic was a real and present danger to both researchers and their financial backers. One bad incident might trigger a public outcry that would effectively shut down all such research for years. The possibility of such an accidental epidemic was very real, and the scientists knew it.3 During the early 1960s there were numerous outbreaks of infectious diseases among the animal handlers in monkey labs around the country.4 Waterborne diseases were transferred through saliva, moisture in the breath, and urine. They could be caught just by being around the primates. Cleaning out animal cages was dangerous. Feeding a monkey was dangerous. Taking a monkey out of a cage was dangerous. Holding a monkey was dangerous. Primates are intelligent mammals, and they quickly figured out that a trip with a handler often meant getting stuck with needles, or having the top of the skull chopped off with a power saw, or being injected with psychoactive drugs. The monkeys fought back. They bit their handlers. They urinated on them. They tried to escape.

The monkeys fought back. They bit their handlers. They urinated on them. They tried to escape. Monkey handlers who drew blood from one cancerous monkey to inject it into another occasionally stabbed themselves with needles full of blood laced with carcinogenic monkey viruses.5 The dangers were enormous, and the controls were feeble by today’s standards. The generality of all this is well documented in medical libraries around the country. One book published during the 1960s made the point clearly in its title, The Hazards of Handling Simians, and listed the numerous outbreaks of diseases in the primate research facilities during the previous two decades.6 There is … a serious danger that viruses from such closely related groups as the simian primates could show an altered pathogenesis in man, of which malignancy could be a feature. The dangers of such happening are enhanced by man’s exposure in crowded cities to oncogenic agents and increased radiation hazards … The idea of an epidemic suddenly sweeping the streets of an American city was not foreign to the public. In fact, a movie called Panic in the Streets won the Academy Award for best screenplay in 1952. Panic in the Streets depicted a U.S. Public Health Service officer battling a modern day outbreak of bubonic plague on the streets of New Orleans. But the press of the 1950s and 1960s either did not consider the public’s interest in medical matters substantial enough to warrant coverage, or they felt they had a higher duty to prevent public panic. Either way, the press did a poor job of covering the issue then. But, they do a better job of covering it today. For example, an accident occurred at a Yale laboratory in the 1990s. The headline in Time shouted, “A Deadly Virus Escapes.” The sub-headline continued, “Concerns about lab security arise as a mysterious disease from Brazil strikes a Yale researcher.”9 The researcher worked at a Biohazard-3 lab and was studying a rare, potentially lethal virus when he broke a test tube. He failed to report the incident, which sprayed this virus into his nostrils. Instead, he went to visit friends in Boston. When the incident was discovered, the researcher was quarantined, and his friends were put under medical surveillance. The article concluded, “If researchers do not tighten some of their procedures, the next outbreak might not be so benign.” All of which makes one wonder: What safety procedures were enforced in the monkey labs of the 1960s?

And what procedures would have been followed in an underground medical laboratory with no visible sponsor? To understand the type and extent of monkey virus research being done in medical schools in the 1950s and 1960s, I went to medical libraries and started reading the history of virology. While even an overview of these activities is beyond our scope at the moment, there are a few points worth mentioning. First is that it was well established in these medical research circles around the world prior to 1960 that certain monkey viruses caused various types of cancer, including cancers of the skin, lungs, and bones.10 Secondly, experimentation with carcinogenic viruses was widespread throughout the network of primate research centers, from the U.S., to Europe, to the U.S.S.R. Blood, tumor cells, and viral extracts were routinely taken from a variety of animals and injected into monkeys like a game of viral roulette. One lab created tumors in as little as eight days.11 Another lab injected human volunteers with the known cancer-causing monkey viruses to observe the effects.12 New diseases started to appear — diseases which were unknown in the wild. One such disease that first appeared in the lab is now called SAIDS or Simian AIDS.13 It occurred when African monkey viruses were given to Asian monkeys. SIV, the retrovirus that collapsed the immune systems of Asian monkeys, did not cause disease in its natural host, the African green monkey.14 In addition to viral roulette, researchers experimented with radiation therapy, beaming x-rays and gamma rays directly into tumors to encourage remission. The medical researchers of the 1960s irradiated tumors in laboratory animals, including primates, and shot radiation directly into the tumors of human patients.15 Think this one through before we proceed. When you shoot a radioactive beam at a tumor, you not only hit the tumor, but you also hit the blood and viruses in and around the tumor. Was the type of radiation used to dissolve cancer tumors strong enough and focused enough to damage the DNA and RNA of the viruses floating in the patient’s blood? At this point, the medically sophisticated reader might say, “Wait a minute! The radiation exposure of a clinical x-ray machine does minimal damage to DNA or RNA, and very many people receive very many x-rays without getting cancer.” And this is true where we are talking about the exposure and energy levels associated with common clinical use, which have", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:17:e97d5ee78f5c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2947, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "cancer tumors strong enough and focused enough to damage the DNA and RNA of the viruses floating in the patient’s blood?

However, in the late 1950s a powerful new device emerged from the physics lab and quietly began to be distributed to selected medical research facilities. It was called a linear particle accelerator. 16 Never before had a machine of this magnitude been put into the commercial workplace. You might think of it as a poor-man’s atom-smasher. These high-voltage scientific machines were capable of doing things never done before, and they spawned new ultra-hi-tech applications that stretched the imagination. Their basic capabilities included producing high-energy radiation and hurling sub-atomic particles near the speed of light into whatever object one desired.17 To illustrate their ability to change things generally considered to be unchangeable, let’s look at a commercial application of a linear accelerator in South Africa. Shooting subatomic particles through imperfect yellow diamonds stripped the impurities out of the yellow diamonds and turned them into clear marketable white diamonds. These linear accelerators were capable of destroying anything in their path. There is nothing they could not cut, if directed to do so. This particular point was dramatically demonstrated by a man named Jack Nygard, an engineer at a company in Boston which manufactured linear accelerators.18 Nygard developed ingenious new commercial applications for linear accelerators, from preserving bananas to cross-bonding wood. By shooting particles laterally through plastic-laminated wood, Nygard created a new structural matrix inside the wood. The result was an ultra-hard super-wood that would never warp. It was the perfect low-maintenance solution for the bowling industry. Nygard turned entrepreneur and set up shop in the heart of the lumber industry near Seattle, Washington, where he began producing his super-wood on a commercial scale. His success continued until the day the technician running his accelerator did not notice that Jack had stepped into the wood-processing area. When the technician flipped the switch on the 5,000,000 volt machine, it was the last anyone ever saw of Jack Nygard.19 The beam of electro-magnetic radiation burned him to the point of disintegration. They swept up his ashes. (Or so the story goes.) Some of the scientists involved in the field of monkey virus experiments got extremely nervous about the dangers of such experiments, and warned their colleagues in the mid-1960s that if one of these monkey viruses mutated into a more lethal form and got into the human blood supply, there could be a global epidemic which would", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:18:2e2cf2e1398c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2948, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "Jack Nygard.19 The beam of electro-magnetic radiation burned him to the point of disintegration.

Today that laboratory has over 4,000 primates, thirty scientists, and 130 support workers, plus a public relations director whose job it is to boast of the center’s virus research, especially on AIDS, and to point to the improvements in lab security, such as the high-security zone, where researchers and staff shower and change clothes before approaching or leaving the 500 monkeys infected with simian AIDS. Despite these security measures, Delta was back in the headlines in 1994, when eighty-three monkeys escaped. The public The Delta primate lab’s $4, 000, 000 per year operating budget comes directly from the U.S. government’s National Institutes of Health, as it has for the past forty years. One critic of animal research, Dr. Peggy Carlson of the Physicians’ Committee for Responsible Medicine, claimed that animal research is big business, and said, “They are taking money away from other areas and dumping it into a sinkhole.”25 Other critics opposed animal research on humanitarian grounds, many believing that animal research actually contributes more to advancing professional careers than to advancing human medicine. A case in point involved ten monkeys, which were transferred to the Delta Regional Primate Center from Silver Springs laboratory after their infamous experiments triggered a national animal-rights debate in the 1980s. Delta terminated eight of the monkeys following heavy-handed experiments. The other two monkeys which had their spinal cords deliberately severed at Silver Springs in the mid-1980s were kept alive at the Delta Regional Primate Center until the early-1990s.26 Dana Dorson, an activist from a group called Legislation in Support of Animals, saw little improvement in the new experimental oversight procedures: “Those committees just rubber stamp whatever is presented to them.”27 Attempting to counter the animal rights critics, Delta Regional Primate Center’s director Peter Gerone said, “Sometimes the public perception is that we do anything we want to monkeys, but that’s a myth.

After several hours I took a break and, as a distraction, set out to explore the mysteries of the medical school. Near the elevator on one floor, I found an incredible display of mutated human fetuses stored in glass jars. This mind-boggling collection of genetic malfunctions featured two-headed babies, Mongoloid fetuses, and Siamese twins. I decided to explore the other floors to see what else they had. A voice came from inside the room. “Come in. Come in. Who are you? And what can I do for you?” A professor sat in his chair looking at me, his head cocked to one side. He was dressed casually, a plaid shirt, no coat, no tie, no medical jacket. I introduced myself saying that I was visiting my father who was a professor in orthopedics. He invited me to come in and see the monkeys. He explained that the tops of their skulls had been removed with a bone saw and electrodes had been placed deep inside their brains. He held a sample electrode up for me to see. It was a copper wire with a silver ball on the end which acted like a microphone inside the monkey’s brain, sensing and amplifying electrical signals. Once fifteen or so of these electrodes were implanted in the monkey’s brain, they were soldered to a data plug which was then glued to the monkey’s skull. Once everything was in place, the monkeys would be plugged into a electronic data-collection machine, similar to an EEG, and then injected with experimental psychoactive drugs. The machine measured the reaction of the various parts of their brains to the drugs. The professor held up a haphazardly folded scroll of paper full of squiggly lines to show me how the raw data was collected. “It’s amazing work,” I commented gesturing to the monkeys. From what I can find in the medical libraries, the history of primate research in America started with psychology experiments. An American psychologist named Robert Yerkes originally became famous for", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:20:f7d643154473", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2950, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "experimental psychoactive drugs.

From what I can find in the medical libraries, the history of primate research in America started with psychology experiments. An American psychologist named Robert Yerkes originally became famous for developing and administering the first large-scale intelligence test to American soldiers during World War I. Later, as a professor at Yale, Yerkes started exploring the biological basis for intelligence by comparing the brain functions of a wide variety of animals. He called this niche “psycho-biology.” In the 1920s Yerkes went further still, getting as close to the human brain as he could, by dissecting and analyzing the brains of gorillas and other high primates. His 1924 book The Mind of the Gorilla catapulted him to become the world’s leading authority on brain function. In 1928 he established the first large-scale scientific primate laboratory for Yale University, not in Connecticut, but in the warmer suburbs of Jacksonville, Florida.31 There they used lobotomies and other techniques to isolate brain function further. In 1942 the laboratory was renamed in his honor. The Yerkes lab was eventually moved to Emory University in Atlanta, nearer the Center for Disease Control. Today it is one of the seven federally funded primate research centers. Only seven, if you do not count the U.S. military’s primate laboratories. For some reason, before the Delta Regional Primate Center was established, the Tulane/LSU monkey lab was unofficially referred to as the “Yerkes lab.” I say this mostly from personal experience. Growing up I repeatedly heard the New Orleans lab referred to as “Yerkes.” As my seventh grade teacher put it, “It’s not the famous Yerkes lab, but it’s like the Yerkes lab.” During the course of researching and writing this book, I heard three separate people refer to the Delta primate lab as “Yerkes.” Further, I found a reference in a 1967 medical book to “an outbreak of hepatitis at Yerkes in New Orleans,”32 reported by Dr. Arthur Riopelle in 1963, a year before the Delta Regional Primate Center opened. Dr. Riopelle was a psychologist specializing in brain function at the LSU Medical School in New Orleans, and he soon became the first director of the Delta Regional Primate Center. I wrote him a letter asking for clarification on the Yerkes name. He did not write back. The use of the Yerkes name for a lab in New Orleans remains somewhat of a mystery to me. But it certainly would have helped deflect any reports of misconduct in a lab if one circulated the name of another lab hundreds of miles away. When confronted with an accusation, one could say, “What", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:21:492c455912ef", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2951, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "the first director of the Delta Regional Primate Center.

You must be confused.” Monkey research in the 1930s and 1940s was by no means confined to psychology. Monkeys were the primary means of studying many viruses, including polio. Then in the late 1940s John F. Enders, a microbiologist from Harvard, and several students figured out how to grow viruses in a test tube full of human cells. At the time, the breakthrough was hailed as the end of the monkey era.33 Today, however, there are approximately 20,000 monkeys sitting in cages in scientific laboratories across the country who might disagree with that prediction. The second reason for maintaining a low profile was that the animal rights movement was just starting to grow. Antivivisectionists groups were protesting the treatment of experimental animals, and were distributing literature which showed the horrors of life and death in the animal labs. Keeping a low profile prevented such publicity from creating negative pressures on researchers and their employers. The third reason for keeping a low profile was the secrecy demanded by covert Cold War operations. Simply said, Tulane was conducting sensitive research for the U.S. government, some of which was for the CIA. This was as much a matter of political pork as national security. Louisiana had one of the most powerful delegations in Washington, and much of that power was concentrated in the hands of legislators who controlled the military budgets. Congress works on the seniority system, and very few people had been in Washington longer than Louisiana’s most powerful members: D F. Edward Hebert, Chairman of Armed Services Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives. Taxes start in the House, and budgets start in Committee. As Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, the entire U.S. military budget and the vast majority of the CIA budget started on Hebert’s desk. One of his jobs was to hide most of the CIA budget in the U.S. military budget. He was known as “the military’s best friend.”34 D Allen Ellender had been in the U.S. Senate for over 40 years. He was the senior senator when Huey Long was the junior senator in 1930s. Ellender sat on the Armed Services Committee of the U.S. Senate and got Hebert’s budget through the Senate.

Hebert and Ellender were in terrific position to assure that Tulane received pork in the form of CIA research contracts. CIA projects were hidden from both Soviet and American scrutiny by placing them in other agencies’ budgets, such as the National Institutes of Health, in the various military branches, or in private foundations.36 From what I heard through Tulane’s student grapevine over the years, I must conclude that Tulane was definitely involved in both NIHand CIA-sponsored projects, especially research with psychoactive drugs. Secondly, the CIA was trying to get rid of Fidel Castro and Communism in the Western Hemisphere. They tried to use their mind-altering resources and other medical tactics to discredit Castro. The project was called MKULTRA.39 One specific plan was to spray a hallucinogenic drug in Castro’s personal radio studio, so that he would make a fool out of himself during a national radio broadcast. Then they decided to kill him. Their new team was called ZR-RIFLE, and its job was to explore exotic ways of advancing the date of his death.40 The CIA’s medical director for these projects was brain-func-D： C： 41: 41 (The name “Gottlieb” shows up frequently in AIDS literature.

His writing partner Warren Hinckle was editor of Ramparts magazine. In Deadly Secrets they made numerous references to the fact that the CIA was getting the best minds in America, and particularly from the universities, involved in figuring out exotic ways to eliminate Castro and his government from Cuba.43 Hinckle and Turner explained the frustration of the Kennedy White House. After spending hundreds of millions of dollars and recruiting thousands of Cuban exiles for Operation Mongoose (a free Cuba paramilitary operation based on the campus of the University of Miami), the Kennedy brothers wanted to see some action. They pressured the CIA for more tangible and immediate results and encouraged the use of alternative means to remove Castro and Communism from Cuba. Consider this passage: … The pressure for more spectacular results was on Lansdale [CIA], who was in almost daily contact with the attorney general [Bobby Kennedy]. He passed the pressure on to an interagency group formulating plans for approval by the SGA [Special Group Augmented — a CIA/White House task force focused on Cuba], saying that “it is our job to put the American genius to work on this project, quickly and effectively. This demands a change from the business as usual and a hard facing of the fact that we are in a combat situation — where we have been given full command.” Lansdale hinted that “we might uncork the touchdown play independently of the institutional program we are spurring.”44 Other than naming the University of Miami, Deadly Secrets does not say which universities were involved. Was Tulane one of the universities asked “to put the American genius to work”? It certainly would have fit into the economic interests and anti-Communist sentiment of the New Orleans business community. It would have fit into the tradition of close cooperation between CIA officials and certain members of the Tulane Board, most notably Sam Zemurray (who was chairman of both the United Fruit Company and the Tulane University Board of Directors in 1954, when the CIA produced a coup d’etat in Guatemala to reclaim 250,000 acres of United Fruit land which had been nationalized by And what of Lansdale’s proposal to “uncork the touchdown play independently of the institutional program”?

The Soviets were explicit, as early as 1951, about their demonstration that certain simian viruses caused a variety of cancers.46 This was six to eight years before American government researchers produced the same results. This Soviet edge was a concern for American Cold War planners, who monitored Soviet scientific journals. From their perspective, this was just another Soviet threat. Either the Soviets might use this information to develop a sexually-transmitted biological weapon to undermine freedom in the promiscuous West, or they might develop a cure for cancer before the U.S. did and there- Whatever the motive, the U.S. government wanted the work done. The money was provided for researching monkey viruses through convenient channels, but the doctors were not supposed to talk about it. In the process, New Orleans became one of the leading centers of knowledge about immunology and retroviruses. The doctors at Tulane who specialized in cancer and pathology had access to this knowledge, to these monkeys, and to their viruses. 1 My father was a limb surgeon whose specialties were reconstructive surgery and the rehabilitation of amputees. He was President of the Crippled Children’s Hospital and Medical Director of the Physical Rehabilitation Center at Delgado College. He knew Mary Sherman because they both taught orthopedic surgery at Tulane Medical School in the 1950s and early ’60s. He never worked at Ochsner’s clinic or hospital. He was not a virus researcher and was not involved in the underground medical laboratory in any way. 2 Tulane did publish the Bulletin of the Tulane Medical School, but it was an industry relations piece sent to other medical schools. 3 An outbreak of infectious hepatitis was reported in New Orleans in 1962 by A.

Caution: James DiEugenio told me that the source of these statements is ultimately CIA officer Howard Hunt, and that he may have fabricated them to make his anti-Castro activities to appear to have been authorized by the White House. If so, we should remember that fabricating the authorization does not equal fabricating the activity. In fact, there is little reason to fabricate the authorization unless one was trying to legitimatize an otherwise illegal activity. Or to put it bluntly, it is unlikely that someone would try to legitimatize an activity that did not exist. 47 Who would synthesize a disease for which there is no cure? Consider the Defense Appropriations Hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1970: “Within the next 5 to 10 years, it would probably be possible to make a new infective microorganism which would differ in certain important aspects from any known disease-causing organisms. Most important of these is that it might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease.” While I personally do not think that this conversation led to HIV-1, it does show the thinking of a biological weapons developer. Of course, the rationale was defensive: we’d better do it before some bad guy does. arrollton Avenue is a wide, tree-lined boulevard which runs north and south, bisecting New COrleans and connecting the Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain.

Above all else, they are expected to carry the militant social conscience and uncompromising values of their Jesuit educators with them into their future roles. I attended Jesuit High School from 1966 to 1969. During this time, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison was investigating the assassination of President Kennedy. This investigation culminated in the trial of New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw in early 1969. The amount of press coverage this received in New Orleans was staggering. And much of this was a contrived media smog, aggressively negative toward Garrison. The national press had been particularly vicious, with anti-Garrison articles like “Jolly Green Giant in Wonderland.”1 They basically claimed that the New Orleans Garrison, in turn, appeared on national television and stated in unambiguous language that a faction within the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had murdered the President of the United States. Gesturing to the camera, he waved sworn statements from witnesses who claimed that their testimony to the Warren Commission had been altered to distort important information. If that was not enough, he went further, reminding the American people that the order to hide the hard evidence (Kennedy’s x -rays and the autopsy photos) from the American people came directly from the Oval Office in the White House. Garrison said bluntly that there had been a “coup d’etat” right here in the United States and that the press had ignored it. This was a difficult time for people whose families were connected to the Garrison investigation. Several of my close friends had family members involved, and I saw their dilemma first hand. The basic situation was this: If Kennedy’s murder had been planned in New Orleans, then something should be done about it. Many people supported Garrison’s efforts. He was, after all, a legally-elected law enforcement official investigating a murder within his jurisdiction. On the other hand, Garrison was investigating some sensitive issues and some very important people. On the national front, he had discovered the U.S. government’s secret war against Cuba, uncovering in the process that elements of the CIA were involved with the Mafia and were trying to kill Castro. (Today we know that this is true, since it was established beyond any reasonable doubt in 1975 by the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, but back in the 1960s it was political heresy.) On the local front, Garrison was investigating, and in some cases arresting, some of New Orleans’ most prominent citizens. Harvey Oswald and had helped Kennedy’s killers by setting up Oswald to take the fall for Kennedy’s death.

Harvey Oswald and had helped Kennedy’s killers by setting up Oswald to take the fall for Kennedy’s death. Shaw, of course, claimed he never knew Oswald and had never worked for the CIA. (Today, both Shaw’s association with Oswald and his association with the CIA have been established.2 But at the time both Shaw and the CIA denied it.) Particularly baffling was Garrison’s inability to get the press on his side, especially the local press. The whole situation was very confusing, even embarrassing at times. Garrison was under a gag order. We all waited for the trial. On Sunday, March 1, 1969, the jury acquitted Clay Shaw of all charges in less than one hour. Everyone was stunned. After two solid years of heavy publicity and waiting for the evidence to come out in the trial, it seemed like it should have taken more than one hour for the jury to decide the verdict. What was going on? Was Garrison really crazy as his critics claimed, or had he been successfully shut down by forces inside the federal government? In one of my classes there was a student named Nicky. His father was Dr. Nicolas Chetta, the Coroner of Orleans Parish (an officer known as the Medical Examiner in many locales) who was involved with Garrison’s investigation. Dr. Chetta was somewhat of a local celebrity for us. Not only was he an elected politician whose name was frequently in the press, but he was the team physician for our football team. Once he even took our class on a memorable field trip to the city morgue. Nicky, the son, was well liked. He was a friendly, modest, boy-next-door who was well-intentioned and sincere. He did not strive for any “star” position and certainly did not trade on his father’s reputation. I never knew anybody that did not like him. He and I were friends, but we were not what you would call “close.” We went to the same school, lived in the same neighborhood, and both had fathers who were doctors. Nicky erupted, saying in a loud, tense voice that Garrison had gotten a “raw deal.” We all knew Nicky to be quiet and even-keeled. This outburst seemed quite out of character. But we all respected his sincerity. We knew who his father was, and we all saw the same ridiculous news coverage night after night. We were all confused, and we wanted to hear what he had to say. No one counterattacked. The room was quiet. We waited to see what would happen next.

We were all confused, and we wanted to hear what he had to say. No one counterattacked. The room was quiet. We waited to see what would happen next. The teacher said patiently, “What do you mean?” D that someone, presumably the FBI or the CIA, had bugged Garrison’s office and conference rooms, had stolen and/ or photocopied his files concerning Clay Shaw, and had turned them over to Shaw’s attorneys; D that all of Garrison’s extradition requests for witnesses from other states had been turned down, as had all of his requests to subpoena former federal officials, preventing him from assembling the pieces of his puzzle in a court of law; D that an ex-airline pilot named David Ferrie and a former high-ranking FBI official named Guy Banister had been training anti-Castro Cubans for paramilitary assaults against Cuba at a secret training camp across Lake Pontchartrain; and that Ferrie and Banister had stolen weapons for this operation from a company in Houma, Louisiana which was operating as a CIA front. Nicky said he couldn’t pronounce the name of the company, but said that the name “looked German, but sounded French.” (It turns out that he was referring to the Schlumberger Tool Company, pronounced locally “Slum-ber-jay.”) Someone asked Nicky why we had not heard all this in the press.3 It was a fair question. We had all been taught that the press was the “Watchdog of Government.” How could they have overlooked these obvious and important points. Nicky paused and repeated Garrison’s favorite saying: “Treason never prospers, for if it prospers, none dare call it treason.” This was just the sort of riddle that made it hard for the public to understand what Garrison was up to. Then Nicky turned his attention to David Ferrie and started talking about him in more detail. (Today Ferrie is considered a central character in several assassination theories, but back then he had been little more than a blip on the television screen during the first year of Garrison’s investigation.) His sudden death on the eve of his arrest for conspiracy to murder the President was considered by many to be a very suspicious coincidence, even though his death had officially been ruled to be from “natural causes.” Ferrie was an unusual man in many respects. Professionally, he was a pilot. Politically, he was a notorious right-wing extremist.4 Personally, he was completely bald from head to toe, and was a homosexual who favored teenage boys.

Ferrie’s bizarre appearance and personal history was one of the things that earned six-foot six-inch Jim Garrison the nickname “Jolly Green Giant,” because “he put fruits and nuts in the can.” Ferrie died several days after Garrison’s investigation was made public. Garrison, who was about to arrest Ferrie for conspiring to murder President Kennedy, thought that either Ferrie had been murdered to silence him or that Ferrie had silenced himself. But it was the Coroner’s job, not the District Attorney’s, to rule on the cause of death. Dr. Chetta, Nicky’s father, was the Coroner, and said that he found no evidence of foul play. Therefore, he ruled that Ferrie died of natural causes (a ruptured blood vessel in the brain), and noted that Ferrie had been under enormous stress. Nicky continued: Ferrie had known Lee Harvey Oswald when he was a cadet at the Civil Air Patrol and had been seen with him that summer. Ferrie’s role in the assassination was as a getaway pilot. He reportedly spent the two weeks before the assassination at Mafia boss Carlos Marcello’s hunting camp across the Mississippi River. He may have been flying people and supplies around to position them for the assassination. Now all this seemed pretty wild, but it got even wilder. Nicky said that the day they announced Ferrie’s death, Bobby Kennedy had called his house to discuss the cause of death with his father.5 A murmur shot through the room. Nicky countered by saying he had answered the phone himself. Thinking it was a prank, he hung up on the then-Senator. But Kennedy called back. This time Nicky’s father answered the phone himself. Then Nicky started talking about Ferrie’s apartment, which his father had seen the day Ferrie died. Ferrie lived alone. But in his closets they had found both women’s clothing and priest’s robes. They also found a small medical laboratory with a dozen mice in cages which he used for medical experiments. His medical equipment included microscopes, syringes, surgical tools, and a medical library. When they talked to Ferrie’s other landlords, they were told of a full-scale laboratory in his apartment with thousands of mice in cages. It seemed clear that he was inducing cancer in the mice! Ferrie claimed that he was looking for a cure for cancer, but Garrison’s investigators thought that he was trying to figure out a way to use cancer as an assassination weapon, presumably against Castro and his followers.

Nicky added, almost as an aside, that Garrison’s investigative team thought that this may have been how Jack Ruby died, murdered by induced cancer to silence him. By this point, you could have heard a pin drop in the room. Back in 1969, we (and presumably the public) were taught that cancer was “a spontaneous disease,” meaning it could not be created, transferred, caught or induced. Words like “carcinogenic” and “cancer-causing chemicals” were not yet part of the popular American vocabulary. Viral cancers were not discussed. The idea of “inducing cancer” was very strange indeed, and, scientifically, we (the students) considered it somewhere between “questionable” and “impossible.” A student asked, “How could they induce cancer?” The question was sincere, but doubting. I remember hoping, for both Nicky’s sake and Garrison’s, that the answer made some kind of common sense. Garrison’s case already looked like Mardi Gras to the rest of the country. It did not need another bald, right-wing, counter-revolutionary, contraband pilot wearing a wig and a dress and saying the Catholic mass in Latin. And this particular claim, about inducing cancer, was not only out of John Q. Public’s experience, it was also over the edge of what we understood to be scientific reality. Nicky sensed the doubt. You could see he felt it. He remained calm. Slowly and cautiously, he said that they had been “injecting mice with monkey viruses.” Monkey viruses! The room groaned. I rolled my eyes and dropped my forehead into my hand. Why did it have to be monkey viruses? Garrison was already misunderstood because his plot was stranger than jazz — too complex, too subtle, and too bizarre for the American TV audience. Why couldn’t it have been something simpler, like injecting rats with radiation. Cancer from plutonium! The public might follow that. But cancer from monkey viruses? The rest of the country would never buy it. The very words conjured up a dark collage of alienating images — diseases imported from tropical jungles in the bellies of insects and mixed with monkey heads boiled in voodoo rituals on the edge of the Louisiana swamp at midnight. It was all “so New Orleans.” You could feel that everyone in the room wanted to believe Nicky, but it was hard to know what to say. Then somebody said, “I don’t get it.

How could a monkey virus cause cancer?” Nicky said he didn’t understand that part either. My brain was about to bust, but I wasn’t about to bring Tulane into the conversation. Then another student blurted out that there was a “kid” down at Tulane Medical School who was dying from the total collapse of his immune system. They couldn’t figure out what was causing it. They gave him every antibiotic they had and nothing worked. He would get better for a while, and then he would get worse. While this comment was interesting, it sounded “off the wall.” Two thoughts raced through my head. First, what did the uncontrollable collapse of an immune system have to do with our discussion about monkey viruses? And I also said to myself, I’m obviously not the only student at Jesuit that has a family member working at Tulane Medical School. I was certain that this was “insider information.” It was the first time I had ever heard it. (But not the last!) The room fell to a new level of silence. Let’s call it fear. No one breathed. The Jesuits drilled social responsibility into us until it came out of our ears. Everybody knew that developing a biological weapon was high taboo. Twenty teenagers sat in dead silence pondering this mind-boggling question for a moment that hung like an hour. Then the bell rang. In a routine voice, the teacher thanked Nicky for sharing his thoughts and dismissed the class. As I gathered my books together, I turned to the student next to me and made that nervous remark:, “Well, the good news is if there’s a bizarre global epidemic involving cancer and a monkey virus thirty years from now, at least we’ll know where it came from.” When I got home that afternoon, I put my books away and called to my mother who was in the other end of the house. I said, “Do you have time for some useless information?” These were code words we frequently used for discussing things of interest. “Useless information” was one step above gossip. It could be anything from a new scientific theory about how the dinosaurs died, to speculation on who was going to get indicted next in the growing grain scandal. Her voice rang back down the hall. She would be right there.

When she came into the room, I told her that Dr. Chetta’s son was in one of my classes and that he told us an amazing story about Garrison’s investigation. “Oh, yes,” she said. “I know who he is.” I recapped Nicky’s comments and ploughed through the stories of Ferrie’s wigs, his dresses, and his religious vestments. She listened attentively, acknowledging each point as I went, but exhibiting no surprise whatsoever. Frankly, I was expecting a little bit more of a reaction, but New Orleans is a very tolerant place. If the transvestite stuff didn’t get a reaction out of her, I was sure the medical stuff would. So I told her about the medical experiments and the laboratory with the thousands of white mice and waited for a response. Nothing. She was unfazed. I was getting frustrated. So I told her about the monkey viruses, expecting it to fall on her like a bombshell, like it had on me. Still nothing. “She was killed. Murdered. A terrible thing. Slashed with a knife, dismembered, and set on fire. It looked like a sexual killing, you know. But the grapevine said that whoever killed her knew what they were doing with a knife … maybe they even had a high level of medical knowledge, just judging by the way the cuts were done. What a terrible way to go!” “Oh, they were not the type of people we were used to associating with. They lived in the French Quarter and were involved in the theater and all that. Mary was somewhat of an outcast at the medical school. Most of the doctors we knew had wives and children. Everyone respected Mary professionally, but she ran in different social circles. I remember driving home after the dinner. The normal protocol, like we used to do in the Navy, said the next step would have been for us to invite her over to our house for dinner. So I asked your father if he wanted to do that. He thought about it for a while and said, ‘No,’ adding that Mary’s social circle was a little weirder than he wanted to be associated with. That was the last time we discussed it.” Suddenly I felt exhausted. I shook my head in dismay and breathed deeply. This was stranger and more disturbing than even Nicky’s story had been.

What was going on here? And to have it all so close to my family! I didn’t know what else to say. I thought again about my wisecrack: “If there’s a bizarre global epidemic … at least we’ll know where it came from.” I was depressed. We were silent. My mother went back to her task down the hall. I changed clothes and walked over to a friend’s house, trying to forget about it. im Garrison was one of the most controversial figures in modern American history. Attitudes about him tend to be polarized. To his supporters, he was a hero, the only public official to have the courage to dig for the truth about President Kennedy’s assassination and to confront the American government and the American people with it. To his critics, he was a politically ambitious tyrant whose ruthless use of power was driven by his wild imagination. We do not need to judge Garrison, but we do need to understand him, because his statement recorded in an interview with a national magazine was for a long time the only documentary evidence we had in hand connecting Dr. Mary Sherman to David Ferrie’s underground medical laboratory. So who was he? Jim Garrison was born in Iowa in 1921.1 His father abandoned his family when he was three. His mother moved him to Chicago and then to New Orleans. His original name was Earling Carothers Garrison. He changed it to “Jim” in 1946. His nickname “Jimbo” was a friendly corruption of the words “Jim” and “jumbo,” based on his enormous size, six-feet six-inches. In 1940 Garrison joined the U.S. Army at the age of nineteen and became a pilot. During World War II he flew missions over France and Germany, acting as a forward observer for artillery units. At the end of the war, his unit liberated the infamous Dachau Concentration Camp, where he witnessed the horrors of Nazi incarceration first hand. It was there that he came to understand what one human being was capable of inflicting upon another in the name of a flag. It solidified his hatred of fascism, and his fear of autocratic governments. After the war, he returned to New Orleans and earned a law degree from Tulane University. Soon he started working for the FBI, knocking on doors for background checks in the Northwest.

After the war, he returned to New Orleans and earned a law degree from Tulane University. Soon he started working for the FBI, knocking on doors for background checks in the Northwest. Preferring combat to boredom, he re-enlisted in the army for the Korean War and, when that was over, returned to New Orleans. There he joined the National Guard and, like many young attorneys in New Orleans, became an assistant DA for a few years before starting a private practice. In 1960, Garrison mounted his first political campaign: to become a judge in Criminal District Court; he lost. In 1961, he mounted a second political campaign, for the District Attorney of Orleans Parish, and surprised the political establishment by winning. Re-elected twice, he held that position for twelve years, until 1974 when he was defeated by Harry Connick, father of the popular singer/musician Harry Connick, Jr. As District Attorney, Garrison positioned himself as “a tough-on-crime enforcer.” He cracked down on prostitution and gambling in the French Quarter. Self-righteous and outspoken, he criticized police for being soft on crime and criminal court judges for refusing to finance his investigations into organized crime. His moralistic stance made him popular with some groups and unpopular with others. (The drummer in Jack Ruby’s nightclub told me, “Garrison was a terrible man who ruined a lot of people.”) Perhaps his most important contribution to American law was a landmark victory in the U.S. Supreme Court in 1964. The New Orleans criminal court judges he criticized for being soft on crime had sued him for defamation. Garrison counter-sued on the grounds that he, as a citizen, had the right to criticize public officials. It was, as he called it, “the essence of self-government.” The high court agreed. A second indication of Garrison’s penchant for rights of the individual against the state was his intervention in a racial-integration crisis on behalf of a New Orleans merchant who had been arrested for selling books by black author James Baldwin. The New Orleans Police Department felt the book, Another Country, violated the prevailing political and racial sensibilities, and should not be sold. To Garrison, it was just another book burning. Politically, this event solidified his support among the black population in New Orleans, since they had never seen anyone from the District Attorney’s office intervene on their behalf before. Garrison moved swiftly into the JFK probe. The day after Kennedy’s death, the press announced that Lee Harvey Oswald had spent the summer before the assassination in New Orleans.

Before Oswald was even buried, Garrison was tracking down New Orleanian David Ferrie on a tip that Ferrie was a getaway pilot in a larger assassination plot. Garrison’s office raided David Ferrie’s apartment, picked up Ferrie for questioning, and turned him over to the FBI. The FBI promptly released Ferrie, and Garrison dropped the matter. Three years later, in November 1966, Garrison was persuaded to re-open his investigation into the JFK assassination by U.S. Senator Russell Long. Senator Long arranged to finance Garrison’s inquiry secretly through an organization called Truth and Consequences, formed specifically for that purpose at Long’s request by New Orleans oil man Joe Rault. In February 1967, a press leak concerning Garrison’s secret investigation into the JFK assassination, followed immediately by the death of his prime suspect David Ferrie, catapulted Jim Garrison into the world media spotlight overnight. If it was fame he sought, he got it. And with it, the focus of assassination speculation shifted from Dallas to New Orleans. In March 1967 Garrison arrested New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw for conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy. At first Garrison called the assassination a crime organized by extremist elements of the anti-Castro community, and to prevent any misinterpretation, he specifically pointed out that his team had not found any evidence of involvement by the CIA itself. But in May 1967, all that changed. The heart of Garrison’s case was that he had associated Clay Shaw with Lee Harvey Oswald during the summer of 1963. Garrison believed Shaw’s contact with Oswald was part of a deliberate attempt to set up Oswald to take the blame for Kennedy’s impending assassination.4 In particular, Garrison claimed that Shaw tried to help Oswald get a job at a mental hospital in Jackson, Louisiana, near the town of Clinton. According to Garrison, Shaw drove Oswald to Clinton so Oswald could register to vote in hopes of improving his chances of getting the job at the hospital. As luck would have it, the Congress for Racial Equality was sponsoring a voter registration for black voters that day. When a black Cadillac drove into the center of the small Louisiana town, folks watched closely and curiously. Were these FBI agents? The press? Outside agitators?

Numerous eyewitnesses identified the person who got out of the Cadillac as Oswald, and, of course, the man had given his name to the registrar of voters as Lee Harvey Oswald. The more difficult question: Who was driving the car? Witnesses said he looked like Clay Shaw, a white male in his fifties with wavy gray hair and a stern face. This described Shaw well enough, but it also described other people equally well. There was less difficulty identifying the other passenger in the car. His orange hair and painted-on eyebrows made seeing David Ferrie a truly unforgettable experience for anyone. Since it was already established that Ferrie knew Guy Banister and Oswald (all of whom were dead by ^(′)69 ), it was difficult for Garrison to prove that the man driving the car was actually Clay Shaw and not someone else, like Banister. Shaw, of course, claimed he never knew Oswald or Ferrie and had never been to Clinton. Garrison failed to prove the connection to the satisfaction of the jury. Shaw was acquitted. Garrison counterattacked, claiming that Shaw had lied under oath and charged him with thirteen counts of perjury, confident that he would win the perjury conviction in the next trial. The federal government intervened, however, and dismissed the perjury charges; thus with the acquittal of Clay Shaw in 1969, Garrison was neutralized as a political force. A decade later, the U.S. Congress’s House Select Committee on Assassinations took a second look at the Clinton incident. On March 14, 1978, they took the testimony of Clinton town marshal John Manchester in Washington.5 Manchester said that he approached the black Cadillac from which Oswald had emerged that summer day in 1963 and, acting as the town’s law enforcement officer, instructed the driver to identify himself and to produce his driver’s license. We only know about it today because of documents released through the JFK Assassination Materials Act of 1992.6 With information of this magnitude continuing to come to light, it will be tomorrow’s historians, and not yesterday’s press, who will have to judge Jim Garrison and his assassination theory. To call him “discredited” is extremely premature, despite the numerous attempts to make him appear so. We may owe Garrison an apology before it’s all over.

In 1971, Garrison’s life grew still more entangled. Based on information from a disgruntled former DA-office employee named Pershing Gervais, attorneys for the federal government charged Garrison with accepting kickbacks in exchange for not prosecuting illegal pinball operations. The trial lingered until August of 1973. Garrison defended himself, arguing that the charges against him were fabricated and that the evidence had been tampered with. The jury found him not guilty.7 The federal attorneys immediately struck back, charging Garrison with failing to pay income taxes on the same alleged kickbacks. Again, Garrison defended himself and was found not guilty. But the years of negative publicity had been too much for any publicly elected official to survive. He was now politically destroyed, and subsequently lost the 1974 election. During these post-investigation years, he wrote several books about the JFK assassination, the last of which was On the Trail of the Assassins, which Oliver Stone used as one basis for his movie JFK. Garrison even made a cameo appearance in JFK, ironically playing the role of U.S. Chief Justice Earl Warren. At the height of his media visibility in 1967, Playboy magazine offered Garrison an interview.8 Distrustful of the press and their motives, Garrison accepted the interview on the condition that Playboy present his whole story unedited. The 12 hour interview covered 25 pages, and presented his complex case to the American public for the first time. Playboy cannot be accused of being sympathetic. They began their interview with a series of questions, not about the assassination, but about the accusations that Garrison had bribed, drugged, and threatened witnesses. Even the title of the interview referred to him as “the embattled district attorney” [italics and lower case in original]. We find the first mention of the Ferrie-Sherman cancer experiments in this interview, in the midst of a barrage of questions about Jack Ruby.9 Garrison was busy baffling his interviewer with answers like: “In Jack Ruby’s case, his murder of Lee Harvey Oswald was the sanest act he ever committed.” We pick up the interview there, right before the critical section: GARRISON: …and he (Ruby) became the prisoner of the Dallas police, forced over a year later to beg Earl Warren to take him back to Washington, because he wanted to tell the truth about “Why my act was committed, but it can’t be said here … my life is in danger here.” But Ruby never got to Washington, and he’s joined the long list of witnesses with vital information who have shuffled off this mortal coil.

GARRISON: I can’t agree or disagree, since I have no evidence one way or the other. But we have discovered that David Ferrie had a rather curious hobby in addition to his study of cartridge trajectories: cancer research. He filled his apartment with white mice — at one point he had almost 2,000, and neighbors complained — wrote a medical treatise on the subject and worked with a number of New Orleans doctors on means of inducing cancer in mice. After the assassination, one of these physicians, Dr. Mary Sherman, was found hacked to death with a kitchen knife in her New Orleans apartment. Her murder is listed as unsolved. Ferrie’s experiments may have been purely theoretical and Dr. Sherman’s death completely unrelated to her association with Ferrie; but I do find it interesting that Jack Ruby died of cancer a few weeks after his conviction for murder had been overruled in appeals court and he was ordered to stand trial outside of Dallas — thus allowing him to speak freely if he so desired. I would also note that there was little hesitancy in killing Lee Harvey Oswald in order to prevent him from talking, so there is no reason to suspect that any more consideration would have been shown Jack Ruby if he had posed a threat to the architects of the conspiracy. William Penn Jones, Jr. was a retired U.S. Army officer who became an editor of a local newspaper in a small town outside of Dallas. He was famous for his “stir-theshit” editorial style, particularly when it came to the JFK assassination. I asked two people who worked for him over the years if they knew anything about this claim. They said they did not, adding that Penn frequently said things that he could not back up. I tried to contact him, but was told that, due to his frail health, his wife no longer let people interview him. He died in 1998. I did contact Mailer and asked him what was behind his comment about Ruby’s cancer. He emphatically, thoroughly, and completely denied ever having made any such comment about Jack Ruby or his cancer. So either Playboy’s interviewer was operating from bad information, or perhaps Mailer forgot what he had said. Either way, I was not able to gain any helpful information by tracking down Penn Jones and Norman Mailer. Cartridge trajectories?

Isn’t a cartridge the part of the bullet that stays in the gun after the slug flies out of the barrel? Yes, it is. And doesn’t trajectory mean the flight path of the projectile? Yes, it does. And when you pull back the bolt to clear the chamber before inserting another bullet, the empty cartridge flies out of the rifle, to the right and to the rear. So what was Garrison talking about? Earlier in the same interview, Garrison discussed some of the materials they found in Ferrie’s apartment. His investigators found unusual notations in the margins of one of his books, a reference manual on high-powered rifles. It showed that Ferrie had measured exactly how many feet an empty cartridge flew when ejected from that rifle and at what angle.10 Hence the apparent oxymoron “cartridge trajectory.” But for this investigation the important words in that sentence are the last two: “cancer research.” It is widely reported by people who knew Ferrie personally that he was actively involved in cancer research. For example, one of Ferrie’s friends said, “Ferrie was going to fix everything. Find a cure for cancer. Get rid of Communism.”11 This activity stretched from his days as an airline pilot (late 1950s) until his death in 1967. It is also clear from his interview that Garrison thought that there was more than one doctor working with David Ferrie. Who were the other doctors? What was this claim based upon? If a group of doctors were working with Ferrie, it might be safe to assume that it was really their lab and not Ferrie’s. This is an important point. If Ferrie was simply an executor, instead of the main instigator, the dimensions of the project change dramatically. It also means that the lab may have continued operating after Ferrie’s death in 1967. It should be noted that, in the summer of 1967, Garrison was talking about arresting one particular New Orleans doctor: Dr. Alton Ochsner.12 (William Gurvich, one of Garrison’s staff who resigned from the case, is said to have disclosed this fact to Ochsner.) Was Ochsner one of the other doctors Garrison was referring to in this interview when he said “a number of New Orleans doctors”? And if so, was Garrison saying this as a threat to get Ochsner, a political enemy, to stop his anti-Garrison activities? Or did he have information that he could not (or would not) disclose about Ochsner?

Or did he have information that he could not (or would not) disclose about Ochsner? I will say, speaking as a political observer, that if Garrison had attacked Ochsner openly in 1967, it would have been very bad for him. He needed all the support he could get from the people of New Orleans. Attacking the city’s most famous doctor would have cost him significant political support. He did not need to open up another front in his war. The most incredible thing about this interview from our current perspective is the reaction from the press. Or should we call it “the non-reaction from the press”? First, after being told that a District Attorney of a major American city who was investigating a murder in his jurisdiction had accidentally discovered an underground medical laboratory which was inducing cancer, and which was run by a known political extremist with a history of violent political activities and with no formal medical training, the interviewer did not even ask a follow-up question! Then, the members of our national press, the so-called Watchdogs of Democracy, simply continued to bash Garrison from coast to coast. Had they bothered to read what Garrison had to say for himself? Had they read it and then somehow discredited it without bothering to tell anyone? Or did they think, “What’s wrong with having a couple of thousand mice full of cancer viruses in your apartment?” Or perhaps, “This is too weird for my audience”? Whatever the reason, the press did nothing. Now Garrison is dead, and we cannot ask him any more questions. The few JFK researchers who remembered the cancer passage in Garrison’s Playboy interview assumed that Dr. Mary Sherman was a local doctor and, therefore, that she was not significant. This was based on the assumption that no one of any measure would be associated with David Ferrie’s cancer research, since Ferrie had no formal medical training. But this was not the case. Dr. Mary Sherman was one of America’s leading cancer experts and had all the credentials to prove it. The newspaper articles about her death refer to her as “an internationallyknown bone specialist.”13 She was an Associate Professor at a prominent medical school engaged in monkey virus research, director of a cancer laboratory at an internationally famous medical clinic, and Chairman of the Pathology Committee of one of the most elite medical societies in America.

The medical articles she wrote were quoted for half a century. So we ask the question again: What was a highly trained medical professional with impeccable credentials doing in an underground medical laboratory run by a political extremist with no formal medical training? This question is so vexing that it puts enormous importance on the credibility of this one passage. What other evidence of the Ferrie-Sherman experiments do we have? Unfortunately, for many years, this interview was the single document connecting Sherman to Ferrie’s cancer experiments. Perhaps even more unfortunately, however, this link has now been corroborated. But back in the early stages of my investigation, I tried to find out what Garrison’s claim was based upon. I succeeded in talking to a number of people who knew Garrison personally, but they did not know anything about the matter. In the process, I determined that the person most likely to know the answer was Lou Ivon, Garrison’s Chief Investigator, who personally handled Ferrie. What did Lou Ivon know about the Ferrie-Sherman connection? Therefore, I have never known what Lou Ivon knows (or does not know) about the Ferrie-Sherman cancer experiments, but my guess is that he probably knows more than anybody else about the basis for Garrison’s claim that Dr. Mary Sherman worked with David Ferrie in his underground medical laboratory. I hope he will talk about it on the record one day. In the meantime, all I can say is that the investigator who probably knows the most about this important subject would not discuss it with me. He may also know who the other doctors were that Garrison had linked with Ferrie. n the fall of 1969 I went away to college. What a turbulent period! Each night the news brought fresh frustrations. Daily footage from Vietnam showed the bleeding and the dead. Body bags of mounting American casualties swept the screen. The smog of an incomprehensible and undeclared war settled over our land. Its endless drifting nature, its unbelievable cost, and its potential for expansion flared anger throughout the country. College campuses rioted. ROTC buildings burned. Congress revoked the student draft deferment, exposing all male college students to potential slaughter. Each night the drama was played out on television. Police beat demonstrators with night sticks and dragged them through the streets by their hair. Some applauded the protestors, some the police. Angry words divided friends and families. The generation gap widened. Boomer disillusionment jelled into a sense of national betrayal and challenged the loyalty of the pre-Watergate generation.

The generation gap widened. Boomer disillusionment jelled into a sense of national betrayal and challenged the loyalty of the pre-Watergate generation. In return, the Boomer’s parents pondered their questions: “What’s wrong with this new generation? Where is their patriotism? Why don’t they rush to support our war?” The Supreme Court sat and watched as 58,000 Americans died in an undeclared war. Then Nixon ordered the bombing of Cambodia. The shock wave of this news rushed across the country. Campuses erupted. In Ohio, soldiers gunned down four college students at a demonstration on the Kent State campus. The second shock wave: “They’ve started killing us.” Mass demonstrations broke out spontaneously, shutting down college campuses all across America. The protestors converged on Washington for a showdown demonstration. Tear gas flowed through the streets of our capitol. Those were crazy and bitter days, which were made even more difficult for me personally by the death of my father. I dropped out of college and waited for them to pass. And when they were over, I was anxious to forget them. Completely free of any responsibilities, I hitchhiked around the country just to see what was out there. During the summer of 1971, I returned to my home in New Orleans to re-group and to plan my next steps. On my travels I had developed an interest in writing, and started working on a book about my hitchhiking experiences. As the summer wore on, the publicity about the trial of the Manson murders in California took root, and the image of hitchhiking changed. Charles Manson and his companions had hitchhiked their way to one of the most grotesque multiple murders in American history. Everyone became aware of the real and present danger that lurked on the shoulders of our highways. Jack Kerouac’s romantic vision of hitchhiking from On the Road was replaced by Jim Morrison’s stark warning: “There’s a killer on the road.” My “hitchhiking for the fun of it” perspective suffocated, and my book project died. I started looking for something else to write about. Mary Sherman’s murder still intrigued me, and I thought it might have good potential for a screenplay. So I decided to track down the real facts. My first call was to the public library to see if there were any newspaper articles. I was informed that the indexing system stopped in 1963.

If I wanted a newspaper, I would need to have the exact date. But I did not know the date, so I decided to try to get a copy of the police report. Based on what I knew about Sherman’s murder and her connection to Ferrie, I figured this might be difficult. So instead of calling the police department myself, I decided to call someone “on the inside” who might be able to help me get a copy of the report quietly. I called Big Mike.1 He was known as “Big Mike” due to his enormous size. He stood six-feet five-inches and weighed close to 300 pounds. Big Mike worked in the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s office and was an investigator for the Grand Jury. I knew him socially, but not well. We lived in the same neighborhood, and his daughter had been a friend of mine during high school. It had been several years since I had been to his house, and I wasn’t sure if he would remember me. It was a Wednesday evening when I picked up the telephone to call him. His wife answered. Yes, she remembered me, and promptly called him to the phone. When Big Mike came to the phone, I introduced myself and reminded him who I was. He was friendly, and greeted me with “Yeah, kid, I remember you.” Then he proudly detailed his daughter’s recent accomplishments at college. When he was finished, I told him the purpose of my call: I was doing research for a screenplay and wanted to know how I could get a copy of the police report on the Mary Sherman murder. He was accommodating and in a casual voice said, “That seems easy enough. I’ll see if I can get a copy for you. What was that name again?” I repeated the name and spelled it for him. It was clear that he did not recognize it. This concerned me, because it meant that he was not completely aware of what he was agreeing to. If the rumors I had heard about political heat and suppression of the investigation were true, it could mean trouble for him. But I did not know how to tell a gun-toting ex-linebacker like Big Mike that he should keep his head down in his own office. Anyway, I had only asked “how” I could get a copy of the report. He had volunteered to get it for me. I offered to call him back in a week, but he said that it wouldn’t take that long.

He had volunteered to get it for me. I offered to call him back in a week, but he said that it wouldn’t take that long. He told me to call him in two days. I thanked him and hung up. Two days later, I called back. It was Friday about 3:30 in the afternoon. My plan was to call early and leave a message with his wife and then call back later that evening. I was surprised when he answered the phone himself. The stress and tension in his voice was immediately obvious. He was home early for a reason: It had been a bad day. He began with: “What the hell did you get me into?” I said, “Thanks for trying,” waited for the click, and then slowly put the receiver down. Whatever was going on, it was clear to me that the rumors about “the heat” on this case were true. I knew that if Big Mike couldn’t get a copy of the police report himself, then I wouldn’t be able to through any other channel. I would have to wait for another day to find out what happened to Mary Sherman. In 1972 I entered Tulane University. It was late August of that year, and the campus was buzzing with activity of another semester preparing to begin. I went to the University Center to buy books and to register for my courses. The matriculation was held in a large cavernous room filled with folding tables stacked with boxes of computer cards. Behind the tables sat graduate students who answered questions, gave advice on professors, and signed up undergraduates for classes. I was interested in taking an anthropology course and located the right table. There I met a brilliant and beautiful young woman named Barbara.2 She had just completed her undergraduate work at the University of Chicago and had accepted a fellowship from Tulane to get her Ph.D. Intrigued by her warmth, and her waist-length brown hair, I invited her to go to a concert being held on campus that evening. She accepted the invitation, and we discussed plans. She did not have a car, and mine was in the shop. We agreed on a convenient place and time to meet and went our separate ways. That night Barbara and I met as planned and walked to the concert. The performance was by the New Leviathan Oriental Fox Trot Orchestra, a camp revival troupe that played dance music of the 1890-1920 period. We had a lot of fun, and I felt very comfortable with her.

This was a relationship that I wanted to pursue. After the concert she told me she lived near Louisiana Avenue. I knew the area well. While it was not far from campus, it was in a marginal area near a high-crime zone known as the Louisiana Avenue Housing Project. I did not think it was safe for a woman to be walking on the streets of that neighborhood alone at midnight, so I escorted her home on the bus. Several days later I called her up, told her I had gotten my car out of the shop, and that I was itching to show her “my city.” It was a Monday, but classes had not started. It was still early in the morning, and the weather was beautiful, so I invited her sailing. (Despite my penniless student status, I still had access to a sailboat which my older brother had left in my care when he moved out of town.) She accepted the offer and gave me her address again. I said I would be there in half an hour. It was about ten o’clock in the morning when I turned off Claiborne Avenue into Louisiana Avenue Parkway. I remember my surprise at seeing this intriguing street for the first time in daylight. Unlike Louisiana Avenue itself, which was a broad bustling boulevard, Louisiana Avenue Parkway was a quiet oasis, isolated from the activity and noise of city life. Only three blocks long and leading nowhere, this narrow, bumpy street was shaded by massive oak trees which grew together at their tops, creating a canopy over the street and providing welcome protection from the oppressive August sun. The houses were modest, mostly two story rental units whose stucco façades made it easy to confuse one house with another. I pulled over and dug the slip of paper from my jeans to check the address: 3225 Louisiana Avenue Parkway. Barbara came down the stairs, opened the door, and greeted me. She was dressed appropriately for sailing, in cutoff blue jeans and a baggy shirt. As I entered the stairwell, I noticed a door to my immediate left which led to a basement. It was ajar, opened about one inch. But it closed suddenly when I looked at it, and then the sound of several locks clicked away, one after another. “Who was that?” I asked. “Oh, that’s the old woman who lives", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:47:1f80679997ed", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2977, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 48, "text": "the stairs, opened the door, and greeted me.

But it closed suddenly when I looked at it, and then the sound of several locks clicked away, one after another. “Who was that?” I asked. “Oh, that’s the old woman who lives in the basement,” she responded as we started walking up the stairs. “I met her yesterday. She seemed like she had a really tough life.” I asked her what she meant. She continued, “It’s hard to describe. She looks like she might have been a stripper or maybe even a prostitute. She wears lots of make-up and has a real hard edge to her.” I laughed a little and said it sounded very New Orleans, pointing out that a club owner might take care of one of his ladies after she had grown too old to be useful to his business by letting her live in a place rent-free, even if it was a basement. I complimented her on the apartment and noted the great condition it was in. The walls were all freshly plastered and painted. The floors had been stripped and varnished. I had been in plenty of student apartments, but I had never seen one that was in such good condition. Since it was larger and in better condition that the apartment I lived in, I asked her about the rent. The rent seemed well below market value. I would have guessed about fifty percent higher based on what My thoughts now turned to the sweet smell of freshly baked bread. I had noticed it when I first came in, but had not said anything about it yet. If you have ever been in New Orleans in August, you will understand that people without air-conditioning just do not bake bread then. It is much too hot. It was, indeed, a curious activity for a hot summer morning. “Yes,” she said, explaining that the apartment had a “residual odor” in it and that she had heard that baking bread would help take the odor away. Then she asked if I thought it was safe to leave the windows open so the place could air out while we were sailing. I said, “Yes.” As she continued to talk about the apartment, it became clear that it had an unusual history to it. It had been vacant and off the market for several years before she rented it, and during that time it had been thoroughly re-conditioned. Yet despite the fresh paint and varnish, and after years of vacancy, a musty smell remained. I asked, due to the odor, if the previous tenant had cats.

She laughed, breaking the tension for a moment. “Yes, the furniture was weird all right, but that wasn’t the problem.” Then she described how the old woman talked to her in a tense suspicious voice and how she was genuinely frightened of something or someone. Her fear had obviously transferred to Barbara. Then Barbara said, “Ed, I got the feeling that something really bad happened here. Something terribly wrong, like maybe someone had been killed. You are from here, do you know what she might be talking about? She acted like it was something big, something everyone knew about. Maybe it was even on the news.” The sentence hung in the air. I took it apart in my head and studied the words. “Terrible men” do “horrible things.” My mind flooded with images of laboratory animals I had seen — sad, sick mice and monkeys suffering from horrifying diseases, their bodies covered with lesions and harboring tumors larger than their natural bodies. I was silent. I shrugged and said, “The only thing that comes to mind is a secret laboratory that was discovered during the Garrison investigation. There was this political wacko and this woman doctor who had thousands of mice in cages. They were using monkey viruses to induce cancer in mice. Garrison thought they were trying to develop a biological weapon.” Her fear was now visible. She crossed her arms upon her chest and leaned up against the wall. By this point I realized that she was really frightened, and rightfully so. Her parents had warned her about living in New Orleans alone, and I had expressed my concerns about her neighborhood. And who is going to get a good night’s sleep in a place if you know the previous tenant was butchered in her bed. I realized our conversation was only making matters worse for her. She broke the silence by blowing out a short breath and said, “What part of town did that happen in?” At the time I did not know and, more importantly, I wanted to change the subject. I was getting frightened too, both for her and with her. I said that I did not know where these people had lived, but I had assumed that it was in the French Quarter, since that was where all “the weird stuff seemed to happen.” It would be years before I found out where we were standing.

Our date was not going well. I had offered to take her sailing on Lake Pontchartrain, but we were standing around talking about brutal murders and monkey viruses. Knowing she was quietly wondering if her apartment was infected with a flotilla of bizarre diseases, I pointed out that viruses could not survive more than a couple of hours in the air. She shook her head in cautious agreement. It was time to shift tactics. I switched my tone to confident and our conversation to sailboats. She accepted my lead, and we left the apartment within minutes to go sailing. (How was I to know we were standing in David Ferrie’s shadow?) Classes started the next day, and we saw each other daily, exchanging comments about our classes and the people we had met. After about two weeks, we met for lunch at our usual spot in the cafeteria. Barbara said that she was really upset about something she had heard concerning Tulane’s “right-wing political orientation.” Specifically, she asked me if I had ever heard of Dr. Alton Ochsner. Of course, I had heard of Ochsner. Everybody in New Orleans had. An enormous hospital in town was named after him. Then she asked me what I knew about him. At the time all I knew was the standard pitch: He was one of the most respected people in New Orleans and was founder of the Ochsner Clinic, which took care of a lot of important people from Latin America. Then I added a personal comment: He was also an aggressive antismoking activist, which was something that I liked about him. On the other hand, rumor had it he was a Victorian moralist who held some controversial views about sex causing cancer. Then she told me what was bothering her. A fellow graduate student who had lived in South America had told her that Ochsner was part of an international fascist group and had been very close to Nazi scientists who fled to South America at the end of World War II, particularly in Paraguay.3 I did not think much of the story, quietly considering it to be a hysterical liberal rant.

In fact, he was occasionally referred to as a “right-wing crackpot,” but I had never heard him referred to as a fascist, and had never heard anything about his helping Nazi scientists in South", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:50:2d87b3f7fdc7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2980, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 51, "text": "very close to Nazi scientists who fled to South America at the end of World War II, particularly in Paraguay.3 I did not think much of the story, quietly considering it to be a hysterical liberal rant.

In fact, he was occasionally referred to as a “right-wing crackpot,” but I had never heard him referred to as a fascist, and had never heard anything about his helping Nazi scientists in South America. To my ears, it all sounded like overstatement. Anyway, it was widely known that Nazis had gone to South America at the end of the war and that the American military debriefed both German and Japanese scientists at the end of the war to find out what they were working on. Who would they ask to do that? Some Army doctor? Wouldn’t they get the best scientists in America to review what Germany’s top scientists were up to? I did not know if Ochsner spoke German fluently, but that would seem to be a prerequisite for the job. It’s hard enough to know what scientists are saying in your own language. Who knows? Maybe the U.S. government did get Ochsner to go to South America to debrief Nazi scientists. If so, that made him an important American scientist, not a Nazi sympathizer. I suggested to her that his evasiveness might be a sign he was a Cuban exile. There were many of them in New Orleans, and most found it convenient to keep the word “Cuba” out of the conversation. Then I asked her what he did for a living. She said Miguel claimed he was a mechanic, but that he only occasionally worked at a gas station out in Jefferson Parish. Most of his time was spent at one particular bar. I was not surprised to hear that he invited Barbara to go to the bar with him one evening “just to see what it was like.”4 She turned him down, saying she already had a boyfriend. Several things about Miguel did not add up. One is that it took money to pay rent and to hang out at a bar, and he did not have what you would call a visible means of support. Secondly, there were many service stations in New Orleans that could have used a good mechanic, and these were much closer to his apartment. Why would he only work occasionally at a service station in Jefferson Parish, a suburb thirty minutes away (and a cultural world apart) from uptown New Orleans? The second incident occurred several days later. Miguel knocked on Barbara’s back door and called out her name in his accented voice. She motioned for me to come with her to the door, whispering, “I want him to see that I have a boyfriend.” When she opened it, he stepped inside confidently.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:51:a8dab381791f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2981, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 52, "text": "apartment.

She motioned for me to come with her to the door, whispering, “I want him to see that I have a boyfriend.” When she opened it, he stepped inside confidently. When he realized I was standing there looking at him, he was embarrassed. Barbara introduced me with, “Have you met my boyfriend?” Actually our relationship seemed new and tentative at the time, but I didn’t argue with her. It sounded good to me. Miguel stood about five-feet eight-inches with black hair and a stocky build. He was in his mid-thirties and was common looking. His shifty personality glistened. It was an awkward moment. Another rooster in the hen house. And to be caught coming in the back door! He was obviously uncomfortable with the situation, but that was where I wanted him. I kept my tone polite and somewhat formal. My unspoken message to him was, “I don’t blame you for trying, but let’s not have this happen again.” His unspoken message to me was, “You lucky devil, you beat me to it.” He mumbled through a couple of social courtesies trying to portray his presence as a concerned neighbor just stopping by to see if she was all right. Then as quickly as he had appeared, he said good-bye and went on his way. I never saw him again, but we heard his footsteps coming and going down the back stairwell for months. As the fall semester progressed, Barbara and I saw a lot of each other. I was in and out of her apartment repeatedly, though we spent less and less time there and more time over at my place. Shortly after Thanksgiving, I forced myself to begin writing a term paper that I had been ignoring. It was for my Pre-Columbian Art course, and I had chosen a comparison of two Mayan carvings from Guatemala as the subject. Much of the information I needed was in the Middle American Research Institute, located on the fourth floor of the Tulane’s main library. I ate an early lunch and headed to the library about noon. Little did I know what lay ahead. As I entered the glass doors of the Middle American Research Institute, I was greeted with the unmistakable look of terror on the faces of two women.5 Both were staring wideeyed and slack-jawed out the window. One mumbled “My God” as she shook her head in disbelief. I turned to see what they were looking at. Out the window and across the tree tops there was an unobstructed view of the downtown skyline seven miles away.

One mumbled “My God” as she shook her head in disbelief. I turned to see what they were looking at. Out the window and across the tree tops there was an unobstructed view of the downtown skyline seven miles away. One of the tall buildings had just exploded into flames. Enormous flames were shooting out of the windows. A thick plume of dense black smoke had not yet reached more than a couple of hundred feet above the roof, indicating the fire had just started. But the forty foot flames indicated a massive sudden explosion, probably a firebomb. I recognized the building immediately, it was the Rault Center. The top three floors of the building were the Lamplighter Club, where I had worked in the summer of 1968. The building was owned by Joseph M. Rault, Jr., an independent oil man and real estate entrepreneur. Rault was very close to U.S. Senator Russell Long, and was sitting in an airplane next to both Senator Long and New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison when Long originally proposed the JFK investigation to Garrison. To facilitate the secret investigation, Long asked Rault to form an organization, now known as “Truth and Consequences,” to finance trips so Garrison and his staff could investigate the murder of the President quietly. Down at the Rault Center all hell was breaking loose. Rault had been at his normal post on the sixteenth floor, meeting and greeting local dignitaries who had come to the club for lunch. Congressman Hale Boggs, Senator Russell Long, and New Orleans Mayor Vic Schiro were just a few who frequented this club, though none were there that day.7 Local bankers and developers congregated around this seat of power to be close to the pulse and to see the right people. Suddenly, there was a loud explosion from down below. The building shook violently. A firebomb had exploded on the fifteenth floor. Flames leapt out the window. The crowd panicked and stampeded for the exits. For some reason Rault headed for the roof. Others headed for the ground. Seven people followed Rault to the roof. As the forty-foot flames leapt up above the roofline of the building, Rault must have wondered if he made the right decision. He must have also wondered what happened to the three floors of “fireproof” paneling that he had bought for the Lamplighter Club, which was now burning like a blowtorch.8 The concrete and steel stairwells quickly became ovens. No one could pass now.

No one could pass now. The eight people trapped on the roof knew that unless someone descended from the sky, they would either be burned alive or would have to jump to their deaths from the seventeenth-floor roof. The seven women trapped in a window on the fifteenth floor faced the same situation. I got as close to the building as I could, but the roads were blocked off. Claire jumped out of the car and ran the final few blocks. I turned my car around and headed for a television set. It was the greatest of fortunes that a helicopter carrying an oil executive happened to be flying over downtown New Orleans at the moment of the explosion. The pilot dropped his passenger on the grassy field in front of the Louisiana Supreme Court building and headed for the roof of the flaming building. Nine people were trapped there, but his small helicopter could only carry three passengers at a time. Some would have to wait for the next trip. The rest would have to wait for the third trip. So three separate times, this determined pilot landed on the roof surrounded by onyx smoke and orange flames. Rault was the last person to leave the roof. He was lucky. The women who were trapped in their beauty salon on the fifteenth floor were not. Fire investigators estimated the bomb contained five gallons of gasoline, and had exploded in the utility closet right outside the door of the salon. The hallway was immediately filled with flames, blocking the women’s exit. The helicopter could not help them. Faced with certain death by fire, or jumping to their deaths, seven women jumped. There was no net. No air bag. Six died on impact. The camera crews were there. They filmed it all. That night veteran broadcaster Walter Cronkite warned his viewers that he was about to show the “grimmest footage” of his career. The nation watched helplessly. I turned off the television and went back to the library, trying to concentrate on thousand year-old hieroglyphs buried in a Mayan grave. One question has smoldered since the fire: Was the Rault Center firebombing the result of Rault’s financing of Garrison’s JFK investigation?9 When Christmas break came, Barbara gave me a key to her apartment and asked me to keep an eye on it while she flew home to see her family.

A couple of days after she left, I dropped by for a routine check and found that her waterbed mattress, which was resting on the hardwood floor without a frame, had started to leak. I quickly went outside, borrowed a hose from a neighbor’s lawn, and drained the mattress. But the damage had already been done. The wooden floors were severely buckled. It was hundreds of dollars of damage. The landlord would certainly flip. That night I called her at her family’s farm and told her about the leak. She said that she would call the landlord in the morning and tell him. Several days later, New Orleans woke up to yet another incredible event: Someone had set fire to the Howard Johnson Motel.10 It was directly across the street from the Rault Center, but these arsonists were not experts. And the fire was small in comparison, one smoky hotel room. But in light of what happened at the Rault Center, the hotel guests panicked and ran to the street. And having recently been humiliated in the national news by their inability to do anything to help the seven women who jumped, the New Orleans Fire Department rushed to the scene, hoping to redeem its reputation. The longest ladder was raised to reach the fifth floor window. The bravest firemen rushed up the ladder with no other thought than trying to save someone’s life. As they approached the window, a rifle barrel slid through the opening. The sniper squeezed off round after round, murdering the very men who had come to save him. The police department broke into a fit of rage. Nearly 600 policemen swarmed to the building in pre-SWAT chaos. Two snipers were reported. The Deputy Chief of Police grabbed several men and led them into a stairwell to find the snipers. Somebody thought he saw something. Somebody fired a high powered rifle in the concrete and steel stairway. When the bullet finished ricocheting, the Deputy Chief of Police was dead. Police sealed the building. As the situation developed, a police spotter thought he saw something in the blockhouse on the roof. Twelve police fanned out and approached the blockhouse like they were going to a western shootout. Standing in a semi-circle in front of a steel door cemented into a concrete wall, they opened fire. As one might expect, the bullets ricocheted off the concrete wall and steel door, right back at the very men who fired them. Yes, live on national television, they shot themselves.

Several policemen fell wounded on the building’s roof. One officer charged the blockhouse. It was empty. I turned off the TV and drove to the airport to pick up Barbara, who was returning from Christmas break. It seemed like she had been gone a long time. Her flight was early and I found her entering the terminal. Knowing that I had worked at the Rault Center, she asked if I had heard anything new about the fire. I told her I had heard it was a bomb. Somebody was trying to kill somebody. As we rode the escalator leading down to the baggage claim, she noticed a big lighted sign advertising the Howard Johnson’s Motel rising above our heads. She had been traveling most of the day but had heard rumors of something happening at Howard Johnson’s in New Orleans. I had seen a lot of strange things in the past months. But it all made some kind of twisted sense. In the Rault Center fire, somebody was mad. They were either mad at Rault for some reason and were trying to destroy him, or they were mad at society and chose his building and his success as a target. In the Ho-Jo Massacre, an angry and frustrated black man (or men) decided to strike back at a white racist society. He died venting his anger. Others died with him. But this? A lawyer holding a damage deposit did not care about hundreds of dollars of damage done by a tenant to his client’s building? It didn’t make sense. Whatever was going on, it was clear that this was no ordinary apartment. All I could think of was “those terrible men and the horrible things they did to those animals.” One month later, when she moved out of the apartment, Barbara got her full security deposit back. The person or persons pulling the strings on this building had succeeded in their objective, and that was a lot bigger than Barbara’s security deposit. They got a real live human being to live in a virtually haunted apartment. I scratched my head about this apartment for years. Frankly, I was afraid to understand it. It was so close and so strange that it scared me. I could have gone back and talked to the old woman who lived in the basement, but I didn’t. I was afraid of what she might tell me.

I didn’t go find out where Mary Sherman lived, or where David Ferrie lived. I just went sailing, played music, and worried about things like Mayan hieroglyphs from Guatemala. It was not until 1992, when I realized the possibility that the Ferrie and Sherman cancer experiments might have something to do with the most deadly epidemic in history, that I finally woke up. At that point my choices narrowed. It was time to find out everything I could. I started by reading everything on the shelf about AIDS and then everything that was written by or about Jim Garrison. It was then that I realized that David Ferrie had lived on Louisiana Avenue Parkway. A sick feeling came over me as Garrison described the smell of white mice in Ferrie’s apartment: “The special fetid smell of hundreds of unattended white mice in the dining room added to the unique rank odor of the dwelling, making it difficult for visitors to enter.”11 Then he described Ferrie’s medical books and laboratory equipment and the medical treatise he had written on the viral theory of cancer. But Garrison did not give the exact address. For a brief time, I pondered the possibility that my girlfriend had lived in David Ferrie’s apartment, perhaps on the spot where the plot to kill Jack Kennedy was hatched. It was more than I wanted to wonder about. I had to find out the exact address. So I called the library in New Orleans. Ferrie was not listed in the phone book, but they found the address in his obituary, 3330 Louisiana Avenue Parkway. For a brief moment I was relieved. That must be a block away from 3225. But what to make of everything I had seen and heard myself. What about the smell in Barbara’s apartment? What about the old lady in the basement? What about “those terrible men and the horrible things they did to those animals?” What about Garrison’s estimate of nearly 2,000 mice? Now, that was worth thinking about! Nearly 2,000 mice! Say five mice per cage. That’s 400 cages of mice. What would an apartment look like with 400 cages of mice in it? It would be wall-to-wall cages! And consider the mice. Consider the food. Consider the excrement. Consider the smell. Consider the diseases! No one could live in such a place.

Let me repeat that: “No one could live in such a place.” Four hundred cages would take a dedicated facility. Then it hit me: Ferrie’s underground medical laboratory was not in his apartment, and he did not live in the lab! No one could. He lived near the lab, so he could manage its dayto-day operations, and kept a small number of mice back at his apartment for convenience. No, I had not been in Ferrie’s apartment: I had been in his laboratory! avid Ferrie has become a character of almost D comic book proportions. A brilliant man rejected by society, he was a collection of contradictions. A man of high moral aspirations who was compromised by personal cravings. A respected airline pilot who became a tattered Bohemian rebel. The son of a police captain who helped defend a Mafia boss against prosecution. From his orange wig haphazardly glued to his head to his grease-paint eyebrows, to his wardrobe full of religious vestments, to his home-brewed cancer experiments, to his burning desire to help teenage boys, to his ability to land planes in jungle clearings at night, to his violent schemes against Castro, to his friendship with Lee Harvey Oswald, to his unrewarded genius, he was the most colorful figure dredged up during the JFK investigations. Today Ferrie has emerged as the keystone in several JFK assassination theories, including: D The Garrison Case. Ferrie’s trip to Texas on the afternoon of November 22, 1963 triggered Garrison’s suspicion that Ferrie was involved in the JFK assassination, perhaps as a getaway pilot. Next, based on additional evidence, Garrison suspected Ferrie may have been a prime organizer of the plot. Garrison finally concluded that a high-level faction within the CIA was ultimately responsible for Kennedy’s death, and that Ferrie had played a lesser role. Ferrie’s relationship with the CIA is well known. He trained pilots for the CIA-sponsored Bay of Pigs invasion, and flew covert missions into Cuba. Marcello, reportedly the head of the Mafia in Louisiana, and some say the entire nation. Davis proposed that Ferrie planned and organized the plot to kill the President on Marcello’s instructions. That Ferrie had some form of relationship with Carlos Marcello is beyond question, but the extent of that relationship is still unclear. Ferrie was sitting with Marcello in federal court at the moment JFK was assassinated.

Descriptions of Ferrie from those who knew him personally range from “a living god”1 to “a sexual deviant capable of any form of crime.”2 Unfortunately, most books which reference Ferrie devote little time to examining who he was and what made him that way. What do we really know about him today? What made him tick? Why was he experimenting with cancer? And who was he really mad at? Castro? Kennedy? Or God? Much of what I am about to describe comes from a report none of us were supposed to see. It was a private investigation on David William Ferrie prepared by Southern Research Company Inc. of New Orleans, beginning in the winter of 1963,3 six months before Oswald arrived in New Orleans, nine months before the raid on the anti-Castro guerilla training camp, and eleven months before the JFK assassination. I do not know who authorized it or why, but I am told it was Eastern Airlines, which was building a case in order to dismiss Ferrie. An advertisement at the bottom of the report describes the Southern Research Company as “A firm principally staffed by former agents of the FBI.” David Ferrie began his long, twisted journey in the middle class suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio, in 1918. His father was James H. Ferrie, a captain in the Cleveland Police Department and later an attorney. Young David was baptized, confirmed, and raised as a Catholic, and he was educated in a string of Catholic schools. First, he graduated from St. Ignatius High School in Cleveland in 1935. Readers familiar with Catholicism will recognize the name St. Ignatius as referring to “St. Ignatius of Loyola,” the militant crusader who founded the Society of Jesus, more commonly known as “the Jesuits.” Then Ferrie enrolled at John Carroll University from 1935 to 1938, a college also run by the Jesuits. There he studied Greek, Latin, history, and government, getting A’s or B’s in all subjects. Despite his scholastic success, other forces were obviously churning within him, and he dropped out during his senior year to begin his quest for the priesthood. In 1938, he entered St. Mary’s Seminary in Cleveland, where he studied for the priesthood for three years. Then, in 1940, just prior to graduating, he had a nervous breakdown.4 This was his first failure in a long series of attempts to become a priest. Later, when he applied for re-admission, he was rejected. Having known him for three years, St. Mary’s did not want him back.

Later, when he applied for re-admission, he was rejected. Having known him for three years, St. Mary’s did not want him back. He seemed to have a problem with authority. In 1940, Ferrie’s objective changed from becoming a priest to becoming a teacher. He entered Baldwin-Wallace College, and did student teaching at Rocky River High School from 1940 to 1941. A department chairman summarized his performance with a tongue-in-cheek statement: “His interest in teaching students is very closely tied up with his religious faith.”5 When questioned years later about her evaluation, she remembered Ferrie clearly, but this time she was less charitable. She quickly portrayed him as having an inflated self-image when, in fact, he was “the poorest teacher they ever had.” From there, she went straight after his personality describing him as “tricky, a bluffer, shrewd, and probably a liar.” She added that she received “complaints about his psychoanalyzing his students,” but never had “complaints involving moral problems.” However, she expressed her own doubts about his moral character, advising that he be kept away from both girls and young boys. He seemed to have “a particular interest in the younger students, more than a teacher should have.” In August 1941, Ferrie made a second attempt to become a Catholic priest and entered St. Charles Seminary in Carthagena, Ohio. There he stayed for three years. During this time his father bought him a plane, and he learned to fly. In 1944, on the eve of ecclesiastical accomplishment, the faculty refused to allow him to continue his religious studies. Having spent six years of his life in seminaries studying for the priesthood, he was again formally rejected from a life of prayer. Ferrie was shattered. An unsigned memo found in Ferrie’s file at the St. Charles Seminary told the faculty’s side of the story. It began, “We had serious misgivings about admitting him to our seminary after learning he had been refused re-admittance to Saint Mary’s in Cleveland.” Attempting to give a balanced portrayal, they described Ferrie as “a paradox,” saying “many of his ways were likable.” They even assumed some responsibility for their part in Ferrie’s tragedy by pointing out that they had renewed his relationship for over three years, but alas “there was surely an element of instability in his character somewhere.” Then they described what became a familiar pattern in Ferrie’s life, initial success both socially and scholastically, the achievement of a leadership position amongst his peers, growing conflict and jealousy, back-stabbing, self-pity, exaggeration, manipulation, misuse of leadership and trust, excessive criticism,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:60:bfbfd81071b6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2990, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 61, "text": "were likable.” They even assumed some responsibility for their part in Ferrie’s tragedy by pointing out that they had renewed his relationship for over three years, but alas “there was surely an element of instability in his character somewhere.” Then they described what became a familiar pattern in Ferrie’s life, initial success both socially and scholastically, the achievement of a leadership position amongst his peers, growing conflict and jealousy, back-stabbing, self-pity, exaggeration, manipulation, misuse of leadership and trust, excessive criticism, threats, and contempt of authority. In a tone that approached apology, the anonymous author said there was no single event of magnitude, but rather a pattern of minor infractions, mostly of the rules of the house, but also “emotional instability,” especially “his inclination to suspicion and rash judgement and uncharitable conclusions” that indicated “he would not fit into a religious community.” The final stroke: “When corrected, his attitude seemed to be that the rule should be changed rather than that he should be forced to observe it.” On November 27, 1944, the Faculty of St. Charles Seminary refused to allow him to continue his quest for priesthood “due to the questionableness of his disposition.” He was unfit for the Society of the Precious Blood. In 1945, Ferrie was treated by a psychiatrist and began a period of relative stability. He lived at home, worked teaching English and Aeronautics at Benedictine High School, and began his long relationship with the Civil Air Patrol. This calm lasted through 1948, though the seven traffic violations from this stretch showed he was still having some trouble with “the rules of the house.” Force and flew it, after dark and without landing lights, from Columbus to Cleveland. Identifying himself as a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force during the incident got him into even hotter water. The CAP commander tried to have Ferrie dismissed from CAP, but the paperwork was “lost.” So Ferrie was still on their books in 1950, when two CAP cadets signed papers reporting that Ferrie, their instructor, had taken them to a house of prostitution in a nearby town. Ferrie was not charged with a crime, but his dismissal from CAP became imminent. Ferrie negotiated his disastrous situation into a transfer to Louisiana. When the Louisiana branch asked for his personnel file, the Cleveland office found it missing, but could not prove it was stolen. Ferrie did have his friends and allies along the way. One was a well-known female pilot who hired Ferrie to fly her exhusband’s twin-engine plane on business trips down to Texas.6 She considered Ferrie a near-genius whose piloting skills were above reproach.

Before long all of the hair on his body, including his eyebrows and eyelashes, was gone. He compensated for this by wearing a crude homemade wig glued to his head and false eyebrows painted on his face. It is unclear whether his study of bio-chemistry was related to his hair loss, as some have suggested. But what is clear is that something happened in the 1950s that set his beast of unrest in motion again. With it came the awakening of a violent and intolerant political temperament. A glimpse of this can be seen in a letter that he wrote to the U.S. Secretary of Defense: “There is nothing I would enjoy better than blowing the hell out of every damn Russian, Communist, Red, or what-have-you. Between my friends and I, we can cook up a crew [sic] that can really blow them to hell … I want to train killers …”8 Someone in the government must have seen the value in an airline pilot who wanted to train killers, because Ferrie started moonlighting as a pilot for the CIA.9 The precise extent of Ferrie’s relationship with the CIA is not fully known. Many of the documents are still classified. But it is widely reported that he flew numerous missions in and out of Cuba, first supplying Castro with arms to fight Batista and later supplying the anti-Castro underground with weapons. Castro came to power on January 1, 1959. Within a year he had seized American assets (casinos, factories, and oil refineries), openly embraced Communism, and militarily allied himself with the Soviet Union. Ferrie felt personally betrayed, and set out with a vengeance to destroy Castro and his Communist dictatorship. This hatred led Ferrie into a long and complex relationship with the anti-Castro Cuban underground here in the United States. He firebombed targets inside Cuba,10 and traveled to Guatemala to train Cuban exiles to fly planes in support of the Bay of Pigs invasion. Back in Washington, D.C., events were unfolding that would greatly impact Ferrie’s life.11 Kennedy’s White House and the CIA had very different ideas about how to stop Communism, especially the expansion of Soviet influence in the Western Hemisphere. This policy dispute erupted into open conflict between the two camps. Many of the CIA’s activities were untraceable even by the CIA inspector general.

This policy dispute erupted into open conflict between the two camps. Many of the CIA’s activities were untraceable even by the CIA inspector general. These “unvouchered expenditures” essentially meant that the CIA was refusing to be controlled by the White House. The situation oscillated between insubordination and treason. In 1975 when the Senate Intelligence Committee finally looked into these activities, Chairman Frank Church likened the CIA’s activities to “a rogue elephant rampaging out of control.”12 Actually, the problem was even deeper. The question: Who is running the government? The stakes were enormous. The pressures unbelievable. The players believed nothing less than the destiny of the planet was at stake. The CIA’s plan for keeping the Soviets at bay was to put a gun to their head. Batteries of American missiles armed with nuclear warheads sat in Turkey on the U.S.S.R.’s southern border. All major Soviet cities, including Moscow, were now ready to burst into the flames of a nuclear nightmare within thirty minutes of an order from Washington. Kennedy ordered them removed, but the Pentagon did not comply. The Soviets were very unhappy about such intimidation and were anxious for an opportunity to show the Americans just what it felt like to have someone point a nuclear missile at them. Castro gave them the opportunity. Castro was determined to break America’s grip on his island. In his words, “It is time to tell the Yankees that we are not your plantation, your gambling casino, or your whorehouse.”13 In order to discourage an American military overthrow of his government, Castro offered his island to the Soviets as launching pad for their nuclear missiles. The Soviets wasted little time in moving them into position. In early April of 1961 American intelligence started picking up unusual radio signals from the Camaguey Mountains in central Cuba.14 But the radio signals were too weak to analyze properly. They were simultaneously receiving reports from the anti-Castro guerillas inside Cuba that some large facility was under construction in a deep ravine in the jungle in the Camagueys. Were the Soviets moving nuclear missiles into Cuba? The CIA needed better intelligence. They needed hard evidence. The CIA decided to send a team into Cuba to collect radio signals from a mountain top in the Camagueys. Ferrie was ordered to come to Washington, where he met with General Charles Cabell, one of the top people at the CIA. The general explained the mission to Ferrie and a young aeronautic electronics expert named Robert Morrow. They would leave from the west coast of Florida at night on April 16, 1961.

The general explained the mission to Ferrie and a young aeronautic electronics expert named Robert Morrow. They would leave from the west coast of Florida at night on April 16, 1961. Ferrie would fly the plane, with Morrow as copilot, and land in a clearing in the jungles. Guerillas would meet the plane and take them to a location to record the radio signals. At last, Ferrie was doing something really important. the beach. Over 1,200 were captured. Kennedy was furious at the CIA, believing they were trying to manipulate him into an act of war. He fired Dulles, Cabell, and Bissell, the top brass at the CIA, and ordered his brother Bobby, the U.S. Attorney General, to oversee the CIA, and to dismantle its system of unaccountable expenditures. By 1961, Ferrie lived in a three-level house near New Orleans International Airport, where he worked. Ferrie said his mother lived on the main floor, which looked like a normal middle-class house with sofas, paintings, books, and the like. Here Ferrie held CAP meetings. The entire top floor was David’s personal territory, and was strictly for his medical interests. It contained a medical library with various diplomas hung on the walls, a psychiatric couch, medical equipment like microscopes and test tubes, and about twenty caged mice for his medical experiments. In the basement sat the sawed-off remains of a World War II fighter plane, which he used as a primitive flight simulator to teach flying.15 As the story was told to me by ex-CAP cadets, one night Ferrie got drunk and, in an attempt to impress a young boy, borrowed a plane and went for a joyride, buzzing the sleeping city of New Orleans at tree-top level. Some say he had sex with the boy during the flight. FAA officials were waiting at the airport when he returned. They set in motion an effort to pull his commercial license. He was also booked on “decency charges” concerning his relationship with the teenage boy.16 About the same time, he lost his position with the Civil Air Patrol through insubordination and misconduct. Again, the basic ingredients were young boys. Ferrie insisted on sleeping in the cabin with the teenage cadets, and threw a beer party for them on the beach, both violations of CAP rules. Ferrie left the CAP and started his own flying club for teenage boys, called the Falcons, and held meetings in his home. Ferrie’s religious ambitions also re-surfaced in 1961.

He became a member of the clergy of the Apostolic Orthodox Old Catholic Church of North America, an independent offshoot of the Roman Catholic Church headquartered in a house in Louisville, Kentucky. It was from this fountain of legitimacy that Ferrie sought to attain his rank as Bishop. On November 30, 1961, wearing a wig Scotch-taped to his head and accompanied by sidekick Jack Martin, Ferrie arrived in Louisville expecting to be consecrated as a Bishop of the Church. It was not to be. The Archbishop who was supposed to perform the ceremony had heard of Ferrie’s dismissal from Eastern Airlines, refused to consecrate him, and chastised him for the reports of his unnatural sexual behavior. The Archbishop’s criticism went further still, telling Ferrie he intended to excommunicate him from the Church for behavior unbecoming to a Church official. Ferrie was furious and departed in anger. In January 1962, the Archbishop officially excommunicated Ferrie from the Church, advising him by letter that he had been “degraded and cast out of the clergy and Church in America.” Ferrie’s battle with Eastern Airlines had lasted for several years. A doctor who examined him for Eastern Airlines described him as having a “psychotic personality and no sense of responsibility.”17 He eventually lost his job. His life fell into a spiral. He moved from his tri-level house by the airport to a small apartment in town. His hair had now fallen out completely, and he began wearing a homemade orange wig which some said was made of monkey hair.18 He replaced his natural eyebrows with dark grease paint. We enter 1963. Ferrie made one final try at getting someone to recognize his religious talents, his fourth attempt at the clergy. This time it was from the Orthodox Catholic Church, another offshoot Catholic sect, which split from the Church over a doctrinal dispute in 1709. The worldwide head of this church was reported to be an Archbishop in Geneva, Switzerland, who was identified in the Southern Research report as a translator at a disarmament conference. The Chancellor of the North American Province was Bishop George A. Hyde, who lived in Washington, D.C. and ran a small seminary out of his house. Hyde had three young male novices and expected another three shortly. Each person in the house held an outside job and contributed his income to Hyde to run his house. Using the title Friar Hyde, he offered his services to the Washington D.C. Juvenile Court, which responded by placing a young boy in his home.

Juvenile Court, which responded by placing a young boy in his home. Hyde said, “If I am successful, I would like to take in other boys like him.” Early that summer Ferrie told Hyde of his desire to become a priest and asked Hyde to ordain him. After considerable discussion, Hyde agreed to the request saying the next opportunity would be at the Bishop’s conference in Kankake, Illinois. Hyde recommended David Ferrie as a candidate for ordination, but requested the hosting Bishop to ordain him, since he could not attend. Ferrie was scheduled to be ordained a priest of this church on July 19, 1963. Just two days before Ferrie’s scheduled ordination, Jack Martin, Ferrie’s old sidekick in New Orleans, arrived at the Bishop’s Rectory in Kankake, Illinois, and told the Bishop that David Ferrie had been arrested several times on charges of homosexuality and that he was presently appealing one such allegation in the Louisiana Court of Appeals. Martin picked up the phone, called the Clerk of Court in New Orleans, and handed the phone to one of the priests to verify the information. The Bishop refused to ordain Ferrie. Back in New Orleans, Ferrie’s involvement with the increasingly desperate anti-Castro Cuban underground was escalating. His main employment was working as a “private investigator” for a right-wing extremist named Guy Banister, who was heavily involved in covert anti-Communist activities throughout Latin America.19 Ferrie also served as a private investigator and personal pilot for accused Mafia boss Carlos Marcello (and others). By July of 1963, Ferrie’s assistance to the anti-Castro Cuban underground included the military training of a dozen Cuban exiles at a rural camp located about forty miles from New Orleans. Their target was Castro himself.20 By this time, Kennedy had explicitly prohibited paramilitary raids on Cuba by desperate exile groups. On July 31, 1963, the FBI raided this training camp, arrested and/or detained eleven people (mostly Cubans and a few mobsters), and confiscated a large quantity of military weapons. The military weaponry included over a ton of dynamite, aerial bomb casings, detonators, and the ingredients to make napalm. It is believed that the mission of this group was the assassination of Fidel Castro and that it was one of many projects organized by the Cuban exile Dr. Orlando Bosch, a fanatical terrorist and saboteur who began his career as a medical doctor.21 Had ordinary people been caught with that same equipment and in those same circumstances, they would have been sent", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:66:d261eb906101", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2996, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 67, "text": "weaponry included over a ton of dynamite, aerial bomb casings, detonators, and the ingredients to make napalm.

For some reason, the FBI released these eleven saboteurs and attempted to cover up their detainment.22 It should be noted that Ferrie-employer Guy Banister had run the FBI’s Chicago office and was a close professional associate of J. Edgar Hoover. Into this caldron walked one of Ferrie’s old Civil Air Patrol cadets, who had just returned to New Orleans with his pregnant wife and baby daughter. Lee Harvey Oswald had been off in the Marines for several years, and had lived for several more years in the Soviet Union, where he had met his young bride. In New Orleans, Oswald got a job at the Reily Coffee Company, located around the corner from Guy Banister’s office where Ferrie worked. Oswald was seen with Ferrie several times that summer: D Oswald and Ferrie were seen together at Banister’s office at 544 Camp St. D Ferrie and Clay Shaw took Oswald up to Jackson, Louisiana to try to get him a job in the Southeastern Louisiana State Hospital, a mental hospital staffed with doctors from both Tulane and LSU medical schools. As part of that effort, Shaw and Ferrie brought Oswald to nearby Clinton, Louisiana, to register to vote. D Ferrie had a party at his apartment. His guests included Clay Shaw, Lee Oswald, Perry Russo, and several Cuban exiles. Ferrie got drunk and discussed how President Kennedy could be killed if he was caught in a crossfire of high-powered rifles. In the months that followed, Ferrie spent his time helping Carlos Marcello defend himself against racketeering charges brought by Robert Kennedy and the U.S. Justice Department. On November 22, 1963, at the moment of President Kennedy’s assassination, Ferrie was sitting in federal court in New Orleans with Marcello as the judge prepared to read the jury’s “not guilty” verdict. Later that afternoon, Ferrie made a sudden trip to Texas. Jack Martin (who had just been pistol whipped that afternoon by his employer Guy Banister) called the DA’s office to say that Ferrie may have been involved in Kennedy’s assassination. In response, the New Orleans District Attorney’s office raided Ferrie’s apartment on Louisiana Avenue Parkway. There they found aerial bomb casings, maps of Cuba, a small portion of his medical equipment and a dozen or so mice in cages. Ferrie was picked up for questioning by the DA’s office when he returned to New Orleans.

Ferrie was picked up for questioning by the DA’s office when he returned to New Orleans. The New Orleans DAs found the circumstances of his trip suspicious, and Ferrie’s explanation of the trip unbelievable. They turned Ferrie over to the FBI for further questioning. The FBI promptly released Ferrie with what amounted to a public apology. However, we are exploring the life and activities of a man who was running an underground medical laboratory which was said to have been using monkey viruses to develop a biological weapon. The fact that Ferrie was suspected of being involved in the Kennedy assassination is why we know as much about him as we do, and is how we know of his involvement in covert medical experiments with Dr. Mary Sherman and others. Later, in 1966, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison re-opened his investigation into the Kennedy assassination at the suggestion of U.S. Senator Russell Long. Garrison found Ferrie to be central to his investigation. After the assassination, as a matter of fact, something psychologically curious happened to Ferrie: He dropped out of anti-Castro exile activities, left the pay of the CIA, and drifted aimlessly while his emotional problems increased to the point where he was totally dependent on huge doses of tranquilizers and barbiturates. I don’t know if Ferrie ever experienced any guilt about the assassination itself, but in his last months, he was a tortured man.23 I had nothing but pity for Dave Ferrie while he was alive, and I have nothing but pity for him now that he’s dead. Ferrie was a pathetic and tortured creature, a genuinely brilliant man whose twisted drives locked him into his own private hell. If I had been able to help Ferrie, I would have; but he was in too deep and he was terrified.24 David Ferrie perennially was being defrocked, first of his priesthood, then of his hair, then of his Civil Air Patrol captaincy and then of his position as an Eastern Air Lines pilot. It is unlikely that he was unaffected by this accumulation of bitter experience. This man with a brilliant mind and a face like a clown was a dangerous man.26 In February of 1967, only a few days after Garrison’s investigation was made public, David Ferrie was found dead in his disheveled apartment.

The Coroner ruled that Ferrie died of natural causes. To this day, speculation continues about the cause of his death: Some argue that he was murdered; some argue that he took his own life. The only three names mentioned in Ferrie’s handwritten will are his brother, his friend Alvin Beauboeuf, and Rev. George A. Hyde. In January 1993, I flew to New Orleans to assist Gus Russo in his investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald for the PBS television show Frontline. Before I left for New Orleans, I called Perry Russo.27 Perry had been Garrison’s key witness, who testified that he was in Ferrie’s apartment when Ferrie plotted to kill Kennedy. In 1993 Perry was a cab driver in New Orleans, so I asked him to pick me up at the airport. Once in the cab I asked him to tell me everything he knew about Ferrie, starting with the first time he met him. Ferrie. As a favor to the boy’s parents, Perry Russo infiltrated Ferrie’s group with the intention of bringing his friend home. To do this, he had to break Ferrie’s considerable psychological grip on the youngster.28 Throughout his tale, Perry Russo told me of both his successes and his failures in a balanced manner. I asked questions as we went along. He was quick to say “I don’t know” when he did not know, and he struggled to remember details about the things he could. It was clear to me that Perry never really liked Ferrie, but he came to respect him. His descriptions were particularly helpful. The Dave Ferrie that Perry Russo talked about first was Captain Dave Ferrie, the successful commercial airline pilot. It was Perry who described Ferrie’s house near the airport room-by-room: the middle class apartment on the main floor, the fighter plane in the basement, and his medical suite above. It was here that Ferrie was most at home, among his diplomas, reclining couches, microscopes, test tubes, medical books, and mice. It was here he plotted to cure cancer and to rid the world of Communism. When Ferrie lost his airline job in 1961, he also lost his affluent lifestyle. Perry’s before-and-after descriptions contrasted a proud man who meticulously wore uniforms with a broken man who shopped exclusively at thrift stores. As Perry described Ferrie’s small apartment on Louisiana Avenue Parkway, it became clear that the bulk of Ferrie’s furniture, his medical equipment and his airplane-related paraphernalia did not make the transition to 3330 Louisiana Avenue Parkway. So I asked Perry about this. He said he remembered asking, “What happened to all Dave’s stuff?” to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt:69:85d2568f5eb4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 2999, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781937584597", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781937584597_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 70, "text": "also lost his affluent lifestyle.

So I asked Perry about this. He said he remembered asking, “What happened to all Dave’s stuff?” to either Ferrie himself or to one of the boys who hung out at his apartment. Perry was told Ferrie had stashed his extra “stuff” in another apartment nearby.29 Two days later Perry Russo picked up Gus Russo and me, and drove us over to Ferrie’s apartment on Louisiana Avenue Parkway. While Gus asked Perry questions about Garrison and the Kennedy assassination, I got out of the car and walked around, checking the distance between that building and the one I knew, checking the angles, and taking pictures. When I got back in the car, Perry mentioned that Ferrie’s apartment had been vacant for four or five years after his death in 1967. Those were the same years that my girlfriend Barbara’s apartment had been vacant!30 Two rental apartments, both on the same street within a dozen houses of each other, both with the lingering smell of animals, and both voluntarily taken off the market (without rent) for years at a time! There had to be a connection! My conclusion could only be that Ferrie had been involved in both apartments, and used 3225 Louisiana Avenue Parkway as his underground medical laboratory. Thirdly, Perry Russo testified in court that, in September 1963, he heard David Ferrie, Clay Shaw, and several Cubans discuss shooting President Kennedy with high-powered rifles. The location of this incident was David Ferrie’s apartment at 3330 Louisiana Avenue Parkway. When I interviewed Perry Russo about David Ferrie, he said the Cubans frequently showed up at Ferrie’s apartment. They just appeared. No phone calls. No cars. Always late at night. How did the Cubans know when to show up? Were they staying in Miguel’s apartment down the block? Was Miguel one of them? It is clearly stated by both Garrison in On the Trail of the Assassins, and by Turner and Hinckle in Deadly Secrets (and in many other books), that Ferrie was part of the secret war against Cuba, and that these activities included an underground railroad which transported militant Cuban exiles to guerrilla-warfare training at places like Banister’s camp outside New Orleans. Now, where would you lodge a group of guerillas who had just come from a week of combat training in the swamps? At your mother’s house? No, you would need to have ^(a) safe house.

A secure place that was basically empty so it could be used as needed for a stopover. A place just like the apartment across the street from Ferrie, close to the operation, but far from high-traffic areas where it might attract unwanted attention. All of which made me wonder if our neighbor Miguel might not have been “part of the scenery,” an artifact of the underground Cuban railroad left in position to keep an eye on things, and to make sure no one got too curious about the apartment building where those terrible men did horrible things to those animals. 30 This point about both apartments being vacant has been made by several people, including Barbara, who told me within days of renting her apartment in 1972 that her landlord had two properties which had been vacant, and had just rented the other unit across the street. She pointed the building out to me. It was memorable because of the arched window in the façade, which lit the stairwell by day but made it look like an aquarium at night. I am positive that this was Ferrie’s apartment at 3330 Louisiana Avenue Parkway. he woman enters our story as an enigma. Considered “absolutely brilliant” by her medical colleagues, Mary Sherman rose rapidly to the very top ranks of the male-dominated hierarchy of American medicine in bone and joint surgery, a field that to this day has extremely few female physicians. Self-made, financially successful, and professionally respected, Dr. Sherman was a sophisticated and powerful woman during an era when the future feminists of the 1960s were still sitting at home watching Leave it to Beaver. Yet the glimpses we see of her very private personal life show a complex and sensitive woman who loved theater, literature, music, wine, flowers, and international travel, and who carried with her some terrible personal burdens. But we see no discernible political interest.1 None of this seems to explain, or even hint at, her involvement with a politically violent, emotionally unstable, drugaddicted social outcast like David Ferrie, who had no formal medical training.

Most of what we know about Mary Sherman comes from newspaper articles, an unusual police report, and her will. To that we add insights from a few medical articles, and a handful of interviews with people who knew her, to produce a sketch of an unusually talented woman who met an unusually horrible end. Born “Mary Stults” in Evanston, Illinois in 1913, she was one of several daughters of a musical voice teacher.2 At the age of sixteen, Mary went to France for two years to study at L’ecole de M. Collnot, and later taught French while working on a masters at the University of Illinois. Marrying Thomas Sherman, she became Mary Sherman.3 The pattern of an academic superstar is immediately obvious from her Phi Beta Kappa membership to her graduate work at the University of Chicago. For those unfamiliar with this institution, please note that within academic circles, the University of Chicago is an intellectual powerhouse which rivals Harvard, Stanford, and any other famous university one might name. It was founded by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, and was designed on the model of the European research university, rather than the American teaching college. This was done at a time when the Rockefeller fortune was heavily involved in the drug companies, and their sponsorship of biochemical research helped develop new commercial drugs. Today, the University of Chicago continues on the leading edge of genetics and cancer research. As an outgrowth of this biochemical medical research, the University of Chicago became one of the first major centers of nuclear research. The landmark event of this nuclear effort was the construction of the first “atom smasher,” a huge nuclear accelerator hidden in the bowels of UC’s sports stadium. In 1937, it produced the first sustained nuclear reaction for UC physicist Enrico Fermi. This is where Mary Sherman did her post-graduate work. She was trained at the headwaters of nuclear, bio-chemical, and genetic research in America. Before she became involved in human medicine, Mary did ground-breaking research into botanical viruses which lived in soil. Her early articles were so profound and so insightful that they were frequently quoted in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Though she had been dead for thirty years, the Scientific Citation Index shows ten medical articles published in 1993 which contained references to her scientific writings published between 1947 and 1965. The names of the journals tell the story of her state-of-the-art use of radiation for the treatment of bone cancers: From this, we can see the evidence of her breakthrough thinking.

This young woman, who studied in France at the time when Madame Curie’s name was at the top of the scientific heap, was one of America’s most promising minds. With the proper training, encouragement and opportunities, she could be within striking distance of the legendary Curie herself, and could possibly become the most important woman in science. Maybe it would be Mary, who at such a young age had understood the basic life of viruses better than anyone before her, who would break through “the cancer barrier.” The great minds at UC saw her potential and brought her along. During the 1940s she became Associate Professor of Orthopedic Surgery, and practiced medicine at UC’s Billings Hospital.4 In the early 1950s, Mary Sherman’s life changed. Her cancer work at the University of Chicago had attracted the attention of a famous and wealthy doctor who was president of the American Cancer Society, president of a famous medical clinic which bore his name, and Chief of Surgery at Tulane Medical School, one of the most respected medical schools of the day. The doctor was Alton Ochsner, M.D., of New Orleans. Ochsner’s offer to Dr. Sherman was considerable. She would be a partner in Ochsner’s clinic, the head of her own cancer laboratory, and, to keep her place in the academic side of medicine, she would be an Associate Professor at Tulane Medical School. Additionally, she would also have the personal support of one of the most politically powerful and well-connected doctors in America, a conduit for a constant flow of research funds. Again single, Mary moved to New Orleans in 1952, and took up residence on historic St. Charles Avenue, near the corner of Louisiana Avenue. There she lived until her death in 1964, juggling her jobs at Tulane and Ochsner’s, doing surgery at Charity Hospital, and working on the medical staff of several children’s hospitals. But as doctors went, she was always more comfortable in a laboratory than an operating room. Mary’s career prospered. One of the clear marks of professional success for an orthopedic surgeon is to be elected to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. It takes years, if not decades. Some never make it. Once in the academy, the ladder continues. The bright stars get put on Committees which make the rules about science and ethics. They establish what is acceptable and who is accepted. The brightest of the stars chair these Committees. One of the most prestigious is the Pathology Committee, which reviews the state of the art on disease itself, particularly bone cancers.

Mary Sherman was Chairman of the Pathology Committee of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. Her position took her around the world. When the great wizards of medicine realized the very language which they used to describe and categorize cancers of the bone and soft tissue needed to be re-examined, they chose six of the nation’s leading experts to tackle the task, including Dr. Mary Sherman.5 When the front page of the newspaper had the sad task of announcing her death, it described her as “an internationally known bone specialist” whose main area of interest was “bone cancer treatment and research.”6 So our question remains: What would motivate an accomplished medical professional to risk her reputation by getting involved in an underground medical laboratory with a violent political zealot owning a criminal record of sexual misconduct and with no medical credentials? Was she led there by her own ambition? Was there a dark side to her concealed from public view? Was she simply manipulated by more powerful forces? Or was there a medical problem brewing that was so serious that it was worth the risk? The basic storyline went like this: At approximately four o’clock in the morning a neighbor smelled smoke and called the police. His name was Juan Valdez. The police checked the building and found one apartment filled with smoke. The police called the fire department. When the firefighters arrived, they removed a smoking mattress from the apartment. Within minutes the police searched the apartment and found the badly burned body of a woman that had been stabbed repeatedly. An investigator from the Coroner’s office arrived and checked the scene. Then the NOPD homicide team arrived. No murder weapon was found, but a large knife was missing from the knife rack in the kitchen. Her body was removed to the Coroner’s office, where it was identified by another doctor. Homicide detectives said the front door to her apartment had been forced open, her wallet was empty, and her 1961 automobile was missing … Sam Moran, Special Investigator for the Orleans Parish Coroner’s office, said the front door had been forced open and an unsuccessful attempt had been made to open a jewelry box. Between the two papers, each of which ran three articles on their first day of coverage, the burglary motive was stated or referenced about twenty times, including several references to the fact that Dr. Sherman’s apartment had been burglarized before.

The burglary angle is so strong that the NOPD precinct captain complained to the press about “the departmental manpower shortage” in response to criticisms of “inadequate police protection in the neighborhood.” It would not be until the next day, after a horrified city had literally millions of word-of-mouth discussions about the sensational murder/burglary, before the newspapers stated that the front door had not been forced open and her burglar alarm had been turned off. The press now reported that the homicide department, impressed by these facts, and the facts that “the intruder” knew which car belonged to Dr. Sherman and that a box full of jewelry which could have easily been carried off was left behind, ruled out burglary as a motive. The first-day coverage continued with the standard biographical information about education and employment. Additionally, we learn that Dr. Sherman was a widow living alone, that she loved flowers, that her neighbors described her as “wonderful” and “thoughtful,” and that her housekeeper said she was expecting a lady friend for a visit that evening. The most striking thing about the living room, however, is a pastel painting hung in a prominent position. In the foreground of the painting is the fear-gripped face of a woman clutching her throat. A series of smaller sketches in the background depict a Roman warrior stabbing a woman with his sword. Mrs. Levy [a neighbor who lived beneath Dr. Sherman for 12 years] … usually heard Dr. Sherman when [she] came in at night, but last night she went to bed early and didn’t hear anything…. “If there had been a loud commotion, I know I would have heard it,” Mrs. Levy said. “The doctor was quiet, but I always heard her come in and take off her shoes, then padding around in her slippers. Sometimes I remarked to my husband, ‘Doc’s home again.’” On the second press day the case was referred to as “a mutilation slaying,” to which NOPD Captain Stevens added, “Obviously some perverted mind was involved.” The police were looking for a psychopath, perhaps one of her patients. The newspapers reported a “mysterious telephone caller” who had called several of Dr. Sherman’s close friends to say, “You’re next.” The voice was male. Other developments were reported: Her car was found eight blocks away. A palm print was recovered from the car, but could not be identified. The car key was recovered from a neighboring lawn.
