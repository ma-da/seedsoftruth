Life becomes an exchange of energy between you and the universal soul that is allowed to play out without judgment, and is experienced without fear. **This is the underlying meaning of unconditional love: to experience life in all its manifestations as a single, unified intelligence that responds perfectly to the projected image of each soul. ** It is for this reason that when you project gratitude, regardless of circumstance or condition, life becomes increasingly supportive in opening you to further awakening your sacred intentions. This feeling of gratitude coupled with the mental concept of appreciation is expressed like an invisible message in all directions and at all times. In this particular context, gratitude is the overarching motive behind all forms of expression to which humanity aspires. Every breath, every word, every touch, every thought is centered on expressing this sense of gratitude; a gratitude that you are sovereign and supported by a universal soul that expresses itself through all forms and manifestations of life with the sole objective of creating the ideal reality to fully awaken your sacred intentions and to transform your entire being into divine essence. It is this specific form of gratitude that accelerates the awakening of your sacred intentions and their inherent ability to integrate your body, mind, heart, and soul, and to transform your ability to perceive and express from the place of divine essence. Time is the primary factor that distorts the otherwise clear connection between the individual and the Divine. Time establishes separation of experience. This creates doubt in the Divine's system of fairness and overarching purpose. This doubt, in turn, creates fear that the universe is not a mirror but rather a chaotic, whimsical energy. Time intervenes to create pockets of despair, hopelessness, and abandonment. However, it is these very \"pockets\" that often motivate awakening the sacred intentions of your soul, as they cause you to seek a more intimate and harmonious relationship with the Divine. When you choose to align with divine essence and to live from this perspective as part of an ever-unfolding reality, you attract a natural state of harmony. This does not necessarily mean that your life is without problems or discomforts; rather it signifies a perception that there is an integral purpose in what life reveals. In other words, **life experience is meaningful to the extent that you choose to live in natural harmony with the multidimensional aspects of divine essence.

Establishing a relationship with the universe through the outflow of gratitude attracts life experience that is deeply transformative - experience that is richly devoted to uncovering life's deepest meaning and most formative purpose. **The Emergence of Divine Essence** Through the ongoing application of these principles of transformation, divine intelligence increasingly permeates your soul, and your soul becomes the identity of your entire being. Thus, identity is transformed, and in the wake of this transformation, divine essence unifies your entire being with your soul, and your soul with divine intelligence. It is this unification and shift of identity that is the explicit purpose of these life principles. If there is any other intention or objective, these principles will remain misunderstood and their catalytic powers will remain dormant. **It is the perspective of divine essence that all life is pure love in its fullest expression, and that in this single concept, all life is conceived and forever exists.** This becomes the core belief from which all other beliefs arise. And as these beliefs expand outward, this core belief system emerges with a clear intent of supporting a fundamental perspective of seeing, nurturing, and appreciating the universe as the divine cradle from which all life is created and evolves. These principles of transformation are merely symbols represented in words and served to you as a potential recipe to stir awake the embers of light that tirelessly burn within. There are no specific techniques or rituals that are required to invoke their power. They are simply perspectives. In a real sense, they are sacred intentions that attract experience that expands consciousness. They do not provide quick fixes or instant realizations. They are amplifiers of personal will and intention that clarify how one lives. Their transformative power is contained exclusively in the intent of their application. Through these principles, you can become a master of empowering your deeper self. In the past, boundaries were set, secrets were kept, and your light was subdued simply because your perception of external, hierarchical controls created in you fear of the unknown and of the mystical practices of transformed souls.

Each individual on Earth is exploring in a physical body new ways of experiencing life. Through this process of discovery, each of us is developing a deeper level of understanding of life and a greater ability to express our divine essence. This divine essence is the fullest expression of each individual's soul, and most closely exemplifies the Divine's capabilities therein. Divine essence is a level of divine awareness that was \"seeded\" within each soul when it was initially conceived by the Divine. It is also the natural state of the soul that has removed itself from the controlling aspects of hierarchical belief systems through the complete awakening of its sacred intentions. All souls are in various stages of transformation, and all are destined to attain a level of conscious awareness of divine essence as their sacred intentions are fully awakened. **The self-enlightenment experience is initiated by the realization that you are capable of direct access to the Divine.** This is the realization that the wisdom of the Divine can be discovered deep within your own soul. In other words, your body, complete with its physical, emotional, and mental capabilities, is not the repository of your sacred intentions. Nor is it able to reach out and access this divine inner calling which tirelessly beckons, inviting you towards the glorious joy of ever deeper connection with All That Is. It is the soul that is the harbor of your divine essence. And it is the soul that is the vehicle of access to the awakening of your sacred intentions, which opens the door to self-enlightenment through the integration of your body, mind, heart, and soul. Through opening to meaningful connection not only with your own divine essence, but with that of all living beings, the experience of profound personal transformation eventually triggers the realization that perceived reality is the Divine personified in the form of individual preferences. Thus when your sacred intentions are fully awakened, divine reality and your perception of reality become inseparable as the wind and the air. This confluence is only completely realized through the full enlightenment experience, which is unlike anything known within human experience. There have been those upon Earth who have experienced a shallow breath of wind from this powerful tempest. Some have called it ascension; others have attributed names like illumination, nirvana, and cosmic consciousness. While these experiences are profound by human standards, they are only the initial stirrings of divine essence as it becomes increasingly adept at touching and awakening the remote edges of its existence. What most would define as the ultimate bliss is merely an impression of their divine essence whispering to its outposts of form and nudging them to look within to the roots of existence, and to unite with the formless", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakers1.txt:0:75d08b641e5f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15630, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakers1.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakers1", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "have attributed names like illumination, nirvana, and cosmic consciousness. While these experiences are profound by human standards, they are only the initial stirrings of divine essence as it becomes increasingly adept at touching and awakening the remote edges of its existence. What most would define as the ultimate bliss is merely an impression of their divine essence whispering to its outposts of form and nudging them to look within to the roots of existence, and to unite with the formless and limitless divine intelligence that pervades all. The full enlightenment experience is far beyond the scope of the human drama, much like the stars in the sky are beyond the touch of Earth. We can see the stars with our human eyes, but we will never touch them with our human hands. Similarly, we can dimly foresee the enlightenment experience, but we cannot fully experience it as humans. It is accessed through the wholeness of the soul, for it is only in wholeness that the soul's sacred intentions and their catalytic effect of divine perception can be fully experienced. This level of wholeness is attained only when the individual consciousness has separated from time and is able to view its existence in timelessness. Nevertheless, the human experience is essential in facilitating the self-enlightenment experience and causing it to trigger - like a metamorphosis - the integration of your formful identities into divine essence. Self-enlightenment is the next stage of perception and expression for your soul. It is initiated when you choose to design your life based upon principles that are symbolic of the Divine. **As you become increasingly responsive to the Divine, you naturally gravitate towards life principles that symbolically express the formative principles of divine creation. ** The below principles are divine templates of creation. They are designed to help you experience life from the perspective of divine essence. They are principles that construct opportunities for the integration of your formless and formful identities. They are bridges through which you can access the experience of wholeness by perceiving with your divine essence. There is a wide range of means that can facilitate the self-enlightenment experience and disengage the soul from external controls. Inasmuch as the means may vary, the intent behind the means is quite narrowly defined as the intent to expand into a state of integration whereby all aspects of your conscious self become increasingly aligned with your divine essence. **There are three particular life principles that help to align your perspective with the perspective of divine essence and thus inspire the self-enlightenment experience. ** They are: **1) Seeing the Divine in all 2) Nurturance of life ** ** 3) Gratitude** When you apply these principles, a deeper meaning will be revealed to the seemingly random events of your life experience - both in the personal and universal contexts. **Seeing the Divine in All** This is the principle", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakers1.txt:1:635072bf7e4d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15631, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakers1.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakers1", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "divine essence. **There are three particular life principles that help to align your perspective with the perspective of divine essence and thus inspire the self-enlightenment experience. ** They are: **1) Seeing the Divine in all 2) Nurturance of life ** ** 3) Gratitude** When you apply these principles, a deeper meaning will be revealed to the seemingly random events of your life experience - both in the personal and universal contexts. **Seeing the Divine in All** This is the principle that the Divine is present and can be seen everywhere and in all manifestations of life. It is interwoven in all things like an intricate mosaic whose pieces adhere to the same wall, and are thus unified. However, it is not the picture that unifies the mosaic, but the underlying wall upon which its pieces adhere. Similarly, the Divine paints a picture so diverse and seemingly unrelated that there appears to be no unification. Yet it is not the outward manifestations that unify. It is the inward center of divine energy upon which the pieces of diversity are layered that unifies all life. This centerpiece of divine energy is the collective storehouse of all life within the universe. It is the full expression of the Divine, which invests itself in all forms through the projection of its divine intelligence into all manifestations of life. Thus, divine intelligence - acting as an extension of the Divine - is the unifying energy that is the \"wall\" upon which all the pieces of life's mosaic adhere. **Seeing the Divine in all is the principle that all manifestations of life convey an expression of All That Is.** It does not matter how far the unifying energy has been distorted or corrupted; the Divine can be observed. It is the action of perceiving the unification of energy even when the outward manifestations appear random, distorted, or chaotic. It is the realization that all life flows from one divine energy source that links one to All and all to One. When every manifestation of life can be genuinely perceived as a fragmentary expression of All That Is, the vibration of equality that underlies all life becomes perceptible to you. You realize that life initially emerges as an extension of the Divine, and then, as an individuated energy frequency invested within a form. This individuated energy vibrates, in its pure, timeless state, precisely the same for all manifestations of life. This is the common ground that all life shares. This is the tone or vibration of equality that can be observed within all life forms that unifies all expressions of diversity to the very foundation of existence. If you are able to look upon any and all forms of life with the outlook of equality, then you are seeing the Divine in all. While this may seem like an abstract concept, it is actualized through the practice", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakers1.txt:2:13f781d80ae9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15632, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakers1.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakers1", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "manifestations of life.

If you are able to look upon any and all forms of life with the outlook of equality, then you are seeing the Divine in all. While this may seem like an abstract concept, it is actualized through the practice of looking for both the outward and inward manifestations of the Divine. In a very real sense, you expect to observe the workings of divine intelligence in every facet of your experience. The principle of seeing the Divine in all is the unassailable expectation that everything is in its rightful position, performing its rightful function, and serving its purpose to activate the fullest expression of its life in the present moment. It is the outlook that all life is in a state of optimal realization and experience regardless of condition or circumstance. It is the perception that life is perfect in its expression because it flows from perfection, and that no matter how divergent its manifestations are, all life is an extension of the Divine. In light of the obvious turmoil and destruction that are apparent on Earth, this is an outlook or perception that may seem naive. How can life - in all its forms and expressions - be perceived as optimal or perfect? This is the great paradox of life, and it cannot be reconciled with your mental or emotional capabilities. It can only be understood in the context of the soul, which is deathless, timeless, limitless, and sovereign. Paradoxes exist because the human drama is too limited in scope and scale to allow a perception of wholeness to illuminate how the pieces of the puzzle are perfectly interconnected in the ever-unfolding divine cosmic dance. The human drama is circumscribed by the dimensions of time and space and the elements of energy and matter. It is played out upon the stages of survival and dysfunctional behavior because of the methods of controlling information and manipulating conditions used by those operating within the [hierarchical paradigm](https://www.weboflove.org/divinewisdomunderstanding). The soul within the human body is largely unexpressed and underutilized in this human drama, and therefore, life's apparent perversions and imperfections are seen in isolation as impediments to perfection rather than perfection itself. **Life is perfect in its resolve to expand and express an intelligence that is limitless. This is the fundamental purpose of life in all its diverse manifestations. ** The presence of the Divine expressing itself as a vibration of equality can be seen in all things. Sensory input derived from the human body is limited to frequencies in specific ranges that only convey an echo of this divine vibration. **The divine resonance of all life is understood only through deliberate", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakers1.txt:3:758ac5fd8b64", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15633, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakers1.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakers1", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "**Life is perfect in its resolve to expand and express an intelligence that is limitless.

Sensory input derived from the human body is limited to frequencies in specific ranges that only convey an echo of this divine vibration. **The divine resonance of all life is understood only through deliberate and focused contemplation of the equality inherent in all things, and through the ability to penetrate beyond the image of a thing to the origin of the image. ** These insights stimulate a new sensory system beyond the five senses that rule the physical world. These new senses are an outgrowth of the awakening of your sacred intentions. They are manifestations of the first stage of the self-enlightenment experience. **With this new perceptual ability, you will be capable of sensing not only the presence of the Divine, but also the timeless divine essence within all life that is individualized and uniquely separate from the Divine. ** Calling forth the divine perceptions of the soul within your own being is the ideal method to access a lasting sensitivity to the divine vibration. This is how you develop the ability to see the Divine in all. It is not only that the Divine is found within you and within every individual manifestation of life; it is also in itself the wholeness of all life. Thus, this principle calls for seeing the Divine in all its diverse forms of manifestation, as well as in the wholeness of life itself. **Nurturance of Life** Life, in this definition, is an individual's sovereign reality. It is subjective and impressionable. Life is the wholeness of experience flowing past the individual's field of perception in the present moment. There is never a closure to life, nor a final chapter written. It is eternal, not so much in the abstract sense of never ending or beginning, but rather in the real sense that life is ever expanding in order to express divine intelligence in all realities within the universe. Nurturance of life is the principle whereby an individual is in alignment with the natural expansion of intelligence inherent within all life. This alignment enhances the life energy that flows past the individual with the clear intent of gentle support. **It is the action of opening to the highest motive in all people and in all life and supporting the flow of this highest intention towards its ultimate expression. **In so doing, the action is performed without judgment, analysis, or attachment to outcome. It involves simply nurturing the highest energy that flows from all people and all beings, and thus supporting the fullest expression of their deepest essence.

It involves simply nurturing the highest energy that flows from all people and all beings, and thus supporting the fullest expression of their deepest essence. This is a departure from the normal perception that nurturing support can only be granted when others are in alignment with your personal will and desires. When, instead, you view everything in your life as an integrated energy flowing as an expression of ever-expanding divine intelligence, all life is honored as an extension of the Divine. In this context, there is no energy that is misdirected or unworthy of support and nurturance. While this may seem contrary to the evidence of abusive energy upon the Earth, even energy that is laden with \"evil intent\" is nevertheless energy that is flowing outward in search of a higher expression. All people and all forms of life can be nurtured and supported to their highest expression. This is the fundamental purpose of this principle. It is greatly facilitated by the intention to perceive the original motive and ultimate expression of life energy as it passes through your field of awareness. **Energy is an element of life that is so subtly interwoven with form that it is one, in much the same manner as space and time are inextricably linked in union.** Energy is a motive. It is intelligent beyond the mind's ability to reason. While it is a force that can be subject to applications that deny its highest expression, energy is always imbuing life with the motive to expand and evolve. Life energy is always in a state of becoming. It is never static or regressive in its natural state. You are very capable of nurturing this natural expansion of energy to forge new channels of expression and experience. **In fact, it is your primary purpose to expand the life energy that encircles your personal reality, and to transform it to new levels of expression that more clearly reflect the perspective of divine essence. ** There are many specific actions that can be taken to nurture life. Each soul has the innate ability to transform energy through a tremendous variety of means. Working through your body, your soul is able to collect and store energy and redirect its purpose or application. This transformation of energy can occur on both personal and universal levels of expression. That is, within an individual's field of awareness at any time, energy can be transformed to conform more to a vision of personal welfare, or aligned with a vision of universal welfare and goodwill. One of the best methods to transform energy is through exploring one's belief system. **All", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakers1.txt:5:964d5c71df85", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15635, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakers1.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakers1", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "your body, your soul is able to collect and store energy and redirect its purpose or application.

One of the best methods to transform energy is through exploring one's belief system. **All beliefs have energy systems that act like birthing chambers for the manifestation of your perceived reality.** Within these energy systems are currents that direct life experience. Your soul is aware of these currents either consciously or unconsciously and allows them to carry you into realms of experience that engage your core belief system. By cultivating beliefs that expand and transform energy, you are more able to explore energy systems that are nurturing to life in all its myriad forms. When your beliefs are clearly defined as intentions - as preferred states of being - your life energy engages more fully in the present moment. Your energy system becomes inseparable from your being and woven into your spirit like a thread of light. **[Clarity of intention](https://www.weboflove.org/lifepurposeintentions) is essential to engaging the energy system of your core beliefs, and to allowing the nurturance of life to prevail in all activities. ** The nurturance of life is essential to both personal and collective realities within the universe, which contains all realities that are interlinked like threads of an infinitely expanding fabric. Thus, as you awaken to your own creative power to transform life energy outside of yourself and enhance it with the clear intent of gentle support, you naturally experience ever-unfolding transformation within yourself as well. You become an increasingly clear beacon of the Divine and the architect of a new paradigm based upon the intention to nurture all life in the universe. **Gratitude ** This principle is based on the understanding that the universe represents a collective intelligence that can be personalized as a single universal soul - a composite expression of the Divine. Thus, in this perspective, there are only two souls in the entire cosmos: the individual soul and the universal soul. Inasmuch as the individual is impressionable and constantly changing to adapt to new information, so is the universal soul, which is a dynamic, living template of potential energies and experiences that are coherent and as knowable as a friend's personality and behavior. The universal soul is responsive to the individual soul and its beliefs and perceptions. It is like a composite omni-personality that is imbued with divine intelligence and responds to the perceptions and belief systems of the individual like a pool of water mirrors the image that overshadows it. **Everyone is indeed, at their innermost core, a sovereign soul that can transform themselves into an instrument of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakers1.txt:6:8f83349524c5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15636, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakers1.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakers1", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "and experiences that are coherent and as knowable as a friend's personality and behavior. The universal soul is responsive to the individual soul and its beliefs and perceptions. It is like a composite omni-personality that is imbued with divine intelligence and responds to the perceptions and belief systems of the individual like a pool of water mirrors the image that overshadows it. **Everyone is indeed, at their innermost core, a sovereign soul that can transform themselves into an instrument of divine essence.** However, this transformation is dependent on whether the individual chooses to project an image of divine essence upon the \"mirror\" of the universal soul, or to project a lesser image that is a distortion of its essential state of being. The principle of gratitude is primarily concerned with consciously designing your self-image through an appreciation of the universal soul's supportive mirror. In other words, the universal soul is a partner in shaping reality's expression in your life. If you choose to project a transformed image upon the mirror of the universal soul, reality gradually becomes an internal process of creation that is increasingly free of external controls and conditions. This process involves an interchange of supportive energy between the individual and the universal soul. This energy is best applied through an appreciation of how perfect and exacting this interchange occurs in every moment of life. If you are aware - or at least interested in having the awareness - of how perfectly the Divine, as expressed in the form of the universal soul, supports your sovereign reality, there is a powerful and natural sense of gratitude that flows from you to the Divine. **It is this wellspring of gratitude that opens wide the channel of support from the Divine to the individual and establishes a collaboration of purpose to transform the individual soul into a pure expression of divine essence. ** It is principally gratitude - which arises naturally through appreciation of how the relationship between the individual and the universal soul operates - that opens you to connection with your divine essence, and to your eventual transformation into the state of perception and expression of divine essence. The relationship of the individual with the universal soul is essential to cultivate and nurture, because this relationship, more than anything else, determines how accepting each individual is of life's myriad forms and manifestations. When you accept changes in your sovereign reality as the shifting persona of the universal soul, you live in greater harmony with life itself. Life becomes an exchange of energy between you and the universal soul that is allowed to play out without judgment, and is experienced without fear. **This is the underlying meaning of unconditional love: to experience life in all its manifestations as a single, unified intelligence that responds perfectly to the projected image of each soul. ** It is for this reason that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakers1.txt:7:7f1816b87377", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15637, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakers1.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakers1", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "sovereign reality as the shifting persona of the universal soul, you live in greater harmony with life itself.

This feeling of gratitude coupled with the mental concept of appreciation is expressed like an invisible message in all directions and at all times. In this particular context, gratitude is the overarching motive behind all forms of expression to which humanity aspires. Every breath, every word, every touch, every thought is centered on expressing this sense of gratitude; a gratitude that you are sovereign and supported by a universal soul that expresses itself through all forms and manifestations of life with the sole objective of creating the ideal reality to fully awaken your sacred intentions and to transform your entire being into divine essence. It is this specific form of gratitude that accelerates the awakening of your sacred intentions and their inherent ability to integrate your body, mind, heart, and soul, and to transform your ability to perceive and express from the place of divine essence. Time is the primary factor that distorts the otherwise clear connection between the individual and the Divine. Time establishes separation of experience. This creates doubt in the Divine's system of fairness and overarching purpose. This doubt, in turn, creates fear that the universe is not a mirror but rather a chaotic, whimsical energy. Time intervenes to create pockets of despair, hopelessness, and abandonment. However, it is these very \"pockets\" that often motivate awakening the sacred intentions of your soul, as they cause you to seek a more intimate and harmonious relationship with the Divine. When you choose to align with divine essence and to live from this perspective as part of an ever-unfolding reality, you attract a natural state of harmony. This does not necessarily mean that your life is without problems or discomforts; rather it signifies a perception that there is an integral purpose in what life reveals.

Establishing a relationship with the universe through the outflow of gratitude attracts life experience that is deeply transformative - experience that is richly devoted to uncovering life's deepest meaning and most formative purpose. **The Emergence of Divine Essence** Through the ongoing application of these principles of self-enlightenment, divine intelligence increasingly permeates your soul, and your soul becomes the identity of your entire being. Thus, identity is transformed, and in the wake of this transformation, divine essence unifies your entire being with your soul, and your soul with divine intelligence. It is this unification and shift of identity that is the explicit purpose of these life principles. If there is any other intention or objective, these principles will remain misunderstood and their catalytic powers will remain dormant. **It is the perspective of divine essence that all life is pure love in its fullest expression, and that in this single concept, all life is conceived and forever exists.** This becomes the core belief from which all other beliefs arise. And as these beliefs expand outward, this core belief system emerges with a clear intent of supporting a fundamental perspective of seeing, nurturing, and appreciating the universe as the divine cradle from which all life is created and evolves. These principles of self-enlightenment are merely symbols represented in words and served to you as a potential recipe to stir awake the embers of light that tirelessly burn within. There are no specific techniques or rituals that are required to invoke their power. They are simply perspectives. In a real sense, they are sacred intentions that attract experience that expands consciousness. They do not provide quick fixes or instant realizations. They are amplifiers of personal will and intention that clarify how one lives. Their transformative power is contained exclusively in the intent of their application. Through these principles, you can become a master of empowering your deeper self. In the past, boundaries were set, secrets were kept, and your light was subdued simply because your perception of external, hierarchical controls created in you fear of the unknown and of the mystical practices of transformed souls.

They represent a version of humanity that has comprehension of the universal systems that govern existence, or at least the laws of time and space. This understanding permits the WingMakers to travel back in time and interact with humankind at various points in its evolutionary pathway. I would speculate that WingMakers have--throughout history--been variously referred to as angels, gods, spirit guides, and, in some instances, extra-terrestrials. They imply that they are adept at subtly interacting with humankind in order to evolve its understanding of the cosmological environment in which life evolves and transforms. After successfully decoding the first of 23 segments of the optical disc left in the 23rd chamber, I will share a small excerpt of their introduction as it were: \"You may refer to us as WingMakers. We are most often confused with angels, though we are actually quite human--just a future, perhaps more advanced, version. Humans, conditioned as they are, seem unable or unwilling to comprehend the vast diversity of living beings amongst the cosmological planes of existence, and so, somewhat as a defense mechanism, lump together what are distinctly unique beings. The angelic kingdom is a different species of life when compared to the human or the WingMakers' format of existence. WingMakers exist outside of time's focus, while their human, extraterrestrial, and angelic counterparts exist within, and, to various degrees, are bound by the principles of time. Our uniqueness stems from our ability to operate independently of time while remaining human with all the physical and mental characteristics therein.\" WingMakers and their existence appear to be woven into virtually all cultures and civilizations upon earth, and appear to be commonly represented through mythological and religious stories. Their stated purpose is to be the Culture Bearers bringing the seeds of language, art, philosophy, scientific reasoning, and spiritual understanding to the human race throughout time. Apparently, they perform this duty without recognition, preferring to be unknown until the time is ripe to present themselves and their specific mission. I think we have to assume, based on the available data, that WingMakers operate at the pinnacle of human existence since they are interactive time travelers. Their interaction with humans seems limited to select individuals, who, during their dream state are more accepting of new ideas and insights. These insights often filter into the contactee's waking life in the form of inventions and sudden discoveries.

These insights often filter into the contactee's waking life in the form of inventions and sudden discoveries. In rare instances, I believe WingMakers will even physically appear, but owing to the time-shift from which they come, their bodies would appear to be constructed of light, and their communication, if there was any, is most likely telepathic. According to the records of the Ancient Arrow site, it was the WingMakers who originally seeded life upon earth and facilitated life's evolutionary leaps and biological transformations. They (and we, according to them) originated from the star system Pleiades. They came as the human genotype, and brought with them a library of genetic codes that, through experimentation, produced the human species, and of course, most other forms of life on earth. Through their time-travel technology they have planted time capsules from their future time, which they hope will provide a sense of connection to our future selves and an understanding of human destiny. They seem to be particularly interested in helping present-day humans build a global culture. One of their more outlandish claims is that they essentially seeded the concept of the Internet for the purpose of developing this global culture. They believe the Internet will somehow become the platform upon which their time capsules will be fully launched into the mainstream of the world's citizens. They predict (and I use this word with chilling precision) that by the time their final time capsule is discovered in 2023, the Internet will be the focal point of the new global culture and it will become the gateway to a connected \"intra-galactic, digital nervous system\". They refer to this global culture as the Sovereign Integral, which is difficult to translate into English. However, Drs. Stevens and Whitehall believe it means that the global culture of earth will be both developed and distributed through the Internet, and that this global connectivity will enable earth to be integrated with other planets in our galaxy through an extension of this network. They use the example of earth as being a node on a cosmological network, and the Sovereign Integral is simply the earth's global culture presented to the galaxy in a way that it can harmonize with the other planetary \"nodes.\" I know this seems like science fiction, but then, I remind each of you that we are talking about a group of advanced humans who have developed interactive time-travel technology that has alluded us for over 30 years.

The artifacts in the AA time capsule, and indeed, the time capsule itself, are clear evidence of this group's advanced technology, and I believe their predictions should be taken as more than mere speculation or clairvoyance. Our biggest concerns, relative to the time capsule itself, have to do with the accuracy of our translations. Their language incorporates visual art, music, poetry, and various hieroglyphs and symbols that collectively communicate their thoughts and ideas. In other words, their language is a multidimensional puzzle, and we are convinced that they are communicating much more than mere words and standard ideas. A recent issue that has arisen concerns project security. Several of our linguistics specialists have become obsessed with decoding the messages in the time capsule, and have been asked to leave the project out of concern for their stability. Anything -- no matter how subtle -- that could compromise the project's security, has been dealt with in an expedite manner. However, this heightened sense of security also has its peculiar issues. All of you are aware of the Judas Effect, as described by Col. Richards. When security reaches a certain tempo and pitch, its breach is almost predictable, because those in the inner circle cannot effectively deal with the pressures. Unfortunately, because of the breadth of this project, we have had to bring in personnel with clearances as low as 6x. We are using our memory protocols with good results, and document-management systems have never been more secure, thanks to the Minyaur technology, but nonetheless, we all have to remain extremely vigilant to maintain utmost security befitting a 12x project. In the time I have been the Director of Special Projects, I have never seen a project worthier of our collective vigilance. Enough about my concerns. Let me go into some detail about our findings to date. If our interpretation is accurate, the WingMakers have placed 6 additional time capsules strategically located on the planet, which will be discovered in a certain sequence, probably by ordinary citizens entirely unaware of what they are stumbling upon. We assume these \"discoveries\" are actually orchestrated by the WingMakers. At this time, it is impossible to determine whether these locations can be discerned through the existing Ancient Arrow site. There remain dozens of petroglyphs and hieroglyphic symbols yet to be deciphered -- any number of which could point the way to the other time capsules. From everything we are able to discern, there appears to be no intended threat by the WingMakers to national", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__Sauthers.txt:2:b789e7a2a47c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15643, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__Sauthers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__Sauthers", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "what they are stumbling upon.

From everything we are able to discern, there appears to be no intended threat by the WingMakers to national security, social order, or economic stability. However, all we know at this time is that the Ancient Arrow site is imbued with wall paintings and various artifacts, most of which have yet to be understood by our technicians and decoders. Our only success to date was the unlocking of the optical disc that appears to be their \"calling card\". At best, we know how they want to be thought of. Culture Bearers is the closest definition we have been able to apply to their intentions thus far. Dr. Stevens is quite convinced that the WingMakers interacted with a pre-historic Native American tribe known as the Anasazi, which were known to inhabit that area of northern New Mexico. Carbon dating places the paints used on the cavern walls at approximately AD 840, which coincides with the flowering of the Anasazi culture. It is interesting to note that, according to Dr. Stevens, the Anasazi Indians mysteriously disappeared about 200 years later. We cannot say if there is any connection or cause for alarm. Having decoded most of the text contained on the optical disc, we have concluded that if their intentions are hostile, WingMakers could, at their complete discretion, time-travel to any of our military installations and deliver a fatal blow to national security. Their signature technology appears to be time-travel, not weapons of mass destruction, and as we all know, there is no imagined technology more advanced than interactive time-travel. We are trying to ascertain if any of the artifacts could also be a communication or signaling device that would draw the WingMakers back to our time. The odd thing is, however, that they could be visiting us every day and then re-writing history so we forget their visit. It is a virtual certainty that they are aware of our discovery of the time capsule, and may be aware of much more. It is even considered a possibility that they are helping us in the discovery process. There have been several events where a certain insight came upon the research team that seemed inexplicable, but then, it is easy to be paranoid when dealing with such an awe-invoking technology as BST. The materials within the time capsule seem to indicate a race of cultured people who are relatively small in number.

The materials within the time capsule seem to indicate a race of cultured people who are relatively small in number. If our deciphering tables are as accurate as we believe them to be, WingMakers are a select tribe or faction of humanity in the middle part of the 28th century, who have combined science, philosophy, and art into a unified \"religion\" and language. They are unique among their peers, and it would seem they are the equivalent of a secret society, not unlike the [Chakobsa](http://www.wingmakers.us/added/chakobsan_secret_language_royalty..htm) (perhaps even like us -- though they're much better artists). I will provide another excerpt from the optical disc, which provides a bit more insight on the mission of the WingMakers. This particular excerpt was translated from the text of the optical disc, and represents one of our first breakthroughs in deciphering their language with alphabetic granularity. Of course, we cannot say with any certainty that the translation is one hundred percent accurate, but we believe it is close. \"Culture-building is the primary focus of the WingMakers because it is understood to have such a significant bearing on the world of spirit and cosmological transformation. Culture-building, by definition, integrates the values of individualism with the value of oneness. It is the goal of life, as it is related to a species, to evolve itself where it can be conscious of its diverse perceptions and expressions, and integrate them into a cohesive, all-inclusive culture. \"Humankind deeply desires such a culture; a global culture that recognizes and appreciates its constituent parts. This is one of the primary reasons that communication technologies have evolved so quickly upon earth in the 20th century. Through these technologies, the global culture can be more rapidly developed and experienced. And through this global culture, humankind will become increasingly sensitive to the spiritual inclinations of oneness. Not only oneness within the human species, but within the whole of life that embraces and envelopes the human species. \"WingMakers are aware that humankind is intricately connected to all other species and forms of life within the universe of wholeness. This connection is known as the Mind of God. It is more than simple inter-dependency as depicted in a food chain or ecosystem. It is the accumulative knowledge of Prime Creator achieved through absorbing the life experience of all life forms. This all-encompassing knowledge is shared willingly to all life forms, but is only comprehensible to those who have achieved an ability to step out of time. \"All of life, even the so-called evil and negative aspects, are part of an incalculably complex, but single-minded, cosmological organism devoted to the transformation of evolving life forms so", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__Sauthers.txt:4:336e68e2112d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15645, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__Sauthers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__Sauthers", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "depicted in a food chain or ecosystem.

This is the fundamental system that overarches all other systems of the multiverse, and it is for this fundamental reason that life exists.\" I think you will agree that these do not seem like the words of a warring race or hostile force. Indeed, they seem indicative of a philosophical group who has a very specific mission and the technology to see their mission through to completion. There are over 8,100 pages of text embedded within the optical disc, organized in 23 sections to coincide with each chamber of the AA site. Thus far, we have been successful in translating about 440 pages or about 5%. What we have translated is very encouraging. There are no references to anything that could be construed as hostile or aggressive in nature. To the contrary, its content is similar to what is included in these selected excerpts. It is very philosophical in nature; there are references to the new physics of time-travel and some interesting exposition about how the individual soul interacts with the multiverse or cosmological order. Much of the poetry, music, and visual art appear benign, but seem to have a powerful effect on those of the research team who were developing the translation tables. We are still testing our hypothesis in this matter, but our preliminary suspicions are that the WingMakers use an encoded language that has an effect on the subconscious mind of building holistic sensory perception in the cerebrospinal system. Which is to say that two of our best 12x linguistic experts claim to have improved mental acuity, visual perception, intuition, and creative skills as a direct result of working on the project. It is as though the very process of deciphering their language equips the mind with a new form of intelligence that can best be described as holistic and penetrating at the same time -- characteristics we have been trying to genetically engineer for over 15 years in the AdamSon Project. While we would like to retain the same experts on the project to expedite the translation, we have made a difficult decision to rotate the linguistics and decoding team every six months in an effort to reduce the undesirable side-effects of this new form of intelligence, which is zealousness. It seems that as the researchers' new intelligence is", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__Sauthers.txt:5:bb07f2a24c15", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15646, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__Sauthers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__Sauthers", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "penetrating at the same time -- characteristics we have been trying to genetically engineer for over 15 years in the AdamSon Project.

It seems that as the researchers' new intelligence is activated or somehow generated through the process of decoding the encoded language of the WingMakers, they become fervent believers in the perspective of the WingMakers and they lose their objectivity, and, as a consequence, become security risks. We have used the MI technology to remedy this situation with the effected personnel, but as we all know, this technology is not perfect, and memory reconstruction has been known to be successful under deep hypnosis. For the time being we are holding this course of action with extreme caution, and all effected or potentially effected personnel under 14x are under constant, invasive surveillance. Other contingencies -- less favorable to personnel -- are being discussed and will be used only under specific scenario triggers, which are still in the process of being agreed upon. Bill Ornstein, who most of you know, was the technical lead on the AdamSon Project, has proposed an excellent array of research tests that, we hope, can pinpoint the causative factors -- both physiologically and psychologically. I have already signed off on the budget and determined it as a 12x classified project reporting directly to me. Dr. Ornstein is developing the project's scope and sequence documentation and it may be ready for distribution at our next meeting. Now, back to the WingMakers, we believe their time-travel technology may be a synthesis of human consciousness and a bio-computer whose neural net is able to adjust dimensional sequencing with such precision that they can open, and, more amazingly, maintain a time window for an indefinite period. One thing all the scientists agree upon, is that the Ancient Arrow site was not created in a week's time. Dr. Arnison concludes that the site would have taken -- even with advanced excavation technology and a crew of 50 workers -- a minimum of three months to create. The 23 chambers of the AA site are carved using some form of a sound resonator technology, but in order to hollow out these chambers without collapsing the canyon wall would have required a slow and careful process. Also, there is no evidence of rock-chips left in the area, so it would have required them to bury the excavated rock some distance away as there are no suitable sites nearby to dispose of that amount of refuse. We believe one of the artifacts left behind in chamber 6 is an example of their sound resonator technology", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__Sauthers.txt:6:4898c79353de", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15647, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__Sauthers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__Sauthers", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "technology, but in order to hollow out these chambers without collapsing the canyon wall would have required a slow and careful process.

We believe one of the artifacts left behind in chamber 6 is an example of their sound resonator technology used to carve rock with sound frequencies. We have been successful thus far in activating its lowest frequencies, and we are quite certain that it is not equivalent to our ELF technology, and has limited military applications. However, we will continue the testing to see if we can access its high frequency range where it is assumed the tool cuts through rock or even metal alloys. None of the artifacts uncovered appear, to our investigation, to be a time-travel device. However, as said earlier, it is premature to draw closure on the peculiar nature of these artifacts. We are still searching for technologies, or combinations of technologies that will permit us to unlock these spectacular and enigmatic artifacts. We are relatively certain that these artifacts pose no threat to national security. They have all been thoroughly examined and are benign in weapons' grade material, at least, as we know them today. Molecular scans show evidence of trace amounts of human DNA -- not on the casing of the artifact, but inside. It is assumed that the artifacts are composite technologies using molecular-scaled CPUs, but we've been unable to ascertain how to disassemble any of them without potentially destroying them. Some of our research staff are growing impatient, and advocate sacrificing one of the artifacts for the purpose of looking inside in order to assess re-engineering pathways and enable us to better understand the remaining 22 artifacts. But that decision needs to be weighed very carefully. Up until now, we have remained patient. I think, however, that the time is approaching when we need to take additional risk. In total, there are 23 artifacts, one in each of the 23 chambers. We have kept all of this technology within the Labyrinth Group; no private-industry partners have been exposed to these technologies thus far. However, preliminary discussions are ongoing with Bell Labs' Cogent Group, and [Incunabula](http://www.incunabula.org/) Documents have been distributed to its Director of Research, Dr. Vaunderman. His team is expert in sound resonator technologies, and have been used by the ACIO in three previously classified projects with great success. Budgets are being developed over the next 30-days, and it is assumed that research would commence shortly thereafter.

However, as we all know, the likelihood an advanced race -- human or otherwise -- would ever disclose its time-travel technology is extremely remote. One more excerpt is probably relevant to this briefing memorandum. Again, it is from the same section of the optical disc referred to earlier, but is a more recent translation. \"It is the drama of life--as it unfolds in human culture--which reflects inwardly upon the cosmological multiverse. Human culture deeply effects the spirit world, and as your Einstein predicted, ripples touch the entire cosmos. It imprints upon the world of spirit a vital energy. An energy of love, passion, involvement, creativity, and perhaps most important, a sense of personal expression and bold individuality. This energy is precisely what balances the energy that drives a species to seek oneness with its Creator. \"The energy of the multiverse is like a giant funnel that delivers a species into the Mind of God, the only vessel of Prime Creator, who is otherwise unclothed and invisible. This funnel creates an overbearing drive for oneness and re-connection with the Mind of God in a developing species. In this drive for oneness, beings can forget their individuality. Their unique life experience could be forsaken for oneness if not for the experience of the physical, mental, and emotional involvement in building a separate, species-based culture. \"WingMakers have strategically placed time capsules upon earth that, when discovered, will facilitate the development of a global culture that represents humankind and earth, rather than a specific geography, race or philosophy. In parallel with this goal of culture building, is the goal to introduce new paradigms of existence. In the case of our first time capsule, it will introduce indisputable evidence that a time-shifted civilization visited earth and left its calling card. It will also--because it is the first one to be discovered in contemporary times--lead to the discovery of additional time capsules placed elsewhere on the planet by the WingMakers. \"These time capsules will eventually act as a communication bridge between contemporary humans and their future selves. The WingMakers will act as the responsible elder brother who returns to help the next two generations of humans build a global culture that prepares the human species to take its next evolutionary leap.

The human species is but one of a countless number of sentient life forms that unerringly grow and expand in diversity throughout the cosmos. It is but an atom in the Body of the Collective God. Within its consciousness, humankind is limited by its perception of the universe of wholeness by its over-reliance on the five senses. These senses are powerful forces that focus the human instrument on a separate reality much like a diver's mask can focus the diver on the underwater world. \"The time capsules we have left behind provide technology, art, and philosophy, indeed, an entire language that will, in time, develop two additional senses of the human instrument. The genetic composition of the human species was conceived to have 7 senses. You have, in recent times, begun to refer to the 6th sense or the sense of intuition. There is a 7th and most powerful sense, and it is the sense that is linked to time-travel, which is linked to space travel. \"However, before these two additional senses of the human instrument can be fully activated, there must be a global culture representing a unified and fully integrated earth. Our mission is to develop the specie's genetic capabilities to include these two new senses while simultaneously ensuring that a global culture is developed that unifies the human species under one leadership, one culture, and one pre-eminent philosophy. \"If this sounds like an improbable goal, we can assure you of its success because we live in the time when it is so. And if you need further proof of our mission, simply learn our language, and you will have your proof\" If the AA site is indeed a massively constructed time capsule from our future selves, it is the single most important discovery we have made.

Their wall paintings are clearly designed to convey a set of messages, and we know believe that their purpose may be to facilitate the unlocking of the optical disc, particularly since there appears to be no technological solution. Hence our efforts have been to try and construct a translation index so we can make some sense of the symbols and stories that are encoded within the paintings themselves. We also believe that the order of the paintings may have significance, so we are carefully reconstructing what we believe to be the original ordering of the 23 chambers. If the sequence is an important factor, and we believe it is, then we need to carefully assess the order in which these chambers were originally created. Presently, we have eight possible sequence scenarios for their creation, and we are working to narrow that to two or three if possible. The factors and relevant variables in our analysis are the following (in no particular order of importance): The wall painting's apparent story The wall painting's symbols The wall painting's colors and relative shapes The wall painting's star patterns The wall painting's geographical landmarks The wall painting's subject matter The wall painting's relative size The wall painting's relative order in the 23 chambers The wall painting's position on the chamber wall The wall painting's relative distance from each other The possible relationship between the wall painting and the artifacts in the chamber The possible relationship between the symbols within a particular wall painting and the pictographs and petroglyphs painted or carved around the Ancient Arrow site. Each of these factors is being weighted for their relative importance and impact in the design of our translation indexes. One thing that seems quite certain is that nothing has been constructed arbitrarily in the AA site. All the chambers, wall paintings, artifacts, pictographs, etc. seem to be designed as part of a master plan, and we're operating under the assumption that this master plan is a time capsule or communication bridge of some sort. We are three months into the development of our translation indexes, and our programming is proceeding smoothly. Our only glitch arises from the number of variables, which places our odds statistically speaking at about 1 in 6.5 million. As you know, these aren't good odds, even with our WSX technology.

But the weighting of the translation indexes will at least enable a priority ordering which will provide the focus we have, to date, lacked. From my past memo, you'll remember that most of our efforts these past six months were directed at the restoration of the site to its original condition. After a thorough cleaning, the wall paintings are remarkable for their brilliant color and detail, probably due to the arid environment and the fact that the paint materials themselves are chemical compounds our scientists have never seen. Presumably, these paints have superior, molecular bonding properties. We assume they're a derivative technology from the WingMakers. Now that site restoration is complete, our efforts are 100% focused on developing the translation software. We expect to be finished in approximately 45-60 days. Once the software is ready, we'll begin the process of elimination and priority weighting for the translation indexes. With a little luck, we'll be ready to test our first programs in early May. We're optimistic that our tests will prove successful in unlocking the optical disc. One note of caution, however, if we are successful in unlocking the disc and acquiring its contents, we should not assume that our translation indexes will be effective inside the disc. It is our hypothesis, that the translation indexes to acquire the content will be different from the indexes required to read the content. Obviously, this is speculation at this time, but I want to manage your expectations a little bit; this could be a long decoding process. For whatever reason, the WingMakers have encoded all of their communication and set-up technology barriers that make it virtually impregnable. I can't imagine what more we could do to acquire the content from the disc, but as always, if any of you have suggestions, please forward them to me. That's it for now.

I think for purposes of this memorandum, it would be better to begin with the description of the artifacts and then follow-up with a description of how we of the scientific core contemplate how the artifacts may be utilized in our current BST initiatives. CHAMBER PAINTINGS Attached you will find high-resolution, fully cropped, photographic copies of each of the 23 paintings discovered within the Ancient Arrow site. As most of you know, these paintings have not been fully decoded at this time. We've successfully decoded about 65% of the glyphs and symbolic structure of the paintings, but we believe that the glyphs represent only one, albeit significant, element of the total story behind each of the chambers. The paintings have incredible detail and their coloration is brilliant. Each of the chamber paintings has a similar color palette and artistic style. We have done a painstaking analysis of both contemporary and historical artists who have composed or painted in a similar style, and we have found none. This style is truly unique. While none of our scientists within the Labyrinth Group can claim to be an art critic, everyone who has seen the paintings first-hand have been utterly amazed at their color and detail. If you look closely at any particular area of the painting you will see details emerge that draw the eye further into the painting. I think one of the best ways to describe them is that they have a hypnotic effect on the viewer, even when viewed through photographs, but particularly when seen in person within the chambers themselves. About a third of the glyphs contained on the paintings can be traced to four different, extinct languages: [Chakobsan](http://www.wingmakers.us/added/chakobsan_secret_language_royalty..htm), Anasazi, Sumerian, and Mayan. However, the remaining glyphs have absolutely no corollary to any other pictographic language that we are aware of. Also, the glyphs found at the AA site were completely different than those found within the chamber paintings. It is interesting to note that the technology artifacts within chambers 2 and 5 contained glyphs represented in paintings found in chambers 1 and 7. There are also representative glyphs that are of a universal nature i.e., the spiral and concentric circles. These glyphs, while they seem similar to those found on various rock structures in Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico, they are more subtle in their line and the many have an incredibly detailed set of lines surrounding them that seem to be", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__stevens2.txt:0:a92261ffbefb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15654, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__stevens2.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__acio__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__acio__stevens2", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "note that the technology artifacts within chambers 2 and 5 contained glyphs represented in paintings found in chambers 1 and 7.

These lines have not been decoded, though Dr. Owens is convinced they are an integral part of their language. (Please note the attached samples with their closest corollaries in the Barrier Canyon and Classic Freemont styles.) We are certain that the paintings were completed using unspecified paints and an application technique requiring special tools. Chemical analyses of the paints show conclusively that hybrid compounds of selenium, gypsum, and jemsonite were used in all of the paintings. The same polymer coating that was applied throughout the interior of the AA site was also applied over the paintings. This was done in a single layer, and has cohesion about 100 times greater than our best derivatives formulated at our Donner Lab. The paintings were produced with an unusual, if not haunting, precision. They are perfectly rectangular, with sharp edges that seem meticulously prepared as if purposeful in its mathematical precision. However, we've not found any recognizable pattern in their geometric proportions or mathematical disclosures. Many of the paintings include depictions of the stars. We initially thought these were arbitrary representations, but Drs. Nolan and Richards have suggested otherwise. The consistent and telltale sign of the constellation Taurus and of particular interest, the 7th, or the lost cluster, of Pleiades is represented. The significance of this is yet determined, but Owens believes it may relate to the WingMakers place of origin and time of entry to earth. TECHNOLOGY ARTIFACTS As you know, the disappointing news is that the technology artifacts seem impregnable to our probes. It is as if the WingMakers wanted us to start our analysis on the paintings and their cultural artifacts, and leave the technology alone. However, we continue to probe with ever-increasing persistence. The Corteums are bringing a new technology that may help, but it will be about another three months before we will be able to experiment with it. For now, let me explain our findings, as minimal as they are. Since my last update, we have continued to make good progress in decoding the optical disc, though it is a slow, methodical process. We believe our accuracy rates are extremely high, though we have yet to determine how the glyphs factor into the translations from the paintings and the AA site itself.

In the construction of the technologies, the most common metal is a form of synthetic beryllium, and the most common mineral is quartz or a synthetic variant. This synthetic quartz is extremely conductive and has properties that seem responsive to human touch and thought. Spectral analyses of the quartz artifacts demonstrate that it is an amplifier of thought waves, but we cannot program the amplification. It is completely spurious and unpredictable. Under extreme magnification, the quartz is impregnated with a form of nano-technology that we've never seen before. This technology appears to act as the digital nervous system for the artifact, while the synthetic quartz acts as its power supply and amplification system. Human genetics have been implanted into all of the quartz artifacts, however, we're uncertain to what extent this is part of the smart system and how much of this is related to a personal recognition system that activates or channels the energy of the artifact based on genetic interleaving as we prescribed in our AdamSon Project.

It is Anne's goal to update this section with new information as soon as she is able. **Notes from Dr. Anderson of the ACIO** Written May 27, 1998 by Anne What follows are some of my notes taken while in earnest discussions with Dr. Anderson from the ACIO during the last 2 weeks of December 1997, before he disappeared -- at least off my radar screen. Dr. Anderson is about 6 feet tall, perhaps 170 pounds, has relatively long black hair, and by all appearances, seems of Peruvian descent or at least from somewhere in South America (though I never asked). I would guess he was about 50 years old with just a few tinges of gray hair. He called me out of the blue one day in mid-December 1997. His opening line to me was something like, \"My name is Dr. Anderson, and I have secret information about the future of humankind that proves the existence of time-travel technology\". Being a journalist by profession, it got my attention, though the whole time I spent on the phone with him my skeptical nature was in high gear. I always assume stories of a fantastical nature are false in reality, though the perceiver can think them to be true. And so thats how I operated with Dr. Anderson. I felt him to be genuine and sincere, but probably misguided or in error. However, he was convincing enough to secure a meeting with me, and so we met a few days later at a coffee shop near my home. He didnt fit my stereotypical view of a scientist. He was much more sophisticated and even elegant in his demeanor, and looked as much like an executive of a Fortune 100 company as anything else. His charisma and articulate manner immediately impressed me, and I sensed that he was not a man of mental instability prone to wild claims. He told me that he had no recollection of his original parents, and that a high-ranking member of the Advanced Contact Intelligence Organization (ACIO) had raised him, so his entire life was involved in one way or another with the ACIO. His adoptive father raised him as a single parent. He had been told that his mother had died from breast cancer shortly after he had been adopted when he was only about 2 years old. He had attended the best private schools, and additionally had been provided with special tutors, which he later learned were from the ACIO. For the most part he grew up a fairly normal boy until the age of 14", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__Anne.txt:0:4bd13a5be163", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15657, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__Anne.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__Anne", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "way or another with the ACIO.

For the most part he grew up a fairly normal boy until the age of 14 when he came under the formal tutelage of his future colleagues from the ACIO. By the time he was 17 he had left school and decided to pursue an internship at the ACIO, though he said that at the time, it was simply called the NSA Special Projects Laboratory and was an unacknowledged department of the NSA. His internship lasted for two years and he never pursued a formal degree at a University, though he claimed to have knowledge about physics and the life sciences that is far in advance to the curriculum of the best universities. He stated that he believed himself to have possessed average intelligence until he began his training and internship at the ACIO. He said that they had technologies that stimulated certain aspects of the central nervous system and brain that increased raw intelligence by as much as 500%. In addition, he claimed that there was a genetic implant technology that increased the ability to memorize and retain information to the point where the entire scientific core of the ACIO had perfect photographic memory. This enabled them to build their group intelligence beyond the genius of any one individual. These technologies -- he claimed -- were of extraterrestrial origin derived from a friendly source that had been visiting earth for thousands of years, but had arrangements with the ACIO dating from 1959 that were secret even from our government and its intelligence agencies. The alien race, which he called the Corteum, had infiltrated the ACIO in 1958, and though he wasnt specific about how this occurred, he did say that the Corteum are still working with the ACIO to seed technologies on earth that are superior to our native technologies. The technologies to accelerate and enhance intelligence were the first technologies to be transferred and these were to enable the ACIO scientists to assimilate and utilize subsequent technologies that the Corteum brought to the ACIO. In exchange for these technologies, the Corteum were provided safe haven within the ACIO intelligence structure. In other words, the Corteum were permitted access to all of the information systems of the ACIO, which are considerable according to Dr. Anderson. They were also able to use the facilities of the ACIO including their laboratories, considerable land holdings, and scientific brain power. This unfettered access to ACIO intelligence provided the Corteum leaders with insight into the structure of world government, where", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__Anne.txt:1:a6d33c088952", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15658, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__Anne.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__Anne", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "In exchange for these technologies, the Corteum were provided safe haven within the ACIO intelligence structure.

This unfettered access to ACIO intelligence provided the Corteum leaders with insight into the structure of world government, where the power centers were, who the real leaders were, and how critical decisions were made for the worlds people. According to Dr. Anderson, the Corteum are benevolent and had no ulterior motives to take over the earth and rule in dictatorship. In fact, they were much more interested in establishing diplomatic ties to the various world governments through the United Nations at the appropriate time, which was considered to be shortly after the year 2011. The existence of the Corteum was kept from the NSA and even most ACIO personnel were unaware of their existence (though I dont know how this was accomplished). Within the ACIO, there are 14 distinct levels of security clearance. Those who are at level 12 and above are aware of the Corteum Technology Transfer Program (TTP), and they, according to Dr. Anderson, are about 120 in number, and are primarily in India, Belgium, and the United States. There are only 7 who have level 14 clearance, and they are the Directors of Intelligence, Security, Research, Special Projects, Operations, Information Systems, and Communications. These Directors report to the Executive Director, who is known simply as \"Fifteen\", which is the unique classification that is reserved for the head of the ACIO. Fifteen, in the eyes of Dr. Anderson, is the most powerful human on the planet, and what I think he meant by \"powerful\" is that Fifteen is able to deploy technologies that are well in advance to any that our worlds governments have access to. However, Dr. Anderson portrayed Fifteen and his seven Directors as a benevolent force, not a hostile or controlling force. The eight people who comprise this inner sanctum of the ACIO are in possession of radical technologies that have been part of the Corteum TTP. However, there were also other extraterrestrial technologies that had been derived from recoveries of spacecraft or other alien artifacts, including various discoveries contained in ancient texts that had never been revealed before. All of this information and technology has been collected and developed within the ACIO scientific core -- all of who possess clearances of level 12 or higher. This scientific core is called the Labyrinth Group, and consists of both men and women who have utilized the Corteum intelligence accelerator technologies to their advantage, and have created a secret organization within the ACIO.

This scientific core is called the Labyrinth Group, and consists of both men and women who have utilized the Corteum intelligence accelerator technologies to their advantage, and have created a secret organization within the ACIO. When Dr. Anderson was explaining this to me, it got so complicated that I asked him if he could draw me a visual diagram of how all of these organizations worked. (Click here to see my rendering of this diagram.) The Labyrinth Group consists of all the personnel within the ACIO that qualify for levels 12, 13, and 14 clearance. Fifteen is the leader of this most secret organization. It was split from the ACIO to enable secrecy from the NSA and lower ranking members of the ACIO, which would facilitate the Labyrinth Groups agenda to create its own applications of the Corteum TTP. The Labyrinth Group is in possession of the pure technologies derived from the Corteum TTP. It takes these technologies and dilutes them to the point where the ACIO or Special Projects Laboratory will sell them to private industry and government agencies, (which includes the military). This secret organization is the most powerful organization on earth in Dr. Andersons opinion, but they do not choose to exercise their power in a way that makes them visible. Thus, their power is only discernible to their members. For about 40 years they have accumulated considerable wealth apart from the NSAs oversight. They have managed to build their own security technologies that prevent detection from intelligence agencies like the CIA or KGB. They are, for all practical purpose, in total control of their agenda -- perhaps this is what makes them a unique organization. Dr. Anderson had a clearance of level 12 and was still kept from vital information that only the Director level was aware. And it was assumed that even Fifteen kept vital information from his Directors, though this was never a certainty. The symbol used by the Labyrinth Group is four concentric circles. Each circle representing a clearance level (12, 13, 14, 15), and each circle had a unique insight into the agenda of the Labyrinth Group, and its coordination with the Corteum. Fifteen was an enigma to everyone within the Labyrinth Group. He had been a physicist before he became the Executive Director of the ACIO. He was a renegade because he never interacted with the protocols and the political environment of academia. He operated outside of the institutions and was selected to be part of the ACIO because of his combination of brain power, independence, and relative obscurity within scientific circles.

He operated outside of the institutions and was selected to be part of the ACIO because of his combination of brain power, independence, and relative obscurity within scientific circles. He was one of the first to make contact with the Corteum and establish communication with them. The Corteum essentially appointed Fifteen as their liaison to the ACIO, and Fifteen became the first to utilize the intelligence accelerator technologies that the Corteum initially offered. These technologies not only enhance cognitive abilities, memory, and higher order thinking skills, but also enhance the consciousness of the individual so that they can utilize the newly gained intelligence in a non-invasive manner. Meaning, they dont exploit their intelligence for personal gain at the expense of others. This apparent increase in both Fifteens IQ and ethical consciousness caused him to create the Labyrinth Group in order to retain the pure-state technologies of the Corteum TTP from the NSA. What technologies are released to the NSA are diluted forms of the pure-state technology, which are significantly less potent in their military and surveillance applications. What I expected to hear from Dr. Anderson was a secret organization of intelligent, evil elitists -- individuals intent on exploitation and control. Why else would they want to hide beneath the cloak of such incredible secrecy? The answer, according to Dr. Anderson, was surprising. The Labyrinth Group view themselves as the only group with sufficient intellect and technology to develop a specific form of time travel technology. They are essentially focused on this agenda because they desire to prevent future hostilities that they believe will occur unless this technology is developed. The Corteum is assisting, but despite their considerable intellects, they also are unable to develop this technology. What Im about to tell you will seem impossible to believe, but again, Im only reporting what my notes say based on my initial conversations with Dr. Anderson. He explained to me that there are as many as 12 different extraterrestrial races currently involved in the past, present, and future of earth and its destiny. The ACIO, because of its mission with the NSA, is the most knowledgeable group about the various agendas of these 12 alien races. Apparently there is an extraterrestrial race that may have hostile intent and the technological potential to disrupt the human social order and overtake it, as well as earth itself. This concern is what motivated Fifteen to assign the Labyrinth Groups intellect and collective energy to create the ultimate defense weapon -- which they refer to as Blank Slate Technology (BST) or a form of time travel.

I dont pretend to understand all of what Dr. Anderson described regarding BST. My notes are a bit vague because he was talking so far over my head I didnt even know what to write as notes. When the Ancient Arrow project came under the control of the ACIO, it was -- like all projects -- carefully scrutinized to determine if there were any technology artifacts that could help in the overall agenda of developing BST. When it was determined that the Ancient Arrow project was in fact a time capsule from a future aspect of humanity, the Labyrinth Group seized the project from the ACIO and essentially began a misinformation campaign back to the NSA. Dr. Anderson was one of two scientists that held a level 12 clearance and was asked to lead in the translation of the WingMakers language and decode their various communication symbols. In this process, he became aware of how to decode their language and began to understand what they were trying to communicate. He became convinced that the WingMakers were time travelers and possessed a form of BST. He also became convinced that there were six additional time capsules stored in various places around the globe, and that they held the technologies or insights that would enable the development of BST. The reason he defected was that somehow in the process of translating the WingMakers language, he became a sympathizer of their philosophy. He felt that the WingMakers were communicating with him and had selected him as their liaison. And when he acknowledged this to his superiors, he was felt to be a risk to the projects secrecy. Apparently, when personnel, regardless of clearance or rank become known as security risks they are given a \"memory therapy\" that essentially removes problematic experiences from their mind. Dr. Anderson felt certain that he was going to receive this \"therapy\" imminently, and could not fathom the results of loosing his memories of the WingMakers experience. Thus, he defected from the ACIO and the Labyrinth Group. The first to ever do so. When he had contacted me, he had defected only the day before. He told me that I would have to wait for him to contact me again to set up a rendezvous time and place. Three days later he called and we met that same afternoon. I wasnt prepared to believe him, but I thought it was a provocative story and was worth spending an hour or two investigating.

Three days later he called and we met that same afternoon. I wasnt prepared to believe him, but I thought it was a provocative story and was worth spending an hour or two investigating. Anyway, what he proceeded to tell me in that first meeting is largely contained in this journal entry. He showed me photographs and documents from the Ancient Arrow project that appeared authentic to my eyes. He also showed me some of the technologies that were in development by the ACIO concerning holographic fractal objects or HFOs as he called them. These were incredible to observe (and equally impossible to explain) and I must admit that my first impression after seeing HFOs in action was that any organization that could develop this technology was operating at a level well outside of the mainstream. It felt alien to me. It was then I became at least a partial believer, and called my employer and told them that I needed to take some personal leave. I took one week off and spent most of it with Dr. Anderson asking a thousand questions most of which, for the most part, he had ready answers to. Gradually I became a reluctant believer with a healthy streak of skepticism. At the end of the week he asked me to take some of his materials and publish them. He was operating at a whole different level of experience. There were times that I honestly felt he was an extraterrestrial, and even now Im not certain that he wasnt. (This from a person who 6 short months ago would have disputed ETs and any other \"bump-in-the-night\" phenomenon.) He was convinced that the ACIO would not allow him to defect with his memory intact. He was fearful of their remote viewing technology and was certain that they would try to track him down. He wanted me to have possession of the materials only if I volunteered to do so, and was willing to publish them. And through all of this, he wasnt absolutely certain that the Labyrinth Group and their ET friends, the Corteum, were intending anything bad. He just didnt want his memory tampered with. I think he was mostly interested in exposing the WingMakers time capsule and its philosophy and communication symbols. He never seemed that interested in exposing the ACIO and its secret organization the Labyrinth Group.

He told me about this entity only to impress upon me that he was part of an organization that had unusual powers and technologies, and to the extent they wanted to keep things under wrap, they would use their considerable powers to do so. And that was why he had picked me at random to help him in getting this story out. Dr. Anderson was the most sincere individual I have ever met. Someone I would love to count among my friends. I was so impressed with his manners, communication skills, and intellect. At one time I asked him what his IQ was, and with all humility intact, he simply answered that there is no way to test it. And that the Labyrinth Groups members are not interested in IQ so much as what he called Fluid Intelligence, or the speed with which alternative, creative solutions to a problem can be generated. He claimed this was the most important form of intelligence, and without it, one would not be able to time travel. In other words, he was convinced that time travel was not an independent technology, but was integral to the traveler. The time traveler must have a certain degree of fluid intelligence in order to withstand the stress inherent in time travel, and the best way to handle the stress was by having an extraordinarily fluid intelligence. The thing I found so fascinating about Dr. Anderson was his descriptions of how information about ETs, new physics, cosmology, prophecies, and the galactic hierarchy were hidden from the public, government, and even intelligence organizations. He told me that only one man had ever really tried to write about the NSAs Special Project Laboratory and that was back in 1950, and according to my notes it was written by Wilbur Smith, who I believe was a journalist from Canada. Everything else that has been written is done so on the basis of pure speculation. Dr. Anderson said that when this paper was circulated it was the genesis to create the ACIO in order to build another layer of what he called unacknowledged departments. He said that unacknowledged departments are rare in intelligence agencies, but those that do exist often telescope into greater levels of secrecy in order to remain hidden from public and private scrutiny. He also inferred that there were corporate members of the military-industrial complex that were involved in these unacknowledged departments. He claimed that the ACIO or its sister organization, the Special Projects Laboratory, would sell diluted technologies to private corporations and laboratories, which in turn would be commercialized for the military, and in some instances, even consumer use.

Dr. Anderson permitted me to tape-record two formal interviews with him. These are probably the best way to understand his perspective and the story that he has to tell. Even now as Im writing this letter, I find myself doubting much of what he told me, while at the same time I cant imagine why hed go to all this trouble if it were just a game or charade of some kind. It just doesnt make any sense in that context. So Im stuck somewhere in the middle of belief and disbelief. I can only tell you that if only a small percentage of his story is accurate, then citizens and their politicians need to wake up. According to Dr. Anderson, even our highest ranking government officials and military intelligence officers lack access to the information that he was privy to. But if these unacknowledged secret departments exist and private contractors working on behalf of the military are involved with these secret organizations, some organization should be investigating this. And they should have powers to grant witness protection, immunity, and a variety of other inducements to get these secrets out to the public or, at the very least, our government officials. I have approximately 60 pages of notes from my initial discussions with Dr. Anderson and then five transcripts from the five interviews I conducted. Id encourage anyone whos serious about understanding these issues to read the interview transcripts. Theyre probably our best records of whats going on behind closed doors relative to the ET phenomenon, secret organizations, and time travel.

The WingMakers website first appeared on the Internet in [late 1998](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.wingmakers.com). I first came upon it through a good friend's recommendation in November of 2000. Though I initially had serious questions and doubts about much of the mind-boggling information on the WingMakers site, I was immediately struck by the depth, clarity, and beauty of the two philosophical writings. Tears welled up in my eyes as I had never in my life read anything which so opened my mind, heart, and spirit, and resonated so deeply in my soul. **As I found the WingMakers [philosophical material](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers) to be so deeply moving, I decided to copy the information on the WingMakers website for future study. But then within a few months, I saw the website gradually begin to change from it's original form.** Where it once provided inspiration through poetry, paintings, philosophy, and music free of charge, the WingMakers website began to transform into a commercial endeavor, making some of the material there available for sale. Names were changed and more. Someone named James appeared on the changed website, claiming that he was responsible for it. The incredible story around the discovery of the physical site where the WingMakers material was found was also changed and gradually given a very different spin. The discovery date of the Lost Arrow site was changed from [1972](https://www.wingmakers.us/wingmakersorig/WingMakersintro.shtml) to [1996](https://web.archive.org/web/20150223234019/https://www.wingmakers.com/product/the-ancient-arrow-project/). Two additional philosophical writings were added to the original two (which were both given on one webpage). And when I carefully compared the changed WingMakers website with the original information I had copied, I discovered other most surprising and intriguing changes. Before describing more changes, it is important to mention that the WingMakers story is quite unbelievable for most who first read it. I originally suspected that the story might have been created to promote the inspiring philosophical teachings. Only after I saw the website change in unusual ways, and then learned about the huge [cover-up around UFOs](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up), did I eventually come to believe the WingMakers story was likely true. I invite you to be skeptical as well, as there is certainly no way I know of proving the story. That said, I also invite you to keep an open mind. The [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) website clearly shows that many things are not what they seem. Among the many significant changes, a 24th chamber was added to the 23 chambers (the number of human chromosomes) on the original WingMakers website. In the [interviews section](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakersorig/wingmakersinterviewschanges) of the changed website, the seven WingMakers sites around the planet are described as having a military objective, when the original website had no hint of anything military in all descriptions of the WingMakers.

Some key inspiring parts of the old interviews were completely deleted, others added, and star distances were changed. The distance to the star system of the Corteum was changed from [15,000 light years](https://www.wingmakers.us/wingmakersorig/wingmakersinterviews/www.wingmakers.com/interview/iview1.shtml#1) on the old website to [15 million light years](https://web.archive.org/web/20020202061535/http://wingmakers.com/neruda1.html). Why was that number changed? **The story on the current WingMakers website has taken on an hierarchical flavor.** It talks of a superior Central Race (of which the WingMakers are supposedly a part), of a Lyricus teaching order from this race, and of a mysterious \"grand portal\" leading to scientific proof of the soul. None of these concepts were part of or even mentioned on the original WingMakers website. Yet the insertion of these key concepts was among the first changes made to the website in 2001. These concepts are quite different from the original WingMakers writings, which were all about opening ever more to divine wisdom from within ourselves, and about moving beyond the teacher/student ordering of the hierarchical paradigm to recognize the divine equality of all beings. It is most interesting that James, who claims he is responsible for both the original and new WingMakers material, mentions on the changed website in question nine at [this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20020202062053/http://wingmakers.com/jamesqa.html), \"In my dominant reality, I am known as Mahu Nahi.\" Yet it is stated on both the [original](https://www.wingmakers.us/wingmakersorig/wingmakersinterviews/www.wingmakers.com/interview/iview2.shtml#1) and [changed](https://web.archive.org/web/20011202133941/http://www.wingmakers.com/neruda2.html) website that \"the leader of the Corteum mission to earth is called -- in English -- Mahunahi.\" This [same webpage](https://www.wingmakers.us/wingmakersorig/wingmakersinterviews/www.wingmakers.com/interview/iview2.shtml#2) describes the extraterrestrial Corteum as beings which \"stand nearly three meters high and have very elongated heads and bodies. Their skin is very fair ... almost translucent.\" So if James is being honest here, he is claiming that he is a 10-foot tall alien.

It seems that the original WingMakers website was somehow taken over and that the original information was gradually distorted and diluted by very sophisticated powers that did not want this information going out. **Some highly intelligent group, which obviously had ample funds, appears to have taken control and gradually changed the orientation of the original website so that those seeking the deep WingMakers wisdom would be subtly led back towards more hierarchical ways of thinking.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakerschanges.txt:1:8352db2963b6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15671, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakerschanges.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakerschanges", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "yet significant changes being made.

The first version of the website should be listed as January 25, 1999, which is only months after the website first appeared on the Internet. The website starts to change in the March 2001 version there.

It is interesting to note that despite the many changes, the two philosophical writings from the original website have changed very little on the current site. This may be because the [original versions](https://www.wingmakers.us/wingmakersorig/www.wingmakers.com/arrow/chambers/indexes/philo.shtml) of this philosophy were written in language that is quite esoteric and difficult for most people to understand. I worked professionally as a [language interpreter](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fredburksresigns) for many years, and was able to understand the originals and recognize the beauty of what I read. Using my translation skills, I translated this esoteric language into common, everyday English, which is what you now read on our website at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers). If you are interested in verifying and further exploring all of the information above, I recommend you start by reading the fascinating introduction to the original website and WingMakers material as I [downloaded it here](https://www.wingmakers.us/wingmakersorig/wingmakers/ancient_arrow_project.shtml).

I also highly recommend reading reliable information on the UFO cover-up [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg) for more background understanding to all of this. **The original writings, poems, and paintings of the WingMakers were simply sharing powerful information and inspiration on the transformation currently taking place on our planet with no hint of fear for our future. This transformation described by the WingMakers involved the shift to a new paradigm where an ever-increasing number of people realize that the deepest answers in life are found not by searching outside of ourselves in the way of the old hierarchical paradigm, but rather by searching within our own divine essence to find deeper connection with all around us.** The philosophy of the WingMakers states that the [universe is always mirroring](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#gratitude) our own deepest beliefs back to us.

It is up to each one of us how we choose to see and interpret everything in our lives and everything that happens. And the more we open to the WingMakers' [three principles of transformation](https://www.WantToKnow.info/transformation) (seeing the Divine in all, nurturance of life, and gratitude), the more easy and fluid our lives may become. It is our choice whether we choose to live in fear, or whether we choose to recognize fear as an invitation to growth, and work with it as a potential tool of transformation. For a number of years I was concerned and even alarmed that the WingMakers materials were changed in ways that I believed diluted and even distorted the power of the original writings. Yet eventually, as I examined my own role in creating this fear, I was able to find compassion and trust for all involved. In recent years, I've been quite encouraged and even excited that the current wingmakers.com website and the other websites it has spawned seem increasingly to be coming from a place of the heart, though I still find the original website to be far more profound and transformational for those who are ready to journey into their own inner wisdom. I trust that the Divine (God, Prime Creator, First Source) is always acting in perfect time and perfect fashion through each one of us to create what is best for all beings in this universe. The more we trust the Divine and align ourselves with [what's best for all beings](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#whats), the more easy, fluid, and love-filled our lives become. For me, this is an essential part of what the WingMakers are telling us. **I most highly recommend that you open to your own spiritual guidance in exploring these matters.** If they resonate for you, I also highly recommend reviewing the original WingMakers [philosophical essays](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers) and [poems](https://www.wingmakers.us/wingmakersorig/www.wingmakers.com/arrow/chambers/indexes/poetry.shtml) from time to time, as they will very likely awaken ever more light and love inside of you. I very much enjoy reading the philosophical essays once or twice a year, and invariably find myself inspired anew. We are clearly in the middle of an incredible planetary shift, which is but a reflection of deep changes within each of us and within the collective consciousness of humanity.

Those definitions can be found in the Interview Transcripts section of the web site. ** **Human Instrument** The human instrument consists of three principal components: The biological (physical body), the emotional, and the mental. These three distinct tools of perception, in aggregate, represent the vehicle of the individuated spirit as it interacts with the physical dimension of time, space, energy, and matter. **Entity** The entity model of consciousness encompasses the individuated spirit sometimes referred to as the Higher Self or Soul. The entity is, in a sense, a fragment of the Universal Spirit Consciousness of Prime Creator. It is composed of a very refined and pure energy vibration that is equal to Source Intelligence (spirit). It is the entity consciousness that divests itself into human or otherwise physical vehicles in order to collect experiences that evolve and transform its understanding and appreciation of existence. It is the hub of the wheel through which all of its outposts of form and expression converge throughout the continuum of time and space. The entity is sovereign and simultaneously interconnected with all life through the Universal Spirit Consciousness (Source Intelligence). It is the animating force/energy within all life forms that is always in search of higher understanding and expression. **Sovereign Integral** The Sovereign Integral is a state of consciousness whereby the entity and all of its various forms of expression and perception are integrated as a conscious wholeness. This is a state of consciousness that all entities are evolving towards, and at some point, each will reach a state of transformation that allows the entity and its instruments of experience (i.e., the human instrument) to become an integrated expression that is aligned and in harmony with Source Intelligence. **Prime Creator** Prime Creator is the primal source from which all existence is ultimately linked. It is sometimes referred to as the Body of the Collective God. It represents the overarching consciousness of all things unified. This includes pain, joy, suffering, light, love, darkness, fear; all expressions and conditions are integrated and purposeful in the context of Prime Creator. IT encompasses all things and unifies them in an all-inclusive consciousness that evolves and grows in a similar manner to how each individuated spirit evolves and grows. In most cultures where the term \"god\" or \"goddess\" is used to define this omnipotent power, it often represents an entity that has evolved beyond the range of human comprehension and who manifests magical powers like manipulating", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary.txt:0:1b9f176a8410", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15675, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "darkness, fear; all expressions and conditions are integrated and purposeful in the context of Prime Creator. IT encompasses all things and unifies them in an all-inclusive consciousness that evolves and grows in a similar manner to how each individuated spirit evolves and grows. In most cultures where the term \"god\" or \"goddess\" is used to define this omnipotent power, it often represents an entity that has evolved beyond the range of human comprehension and who manifests magical powers like manipulating the natural elements through thought or manifesting as non-corporeal Light Beings. These manifestations are described and depicted in virtually all cultures of the human race through its religious texts and mythology. While these may be entities that are highly evolved in their abilities and knowledge, they should not be confused with Prime Creator. Prime Creator is not a manifestation, but rather a consciousness that inhabits all time, space, energy, matter, form, intent; as well as all non-time, non-space, non-mater, non-energy, non-form, and non-intent. It is the only consciousness that unifies all states of being into one Being. And this Being is Prime Creator. It is a growing, expanding, and inexplicable consciousness that organizes the collective experience of all states of being into a coherent plan of creation; expansion and colonization into the realms of creation; and the inclusion of creation into Source Reality-the home of Prime Creator. This Being pervades the universe as the sum of experience in time and non-time. It has encoded ITSELF within all life as a vibration of frequency. This frequency is not perceptible to the three-dimensional, five sensory context of the human instrument, which can only detect a faint echo of this vibration. Prime Creator is present in all. And all are able to contact Prime Creator through this tone-vibration of equality. Prayers of supplication do not stir Prime Creator to response. Only the core expression of the individual's tone-vibration of equality will be successful in contacting Prime Creator in a meaningful way. Prime Creator has many lower faces. These faces are often thought to be God Itself, but Gods are only a dimensional aspect of Prime Creator and there are many faces of God as well. The Hierarchy has made this manifest, not Prime Creator. Prime Creator is not beholden to any law nor does IT operate in conjunction with any other force or power. IT is truly sovereign and ubiquitous simultaneously, and thus, Unique. IT is not hidden or wary of life in any way. IT simply is Unique, and therefore, incomprehensible except through the vibration encoded within all life. The other faces of God have been created so the human instrument can fathom Prime Creator and crystallize an image of this Unique Being sufficient to progress through the Hierarchy and access the Sovereign Integral perspective.

Nevertheless, what you hold as God, is not Prime Creator, but a facet of Prime Creator developed by the Hierarchy as a comprehensible interpretation of Prime Creator. We must tell you that these \"interpretations\" have been exceedingly inadequate in their portrayal. Because Prime Creator is Unique unto all creation, IT is indescribable, unfathomable, and incomprehensible other than through the tone-vibration of equality stored in the entity level of the human instrument and accessible through the core expression of the entity. Until there is a sufficient number of individuals who operate from the Sovereign Integral consciousness, the genetic mind will make access to this vibration difficult to achieve. **The Genetic Mind** The genetic mind is the equivalent of a universal belief system that penetrates, to varying degrees, the human instrument of all entities. In some, it immobilizes their ability to think original thoughts and feel original feelings. In most, it entrains their belief system to harmonize with the accepted belief systems of the Hierarchy. In a few, it exerts no significant force nor has any bearing on the development of their personal belief system. There are those on terra-earth who are in training to be Sovereign Entities and are completely unaware of this training as well as their destiny. When they are able to become timeless and view the continuum of their lifestream, they will see the thread that has differentiated them as Sovereign Entities. They will understand how the hardships and supposed indifference of the universe were actually the catalysts for their emergence as designers of the new genetic mind. The genetic mind is different from the subconscious or universal mind as it is sometimes referred to in your psychology texts, in that the genetic mind has a peculiar focus on the accumulated beliefs of all the people on a planet from its most distant past to its present time. These accumulated beliefs are actually manipulations of the Hierarchy, which imprint on the genetic mind in order to cast the boundaries of what is acceptable to believe. So compelling is this manipulation and the boundaries that are imposed by the Hierarchy that virtually no one is aware of the manipulations of their beliefs. This is precisely why the WingMakers have interacted with your species from the very beginning. As culture bearers, we stretch your boundaries in the arena of science, art, and philosophy. We essentially expand the genetic mind's \"perimeter fence\" and enable it to encompass a larger portion of the \"land\" known as Source Reality.

We essentially expand the genetic mind's \"perimeter fence\" and enable it to encompass a larger portion of the \"land\" known as Source Reality. If we were to tell you about the fundamental misconceptions of your genetic mind, you would not believe us. You would most definitely-even your most accomplished spiritual leaders-find us in contempt of much that you hold true and reasonable. You would feel fear in the face of our expression of Source Reality because it would be so clear to you how you have squandered your divine natures in favor of the entrapment of the genetic mind. We know this will seem like a judgment of your beliefs, and it is to some degree, but you must know this about your belief systems: they are largely disconnected from Source Reality. They are like threads of a web that have become disconnected from the \"branches\" of Source Reality by the \"winds\" of the Hierarchy. Source Reality is represented in your belief in unconditional love, but of all the dimensions of your belief systems, this is the one thread that is connected-through the genetic mind-to Source Reality. All of the other dimensions are connected to the genetic mind and have no ongoing connection to Source Reality. The genetic mind, as an intermediary and reflection of Source Reality, is completely and utterly inept. This is all part of the primal blueprint that designs the evolutionary pathway of a species through time. The genetic mind acts as a buffer for the developing species to experience separation from Source Reality. In this way, the human instrument is appropriately entangled in time, space, and the illusions of a disempowered belief system. These factors, as disorienting as they are to the entity, are precisely what attract the entity to terra-earth. There are very few planetary systems in the multiverse that provide a better sense of separation from Source Reality than that which is experienced on terra-earth. By amplifying the sense of separation, the entity can experience more fully the individuated essence that is unique and bears the resemblance of Prime Creator as a Unique Being. This is what draws entities to this world to incarnate within a human instrument. So the genetic mind is an enabling force to experience separation on the one hand, and a disabling force to understand the true characteristics of Source Reality on the other. This dichotomy, when understood, helps to disentangle the human instrument and its entity consciousness from the limiting aspects of the genetic mind and its principle author, the Hierarchy.

This dichotomy, when understood, helps to disentangle the human instrument and its entity consciousness from the limiting aspects of the genetic mind and its principle author, the Hierarchy. Over the next twenty years, the genetic mind will become increasingly fragmented and thus, vulnerable to modification. This will be an effect of the growing ubiquity of intelligent networks and artificial intelligence therein. The expanding interconnection of intelligent networks has a significant impact on the genetic mind because of the emergence of a global culture that accompanies the arrival of such technologies. **OLIN Technology** Intelligent networks are able to operate from a single language with translation interfaces that enable global intercourse. This means language is no longer a barrier to communication. Intelligent networks will introduce a meta-language that translates both real-time written and spoken applications. It will revolutionize the genetic mind's global construct, and facilitate the digitalization of your global economy. There will be many within the Hierarchy, who will object vehemently to the notion of a global, digital economy, but we will tell you, it will happen regardless of the complaints and registered concerns. Your most powerful banks, computer manufacturers, and software companies will merge to create this momentous technology, and the One Language Intelligent Network (OLIN) will become the standard operating system of all the world's computer-based systems. This will not occur until the year 2008, so it is some time before you will encounter this globalization of your economy, but all of the systems and architecture are already being designed and conceptualized in the minds of some of your brightest engineers and scientists. We assure you, this is not something to be feared, but rather embraced, and not because of the economic values, but because of the way the OLIN technology will facilitate the development of a global culture. As the OLIN technology evolves, it will increasingly become subject to individual control. In other words, individuals will become inextricably linked into the network's entertainment and educational applications, which will become globalized. No longer will global media companies publish for a geographical market. They will produce content for a global audience and each individual will define what and how it desires to be entertained or educated. The OLIN technology will \"know\" the preferences and interests of every individual linked to its network, and by the year 2016, it will be more ubiquitous than telephones in the late 20th century. Hence, the network will be controlled by individuals, and producers of content and services will be the \"slave\" or reactionary force of the individual.

Hence, the network will be controlled by individuals, and producers of content and services will be the \"slave\" or reactionary force of the individual. Thus, the individual will need to define their entertainment and educational desires carefully, or the OLIN technology will deliver content that is undesirable. We know this sounds obvious and trite, but it is profoundly different than the way entertainment and education are delivered in your world of the pre-OLIN technology. The time capsules that the WingMakers have left behind will act as a template to those who operate outside of the limiting force of the genetic mind, and desire to create content for the OLIN technology even before it exists. The time capsules will show how to do this and demonstrate how to create multi-dimensional content that carries its viewer-participant into new corridors of understanding and illumination. This is how the genetic mind will fragment and become unable to exert a unified force upon the human instruments of terra-earth. When it is in this condition it will yield to the transformation/mastership model of existence and form a synthesis with it. It will transform itself, and the genetic mind will become the leader of transformation for entities upon terra-earth instead of its barrier force. **Sovereign Integral Network** The Sovereign Integral Network (SIN) already exists, indeed, has always existed. However, there has not been a way for it to connect or interface with your technologies. Terra-earth has created technologies that are largely mechanistic and electrical in nature, and it is just beginning to understand electromagnetic energy fields and holographic technology. Regrettably, when technologies are in their infantile stages of development, they are very often conformed to a military or economic control application. And this is the case with these emerging technologies. SIN cannot interface with technologies bearing such an application. Not because it is impossible technologically, but because it is undesirable ethically. SIN is actually a sub-atomic network of light-encoded filaments that exist in all dimensions of the multiverse. Think of SIN as an infinite number of threads of light issuing from Source Reality, and, like a web, connecting every life form at its entity level to all other entities and Prime Creator. This is an organic network that is utilized by Prime Creator to transmit knowledge to entities and to receive knowledge from entities. SIN will eventually be interfaced with OLIN technology, but this will not happen for several hundred years. The interface is too far beyond both your technology and understanding of cosmology, and no planetary system can be fitted to interface with SIN until it is", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary.txt:5:5a8273bc90d5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15680, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "every life form at its entity level to all other entities and Prime Creator.

The interface is too far beyond both your technology and understanding of cosmology, and no planetary system can be fitted to interface with SIN until it is absolutely pure in its content and application. Only Prime Creator makes this decision as to when a planetary system can become a node on SIN. This is the core purpose of WingMakers, to help terra-earth become a node on SIN before its opportunity to interface has past. Each entity is a node of SIN, but so few realize this connection exists other than through what they read or hear. The connection is real and timeless, and occurs at the core, innermost aspect of the entity where beats the replica heart of Prime Creator. This is the repository of Prime Creator and exudes ITS Unique vibration like a radio tower sends its signals in all directions. Even your physicists have found preliminary evidence of SIN in their research with their so-called super string theory. We assure you, however, that this network will eventually replace all other networks for the primary reason that it is the conduit into timelessness. And this is the destination that draws all humanoid species, initially, through a technological portal similar to your Internet, which eventually leads to a biomorphic portal consisting of the encoded light filaments leading to the non-worlds of Source Reality. When a human species transforms its genetic mind to utilize the Sovereign Integral Network, this then becomes the \"ship\" upon which it sails the seas of the cosmos. And in this way, the species is allowed to become \"Gods\" of newly created worlds in which it can re-enact the entire process of the Grand Experiment utilizing its knowledge base and wisdom that was achieved in the previous stage of its existence. On a grand scale, this process is cast in countless worlds across the multiverse, and orchestrating all of this wondrous activity of creation is Source Intelligence and SIN. **Source Intelligence** Source Intelligence is the energy-consciousness of Prime Creator that is cast into all worlds, all dimensions, all realities, all life forms, all times and places. Source Intelligence is the Prime Creator projected into all that is. Source Intelligence, in effect, is the \"eyes and ears\" of Prime Creator, and its role is principally involved in expressing, upholding, and sustaining the will of Prime Creator.

While Source Intelligence is the vehicle of cosmological unity, it also holds the information of All That Is and \"circulates\" this information and creative empowerment to all entities who are willing to reach for it and utilize it for the expansion of consciousness. **Universe of Wholeness** The Universe of Wholeness is the aggregate of all dimensions and realities. It is unified and inter-connected through Source Intelligence. It is dynamic and always in a state of experimental change and evolution. It is simply too vast and dynamic to comprehend or to establish a measurement of any kind. **Fields of Vibration** The Universe of Wholeness is a vast field of energy that is composed of innumerable dimensions of perception and existence. Within this macro-universe are dimensions of existence that are dominant realms of experience like the third-dimensional reality in which human life is rooted. Each dimension has its unique qualities of experience and these are known as fields of vibration because the vibratory rate of each dimension is the determining factor of its existence. The higher the vibratory rate of a dimension, the more expansive and unlimiting it is. Within the Universe of Wholeness there are, for all practical purposes, an infinite number of fields of vibration that an entity or Sovereign Integral can attune to and utilize as a experiential or dominant reality. **Source Reality** Prime Creator exists in Source Reality. Source Reality is the dimension of consciousness that is always pushing the envelop of expansion--the leading edge of development and evolution for the whole of consciousness. In this realm of dynamic expansion is always found Source Reality. It can be likened to the inner sanctum of Prime Creator or the incubator of cosmological expansion. **Sovereignty** Sovereignty is a state of completeness and inter-connectedness. It is recognizing that as a human being you have an individuated spirit force that animates your physical, emotional, and mental aspects, and that through this spirit you are complete and connected to all other life forms through the Universal Spirit Consciousness (Source Intelligence). Sovereign beings understand that they alone create their reality and that they are responsible for their life-experience. They also understand that all other life forms are equally sovereign and that they", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary.txt:7:523cc3bc73ef", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15682, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "state of completeness and inter-connectedness.

Sovereign beings understand that they alone create their reality and that they are responsible for their life-experience. They also understand that all other life forms are equally sovereign and that they also create their unique realities. Sovereignty allows that the source of liberating information is contained within the Self, and all that is needed to create new realities is also contained within the Self. It is the point of empowerment and connection to all through the frequency of love. **Source Codes** Source Codes are imbedded \"activators\" that are present within the entity consciousness. They serve the specific purpose of awakening the human instrument to the multidimensionality of the entity and the liberating information that is stored within the entity consciousness. Source Codes are somewhat analogous to the genetic coding of DNA to the extent that Source Codes activate specific blueprints of transformation that accelerate and facilitate the expansion of consciousness. In effect, Source Codes catalyze the awakening of the human instrument and encourage it to make the quantum leap from a socialized human to a sovereign entity that is aware of its connection to All That Is. **Hierarchy** The Hierarchy extends throughout the cosmos to the very borders of discovery. It has branches that extend from every star system, every dimension; and virtually all life forms are \"leaves\" of this cosmological tree. The Hierarchy constitutes the grand indoctrination of species, spirits, planets, and stars as they each evolve through the branches of the tree. It is an assemblage of externals that desire to invest their energies in support of a sub-group that has nested somewhere within the greatest of all structures: the Hierarchy. Service is the operational motive of the Hierarchy, and in most cases, this translates into the concept of saviorship. The Hierarchy is composed of entities of all motives that have linked their energies into subgroups. Think of these subgroups as independent branches of a vast, cosmological tree--a structure that encompasses all things outside of Source Reality. The roots of the tree are bound in the soil of genetic memory and subconscious identity. At the base of the tree the first branches sprout and they are the oldest, representing the native religions of the specie. The middle branches are the orthodox religions and institutions, while the upper branches represent the contemporary belief systems that are newly emerging throughout the universe. The whole tree, in this definition, is the Hierarchy, and its purpose is to advance the evolution of life through a superstructure that results in the teacher/student ordering of the universe.

The whole tree, in this definition, is the Hierarchy, and its purpose is to advance the evolution of life through a superstructure that results in the teacher/student ordering of the universe. Prime Creator is connected to individuals not organizations. Thus, the Hierarchy is unconnected to the Source in a vital and dynamic way. The Hierarchy is more connected to its own collective desire to help, to serve, to perform a function that allows the use of power in a positive way. In itself, this is not wrong or misguided. It is all part of the Primal Blueprint that orchestrates the unfoldment of consciousness from collective to individual and individual to collective. This is the spiral of integration that breeds wholeness and perfection within the Source Intelligence. **Wholeness Perspective** The human instrument, because it is fragmented and limited to five-senses, truly desires the Wholeness Perspective; a way to absorb life experience, process it, and move on to the next thing with grace and ease. This is what is desired, no matter what name is used to describe it. Wholeness is accepting all realities and moving through them with a feeling of integration, unity, equality, and non-judgment. It means there are no dualities that are real. It means that all experience is equal and grounded in the transcendent reality of the One That Is All. And most importantly, it means that the One That Is All is you, me, him, her, it, that, and those. Nothing is excluded or rejected. **Wholeness Navigator** Theories of evolution are layered upon your existing paradigm of a mechanical universe that consists of molecular machines operating in an objective reality that is knowable with the right instruments. The universe is truly unknowable with any instrument save your own sense of unity and wholeness. The perception of wholeness is forever unfolding in the human instrument because the culture of the multidimensional universe is rooted in unity. Plants have root systems that penetrate earth and drink of her substance. In this way, all plants are linked. Imagine that each plant had a secret root that was invisible, but was nonetheless connected to the very center of the planet. At this point of convergence, every plant was indeed unified and aware that its real identity was this core system of interconnected roots, and that the secret root was the lifeline through which individual expression was brought to the surface of earth and its unified consciousness released as the fragrance of individuality. In this same way, all existence has a secret root that spirals into the uncharted realm of Prime Creator. This is the field of unity that defines the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary.txt:9:034e04e4c635", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15684, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "At this point of convergence, every plant was indeed unified and aware that its real identity was this core system of interconnected roots, and that the secret root was the lifeline through which individual expression was brought to the surface of earth and its unified consciousness released as the fragrance of individuality. In this same way, all existence has a secret root that spirals into the uncharted realm of Prime Creator. This is the field of unity that defines the culture of the multidimensional universe. All human life is embedded with a Wholeness Navigator. It is the core wisdom. It draws the human instrument to perceive fragmentary existence as a passageway into wholeness and unity. The Wholeness Navigator pursues wholeness above all else, yet it is often blown off course by the energies of structure, polarity, linear time, and separatist cultures that dominate terra-earth. The Wholeness Navigator is the heart of the entity consciousness, and it knows that the secret root exits even though it may be intangible to the human senses. It is this very condition of accepting the interconnectedness of life that places spiritual growth as a priority in one's life. The five senses of the human body feed only a small part of an individual's wholeness. Yet the human instrument clings to these five senses as though they were the only pathways of experience. The seed vision of the Wholeness Navigator is equal to Prime Creator. It is a replica of Prime Creator vibrating precisely at the same frequency and capable of the same feats of consciousness. And the numberless secret roots that supply Prime Creator with insight, experience, intelligence, and perspective can be accessed, but not through the five senses which are designed for your ego consciousness. The preceptors of the Wholeness Navigator consist primarily of the secret root. This is the subtle carrier of information that leads you to see the One That Is All and the All That Is One. This is a facet of Prime Creator that is made manifest in the human instrument as a means of attracting the human instrument to the life of the Sovereign Integral consciousness. Let the secret root and the Wholeness Navigator guide you, and let the five senses be expressionary tools of the entity, rather than collectors of separatist thought for the human instrument. How do you access the secret root? Its portal of observation can be broadly defined as the integral awareness. This is allowing yourself to be aware of how you are integrated to life outside of your physical body. It is the feeling and perception that you are a holographic entity that is woven throughout all things and time, and when you touch into this feeling, you recall a frequency of your consciousness that is the Wholeness Navigator--the mysterious Allness that is nurtured by the secret root.

This is not a state of being that the human instrument will attain. Rather, it is a feeling of oneness and wholeness that the human instrument can glimpse momentarily and, as a result, transform its understanding of its purpose. The Wholeness Navigator pulls the human instrument into alignment with the entity consciousness where it can view its role as an extension of the entity consciousness into terra-earth, and the entity consciousness as an extension of the human instrument into Source Reality. **Evolution and the Concept of Time** When an individual evolves in consciousness it is quite different from the evolutionary process in terms of the physical body. For example, an individual can make a quantum leap in consciousness within a single moment in time, while in contrast, the physical body is gradually shaped over thousands of years. Thus, the entity transforms through a process of remembrance, while the human instrument--particularly the physical body--evolves through experience in vast stretches of linear time. The individuated consciousness of the entity is the fragment of Prime Creator that is seeking to be remembered within the human instrument. It lives in an eternal state of nowness and represents the continuity of time and consciousness across all dimensions of reality. In other words, all dimensions of time are simultaneously experienced by the entity consciousness, however, upon terra-earth, the human instrument is usually only conscious of one dimension of time, typically calibrated in linear seconds. This is why time plays such a significant role in the evolution of three- and four-dimensional structures like the human instrument, but has very little influence on the transformation of consciousness itself. The human instrument is grounded in a physical body that is constantly being shaped by experience, emotion, and thought, all of which is self-created. On the other hand, the entity consciousness is the multidimensional Self. It is the union of all the different aspects of consciousness that are invested within the time/space universes through instruments of contact; be they human or otherwise. The entity may simultaneously inhabit a thousand human instruments spread across 200,000 years of linear time. To the human instrument of a specific time period, it will seem to be the one and only existence, but to the entity, all of its lives are occurring in nowness. The entity consciousness is the \"hub\" around which its various human instruments connect in to like spokes of a wheel. And the outer rim of the wheel", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary.txt:11:39e4f41f6d69", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15686, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "contact; be they human or otherwise. The entity may simultaneously inhabit a thousand human instruments spread across 200,000 years of linear time. To the human instrument of a specific time period, it will seem to be the one and only existence, but to the entity, all of its lives are occurring in nowness. The entity consciousness is the \"hub\" around which its various human instruments connect in to like spokes of a wheel. And the outer rim of the wheel is represented as circular time within the dimensions of planetary life. All of the \"spokes\", or time-based lives, are linked together at the entity consciousness where they converge into non-time. From the entity consciousness, through the portal of the Wholeness Navigator, this same experience is transmitted to Prime Creator, processed by Source Intelligence, and returned to the entity consciousness as a form of energy that enlarges the entity's perspective on matters of destiny, existence, and purpose. It is virtually impossible to express this interrelationship between Prime Creator, Source Intelligence, the entity, the human instrument, and time. Time makes it possible to segment this knowledge into fragments that can be shared between individual human instruments. The human instrument is a composite of mental, emotional, and physical capabilities linked together to form a vehicle for the entity consciousness to experience planetary life. The human instrument evolves to better fit the needs of the entity. The entity transforms from a pure vibratory, individualized expression of Prime Creator, to a Sovereign Integral who has created its own experiential reality, and re-defined itself by the planetary experiences therein. Eternity, while it may seem to exclude time, is nonetheless a form of absolute time that is not isolated into a sovereign reality, but instead, integrated in all realities like a thread of light that draws the disparate realities into union. In this dimension of union--where the entity consciousness is whole and all realities converge--time is articulated not by the linear progression of seconds, but rather, by the expansion of the vibration of equality or love. Thus, in eternity, time is simply re-defined by a new value system upon which entities establish and recognize their growth. **Models of Existence** There are two dominant models of existence that shape the interaction and destiny of the human race. These models of existence are: The Evolution/Saviorship model The Transformation/Mastership model Each human is developing their belief system from one or both of these models of existence. The evolution/saviorship model is the dominant model that is promulgated by the Hierarchy. Its basic tenets are that life evolves through the Hierarchy's teacher/student methodology, and that various teachers (saviors) are presented to the human race that enable sub-hierarchies to develop and control information. In so doing, individuals are disempowered and disconnected from their sovereignty. The underlying equation of the evolution/saviorship model of existence is: human instrument + Hierarchy = God connection through saviorship.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary.txt:12:2a23cdc34ef0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15687, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "both of these models of existence.

In so doing, individuals are disempowered and disconnected from their sovereignty. The underlying equation of the evolution/saviorship model of existence is: human instrument + Hierarchy = God connection through saviorship. In the case of the transformation/mastership model of existence, its principle tenets are that the entity is limitless, deathless, and sovereign. All information flows from Source Intelligence to the entity, and, it is therefore the responsibility of the entity to become self-enlightened and self-liberated by attuning itself to Source Intelligence and \"detuning\" itself from the Hierarchy. Each becomes their own master, and each transforms from a human being to a Sovereign Integral within the cradle of time and space. The underlying equation of the transformation/mastership model of existence is: Entity + Source Intelligence = Prime Creator equality. One of the challenges of the individual is to recognize these two dominant models of existence and integrate them in order to design a synthesis model. The synthesis model is slowly emerging on terra-earth, and with high probability, will ultimately become the dominant model of existence in this universe. It will be the model of existence that is best able to unify consciousness without impinging on the sovereignty of the entity and Prime Creator. It will allow the entity to be the vibrant container of Source Intelligence and explore new fields of vibration as a fully conscious outpost of Prime Creator.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__WingMakersglossary.txt:13:b61bbf33aa28", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15688, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews1.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews1", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "WingMakers Interviews **WingMakers Interviews An Important Note ** The [WingMakers interviews](https://www.wingmakers.us/wingmakersorig/wingmakersinterviews/www.wingmakers.com/interview/iview1.shtml) provide some information that may be quite disturbing for some people. If these interviews are to be believed, there is a very powerful, secret group called the ACIO that is in charge of anything related to ET presence on this planet. They feared that in the year 2012 our planet would be invaded by a group of \"hive-like\" ETs. They were focused to the point of obsession on stopping this from happening. If you examine the current, strangely changed WingMakers website at wingmakers.com, you will see that those who now control the site have made it appear that the WingMakers shared the ACIO's goal of stopping this invasion. This was not true at all in the [original website](https://www.wingmakers.us), where the WingMakers philosophical writings and poetry mention nothing about any future invasion. Though the invasion is mentioned in the original interviews with a former ACIO member, the man interviewed makes no connection between the WingMakers and the ACIO's efforts to stop the invasion. The original interviews describe the story of this member of the ACIO group who clearly was steeped in the fear promoted by the ACIO, yet who on seeing and experiencing personally the wisdom and transformative power of the WingMakers materials decided to break the strict code of secrecy by defecting and making these empowering materials available to the public. **The original writings, poems, and paintings of the WingMakers were simply sharing powerful information and inspiration on the transformation currently taking place on our planet with no hint of fear for our future. This transformation described by the WingMakers involved the shift to a new paradigm where an ever-increasing number of people realize that the deepest answers in life are found not by searching outside of ourselves in the way of the old hierarchical paradigm, but rather by searching within our own divine essence.** In fact, the \"hive-like\" ETs or \"animus\" that members of the ACIO so fear may be some beneficial ETs who have developed advanced spirituality and telepathy, and thus appear to be hive-like. Or they may just be a number of spiritually advanced souls on our planet who gradually develop the ability to link up and communicate telepathically with each other, and who are strongly oriented towards the good of the whole-thus appearing hive-like. Either of these would be a very positive development, but one which the ACIO would fear greatly, because they would lose much of their power and control, and because their huge secrets would be exposed. The philosophy of the WingMakers clearly states that the [universe is always mirroring](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#gratitude) our own deepest beliefs back to us.

These are the exact transcripts from her tape-recorded interviews and are probably the best way to understand the nature of the discovery and its implications. There are three additional interview transcripts that will be added to the site as soon as Anne is able. At the present (July 1998), Dr. Anderson has not been heard from for nearly 5 months, but it is hoped that additional interviews will be able to be conducted in the near future.** First Interview of Dr. Anderson By Anne What follows is a session I recorded of Dr. Anderson on December 27, 1997. He gave permission for me to record his answers to my questions. This was the first of five interviews that I was able to tape-record before he left or disappeared. I have preserved these transcripts precisely as they occurred. No editing was performed, and I've tried my best to include the exact words and grammar used by Dr. Anderson. **Anne:** \"Are you comfortable?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, yes, I'm fine and ready to begin when you are.\" **Anne:** \"You've made some remarkable claims with respect to the Ancient Arrow project. Can you please recount what your involvement in this project was and why you chose to leave it of your own freewill?\" Dr. Anderson \"I was selected to participate in the decoding and translation of the symbol pictures found at the site. I have a known expertise in languages and ancient texts. I am able to speak over 30 different languages fluently and another 12 or so languages that are officially extinct. Because of my skills in linguistics and my abilities to decode symbol pictures like petroglyphs or hieroglyphs, I was chosen for this task. \"I had been involved in the Ancient Arrow project from its very inception, when the ACIO took over the project from the NSA. I was initially involved in the site discovery and its restoration along with a team of 7 other scientists from the ACIO. We restored each of the 23 chambers of the WingMakers' time capsule and cataloged all of their attendant artifacts. \"As the restoration was completed, I became increasingly focused on decoding their peculiar language and designing the translation indexes to English. It was a particularly vexing process because an optical disc was found in the 23rd chamber and it was impregnable to our technologies. We assumed that the optical disc held most of the information that the WingMakers desired us to know about them.

Shortly thereafter I became aware of what I can only describe as the presence of the WingMakers. I felt as though they were visiting me . . . even assisting me in my work . . . \" **Anne:** \"When you say 'visiting you', what evidence did you have that the WingMakers might be visiting you?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I was spending 70 hours per week working on the decoding formulas for the symbol pictures, and this went on for about 8 months. During this time I tried every conceivable combination to create an access code to the optical disc. I was convinced it was the only way to open it. I was also convinced that it was purposely made to be difficult, at least to our present-day brains. It was almost as though the struggle to decode their language was exercising a part of my brain or nervous system that was enabling me to communicate with them. \"I began to hear them speaking to me. It began as a word or two . . . then a sentence . . . maybe just once a day. It didn't make much sense . . . what I heard. But then one day I was working on a chamber painting and I saw something move in the painting. One of the symbols moved and it was absolutely not an illusion or trick of the light. Then I realized that the WingMakers could interact with me, that they were time traveling to my time and that somehow their paintings were actually portals in which they moved through time. \"It was then I began to hear their instructions, or more precisely, their thoughts. I was given mental images on how to use the Sumerian language to decode their own symbol pictures. I thought I was possibly going crazy. I felt like my mind was playing tricks on me . . . that I was working too hard and needed to take a holiday, but I listened to the voices because it seemed plausible what I was being instructed to do.

I mean about the fact that you were communicating with the WingMakers?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I kept it a secret. I wasn't sure how I would be able to explain the phenomenon and I didn't want to arouse suspicions, so I went about my business and began developing the translation indexes for the 8,110 pages of text that was discovered within the optical disc. It was essential that we had a letter-for-letter index in order to retain the meaning of their language . . . we called this translation granularity. And as I started the process of translating the optical disc, I began to see fragment images of the WingMakers . . . sort of like a holographic image that would appear and then disappear in a matter of seconds. \"They visited me a total of three times -- always in my home at night -- and told me that I had been selected to be their liaison or spokesperson. Of course I asked them why me and not Fifteen, and they said that Fifteen was unable to speak for them because he was already the pawn of the Corteum.\" **Anne:** \"Tell me about Fifteen. What is he like?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Fifteen is a genius of unparalleled intelligence and knowledge. He's the leader of the Labyrinth Group and has been since its inception in 1963. He was only 22 years old when he joined the ACIO in 1956. I think he was discovered early enough before he had a chance to establish a reputation in academic circles. He was a renegade genius who wanted to build computers that would be powerful enough to time travel. Can you imagine how a goal like that -- in the mid-1950s -- must have sounded to his professors? \"Needless to say, he was not taken seriously, and was essentially told to get in line with academic protocols and perform serious research. Fifteen came to the ACIO through an alliance it had with Bell Labs. Somehow Bell Labs heard about his genius and hired him, but he quickly out-paced their research agenda and wanted to apply his vision of time travel.\" **Anne:** \"Why was he so interested in time travel?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"No one is absolutely sure.

And his reasons may have changed over time. The accepted purpose was to develop Blank Slate Technology or BST. BST is a form of time travel that enables the re-write of history at what are called intervention points. Intervention points are the causal energy centers that create a major event like the break-up of the Soviet Union or the NASA space program. \"BST is the most advanced technology and clearly anyone who is in possession of BST, can defend themselves against any aggressor. It is, as Fifteen was fond of saying, the freedom key. Remember that the ACIO was the primary interface with extraterrestrial technologies and how to adapt them into mainstream society as well as military applications. We were exposed to ETs and knew of their agenda. Some of these ETs scared the hell out of the ACIO.\" **Anne:** \"Why?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"There were agreements between our government -- specifically the NSA -- to cooperate with an ET species commonly called the Greys in exchange for their cooperation to stay hidden and conduct their biological experiments under the cloak of secrecy. There was also a bungled technology transfer program, but that's another story . . . However, not all the Greys were operating within a unified agenda. There were certain groups of Greys that looked upon humans in much the same way as we look upon laboratory animals. \"They're abducting humans and animals, and have been for the past 48 years . . . they're essentially conducting biological experiments to determine how their genetics can be made to be compatible with human and animal genetic structure. Their interests are not entirely understood, but if you accept their stated agenda, it's to perpetuate their species. Their species is nearing extinction and they're fearful that their biological system lacks the emotional development to harness their technological prowess in a responsible manner. \"Fifteen was approached by the Greys in his role at the ACIO, and they desired to provide a full-scale technology transfer program, but Fifteen turned them down. He had already established a TTP with the Corteum, and felt that the Greys were too fractured organizationally to make good on their promises. Furthermore, the Corteum technology was superior in most regards to the Greys . . . with the possible exception of the Greys' memory implant and their genetic hybridization technologies. \"However, Fifteen and the entire Labyrinth Group carefully considered an alliance with the Greys if for no other reason than to have direct communication with regard to their stated agenda.

Fifteen liked to be in the know . . . so eventually we did establish an alliance, which consisted of a modest information exchange between us. We provided them with access to our information systems relative to genetic populations and their unique predisposition across a variety of criteria including mental, emotional, and physical behaviors; and they provided us with their genetic findings. \"The Greys, and most extraterrestrials for that matter, communicate with humans exclusively through a form of telepathy, which we called suggestive telepathy because to us it seemed that the Greys communicated in a such a way that they were trying to lead a conversation to a particular end. In other words, they always had an agenda, and we were never certain if we were a pawn of their agenda or we arrived at conclusions that were indeed our own. \"I think that's why Fifteen didn't trust the Greys. He felt they used communication to manipulate outcomes to their own best interest in favor of shared interests. And because of this lack of trust, Fifteen refused to form any alliance or TTP that was comprehensive or integral to our operations at either the ACIO or the Labyrinth Group.\" **Anne:** \"Did the Greys know of the existence of the Labyrinth Group?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I don't believe so. They were generally convinced that humans were not clever enough to cloak their agendas. Our analysis was that the Greys had invasive technologies that gave them a false sense of security as to their enemy's weaknesses. And I'm not saying that we were enemies, but we never trusted them. And this they undoubtedly knew. They also knew that the ACIO had technologies and intellects that were superior to the mainstream human population, and they had a modicum of respect -- perhaps even fear -- of our abilities. \"However, we never showed them any of our pure-state technologies or engaged them in deep dialogues concerning cosmology or new physics. They were clearly interested in our information databases and this was their primary agenda with respect to the ACIO. Fifteen was the primary interface with the Greys because they sensed a comparable intellect in him. The Greys looked at Fifteen as the equivalent of our planet's CEO.\" **Anne:** \"How did Fifteen become the leader of both the ACIO and the Labyrinth Group?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"He was the Director of Research in 1958 when the Corteum first became known to the ACIO.

In this position, he was the logical choice to assess their technology and determine its value to the ACIO. The Corteum instantly took a liking to him, and one of Fifteen's first decisions was to utilize the Corteum intelligence accelerator technologies on himself. After about three months of experimentation (most of which was not in his briefing reports to the then current Executive Director of the ACIO), Fifteen became infused with a massive vision of how to create BST. \"The Executive Director was frightened by the intensity of Fifteen's BST agenda and felt that it would divert too much of the ACIO's resources to a technology development program that was dubious. Fifteen was enough of a renegade that he enlisted the help of the Corteum to establish the Labyrinth Group. The Corteum were equally interested in BST for the similar reasons as Fifteen. The Freedom Key, as it was sometimes called, was established as the prime agenda of the Labyrinth Group, and the Corteum and Fifteen were its initial members. \"Over the next several years, Fifteen selected the cream of the crop from the scientific core of the ACIO to undergo a similar intelligence accelerator program as he had, with the intention of developing a group of scientists that could -- in cooperation with the Corteum -- successfully invent BST. The ACIO, in the opinion of Fifteen, was too controlled by the NSA and he felt the NSA was too immature in its leadership to responsibly deploy the technologies that he knew would be developed as an outgrowth of the Labyrinth Group. So Fifteen essentially plotted to take over the ACIO and was assisted by his new recruits to do so. \"This happened a few years before I became affiliated with the ACIO as a student and intern. My stepfather was very sympathetic to Fifteen's agenda and was helpful in placing Fifteen as the Executive Director of the ACIO. There was a period of instability when this transition occured, but after about a year, Fifteen was firmly in control of the agendas of both the ACIO and the Labyrinth Group. \"What I said earlier . . . that he was viewed as the CEO of the planet . . . that's essentially who he is.

He has a vision that is unique in that it is a blueprint for the creation of BST, and is closing in on the right technological and human elements that will make this possible.\" **Anne:** \"What makes BST such an imperative to Fifteen and the Labyrinth Group?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The ACIO has access to many ancient texts that contain prophecies of the earth. These have been accumulated over the past several hundred years through our network of secret organizations of which we are a part. These ancient texts are not known in academic institutions, the media, or mainstream society; they are quite powerful in their depictions of the 21st century. Fifteen was made aware of these texts early on when he became Director of Research for the ACIO, and this knowledge only fueled his desire to develop BST.\" **Anne:** \"What were these prophecies and who made them?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The prophecies were made by a variety of people who are, for the most part, unknown or anonymous, so if I told you their names you would have no recognition. You see, time travel can be accomplished by the soul from an observational level . . . that is to say, that certain individuals can move in the realm of what we call vertical time and see future events with great clarity, but they are powerless to change them. There are also those individuals who have, in our opinion, come into contact with the WingMakers and are provided messages about the future, which they had recorded in symbol pictures or extinct languages like Sumerian, Mayan, and [Chakobsan](https://www.wingmakers.us/added/chakobsan_secret_language_royalty..htm). \"The messages or prophecies that they made had several consistent strands or themes that were to occur in the early part of the 21st century, around the year 2011. Chief among these was the infiltration of the major governments of the world, including the United Nations, by an alien race. This alien race was a predator race with extremely sophisticated technologies that enabled them to integrate with the human species. That is to say, they could pose as humanoids, but they were truly a blend of human and android. \"This alien race was prophesied to establish a world government and rule as its executive power.

That anonymous prophets from God knows where and when, have seen a vision of our future take-over by a race of robots? I mean you do realize how . . . how unbelievable that sounds?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes . . . I know it sounds unbelievable . . . but there are diluted versions of this very same prophecy in our religious texts, it's just that the alien race is portrayed as the antichrist; as if the alien race was personified in the form of Lucifer. This form of the prophecy was acceptable to the gatekeepers of these texts, and so they allowed a form of the prophecy to be distributed, but the notion of an alien race was eliminated.\" **Anne:** \"Why? And who exactly is it who's censoring what we can read and can't? Are you suggesting there's a secret editorial committee that previews books before their distribution?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"This is a very complicated subject and I could spend a whole day just acquainting you with the general structure of this control of information. Most of the world's major libraries have collections of information that are not available to the general public. Only scholars are authorized to review these materials, and usually only on site. In the same way, there are manuscripts that were controversial and posited theories that were sharply different than the accepted belief systems of their day. These manuscripts or writings were banished by a variety of sources, including the Vatican, universities, governments, and various institutions. \"These writings are sought out by secret organizations that have a mission to collect and retain this information. These organizations are very powerful and well funded, and they can purchase these original manuscripts for a relatively small amount of money. Most of the writings are believed to be hocus-pocus anyway, so libraries are often very willing to part with them for an endowment or modest contribution. Also, most of these are original writings having never been published, being that they originated from a time before the printing press. \"There is a network of secret organizations that are loosely connected through the financial markets and their interests in worldly affairs.

Its holdings are exclusively in ancient manuscripts and religious texts. They have a very strong interest in prophecy because they believe in the concept of vertical time and they have a vested interest in knowing the macro-environmental changes that can effect the economy. You see for most of them, the only game on this planet that is worth playing is the acquisition of ever-increasing wealth and power through an orchestrated manipulation of the key variables that drive the economic engines of our world.\" **Anne:** \"So if they're so smart about the future, and they believe these prophecies, what are they doing to help protect us from these alien invaders?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"They help fund the ACIO. This collective of organizations has enormous wealth. More than most governments can comprehend. The ACIO provides them with the technology to manipulate money markets and rake in tens of billions of dollars every year. I don't even know the scope of their collective wealth. The ACIO also receives funding from the sale of its diluted technologies to these organizations for the sake of their own security and protection. We've devised the world's finest security systems, which are both undetectable and impregnable to outside forces like the CIA and the former KGB. \"The reason they fund the ACIO is that they believe Fifteen is the most brilliant man alive and they're aware of his general agenda to develop BST. They see this technology as the ultimate safeguard against the prophecy and their ability to retain relative control of the world and national economies. They also know Fifteen's strategic position with alien technologies and hope that between his genius, and the alien technologies that the ACIO is assimilating, that BST is possible to develop before the prophecy occurs.\" **Anne:** \"But why the sudden interest in the WingMakers' time capsule?

You have to understand that the time capsule was a collection of 23 chambers literally carved inside of a canyon wall in the middle of nowhere about 80 miles northeast of Chaco Canyon in New Mexico. It is, without a doubt, the most amazing archeological find of all time. If scientists were allowed to examine this site, with all of its artifacts intact, they would be in awe of this incredible find. \"Our preliminary assumptions were that this site was a time capsule of sorts left behind by an extraterrestrial race who had visited earth in the 8th century. But we couldn't understand why the art was so clearly representative of earth -- if it were a time capsule. The only logical conclusion was that it represented a future version of humanity. But we weren't certain of this until we figured out how to access the optical disc and translate the first set of documents from the disc. \"Once we had a clear understanding of how the WingMakers wanted to be understood, we began to test their claims by analyzing their chamber paintings, poetry, music, philosophy, and artifacts. This analysis made us fairly certain that they were authentic, which meant that they were not only time travelers, but that they were also in possession of a form of BST . . . \" **Anne:** \"Why did you assume they had BST?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"We believed it took them a minimum of two months to create their time capsule. This would have required them to open and hold open a window of time and physically operate within the selected time frame. This is a fundamental requirement of BST. Additionally, it is necessary to be able to select the intervention points with precision -- both in terms of time and space. We believed they had this capability, and they had proven it with their time capsule. \"Furthermore, the technological artifacts they had left behind were evidence of a technology that was so far in advance to our own that we couldn't even understand them. None of the extraterrestrial races we were aware of had technologies so advanced that we could not probe them, assimilate them, and reverse-engineer them. The technologies left behind in the Ancient Arrow site were totally enigmatic and impervious to our probes.

The ACIO placed its best resources on this project for more than four years. I posited the theory that the time capsule was an encoded communication device. I began to theorize that when one went through the effort to interact with the various symbol pictures and immerse themselves in the time capsule's art and philosophy, it effected the central nervous system in a way that it improved fluid intelligence. \"It was, in my opinion, the principle goal of the time capsule to boost fluid intelligence so that BST was not only able to be developed, but also utilized . . . \" **Anne:** \"You lost me. What is the relationship between BST and fluid intelligence?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"BST is a specific form of time travel. Science fiction treats time travel as something that is relatively easy to design and develop, and relatively one-dimensional. Time travel is anything but one-dimensional. As advanced in technology as the Corteum and Greys are, they have yet to produce the equivalent of BST. They are able to time travel in its elemental form, but they can't interact with the time that they travel to. That is to say, they can go back in time, but once there, they cannot alter the events of that time because they are in a passive, observational mode. \"The Labyrinth Group has conducted seven time travel experiments over the past 30 years. One clear outcome from these tests is that the person performing the time travel is an integral variable to the technology used to time travel. In other words, the person and the technology need to be precisely matched. The Labyrinth Group, for all it knows, already possesses BST, but lacks the time traveler equivalent of an astronaut who can appropriately finesse the technology in real time and make the split-second adjustments that BST requires. \"The Labyrinth Group has never seriously considered the human element of BST and how it is integral to the technology itself.

Namely, that they claimed that the 3-dimensional 5-sensory domain that humans have adjusted to, is the reason we are only using a fractional portion of our intelligence. They claimed that the time capsule would be the bridge from the 3-dimensional 5 sensory domain to the multidimensional 7-sensory domain. \"In my opinion, they were saying that in order to apply BST, the traveler needed to operate from the multidimensional 7-sensory domain. Otherwise, BST was the proverbial camel through the eye of the needle . . . or in other words . . . impossible . . . \" **Anne:** \"This at least seems plausible to me, why was it so hard to believe for the ACIO?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"This initiative was really conducted by the Labyrinth Group and not the ACIO, so I'm making that distinction just to be accurate, and not to be critical of your question. For Fifteen, it was hard to believe that a time capsule could activate or construct a bridge that would lead someone to become a traveler. This seemed like an extraordinarily remote possibility. He felt that the time capsule may hold the technology to enable BST, but he didn't believe it was merely an educational or developmental experience. \"The other outcome of immersion in the time capsule's contents was a sense of loyalty to the WingMakers' philosophy and approach to life. I found myself becoming less and less technology-centric and more and more spiritually focused. There was a sense of entrainment caused by their teaching that I couldn't explain. For whatever reason, I began to loose my objectivity as a researcher, and felt myself more of an advocate of the WingMakers.\" **Anne:** \"What do you mean by the word advocate?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Just that I was sympathetic to what I construed as the WingMakers' agenda.\" Anne: \"And what was . . . or perhaps more appropriately, what is their agenda in your opinion?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"In my opinion, their agenda is to activate, through their time capsules the new consciousness that enables BST.

But more generally, I think this new consciousness is also -- in itself -- a defensive weapon.\" **Anne:** \"But if the WingMakers are time travelers themselves, in possession of BST, why can't they deal with the hostile aliens in 2011?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I don't know. Believe me, I've thought about that one a great deal, as has the team working on the project. Perhaps BST isn't their primary concern for us, but rather helping us move from the 3-dimensional 5 sensory domain to the more potent multidimensional 7 sensory consciousness. Perhaps they're unable to access the intervention points because they lack some critical piece of information. Or perhaps they're unaware of the need because we already solved it in the year 2011. \"All I know is that we have about 6 different hypotheses, and we just don't have enough data to make a conclusion. Bear in mind that only about 7% of the text from the optical disc has been secured and translated to English.

Okay?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Okay.\" (Break for about 10 minutes . . . Resume interview) **Anne:** \"During the break I asked you about the network of secret organizations you mentioned that the ACIO is part of. Can you elaborate on this network and what its agenda is?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"There are many organizations that have noble exteriors and secret interiors. In other words, they may have external agendas that they promote to their employees, members, and the media, but there is also a secret and well hidden agenda that only the inner core of the organization is aware of. The outer rings or protective membership as they're sometimes referred to, are simply window dressing to cover-up the real agenda of the organization. \"The IMF, Foreign Relations Committee, NSA, KGB, CIA, World Bank, and the Federal Reserve are all examples of these organizational structures.

Their inner core is knitted together to form an elitist, secret society, with its own culture, economy, and communication system. These are the powerful and wealthy who have joined forces in order to manipulate world political, economic, and social systems to facilitate their own agenda. \"The agenda, as I know it, is primarily concerned with control of the world economy and its vital resources -- oil, gold, gas reserves, platinum, diamonds, etc. This secret network has utilized technology from the ACIO for the purpose of securing control of the world economy. They're well into the process of designing an integrated world economy based on a digital equivalent of paper currency. This infrastructure is in place, but it is taking more time than expected to implement because of the resistance of competitive forces who don't understand the exact nature of this secret network, but intuitively sense its existence. \"These competitive forces are generally businesses and politicians who are affiliated with the transition to a global, digital economy, but want to have some control of the infrastructure development, and because of their size and position in the marketplace can exert significant influence on this secret network. \"The only organization that I'm aware of that is entirely independent as to its agenda, and therefore the most powerful or alpha organization, is the Labyrinth Group. And they are in this position because of their pure-state technologies and the intellect of its members. All other organizations -- whether part of this secret network of organizations or powerful multinational corporations -- are not in control of the execution of their agenda. They are essentially locked in a competitive battle.\" **Anne:** \"But if this is all true, then is Fifteen essentially running this secret network?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"No. He's not interested in the agenda of this secret network. He's bored by it. He has no interest in power or money. He's only attracted to the mission of building BST to thwart hostile alien attacks that have been prophesied for 12,000 years. He believes that the only mission worth deploying the Labyrinth Group's considerable intellectual power is the development of the ultimate defensive weapon or Freedom Key. He's convinced that only the Labyrinth Group has a chance to do this before it's too late. \"You have to remember that the Labyrinth Group consists of 118 humans and approximately 200 Corteum. The intellectual ability of this group, aligned behind the focused mission of developing BST before the alien take-over, is truly a remarkable undertaking that makes the Manhattan Project look like a kindergarten social party in comparison.

And perhaps I'm exaggerating a bit for effect . . . but I'm pointing out that Fifteen is leading an agenda that is far more critical than anything that has been undertaken in the history of humankind.\" **Anne:** \"So if Fifteen is running his own agenda, and it's just as you say it is, why would you defect from such an organization?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The ACIO has a memory implant technology that can effectively eliminate select memories with surgical precision. For example, this technology could eliminate your recall of this interview without disrupting any other memories before or after. You would simply sense some missing time perhaps, but nothing more would be recalled . . . if that. \"My intuition cautioned me that I was a candidate to have this procedure because of the behaviors I was exhibiting in deference to the WingMakers. In other words, I was believed to be a sympathizer of their culture, philosophy, and mission -- what I knew of it. That made me a potential risk to the project. The Labyrinth Group, in a very real sense, feared its own membership because of their enormous intellects and ability to be cunning and clever. \"This imprinted a constant state of paranoia which meant that technology was deployed to help ensure compliance to the agenda of Fifteen. Most of these technologies were invasive, and the members of the Labyrinth Group willingly submitted to the invasion in order to more effectively cope with the paranoia. Several months ago I began to systematically shut down these invasive technologies -- in part to see what the reaction of Fifteen would be, and partly because I was tired of the paranoia. \"As I was doing this, it became obvious to me that the suspicions were escalating and it was simply a matter of time before they would ask me to subject myself to memory therapy. What I had learned from the WingMakers' time capsule is not something I want to forget. I don't want to give this information up. It has become a central part of what I believe and how I want to live out my life.\" **Anne:** \"Couldn't you have simply defected and not sought out a journalist who will want to get this story out.

I mean, couldn't you have simply gone to an island and lived out your life and never disclosed the existence of the Labyrinth Group and the WingMakers?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"You don't understand . . . the Labyrinth Group is untouchable. They have no fears about what I divulge to the media, their only concern is the terrible precedence of defection. I'm the first. No one has ever left before. And their fear is that if I defect and get away successfully, others will too. And once that happens, the mission is compromised and BST may never happen. \"Fifteen and his Directors take their mission very seriously. They are fanatics of the first order, which is both good and bad. Good in the sense that they're focused and working hard to develop BST, bad in the sense that fanaticism breeds paranoia. My reasons for seeking out a journalist like you and sharing this knowledge is that I don't want the WingMakers' time capsules to be locked away from humanity. I think its contents should be shared. I think that was their purpose.\" **Anne:** \"This will seem like a strange question, but why would the WingMakers hide their time capsule and then encode its content in such an extraordinarily complex way if they wanted this to be shared with humanity? Look . . . if the average citizen had found this time capsule . . . or even a government laboratory, what's the chance they would have been able to decipher it and access the optical disc?\" Dr. Anderson \"It's not such a strange question actually. We asked it ourselves. It seemed clear to the Labyrinth Group that it had been the chosen organization to unlock the optical disc. To answer your question directly, had the time capsule been discovered by another organization, chances are excellent that its optical disc would never be accessed. Somehow, this coincidence -- that the time capsule ended up in the hands of the Labyrinth Group -- seems to be an orchestrated process. And even Fifteen agreed with that assessment. **Anne:** \"So Fifteen felt that the WingMakers had selected the Labyrinth Group to decide the fate of the time capsule's content?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes.\" **Anne:** \"Then wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that Fifteen wanted to learn more about the contents of the time capsule before he released it to the public through the NSA or some other government agency?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"No. It's doubtful that Fifteen would ever release any information about the Ancient Arrow project to anyone outside of the ACIO.

He's not one to share information that he feels is proprietary to the Labyrinth Group, particularly if it has anything to do with BST.\" **Anne:** \"So now that you've made these statements, isn't it going to effect the ACIO. Isn't someone going to ask questions and start poking around looking for answers?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Perhaps. But I know too much about their security systems, and there's no way that a political inquiry will find them. And there's no way the secret network of organizations I mentioned earlier could exert any influence over them; they're completely indebted to the ACIO for technologies that permit them to manipulate economic markets. They . . . the ACIO and Labyrinth Group are, as I said before, untouchable. Their only concern will be defection . . . the loss of intellectual capital.\" **Anne:** \"What effect will your defection have on the ACIO or the Labyrinth Group?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Very little. Most of my contributions with respect to the time capsule have been completed. There are some other projects having to do with encryption technologies that I developed and these will be more significant in their impact.\" **Anne:** \"Can you elaborate on the WingMakers and who you think they are or represent?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I don't know who they are, but they represent themselves as human time travelers from the middle part of the 28th century. They could very well be the future version of the Labyrinth Group, or some other powerful organization. They seem to have a very well integrated sub-culture in that their language is clearly a combination of many extinct languages which they could only have knowledge of if they had access to ACIO information systems, or were indeed time travelers . . . or both, I suppose. \"Assuming they're accurately representing themselves, they are very advanced technologically. The Labyrinth Group holds that BST is the most advanced technology conceivable. Anyone who possesses it and can successfully utilize it, is clearly more advanced than our contemporary human culture or any of the extraterrestrials we are currently interfacing with.\" **Anne:** \"But if the WingMakers are so advanced technologically, why time capsules? Why not just appear one day and announce what ever it is they want to share? Why this game of hide and seek and hidden time capsules?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Their motives are not clear.

I think they planted these time capsules as their way to bring culture and technology from their time to ours. And they decided to do this by leaving behind these miraculous structures or time capsules that, once discovered, would lead people to a new philosophy or level of understanding. I think they're as interested in our philosophical outlook as our discovery of BST. Perhaps more so. \"As for why don't they just show up and give us the information . . . this, I think, is their genius. They've created seven time capsules and placed them in various parts of the world. I believe this is all part of a master plan or strategy to engage our intellects and spirits in a way that has never been done before. To demonstrate how art -- culture, science, spirituality, how all of these things are connected. I believe they want us to discover this . . . not to be told. \"If they simply arrived here in your living room and announced they were the WingMakers from the 28th century, I suspect you'd be more amazed about their personalities and physical characteristics and what life is like in their time. That's assuming you even believed them. The aspects of what they wanted to impart -- culture, art, technology, philosophy, spirituality, these items could get lost in the phenomenon of their presence. \"Also, in the text that I had translated, it was apparent that the WingMakers had time traveled on many occasions. They interacted with people from many different times and called themselves Culture Bearers. They were probably mistaken as angels or even Gods. For all we know, their reference in religious texts may indeed be frequent.\" **Anne:** \"So you think they intend that these time capsules be shared with the whole of humanity?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"You mean the WingMakers?\" **Anne:** \"Yes?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I don't know with absolute certainty. But I think they should be shared. I don't have anything to personally gain from getting this information out to the public. It goes against everything I've been trained for and places me at risk and at the very least, disrupts my lifestyle irreparably. \"To me, the Ancient Arrow time capsule is the single greatest discovery in the history of humankind.

They shouldn't be selfishly secured and retained by the ACIO or any other organization.\" **Anne:** \"Then why are these discoveries and the whole situation with ETs kept from the public?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The people who have access to this information like the sense of being unique and privileged. That's the psychology of secret organizations and why they flourish. Privileged information is the ambrosia of elitists. It gives them a sense of power, and the human ego loves to feed from the trough of power. \"They would never confess to this, but the drama of the ET contact and other mysterious or paranormal phenomenon is extremely compelling and of vital interest to anyone who is of a curious nature. Particularly politicians and scientists. And by keeping these subjects in private rooms behind closed doors with all the secrecy surrounding it, it creates a sense of drama that is missing in most other pursuits. \"So you see, Anne, the drama of secrecy is very addictive. Now of course, the reason that they would tell you for keeping this out of the public domain is for purposes of national security, economic stability, and social order. And to some extent, I suppose there's truth to that. But it's not the real reason.\" **Anne:** \"Does our President know about the ET situation?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes.\" **Anne:** \"What does he know?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"He knows about the Greys. He knows about ET bases that exist on planets within our solar system. He knows about the Martians . . . \" **Anne:** \"Good God, you're not going to tell me that little green men form Mars actually exist are you?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"If I were to tell you what I know about the ET situation, I'm afraid I would lose my credibility in your eyes. Believe me, the reality of the ET situation is much more complex and dimensional than I have time tonight to report, and if I gave you a superficial rendering, I think you'd find it impossible to believe. So I'm going to tell you partial truths, and I'm going to be very careful in my choice of words. \"The Martians are a humanoid race fashioned from the same gene pool as we. They live in underground bases within Mars, and their numbers are small.

To date, a form of telepathy has been used as the primary communication interface. However, this is not a trusted form of communication, especially in the minds of our military personnel. Virtually every radio telescope on the globe has been, at one time or another, used to communicate with ETs. This has had mixed results, but there have been successes, and our President is aware of these.\" **Anne:** \"Then is Clinton involved in the secret network you mentioned earlier?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Not knowingly. But he is clearly an important influencer, and is treated with great care by high-level operatives within the network.\" **Anne:** \"So you're saying he's manipulated?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"It depends on your definition of \"manipulation\". He can make any decision he desires, ultimately he has the power to make or influence all decisions relative to national security, economic stability, and social order. But he generally seeks inputs from his advisors. And high level operatives from this secret network advise his advisors. The network, and its operatives, seldom gets too close to political power because it's in the media fish bowl, and they disdain the scrutiny of the media and the public in general. \"Clinton, therefore is not manipulated, but simply advised. The information he receives is sometimes doctored to lead his decisions in the direction that the network feels is most beneficial to all of its members. To the extent that information is doctored, then I think you could say that the President is manipulated. He has precious little time to perform fact checking and fully evaluate alternative plans, which is why the advisors are so important and influential.\" **Anne:** \"Okay, so he's manipulated -- at least by my definition. Is this also happening with other governments like Japan and Great Britain for instance?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes. This network is not just national or even global. It extends to other races and species. So its influence is quite broad, as are the influences that impinge upon it. It is a two-way street.

Is the mob involved?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I could name most of them, but to what end? Most you wouldn't recognize or find any reference to. They are like the Labyrinth Group. Had you ever heard of it before? Of course not. Even the current management of the NSA is not aware of the ACIO. At one time, they were. But that was over 35 years ago, and people circulate out of the organization, but still retain their alliance to the secret and privileged information network. \"And no, absolutely there is no mob or organized crime influence in this network. The network uses organized crime as a shield in some instances, but organized crime operates through intimidation, not stealth. Its leaders possess average intelligence and associate with information systems that are obsolete and therefore non-strategic. The organized crime network is a much less sophisticated version of the network I was referring to.\" **Anne:** Okay, let's get back to the WingMakers for a moment . . . and I apologize for my scattered questions tonight. It's just that there's so much I want to know that I'm finding it very difficult to stay on the subject of the Ancient Arrow project.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"You don't need to apologize. I understand how this must sound to you. I'm still wide awake, so you don't have to worry about the time.\" **Anne:** \"Okay. Let's talk a little bit about your impressions or insights into the WingMakers' philosophy and culture.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"First of all, again I want to remind you that only a fraction of their writings have been translated. So whatever insights I may have, are limited by a partial understanding -- at best -- of their culture and philosophy. Also, I want to remind you that the WingMakers may not represent the broader culture and philosophy of their time. Our interpretation was that they represented a subset or subculture of their time. \"With those qualifications, I'll say that the WingMakers have the benefit of about 750 additional years of evolutionary thought.

I haven't heard you talk about it before?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Each galaxy has a Federation or loose-knit organization that includes all sentient life forms on every planet within the galaxy. It would be the equivalent of the United Nations of the galaxy. This Federation has both invited members and observational members. Invited members are those species that have managed to behave in a responsible manner as stewards of their planet and combine both the technology, philosophy, and culture that enable them to communicate as a global entity that has a unified agenda. \"Observational members are species who are fragmented and are still wrestling with one another over land, power, money, culture, and a host of other things that prevent them from forming a unified world government. The human race on planet earth is such a species, and for now, it is simply observed by the Federation, but is not invited into its policy making and economic systems.\" **Anne:** \"Are you saying that our galaxy has a form of government and a economic system?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, but if I tell you about this you will lose track of what I really wanted to share with you about the WingMakers . . . \" **Anne:** \"I'm sorry for taking us off track again. But this is just too amazing to ignore. If there's a Federation of cooperative, intelligent species, why couldn't they take care of these hostile aliens in the year 2011 or at least help us?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The Federation doesn't intrude on a species of any kind. It is truly a facilitating force not a governing force with a military presence. That is to say, they will observe and help with suggestions, but they will not intervene on our behalf.\" **Anne:** \"Is this like the Prime Directive as it's portrayed on Star Trek?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"No. It's more like a parent who wants its children to learn how to fend for themselves so they can become greater contributors to the family.\" **Anne:** \"But wouldn't a hostile take-over of earth effect the Federation?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Most definitely.

And the Corteum are IMs or invited members and they are helping us.

And furthermore, so does everyone within the Labyrinth Group -- including Fifteen. We've seen far too many evidences of God or a higher intelligence that we can't dispute its existence. It would be impossible to deny based on what we've observed in our laboratories.\" **Anne:** \"So God decides when we're ready to responsibly use BST. Do you think he'll decide before 2011?\" (I admit there was a tone of sarcasm in this question.) **Dr. Anderson:** \"You see, Anne, the Labyrinth Group is hopeful that the readiness of the entire species isn't the determining factor, but that a subgroup within the species might be allowed to acquire the technology as long as it was able to protect it from all non-approved forces. This subgroup is hoped to be the Labyrinth Group, and it's one of the reasons why Fifteen has invested so much the ACIO's resource into security systems.\" **Anne:** \"You didn't really answer my question though . . .

Do you think it can be developed in 12 years?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I don't know. Certainly I hope so, but BST is not our only line of defense. The Labyrinth Group has devised many defensive weapons, not all of which I'll describe to you. The alien race foretold in prophecy is not even aware of earth at this time. They originate from a different galaxy altogether. The prophecy is that they will send probes to our galaxy and determine that earth is the best genetic library and natural resource repository in the Milky Way that can be quickly assimilated. They will visit earth in 2011. \"The prophecy says they will befriend our governments and utilize the United Nations as an ally. They will set about orchestrating a unified world government through the United Nations. And when the first elections are held in 2018, they will overtake the United Nations and rule as the world government. This will be done through trickery and deception. \"I mention these prophecies because they're quite specific as to the dates, and so we have the equivalent of 19 years to produce and deploy BST. Ideally, yes, we'd like to have it completed in order to interface with the intervention points for this race when it decided to crossover into our galaxy. We would like to cause them to choose a different galaxy or abandon their quest altogether. But it may be impossible to determine this intervention point. \"You see, the memory implant technology developed by the Labyrinth Group can be utilized in conjunction with BST. We can define the intervention point when our galaxy was selected as a target to colonize, enter that time and place, and impose a new memory on their leadership to divert them from our galaxy.\" **Anne:** \"Either I'm getting tired, or this just got a lot more confusing . . . You're saying that the Labyrinth Group already has scenarios to nip this thing in the bud . . . to prevent this marauding group of aliens from even entering our galaxy? How do you know where they are?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"To answer your question, I would need to explain with much more granularity the precise nature of BST and how it differs from time travel.

I'll try to explain it as simply as I can, but it's complex, and you need to let go of some of your preconceived notions of time and space. \"You see . . . time is not exclusively linear as when it's depicted in a timeline. Time is vertical with every moment in existence stacked upon the next and all coinciding with one another. In other words, time is the collective of all moments of all experience simultaneously existing within non-time, which is usually referred to as eternity. \"Vertical time infers that one can select a moment of experience and use time and space as the portal through which they make their selection real. Once the selection is made, time and space become the continuity factor that changes vertical time into horizontal time or conventional time . . . \" **Anne:** \"You lost me. How is vertical time different from horizontal time?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Vertical time has to do with the simultaneous experience of all time, and horizontal time has to do with the continuity of time in linear, moment-by-moment experiences.\" **Anne:** \"So you're saying that every experience I've ever had or will ever have exists right now? That the past and future are actually the present, but I'm just too brainwashed to see it?\" Dr. Anderson \"As I said before, this is a complex subject, and I'm afraid that if I spend the time explaining it to you now, we will lose track of more important information like BST. Perhaps if I were to explain the nature of BST, most of your questions would be answered in the process.\" **Anne:** \"Okay, then tell me what BST is? Given what the acronym stands for, I assume it means something like . . . wipe out an event and change the course of history. Right?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Let me try to explain it this way. Time travel can be observational in nature. In this regard, the ACIO and other organizations -- even individual citizens -- have the ability to time travel. But this form of time travel is passive. It's not equivalent to BST. In order to precisely alter the future you have to be able to interact with vertical time, paging through it like a book, until you find the precise page or intervention point relevant to your mission. \"This is where it gets so complex because to interact with vertical time means you will alter the course of horizontal time.

And understanding the alterations and their scope and implication requires extremely complex modeling. This is why the Labyrinth Group aligned itself with the Corteum -- its computing technology has processing capabilities that are about 3,200 times more powerful than our best supercomputers. \"This enables us to create organic, highly complex scenario models. These models tell us the most probable intervention points once we've gathered the relevant data, and what the most probable outcomes will be if we invoke a specific scenario. Like most complex technologies, BST is a composite technology having five discrete and inter-related technologies. \"The first technology is a specialized form of remote viewing. This is the technology that enables a trained operative to mentally move into vertical time and observe events and even listen to conversations related to an inquiry mode. The operative is invisible to all people within the time they are traveling to, so it's perfectly safe and unobtrusive. The intelligence gained from this technology is used to determine the application of the other four technologies. This is the equivalent of intelligence gathering. \"The second technology that is key to BST is the equivalent of a memory implant. The ACIO refers to this technology as a Memory Restructure Procedure or MRP. MRP is the technology that allows a memory to be precisely eliminated in the horizontal time sequence and a new memory inserted in its place. The new memory is welded to the existing memory structure of the recipient. \"You see, events -- small and large -- occur from a single thought, which becomes a persistent memory, which in turn, becomes a causal energy center that leads the development and materialization of the thought into reality... into horizontal time. MRP can remove the initial thought and thereby eliminate the persistent memory that causes events to occur. \"The third technology consists of defining the intervention point. In every major decision, there are hundreds if not thousands of intervention points in horizontal time as a thought unfolds and moves through its development phase. However, in vertical time, there is only one intervention point or what we sometimes called the causal seed. In other words, if you can access vertical time intelligence you can identify the intervention point that is the causal seed. This technology identifies the most probable intervention points and ranks their priority. It enables focus of the remaining technologies. \"The fourth technology is related to the third.

In other words, which intervention point -- if applied to a scenario model -- produces the desired outcome with the least disruption to unrelated events? The scenario modeling technology is a key element of BST because without it, BST could cause significant disruption to a society or entire species. \"The fifth and most puzzling technology is the interactive time travel technology. The Labyrinth Group has the first four technologies in a ready state waiting for the interactive time travel technology to become operational. This technology requires an operative, or a team of operatives, to be able to physically move into vertical time and be inserted in the precise space and time where the optimal intervention point has been determined. From there the operatives must perform a successful MRP and return to their original time in order to validate mission success.\" **Anne:** \"I've been listening to this explanation and I think I even understand some of it, but it sounds so surreal to me, Dr. Anderson. I'm . . . I'm at a loss to explain how I'm feeling right now. This is all so strange. It's so big . . . enormous . . . I can't believe this is going on somewhere on the same planet that I live. Before this interview, I was worried about balancing my checkbook and when my damn car would ever be fixed . . . this is just too strange . . . \" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Maybe we should take another break and warm up our coffee.\" **Anne:** Signing off for a coffee break . . . (Break for about 10 minutes . . .

My classification is 12x and so I get diluted reports and quite possibly misinformation with regard to our scenario modeling. About all I can tell you is that we know -- from both the prophecies and our remote viewing technology -- a significant amount of information about this race. \"For example, we know that it hails from a galaxy that our Hubble telescope has examined as thoroughly as possible and we've charted it as extensively as possible. We know that it is 2.6 million light years away and that the species is a synthetic race -- a mixture of genetic creation and technology. It possesses a hive mentality, but individual initiative is still appreciated as long as it is aligned with the explicit objectives of its leaders. \"Because it is a synthetic race, it can be produced in a controlled environment and its population can be increased or decreased depending on the whims of its leaders. It is . . . \" **Anne:** \"Didn't you just say it's from a galaxy that's 2.6 million light years away? I mean, assuming they were able to travel at the speed of light, it would take them 2.6 million years to come to our planet. And you said earlier that they didn't even know about earth yet . . . right?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The Corteum come from a planet that is 15,000 light years away, and yet they can come and go between their planet and our planet in the time it takes us to travel to the moon -- a mere 250,000 miles away. Time is not linear, nor is space. Space is curved, as your physicists have recently learned, but it can be artificially curved through displacement energy fields that collapse space and the illusion of distance. Light particles do not displace or collapse space, they ride a linear line through space, but there are forms of electromagnetic energy that can modify or collapse space. And this technology makes space travel -- even between galaxies -- not only possible, but also relatively easy. **Anne:** \"Why did you say, 'your physicists' just then?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I apologize . . . it's just a part of the conditioning of being isolated from mainstream society.

What do they want? I mean . . . why travel such a far distance to rule earth?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"This seems such a funny question to me. Excuse me for laughing. It's just that humans do not understand how special earth is. It is truly, as planets are concerned, a special planet. It has such a tremendous bio-diversity and a complex range of ecosystems. Its natural resources are unique and plentiful. It's a genetic library that's the equivalent of a galactic zoo. \"The aliens that are coming desire to own this planet and add it to its colonization plans. As I've already mentioned, this is a synthetic race. A species that can clone itself and fabricate more and more of its population to serve the purpose of its colonization program. However, it desires more diversity, and earth will represent an opportunity for it to diversify.\" **Anne:** \"So where are they right now?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I assume they remain in their homeworld . . . to the best of our knowledge they haven't crossed into our galaxy yet.\" **Anne:** \"And when they arrive, how will the ACIO or Labyrinth Group know?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"As I said, the ACIO has already done a significant amount of intelligence gathering and even selected scenarios and intervention points.\" **Anne:** \"So what's the plan?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The most logical approach would be to travel to the time and place when the casual thought was born to explore the Milky Way, and through MRP, expunge it from the memory of the race. Essentially, convince them that of all the wonderful, life-inhabited galaxies, the Milky Way is a poor choice. The Labyrinth Group would implant a memory that would lead this race to conclude that our galaxy was not worthy of their serious exploration.\" **Anne:** \"So some other galaxy becomes their next target?

I am, though, confident in his approach and its efficacy.\" **Anne:** \"But you said earlier that you feared for your life . . . that Fifteen is probably trying to hunt you down even as we speak. Why are so you confident in his sense of morality?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"In the case of Fifteen, morality doesn't really play a role. He operates in his own code of ethics, and I don't pretend to understand them all. But I'm quite certain of his mission to avert take-over by this alien race, and I'm equally confident that he will choose the best intervention point with the least influence to the overall species of this alien race. It is the only way he can acquire BST. And he knows this.\" **Anne:** \"We're back to God again, aren't we?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes.\" **Anne:** \"So God and Fifteen have this all figured out?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"There's no certainty if that's what you mean. And there's no alliance between Fifteen and God, at least not that I'm aware of. This is part of the belief system that the Labyrinth Group formalized along the path to developing BST. It's logical to us that God is all-powerful and all knowing because it operates as the universal mind field that interpenetrates all life, all time, all space, all energy . . . and all existence. This consciousness is impartial, but certainly it's in a position to deny things or, perhaps more accurately, delay their acquisition.\" **Anne:** \"If God exists everywhere as you say, then why wouldn't he stop this marauding alien race and keep them in their place?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Again, a fair question, but one that I can't answer.

It was Fifteen's belief that God orchestrated nothing but understood everything in the universal mind. \"Remember when I was talking about the galactic mind?\" **Anne:** \"Yes.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"There are planetary minds, solar minds, galactic minds, and a singular universal mind. The universal mind is the mind of God. Each galaxy has a collective consciousness or mind field that is the aggregation of all of the species present within that galaxy. The universal mind creates the initial blueprint for each of the galaxies related to its galactic mind or composite consciousness. This initial blueprint creates the pre-disposition of the genetic code seeded within a galaxy. We, the Labyrinth Group, believed that God designed each galaxy's genetic code with a different set of pre-dispositions or behaviors.\" **Anne:** \"And why would this be so?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"So diversity is amplified across the universe, which in turn permits God to experience the broadest continuum of life.\" **Anne:** \"Why is this so important?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Because God loves to experiment and devise new ways of experiencing life in all of its dimensions. This may very well be the purpose of the universe.\" **Anne:** \"You know you're talking like a preacher? You speak like these are certainties or truths that are just self-evident . . . but they're just beliefs aren't they?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, they're beliefs, but beliefs are important don't you think?\" **Anne:** \"I'm not sure . . . I mean my beliefs are changing every day. They're not stable or anchored in some deep truth that's constant like bedrock or something.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Well, that's good . . . I mean that they change. The Labyrinth Group evolved a very specific set of beliefs -- some of these were based on our experiences as a result of the Corteum intelligence enhancement technologies, some were based from ancient texts that were studied, and some were borrowed from our ET contacts.\" **Anne:** \"So now you're going to tell me our friendly neighborhood ETs are religious zealots?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"No . . . no, I don't mean that they were trying to convert us to their beliefs, we simply asked and they related them to us.

And I wish I could answer them all, but here again, I don't know the answer. I would assume the federation and the WingMakers operate in unison and have a mutually beneficial relationship, but I'm not . . . \" **Anne:** \"But if you can use your remote viewing technology to eavesdrop on this alien race in an entirely different galaxy, why can't you observe the WingMakers and the federation?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Actually, we've tried our remote viewing technology on the WingMakers. It was one of the first things we tried. But we got nothing. In fact, it was the first time when our technology was completely ineffective. We assumed that the WingMakers had developed some form of security that prevented remote viewing. But we weren't sure. \"As for the federation, they're fully aware of our remote viewing capability, and in fact, we can't eavesdrop on the federation because they're able to detect our presence if we observe them through remote viewing. So, in deference to their privacy and trusting their agenda, we never imposed our technology on the federation . . . perhaps only once or twice.\" **Anne:** \"You'll have to forgive me Dr. Anderson, but I find all of this a little hard to believe. We've skimmed the surface of about a hundred different subjects through the course of this interview, and I keep coming back to the same basic issue: Why?

They aren't equipped with the knowledge to stand before the media and explain what's happening. They fear that they would be made to appear feeble by the fact that they only know pieces of what's going on. It's like the story of the three blind men who are all touching different parts of an elephant and each thinks it is something different. \"Fifteen withholds his knowledge from the media and the general public because he doesn't want to be seen as a savior of humanity -- the next messiah. And he especially doesn't want to be seen as some fringe lunatic who should be locked up, or worse yet, assassinated because he is so misunderstood. The instant he stepped forward with what he knows, he would lose his privacy and his ability to discover BST. And this he'll never do. \"Most people who know about this greater reality are fearful of stepping into the public scrutiny because of the fear of being ridiculed.

I honestly don't know. I don't pretend to have the answers. But somehow humans need to be more demanding of their governments and even the media. Because the media is a big part of this manipulation, though they're not aware of how they've become pawns of the information cover-up. \"The truth of the matter is that no one entity is to blame. Elitists have always existed since the dawn of man. There have always been those who had more aggression and power and would dominate the weaker of the species. This is the fundamental structure that has bred this condition of information cover-up, and it happens in every sector of society, including religion, government, military, science, academia, and business. \"No one created this playing field to be level and equal for all.

You really need to stand inside these chambers and feel the purposeful nature of this time capsule. \"I think if I could do that, you would believe everything I've said.\" **Anne:** \"Could you take someone like me to the site?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"No. Unfortunately, the security system surrounding this site is so sophisticated, the site, for all intents and purposes, is invisible.

It's been developed for more than 10 years. It's used much more frequently than people realize. And I'm not talking about its diluted version of stealth technology; I'm talking about the ability to superimpose a reality construction over an existing reality that is desired to be hidden. \"For instance, you could walk right up to the entrance of the Ancient Arrow site and see nothing that would look like an entrance or opening. To the observer it would be a flat wall of rock. And it would have all the characteristics of rock -- texture, hardness and so forth, but it's actually a reality construction that is superimposed on the mind of the observer. In reality the entrance is there, but it can't be observed because the mind has been duped into the projected reality construction.\" **Anne:** \"Great, so there's no way to enter this site and experience this time capsule . . . so once again, us little humans are prevented from the experience of proof.

These are the exact transcripts from her tape-recorded interviews and are probably the best way to understand the nature of the discovery and its implications. There are three additional interview transcripts that will be added to the site as soon as Anne is able. At the present (July 1998), Dr. Anderson has not been heard from for nearly 5 months, but it is hoped that additional interviews will be able to be conducted in the near future.** Second Interview of Dr. Anderson By Anne What follows is a session I recorded of Dr. Anderson on December 28, 1997. He gave permission for me to record his answers to my questions. This is the transcript of that session. This was one of five times I was able to tape-record our conversations. I have preserved these transcripts precisely as they occurred. No editing was performed, and I've tried my best to include the exact words, phrasing, and grammar used by Dr. Anderson. (It's recommended that you read the [December 27, 1997 interview](iview1.shtml) before reading this one.) **Anne:** \"Before we begin tonight's session, I wanted to tell you that I've listened to last night's tape and have used it to formulate some new questions. I noticed that I was all over the place with regard to my questions, and tonight I'm going to try and stay more focused. So I'm just warning you that if I get off track again, remind me to stay on course. Okay?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I'll certainly do my best... although I'm not sure what your course is.\" **Anne:** \"Well, I guess I'd like to stay more centered on the WingMakers and their time capsule.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"That's fine with me.\" **Anne:** \"Okay, last night you mentioned that the WingMakers had appointed you to be their liaison. You also said that they wanted you to be their liaison because Fifteen was a pawn of the Corteum. Can you elaborate on that?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I was apparently selected to be their spokesperson in this time, and not only help translate their text, paintings, and symbol pictures, but also help in bringing these things to the public's attention. In other words, I don't think the WingMakers desired the contents of their time capsules to be held in a secret repository deep within the bowels of the Labyrinth Group. \"As for Fifteen, I think the WingMakers felt he was too involved with the Corteum to objectively assess the WingMakers' time capsule and determine how to bring it to the public's attention.

Bear in mind, Fifteen has a single-minded ambition to successfully deploy BST (an acronym that stands for Blank Slate Technology). To the extent the WingMakers' time capsule accelerated or facilitated this development, Fifteen would be extremely interested in the WingMakers. To the extent they did not, it would likely be his objective to seal the project and move it to the back burner of the Labyrinth Group's research agenda. \"Culture and philosophy were important to Fifteen, but only to the extent of personal enhancement . . . they didn't have a place in the Labyrinth Group's research agenda unless it somehow had direct bearing on developing interactive time travel.\" **Anne:** \"But didn't you say that in the process of decoding and translating their language that your intelligence was effected in a way that would make it more adaptive to the stresses of time travel?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I don't think it was a question of intelligence. I think it was more of a multidimensional awareness or ability to sense the higher circuits of consciousness, which I suppose, is a form of intelligence. It seemed to me that the WingMakers were particularly concerned with developing a holistic sensory perception, and that the reason they encoded their language was to develop these higher senses. Again, I asserted that the ability to interactively time travel requires a 7 sensory, multidimensional perspective. It can't be done in the 3-dimensional 5 sensory context of normal human awareness.\" **Anne:** \"But still . . . if you had these enhancements to your consciousness or intelligence and you thought they were integral to the deployment of BST, why wouldn't Fifteen listen to you?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"He did listen . . . it's just that he didn't agree with my theory. The moment I mentioned that I had an interaction with the WingMakers, he seemed to discount my assertions.\" **Anne:** \"What was it about your interactions that seemed to persuade him that you were misguided or not trustworthy?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I was the first one to read their language and understand it. Once we unlocked the optical disc, we printed out over 8,100 pages of symbol pictures like the ones contained in their art work, except much more varied, and, in some instances, much more complex.

There were 23 chapters of text or symbol pictures -- each consisting of about 350 pages. I decoded the first segment or chapter of this text using a version of the Sumerian translation index I had set-up for the access code to the optical disc. \"However, as I began to decode and translate the text I began to gain an understanding into the WingMakers' culture. They had philosophical discourses that were fascinating to read . . . \" **Anne:** \"I read the ones you left for me, I didn't understand most of what they said. They seemed too abstract. They did have an effect on me though . . . they managed to put me to sleep every time I tried to read them.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I know they're a little intense, but you have to admit, they're very interesting if for no other reason than they're representative of how humans -- or at least some humans -- will believe 750 years from now. They're literally the only records we have of our future belief systems. \"But what I was going to say before, is that they not only had philosophy, they also had poetry and musical notations. So I began to theorize that each chamber had a set of objects: a painting, poem, philosophical discourse, musical composition, and a technological artifact that held a specific message or theme. And the time capsule was designed to be understood by linking these themes together just as I had linked the 23 master symbols from the paintings to access the optical disc.\" **Anne:** \"And what do you think was the message they were trying to convey?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I don't know. We only finished decoding 2 entire chambers when I had left. And since leaving, I've managed to decode most of the third chamber as well. However, the technological artifact that was found in each of the chambers remains a mystery. In most instances, they can't even be probed by our technology to determine where or how to activate them. **Anne:** \"But you have a copy of the 8100 pages of text?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes.\" **Anne:** \"And can I see it?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, but it's not something I carry around with me.\" **Anne:** \"I still don't understand why all the complicated encoding and decoding and Sumerian translation indexes.

Why would they change so dramatically in another 750 years?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I can only speculate that if the purpose of the time capsule were to somehow activate higher circuits of learning or intelligence, then perhaps the time capsule would be purposely encoded in order to force a decoding. And in this process of decoding, the activation is triggered. If they did it in simple English or some other language of the day, we'd miss the activation of our higher senses. That's my hypothesis.\" **Anne:** \"You said last night that only about 7% of the text is translated thus far, and that's after months of working on it after discovering the translation indexes. If you have such powerful computing technology, why can't the Labyrinth Group decode and translate the entire volume of text in a matter of a keystroke?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"It's more complicated than that. The WingMakers' language is based on 98 different symbol pictures instead of the 26 found in our own alphabet. The computer-based translation indexes were applied to the entire text, but we found so many inconsistencies in the semantics that it became literally impossible to rely on the computer versions. Their language is much more precise than our own and therefore more sensitive to semantic accuracy. \"Because of the semantic differentials it was necessary to cross-check the translation manually. Which meant that about every 5th word needed to be tested or verified for its meaning in the context of the sentence and paragraph structure it was placed into. And the only way this could be done effectively is with myself and another colleague who was helping in the manual translation.\" **Anne:** \"Still it seems to have taken you an awful long time to complete just 7% of their text . . . \" **Dr. Anderson:** \"But for every page of text, we invested the equivalent of about 20 hours of painstaking cross-checking to ensure the accuracy of the translation. The translation is the key to the usefulness of the time capsule, and it doesn't make any sense to rush the translation and draw wrong conclusions because of semantic or translation errors. \"In our translation indexes there are many dimensions where errors can be made and at each level, if they're not caught, they compound or amplify the translation errors at the next level.

For example, there are indexes written for each letter or symbol picture, there is one for each combination of letters -- which for an alphabet of 98 characters -- you can imagine the variety of combinations. There are also indexes for sentence structure and one for semantic context. On top of these variables, there must be considerations given to the linearity of the language or its sequence. \"Furthermore, as I stated earlier, the text consisted of more than mere prose There was also musical notations and poetry. So we required, for each of the 23 segments of text, a translation that was capable of discerning all the nuance of the prose and also the poetry and music.\" Anne\" \"Good, I'm glad you brought up the music because I don't understand that element of the time capsule.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"How do you mean that?\" **Anne:** \"Was the music already on the optical disc and you simply captured it from the disc, or was it basically produced by the Labyrinth Group based on the musical notations?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Actually, it was a bit of a combination of the two. Their musical notations were very precise and they left digital samples of each of their instruments -- even vocals. So we simply translated their digital samples to a MIDI standard and produced our own version of their music. Of all the things that we've translated, the music was the easiest to produce, but also the one that we're not sure as to its accuracy.\" **Anne:** \"So were you involved in the music translations as well?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes. I helped in the initial discovery of their musical notation and helped with the translation indexes. I wasn't involved in its production phase, though I was very curious as to what it would sound like.\" **Anne:** \"Can I hear any of these compositions?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, of course. When I left, the ACIO had successfully translated 10 of the 23 music compositions. I have these. And they've been converted to both CD and cassette standards. I also have complete files of the remaining 13 compositions in their raw, de-constructed form.\" **Anne:** \"How were they produced exactly?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Do you mean that technically or artistically?\" **Anne:** \"I guess both.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"On the technical end we needed to step their samples down to a resolution of 384-bit in order to use them in our computer systems.

When we first heard the samples of instrumentation, we were somewhat relieved to hear familiar sounds. There were some that were different, but for the most part, the digital samples that were encoded on the optical disc were the same as contemporary musical instruments heard around the world. \"Once we had captured their samples and organized them into octaves, we took their compositional notations and essentially let the computer select the digital instrumentation based on their samples. Eventually this all had to be stepped down to a 24-bit commercial CD mastering system, which was them pressed on a CD and recorded onto a cassette tape. \"As for the artistic production, there really wasn't much that we did. The computers did all the interpretative work and essentially performed the production for that matter. We had some of our staff perform overdubs on various versions to experiment with the compositions. The music was very popular, particularly when you listened to it at a sampling resolution of 384-bit.\" **Anne:** \"Didn't anyone wonder why the time capsule included a musical construction kit instead of just having a recording of the music . . . I mean why have us bring an artistic interpretation to their music?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Everything was wondered about in the Ancient Arrow project. Everything. \"We didn't know why they did it the way they did it, but again our hypothesis was that the WingMakers didn't have a way to bring their music into our world because we lacked the technology to listen to it. So they disassembled their music into -- as you put it -- a construction kit, which enabled us to reconstruct the music so it could be listened to on our technology. It's the most logical reason. \"There were several of us who were able to experience chambers one and two as a completely integrated form of expression and it was a very powerful experience . . . to say the least. When you hear the music in 384-bit resolution with the original paintings, standing inside the actual chamber in which they were placed, it is a very moving and spiritual experience. Unlike any I've ever had.\" **Anne:** \"In what way?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Just that the sense of being pulled out of your body and into the portal of the painting is irresistible.

There is a very strong sense of movement into and beyond these paintings, and the music and paintings are only two of the art forms, the third, the poetry is also part of the experience.\" **Anne:** \"So tell me about the poetry.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The poems are expressive of a wide range of subjects. To most of us at the ACIO, they could have been written by any contemporary poet. There was really nothing that caused them to stand out as representing a culture 750 years in our future. Many of the same themes about spirituality, love, relationships, and death were evident in their poems as well. Most of the poetry has been translated because there isn't much text involved . . . at least compared to their philosophical and scientific papers. There're actually two poems for each chamber painting, so there's a total of 46 poems. **Anne:** \"That's interesting. Everything else -- the paintings, music, artifacts, philosophy -- is placed one-per-chamber. Why do you suppose they've placed two poems in each chamber instead of one?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"In my opinion it was to provide a broader perspective into the particular theme represented by a specific chamber. The poetry appears to be designed in such a way to provide both a personal and universal perspective in each of the chambers . . . but again, it's just a working hypothesis at this time.\" **Anne:** \"I assume from the examples you left me, that the poetry is also a bit less abstract when compared to their philosophy and paintings. Have you considered how the poetry is related to the paintings?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes. And I believe the poetry and the paintings have the strongest connection of all the objects in each of the chambers. I think the paintings illustrate -- in some subtle way -- the themes represented in the poetry. In some instances, when the painting represents an assemblage of abstract objects, the poetry is also more abstract. When the painting is more illustrative, the poetry seems more like prose.\" **Anne:** Are you saying then that the poetry carries the central meaning of each chamber?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I'm not sure, but it does seem that the poetry is somehow implied symbolically in the chamber painting that it's associated with. The problem is that the poetry is so highly interpretive that it's impossible to know precisely what its theme is intended to be.

Also, and I should have mentioned this before, but the grammar and syntax of their language is very different from ours in that they have no end to their language punctuated with periods. \"In other words, if we made a literal translation, there would be no sentence structure . . . more like a logic syntactical approach . . . which simply means an abstracted language flow which would be, for most people, very difficult to understand. When I was doing the translations of the poetry, I placed it in a sentence structure that fragmented its meaning so that it could be better understood. Perhaps in the process I unintentionally changed the meaning, but it was either that or the poetry would be too abstracted to understand.\" **Anne:** \"Is there a connection between the poetry and the philosophy of each chamber?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"My colleague and I felt that all of the objects within a specific chamber were connected . . . probably in ways we couldn't fathom. We were constantly worried that our translation indexes were somehow inaccurate, and that this was limiting our ability to see the linkages between the various objects. And of course the most puzzling connection was the technology artifacts because we had no way to probe or reach any conclusions about their purpose or function.\" **Anne:** \"Let's talk a little bit about the artifacts found in each chamber. The only one that I've really heard about was the one found in the 23rd chamber, the optical disc. I know you've shown me some photos of the others, but could you describe them better with respect to how you analyzed them and what, if any, ideas you have as to their connection to the overall time capsule?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The optical disc is the only artifact of the 23 we found, that the AICO had successfully accessed, at least that I'm aware of. The other artifacts were all taken to the Labyrinth Group's research laboratory in Virginia immediately after they were discovered. These were never acknowledged to anyone below a 12x clearance. There were rumors within the broader ACIO that there were technologies within the time capsule, but these never gained any serious consideration, and certainly not by the NSA. \"The technology artifacts were of the greatest curiosity to Fifteen because they represented the possible solutions to BST.

Hence, Fifteen logically considered these particular artifacts could represent a piece of the puzzle that had alluded him thus far.\" **Anne:** \"But what I've seen don't look very advanced or based in high technology. They could pass for simple crystals or rocks . . . or something organic. Why was the Labyrinth Group so convinced they held the keys to time travel?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The crystalline structures that were found, in most cases, did look quite ordinary in the sense that when they were examined by the eye, they appeared to be crystals, but when you looked at them through various molecular and atomic analyses, it was obvious that they were manmade objects. In other words, they were synthetic crystalline structures, and we held the hypothesis that they were encoded with information much like the optical disc or the paintings. We also held the hypothesis that they were potentially connected to the optical disc since it was the last of the artifacts and seemed the equivalent of a keystone or master key.\" **Anne:** \"Did any of the text translated from the optical disc refer to the other artifacts?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"No, to our chagrin, there were no references . . . at least so far.\" **Anne:** \"You never really answered my question about whether you felt there was a connection between the technology artifacts and the specific cultural artifacts related to each chamber.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Sorry, I guess it's my turn to get side-tracked tonight. Anyway, yes, there were connections . . . we were certain of this, but at the same time, because we couldn't get inside the artifacts and probe them, we couldn't prove our theory. Consequently, we placed all of our time and energy on the optical disc because is seemed to be the most important of the artifacts as well as the one we had the best chance of accessing through our technology.\" **Anne:** \"Yet, when you say that, didn't you also tell me earlier that it took over a year to figure out how to access the optical disc?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, that's true.

But what I was going to say, is that these artifacts seemed to have molecular-based computer systems that activated by a specific human touch. And we weren't certain whether it was literally a specific human, or a specific type of human, or perhaps any human in a specific state of emotion or mind. We had 115 possible experiments developed for testing and all failed. So eventually, we gave up on accessing the organically based artifacts and concentrated our energies and technologies on accessing the optical disc.\" **Anne:** \"But this is real odd . . . why would human DNA be inside a technology . . . and this talk about synthetic crystals . . . it leaves me cold.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"We had some similar misgivings until we were able to translate some of the text within the optical disc. The philosophical papers from chambers one and two convinced us that the WingMakers could indeed be authentic and we had no other reason to disbelieve their story. That's not to say that we suspended all of our disbelief or caution, but the philosophy was a breakthrough to our understanding of their perceived mission with contemporary humankind.\" **Anne:** \"I don't know . . . I read the first two philosophy papers you left for me, and I could believe that they're from an alien race. I could also believe that they're from a deceptive race that uses philosophy and all this cultural stuff to lull us into believing they're benevolent when in fact they're not at all. I mean isn't that part of the prophecy you spoke about last night?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Well, I see you remain the ever-skeptical journalist. I'm actually glad to see that reaction. \"Anne, all I can tell you is that when you take into account all of the cultural artifacts found within the Ancient Arrow site, and you immerse yourself in their content and philosophy, it's hard to believe they originate from evil intent.\" **Anne:** \"Unless that's exactly what they wanted you to believe.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Perhaps.

The Labyrinth Group -- and I'm including the Corteum when I say that -- was in agreement that it was an authentic disclosure and felt confident that we were not dealing with deception. But we never close the door to that possibility. Our security and operations directors put contingency plans in place in the event evidence was accumulated that increased the probability of fraud or deception.\" **Anne:** \"One of things that seemed odd to me, having looked at the photographs of the chamber paintings, was how similar they all were. They were clearly done by the same artist . . . or I suppose a group of artists. But when I think of a time capsule, I would think you would include a variety of art from a diverse assortment of artists that represent a variety of perspectives and so forth. And that isn't the case here. Why do you suppose?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I don't think their motive was to inform us about their artists or the diversity of their artistic culture. I think they intend that the art function initially as a form of communication, and subsequently as a form of time travel or moving out of the body consciousness. The continuity of the 23 paintings seen as a whole seem to be inviting the consciousness of the observer to quite literally step into the world of the WingMakers. As though they were portals, and I've experienced this myself. \"The paintings are incredibly brilliant in their colors. You really can't imagine how much impact they have when you see them in person, particularly after their cleaning and restoration was completed. But even when they were first discovered without any touch-up, it was eerie how luminous they were and vibrant in their colors after 1,150 years. There were many times when those of us who were involved in restoration and cataloging of the artifacts, would sit in the chambers and stare at these paintings. On several occasions I did this for hours just letting my eyes wander through the painting, and imagining the mind of the artist and what they were trying to communicate. It was a very, very powerful experience . . . unlike anything I had every experienced before.\" **Anne:** \"I think they'd scare me a little bit.\" **Dr. Anderson:** I'm only laughing because I had such an experience.

One night after a long day of working in the artifact chambers, I was left as the last one inside the site. I had been so absorbed in what I was doing I scarcely remembered being told to activate the security system on my way out. About a half-hour went by, and I finally realized I was alone inside the time capsule . . . the silence was incredible. Any rate, I was walking down the corridor that connected all of the 23 chambers, and passed each chamber and I began to feel a presence that was overwhelming. Every time I would come upon one of the chambers I expected something from the painting to jump out at me. They literally seemed alive. \"Our lighting was a very high quality portable halogen system and every chamber was outfitted precisely the same. When I got to the bottom of the corridor -- what we called the spiral staircase -- and looked into chamber two, I clearly saw motion and nearly jumped out of my skin. Not necessarily out of fear, but out of excitement I suppose, though there was fear as well. But this motion was simply a blurred image of something stepping out of the painting and then disappearing into thin air . . . I couldn't really . . . \" **Anne:** \"What was it? Was it human?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I couldn't see it clearly enough to tell you what it was, but now that I've had some interactions with the WingMakers I know it was them. They were somehow using these paintings to appear in our time. It was shortly after that experience that I began to theorize that the paintings were actually portals that could enable time travel or something like it.\" **Anne:** \"This may seem to be an odd, off-the-wall question, but how do you know this wasn't all a hoax? That someone or some group created this whole thing to look like an alien or future time capsule just for the fun of playing with your minds?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The one thing we know for certain is that this is not a hoax.

And it also seems odd that they'd go to all this work, but make it so damn hard to understand what the hell they were trying to say. Do you see what I mean?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, I understand, and I don't take your questions as argumentative. But the point I'm making is that this time capsule, or whatever you choose to call it, is indeed a set of real objects. And these objects don't even correspond to the same time frame. For example, while the paintings were created about 1,150 years ago, the artifacts do not even respond to our carbon dating or biochemical analysis. To complicate matters, the pictographs that started to mysteriously appear in and around the Ancient Arrow site were determined to have been created in the past 50 years, and could very well have been done in the year, or month, the site was discovered. \"These real objects are admittedly an enigma, but they are not a hoax to my eyes. The real question is whether the WingMakers' identity is as they represent it -- a future aspect of humanity or an alien race that visited earth around AD 850.\" **Anne:** \"Okay, let's say it's not a hoax. Then tell me why are you so convinced it's a time capsule. It seems to me, that it might be more of a communication device . . . or perhaps an educational tool of some kind. Why a time capsule?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Partly because it seemed that its creators wanted to share their culture with us. When we first began our analysis of the Ancient Arrow site, we felt that everything within the chambers was alien. We were initially convinced that this was an ET contact site, and we even considered the possibility that they had left these items behind to recover at a later date . . . \" **Anne:** \"Sort of like an ET storage locker?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes.

However, some of the paintings depicted humans, and the landscapes were of earth -- specifically that region of the planet in northern New Mexico. So to us, it seemed less likely it was from an alien race. We also saw evidence that there were interactions with the precursor to the Navajo and perhaps Hopi Indian tribes, known today as the Anasazi Indians. And again, this was deduced from the paintings . . . which initially were the only real records that we could interpret from. \"As I recall we had a total of 47 possible scenarios that had been developed. Our most probable scenario -- ranked by our computer systems -- was that the Ancient Arrow site represented an ET race that had left behind the equivalent of a museum that recorded its interactions with the Anasazi Indians. Our second most probable scenario was that the site represented a time capsule left behind by the future version of the Labyrinth Group.\" **Anne:** \"That still seems odd to me . . . why did you think it was a future version of the Labyrinth Group?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The Labyrinth Group uses as its identification symbol three concentric circles surrounding a sphere. There were ample depictions of this symbol within their paintings. Also, it seemed so peculiar to us that we had discovered this site in the manner that we did . . . it literally felt as though we were guided to this site. And remember, Fifteen was very confident in the Labyrinth Group's prospects at developing BST, and he knew that the future version of the Labyrinth Group would somehow make contact. It was just a matter of when and how.\" **Anne:** \"I know I must sound like the biggest doubter you've ever encountered before, but it still doesn't seem like a time capsule to me.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm only telling you that that's how it's officially classified within the Labyrinth Group. It could very well have multiple meanings and purposes.

And furthermore, how could these objects [from the Ancient Arrow site] be used to build a global culture? It seems a little nave to me.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"All I can tell you is that it's related to the Internet and a new communication technology that the WingMakers referred to as OLIN or the One Language Intelligent Network. If you read the glossary section that I left behind, you'll see it referenced there. The WingMakers seem to feel confident that the OLIN technology will help create the global culture through the Internet. This incidentally is consistent with prophecies that the Labyrinth Group was privy to dating as far back as 1,500 years ago. Of course the enabling technology wasn't called OLIN, but the notion of a global culture and unified governance has been predicted for many centuries.\" **Anne:** \"This is what George Bush used to call the New World order isn't it? **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, but there have been four other presidents who've acknowledged this concept.\" **Anne:** \"What would make the world's people decide to unify under one governing body, or for that matter, create a global culture . . . whatever that means? I just can't envision it happening . . . not in my lifetime.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"According to the WingMakers it will happen through the digital economy and then through the Internet's OLIN technology platform. And through this global network, entertainment and educational content will be globalized. This is the basis of a global culture with unified commerce, content, and communities. Once these pieces of the infrastructure are in place, then the need to govern this infrastructure will loom as the preeminent issue of the day. And the United Nations is the logical ruling body for such an endeavor. As long as the World's people allow the digitization of the economy and embrace the OLIN technology platform, a global government and culture is virtually assured to emerge.\" **Anne:** \"And as you said last night, this is supposed to occur in 2018?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"According to prophecy, that's when the United Nations will hold initial elections for a unified world government.

What would you like . . . \" **Anne:** No, you're absolutely right. Sorry. Let's go back to the artifacts . . . what was the condition of the site when you first entered . . . or better still, why don't you just describe your first encounter going inside the site.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I was one of five from the ACIO who made the trip to New Mexico to explore the site after it was initially determined to have potential ET implications. None of us at the time knew anything that would have led us to conclude that the Ancient Arrow site would become such an important discovery. \"The only real clue we had was an artifact that had been recovered near, what was determined much later, as the entrance of the interior chamber of the time capsule. It was this artifact that brought the project under the control of the ACIO because the artifact was considered by the NSA to have potential ET origins.\" **Anne:** \"What specifically led the NSA to conclude the artifact was alien?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Like all the other artifacts it showed no response to carbon dating analysis and it had peculiar markings or symbols that seemed other-worldly. It was a pure grade titanium-beryllium composite, which, as you may know, is extremely rare. Also, and perhaps more importantly, there was no obvious way to activate the artifact or access its interior controls.

We weren't sure, but we couldn't determine any functional purpose in the laboratory, so it seemed like a logical experiment to see how the device would function in the area in which it was discovered. \"This was the first time I was invited to go to the site. So any rate, back to my story, this exploration team from the ACIO figured out how to use this device to locate the entrance to the interior of the canyon wall in which the time capsule was hidden. The device, when activated, seemed to pass thought waves or mental pictures of where it wanted the person to go. The leader of our team was the one holding the device when it was first activated outside the site, and he immediately began to see pictures that led him into a cave-like structure tucked 20-30 meters inside one of the clefts of the canyon wall.\" **Anne:** \"It seems a bit strange that you found the interior of the site using this artifact you mentioned earlier . . . I mean doesn't it seem a little too convenient to find this thing right outside the entrance and then it guides you inside? Wasn't there an entrance already or did you have to blast your way inside?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The way into the interior was cleverly hidden behind a natural made cavern, which in its own right was well hidden by natural underbrush. This cavern was about 25 meters deep and led inside the canyon wall. We presumed it was an Indian dwelling of some kind that had long been abandoned. Towards the end of this cavern there was a small chamber that jutted off to the side, and at the back of this chamber there was a large, flat rock on the floor . . . maybe two and half meters across and about two decimeters thick.

The device or artifact that had been found earlier was emitting mental pictures to our team leader who was convinced it had led him to this flat rock. We tried to move the rock, but it was clearly too heavy for the five of us to even budge. \"It was actually the following day that we returned to the site with pick axes and sledge hammers, and began the tedious task of breaking the rock . . . \" **Anne:** \"So you were convinced there was something underneath the rock?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"We thought there had to be a reason that the device had sent such a clear image to our leader of this flat rock in the back of this natural cavern. It seemed logical that the device -- if it were a homing device of some kind -- might be leading us to something it was designed to help us find. \"After about two hours of smashing the rock, we finally cracked it into small enough pieces that we were able to determine a tunnel was indeed underneath it. The tunnel was in the form of a \"J\" and was about one meter in diameter. We took turns and slid down the tunnel and stood at the entrance of the spiral staircase.\" **Anne:** \"So all five of you were inside this . . . this spiral staircase looking around with flashlights, what was running through your mind at the time?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"We were all very excited and somewhat apprehensive as well. We thought we might find an ET site, and were half-aware that it could be an active site . . . which kept us all on guard. The device, or artifact began to emit a sound frequency that continued to rise in pitch as we walked up the tunnel and as we got to the first chamber it went entirely dead . . . as if its purpose had been served and simply shut down.\" **Anne:** \"And this whole thing was carved out of rock?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"It was completely manmade . . . or alien . . . and we knew it the instant we got out of the transition tunnel.

We assumed it was of ET construction from the moment we stepped out of the \"J\" tunnel. **Anne:** \"But how did you immediately know it was an artificial construction, and not a natural set of chambers or caves?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"At the beginning of the spiral staircase there were ornate petroglyphs carved in the stone with a precision never before seen by our eyes. Also, the entire tunnel system was clearly too smooth -- almost polished -- to be of natural construction. There was a sense of architecture . . . a sense that someone designed it with extreme care and purpose. \"Amazingly there was nothing on the floor. Not even a pebble or a grain of sand. Every surface was completely clean, smooth, and polished. There was dust, but only dust. And something like a polymer coating had been applied to every square centimeter of the structure including the ceilings. \"When we arrived at the first chamber, which is only about 30 meters from the entrance, I can clearly recall a sense of awe or something approaching a religious experience I suppose. No one spoke for a long time after our lights hit the first chamber painting. Everyone's flashlight converged on the painting and we all just stared for about 40 seconds in the incredible silence of this tomblike structure. I was the first to find my voice, and all I could muster was 'This is definitely not Navaho or any other Indian tribe for that matter.'\" **Anne:** \"Did you find all the chambers that same day?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes. We went from chamber to chamber each time feeling like we had stumbled into an alien natural history museum. You have to understand that our lighting was not very good because we hadn't expected to need anything more than basic flashlights.

I think it's fair to say that of those who saw the chamber paintings in their original environment -- the chambers themselves -- they found the artistic merits to be very compelling, even captivating.

He's a workaholic, sleeps about four hours a night and works the rest of his time on some aspect of BST. If there's research or development of new technologies that don't have a specific and strategic impact on BST, he's not involved in it. Won't even ask questions about projects of that nature, and generally within the ACIO, there's always three or four projects that are unrelated to BST. Within the Labyrinth Group, every project is related to BST.\" **Anne:** \"What's he look like?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"He's about average height and has fairly long gray hair down to his shoulders which he usually wears in a ponytail.

I've never heard anyone say his age. I know when he was a student, he was supposed to look old for his age. I think he started getting gray hair when he was in his early twenties, and that's probably why he was often mistaken for a professor rather than a student.\" **Anne:** \"You said earlier that he was kicked out of school. Why?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Remember, he was, even at an age when most kids are concerned about dating and parties, working on BST . . . or at least early versions of time travel. He's one of those visionaries that enter the physical world and knew at a very early age what he came to do. Fifteen was born to time travel. Period . . . end of story. That's all he's ever cared about. \"In the fifties, researching BST was considered a waste of time, no pun intended. It was simply too theoretical and disconnected from anything practical. I think Fifteen also rubbed his professors the wrong way because he was so bright as a student that he intimidated most of them. He's also very stubborn, and when the professors told him to change his research to something more practical, Fifteen apparently told them they were small-minded . . . or something to that effect. Later that semester he was forcibly expelled as the story was told to me. \"However, Bell Labs hired him for a short stint because his research on quantum objects and how they could be influenced by consciousness was of interest to them.\" **Anne:** \"Forgive me, but what exactly are quantum objects?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"They're elementals like electrons or neutrons. Quantum objects are fundamental building blocks of matter, and they can appear both as a wave and a particle.\" **Anne:** \"Okay, so Fifteen was trying to prove that quantum objects are influenced by consciousness. Why was that so dangerous to a research university?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"That in itself wasn't so radical, but it was only a small part of his total research into how to construct BST using the new physics that was being introduced", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews__www.wingmakers.com__interview__iview2.txt:21:c269c631393e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15749, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews__www.wingmakers.com__interview__iview2.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews__www.wingmakers.com__interview__iview2", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "elementals like electrons or neutrons.

Why was that so dangerous to a research university?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"That in itself wasn't so radical, but it was only a small part of his total research into how to construct BST using the new physics that was being introduced rapidly in the community of quantum physics. Fifteen has always maintained that Einstein's general theory of relativity was flawed. Which is not a popular position to take. In somewhat the same way that Newton's theory of the mechanistic universe became too constricted and unable to explain so much of the phenomenon of what we call today, complexity or chaos theory, Fifteen felt that Einstein's theories underestimated the influence that consciousness had on quantum objects. \"In the fifties and sixties, this was tantamount to heresy, particularly because it was impossible to prove by mathematical modeling or formula. So Fifteen just continued to develop his theories in secret and began to become noticed by the ACIO when he became involved in a project having to do with heuristic learning systems based on a technology that the ACIO had re-engineered from the Greys. \"The project leader from the ACIO recognized his intellect and rouge creativity and began to develop a relationship with the young man. Several months later, Fifteen was recruited to join the ACIO and essentially left his identity behind and quickly rose to the position of director of research. He was later introduced to the Corteum intelligence accelerator technology, and the rest is history as they say.\" **Anne:** \"How exactly does this Corteum technology accelerate or expand the intelligence?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Few people realize that their conscious mind only processes about 15 bits of information per second of linear time. However, in vertical time, the unconscious mind is processing approximately 70-80 million bits of information. Thus, in normal consciousness, humans are aware of only an infinitesimal amount of the information that is constantly being fed to them at the unconscious level. The Corteum technology was designed to reduce the filtering aspects of the conscious mind and enable the higher frequency information packets to be fed to the conscious mind. \"In parallel with this effort, the brain circuitry -- if you will -- is re-wired to handle the higher voltage of the information that is being fed to the consciousness, allowing capabilities like photographic memory and abstract thought to co-exist. These capabilities become the matrix filter that draws from the unconscious repositories the most relevant information at any particular time based on the problem or task at hand.\" **Anne:** \"If I were a behavioral scientist, I'd be able to ask you about a thousand questions right now. But I'm lost in what", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews__www.wingmakers.com__interview__iview2.txt:22:d4688e1a63a0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15750, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews__www.wingmakers.com__interview__iview2.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews__www.wingmakers.com__interview__iview2", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "-- is re-wired to handle the higher voltage of the information that is being fed to the consciousness, allowing capabilities like photographic memory and abstract thought to co-exist.

But I'm lost in what you say . . . I mean, how many bits of information can you process right now?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"It's not really a simple question of the quantity of information processing, but rather the relevance of the information in linear time based on the intention of the individual. When one goes through the process of the Corteum technology, their ability to tune into information packets that are relevant to a situation or problem is vastly improved. In most people, when a given situation confronts them they access their conscious mind and pull out the solution that has served them in the past. Thus, people fall into ruts and patterned behavior which closes down their access to the unconscious information packets that are based on real-time situation analysis and have extremely high relevancy. \"This technology accelerates evolutionary thought processes and enables the circulation of information between the conscious and unconscious aspects of the mind to flow in the pattern of an ascending spiral rather than the pattern of a repetitious circle. And it's because of this quality of the Corteum technology that unleashes the innate intelligence of the individual. So you see, the Corteum technology doesn't increase raw intelligence, it simply facilitates the natural intelligence of the individual.\" **Anne:** \"This is very cool. I wish I could undergo this regimen of the Corteum intelligence accelerator so I could really ask you some zinger questions! And with that, let's take a short break.\" 10 minute break . . . **Dr. Anderson:** \"Since you have the tape recorder on now, let me repeat myself. The Corteum technology was the single most influential element in helping Fifteen become the Executive Director of both the ACIO and the Labyrinth Group. Granted, he had a brilliant mind before he underwent the Corteum intelligence enhancement process, but for some reason, the technology seemed to enhance his intelligence more than anyone else . . . by a significant degree.\" **Anne:** \"Did anyone ever suspect that the Corteum and Fifteen were somehow a separate force from the Labyrinth Group. I mean, did anyone consider the possibility that they had a separate agenda . . . maybe BST wasn't their ultimate goal?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"No. There was, and I presume still is, absolute faith in both Fifteen and the Corteum.

We never saw any evidence that they had anything but good intentions to assist us, and, to the extent possible, we tried to assist them in return. It was a courteous and completely reciprocal partnership.\" **Anne:** \"You said last night that the Corteum were part of the Labyrinth Group, but only a couple hundred or so were actual members. How did they become part of the Labyrinth Group?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Actually, I don't know for certain. I can only tell you what I was told when I asked the same question of one of the directors who sponsored me for entry into the Labyrinth Group. He told me that Fifteen had been selected by the Corteum to be their liaison with the ACIO. They singled him out, as the one through which they would initiate their technology transfer program with humans. \"Fifteen agreed to subject himself to the intelligence enhancement technology the Corteum offered. It was from this experience that Fifteen's vision of how BST could be developed was crystallized. He essentially created the framework and design blueprint. \"One of the things that the Corteum have in abundance is logical intelligence. They are very adept in terms of scientific inquiry and logical reasoning. By their own admission, where they lack ability is in the creative visionary aspect of discovery. This is precisely where Fifteen excels . . . \" **Anne:** \"But you're talking about a race that is superior to us in their technologies, how can they lack creative insights?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"These things are all relevant. Compared to virtually all other humans, the Corteum are creative and visionary. But there are formative principles of physics that reside in a dimensional matrix that are completely foreign to all beings except the most penetrating intellects. And Fifteen has such an intellect. The Corteum are hoping that Fifteen, and more generally, the Labyrinth Group, can develop BST because the Corteum have their own application for this technology.\" **Anne:** \"But last night you said there are other races within our galaxy that already have time travel capabilities, why don't the Corteum simply go to these races and make a deal with them?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"As I said before, a species that has, of their own initiative, developed time travel will be unwilling to share it with another race.

It is truly the most guarded of all technologies. And one doesn't simply ask to borrow the technology when they need it. Even when the need seems compelling and true. It's so easy to become dependent on the technology itself. Furthermore, as I tried to explain last evening, there's a considerable difference between time travel and BST. I'm not aware of any species that possesses the form of BST that the Labyrinth Group is attempting to develop. \"It's like this, Anne, BST requires a suite of interdependent, but discrete technologies that require a developer to apply new theorems, new laws of physics, that have never been discovered before. And then to build this suite of technologies based fundamentally on a new matrix of how the world works . . . it's a daunting task. Everything previously held to be true needs to be destroyed, needs to be re-invented, re-formulated, and then integrated into this new matrix. \"This is the very nature of BST, you start with a blank slate and re-invent, re-formulate, and recreate the consciousness of matter.\" **Anne:** \"Slow down . . . You just lost me. The consciousness of matter?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Remember what I said earlier about quantum objects and how they're influenced by consciousness?\" **Anne:** \"Yes.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Quantum objects become increasingly granular or refined until they become pure light energy and cease to have mass. They are not of physical reality, but rather of a pure-state energy. This energy is further segmented into octaves of vibration. In other words, this light energy vibrates, and just like music, there are fundamentals and harmonics. The harmonics resonate with the fundamental energy vibration and the whole energy packet sings like a choir . . . except its voice is light. \"This singing, if you will, is the equivalent of a consciousness that pervades all matter . . . every physical object in the entire universe. Fifteen has successfully proven this all-pervasive consciousness or what he calls the Light-Encoded Reality Matrix or LERM, for those of us who like shorthand.

You're going to tell me that Fifteen discovered God. That he has proof of God?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, in a way, but . . . but God isn't what we call it. It's LERM. And Fifteen was quite emphatic that we never refer to LERM as God or even God-like. He preferred to think of LERM as the shadow of God. The light that casts the shadow, and the object of the shadow itself, he believes is impossible to prove through science or any other objective form of inquiry.\" **Anne:** \"Okay . . . okay. But listen to me for a minute. If LERM is the shadow of God, as you put it, then it proves the existence of God, right?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"To those of us within the Labyrinth Group who understand the work of Fifteen, the answer is yes.\" **Anne:** \"So isn't this even more important than the Ancient Arrow project? I mean, if someone had proof of God, isn't it their moral responsibility to share this information with the public?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Perhaps, but the only way this could be shared with the public is to disclose who the Labyrinth Group is, and that isn't something that Fifteen even likes to contemplate doing. He's afraid of the ridicule and misunderstanding that would result, and firmly believes that no one would believe him anyway because there are so many hidden technologies that led him to his findings, and he has no interest in disclosing these technologies to academia, government institutions, or the media. He'd become the next messiah . . . or devil, depending on your perspective.\" **Anne:** \"So he's trapped in his own secrecy . . . \" **Dr. Anderson:** \"In a way, but he's not feeling trapped. He's simply so far removed from the social fabric and scientific communities of academia that he has, for practical purposes, burned his bridges and has no intention of ever crossing the chasm that separates himself from all that he's left behind.\" **Anne:** \"He must be incredibly lonely.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I don't think so.

I find this interesting, but at the same time, it's frustrating. I even find myself feeling pissed off that all of this stuff is going on in my world and I don't know about it . . . well, I mean I didn't know about it until just now. It seems like an injustice to me. It's the old haves and have-nots story all over again.

Any more than that, it's as mysterious to me as it is to you. It would be a great mistake to think that the Labyrinth Group or any of its members, including Fifteen and the Corteum, understand it all. They don't. But they work hard to get the answers, Anne. I mean really hard. They've devoted their entire lives to this mission of BST. They didn't simply fall into the knowledge by accident. They tried and failed at thousands of different experiments until they found the existence of LERM, and they'll probably fail another thousand times before they find the solution to BST.

Your first question was, What do they look like?\" **Anne:** \"Yes. And your point is . . . ?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"These are the natural questions that people will have. LERM may interest a few scientists, but I doubt it. What's portrayed in these interviews is so superficial that I doubt any scientist would take it very seriously. And those that would, would find it to be a noble gesture to authenticate monistic idealism, and nothing more. So you see, your initial instincts should be trusted. Ask the questions that people would be interested in that appeal to their basic sense of curiosity. And don't worry about changing the world through anything I have to say. I don't need that weight on my shoulders.\" **Anne:** \"Okay, you're right. You're absolutely right. Besides, I'm not sure about the truth of all of this. I'm still not convinced of what you say . . . just for the record.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"And I'm still not trying to convince you or anybody else.

Their eyes are relatively large and have various colors just like our own, except the Corteum have different colors to their eyes depending on their age and, in some instances, their emotional state. \"What's very unique about the Corteum is that they have an incredibly articulate nervous system that enables them to process virtually everything that occurs within their environment, including the thoughts of another. Which means that when you're in their presence, you need to have control of your thoughts or else you'll potentially offend them. They're very sensitive emotionally. **Anne:** \"How do they communicate with you?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"They speak perfect English or French, Italian, Spanish, or most any other language for that matter. They're very gifted linguists and can acquire average language skills in a matter of a few weeks, and operate as masters of the language within a few months. Their minds are like sponges, but like I said before, while they possess incredible mental powers to absorb new information and synthesize it with previous information, they're not necessarily adept at creating new information totally unrelated to existing information. That's precisely what impressed them so much with Fifteen.\" **Anne:** \"What's their interest in the Ancient Arrow project?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"No different than Fifteen's I presume. They're completely absorbed in the efforts to create BST, and hope that there's some technology or theorem within the Ancient Arrow site that can help accelerate the development of BST.\" **Anne:** \"And what do the Corteum want to do with BST?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The Corteum have a planetary system that's in a very fragile state because its protective atmosphere is degenerating at an alarming rate. Their atmosphere protects them, just as our own, from harmful light waves that are generated from their local sun, and, to a lesser extent, their closest stars. Anyway, this condition has led them to become nocturnal, only venturing outside at night, and even then, only for as short a time as necessary. Over many generations, this has left them increasingly susceptible to the very condition that they're trying to solve. Their outer skins become more and more sensitive while their atmosphere becomes less protective. \"Their scientists predict it's only about 10-20 years before they'll have to stay in underground communities year-round.

They hope that BST will enable them to install a technology that they've recently discovered to prevent the deterioration of their atmosphere.\" **Anne:** \"Why can't they simply deploy this technology now?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"It's not a regenerative technology, it's a preventative technology. Regenerative technologies are impossible once a system reaches a certain retrograde trajectory. In their scenario, only BST would restore their environment.\" **Anne:** \"Obviously they have space travel technology, why don't they pick out another planet and colonize it?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"They have tried, but every planet they've found that's suitable for their species is occupied. And they're not interested in being assimilated into an existing culture or society. They want their own identity and social structure. Also, what they deem suitable for habitation is extremely particular. For example, they have the same problem with earth as they have with their own planet . . . in fact, it's worse here. They have to live in our underground base in order to survive on our planet. It required that we build a special way-station for their spacecraft.\" **Anne:** \"Do they want to interact with our governments and our people?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Initially I think they did. And in fact they tried. But they were quickly escorted to the ACIO and we convinced the NSA and all other interested parties that the Corteum had left earth fearful of their lives. So . . . as far as our operatives within the NSA are concerned, the Corteum are long gone, and fortunately the NSA at the time were quite preoccupied with other ET issues anyway, namely the Greys.\" **Anne:** \"I want to return to the WingMakers for a moment. What do the Corteum think of the WingMakers' time capsule, I assume they've seen everything?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, they've been involved from the beginning. The Corteum are as integral to the Labyrinth Group as any of its human members, so nothing is hidden from them. The leader of the Corteum mission to earth is called -- in English -- Mahunahi, and he happens to be an artist first and foremost, and a scientist is his secondary nature.

First, every time you mention a member of the ACIO, Labyrinth Group, or Corteum, it's always a male reference. Are their any women in any of these organizations? And secondly, why would an artist be the leader of a space mission of the Corteum? That seems very strange to me.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"In answer to your first question, it's true that the Labyrinth Group is mostly male. I'm not aware of this being by design, but rather by accident. One of the directors is a woman, she's in charge of communications, and, as a director has a level 14 clearance. We also have perhaps 9 females who are in the 12 or 13 clearance categories, all of them are extremely bright and capable and share responsibility with their male counterparts without any form of discrimination . . . at least that I've ever been aware of. We even have one married couple. Each person -- regardless of sex -- is paid the identical sum of money and has all the same privileges . . . there's no distinction whatsoever within the ranks of the Labyrinth Group, and that's at Fifteen's insistence. \"As for the Corteum, they're all males. Their culture is much more role-defined than our own. And it's not to say the females are treated as the lesser sex . . . no, in fact it may be the quite the opposite, it's just that space travel and interaction with other species is left to the male sex until species interaction procedures are invoked. That's so their children can retain access to their mothers and their families can remain more intact. Most, if not all, of the members of the Corteum contingent are married. \"As for your second question, the Corteum look at science, religion, and art as three equal members of a unified belief system that defines their social order. As I understand it, leadership varies between each of these three elements of their social order, depending on the contact that is made with an alien race. When they first made contact with humans it was decided that the leadership should come from the ranks of the artistic side because they felt we were more of an equal in this domain and thus the leader could more appropriately understand our motivations and desires.\" **Anne:** \"That's", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews__www.wingmakers.com__interview__iview2.txt:31:c57762dc0d2e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15759, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews__www.wingmakers.com__interview__iview2.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews__www.wingmakers.com__interview__iview2", "chunk_index": 32, "text": "that defines their social order.

They actually thought we were more artistic than scientific or spiritual. I guess now that I think about it, I can understand that. As a race, we probably are more inclined in that way than the others.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"That was their assessment any way.\" **Anne:** \"I'd like to go back to the artifacts for a minute. The artifacts that are technology based, where are they right now?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"After the initial discovery of the Ancient Arrow site, all of the physical artifacts that could be removed from the site were carefully packed in shipping crates and shipped to the ACIO research lab in Virginia, and are held by the Labyrinth Group in its own laboratory. That's where they still are, to the best of my knowledge.\" **Anne:** \"And only the homing device found outside the site and the optical disc have been, to some extent, understood?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"That's correct.\" **Anne:** \"You know, something you said earlier doesn't make much sense to me. If the WingMakers did represent a future version of humanity, and let's say they were trying to provide the entire recipe for BST through this time capsule, why wouldn't they simply beam themselves to your headquarters in Virginia and just cut to the chase. All of this other stuff . . . the paintings, the poetry, the music, the enigmatic artifacts, the philosophy, even the elaborate site itself, why not just give the blueprints to Fifteen and be done with it?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"It's actually a very good question, and I was wondering if you'd ask it. There are a few facts that we know of for certain. The WingMakers can time travel and they can interact physically with the time and space that they visit . . . that's obvious given what they did with the Ancient Arrow site. However, we don't know if they have all five elements of BST. Remember the element that pertains to intervention points?\" **Anne:** \"Yes, that's the one that defines when to intervene at the point in time that is causal and has the least ripple effect on related, but separate events. Right?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Your definition is missing only one thing, intervention points are co-dependent on both time and space.

In other words, BST requires a precise fix on both the time and space coordinates of an event when it was in its conceptual stage -- or the stage that precedes physical manifestation of the event. The space component is usually a physical person or an event of nature that is focused in space. This is a very tricky technology, and I believe that the WingMakers have discovered interactive time travel, but still lack the technology to define intervention points with precision.\" **Anne:** \"Or perhaps they just like puzzles.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Or perhaps they just like puzzles . . . exactly.\" **Anne:** \"So we really don't know whether BST is possible, do we?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"We know it's possible, but it's like anything that is extremely complicated and interdependent, one needs a fine grain understanding of the total environment that encompasses the problem before they can modify or change the environment to solve the problem. And this requires an understanding of LERM that is still evolving within the Labyrinth Group, and I dare say, may yet require another decade of experimentation before its understanding is sufficient to identify intervention points and time-splice in such a way to minimize undesirable effects.\" **Anne:** \"So we're back to the shadow of God discussion . . . or LERM as you affectionately call it. Why is the understanding of LERM so fundamental to achieving BST?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Because LERM is the equivalent of genetics for consciousness, and consciousness is the equivalent of reality formulation for sentient beings. So if LERM is understood, one understands the causal system that operates in non-time and non-space, which fundamentally constructs the reality framework of space, time, energy, and matter. Quantum objects operating in the construct of LERM have an existence that is entirely different from macro objects like this table or chair. Quantum objects -- in their true state -- have never been seen by a human. Scientists have witnessed the effects and some of the properties of quantum objects, but their causal nature is not visible through scientific instruments . . . no matter how powerful they are, because scientific instruments are physical and therefore have a relationship to space and time. Whereas quantum objects have no relationship to time and space other than through an observer.\" **Anne:** \"So you're saying that the building blocks of matter -- these quantum objects -- have no existence unless someone is observing them . . . that consciousness makes them appear real and fixed in time and space? Is that what you're saying?\" **Dr. Anderson:** In", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews__www.wingmakers.com__interview__iview2.txt:33:8fd27d8a7fc4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15761, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews__www.wingmakers.com__interview__iview2.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviews__www.wingmakers.com__interview__iview2", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "matter how powerful they are, because scientific instruments are physical and therefore have a relationship to space and time.

Is that what you're saying?\" **Dr. Anderson:** In a way, but not exactly. Let me try and explain it like this. Consciousness stems or originates from non-time and non-space as a form of energy that is a basic building block of LERM. Consciousness becomes localized as it becomes physical. In other words, consciousness becomes human, or animal, or plant or some object that has physical characteristics. Are you with me so far?\" **Anne:** \"Yes.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Good. As consciousness becomes a localized physical object, it essentially orchestrates LERM to conform to a reality matrix that has been encoded into the genetic or physical properties of the object it has become. In other words, consciousness moves from non-space and non-time to become matter, and then it orchestrates LERM to produce a physical reality consistent to the encoded genetic properties of the physical object it has become. If that object is a human being, then the genetic triggers that are uniquely human become the tools of consciousness from which it constructs its reality. \"LERM is essentially an infinite field of possibilities, or, as Aristotle referred to it, Potentia. This Potentia is like fertile soil from which physical objects are created. Those who can orchestrate LERM through the application of their consciousness are able to manifest reality and not simply react to it. This manifestation can be instantaneous because again, quantum objects originate in non-time and non-space . . . \" **Anne:** \"Not to get overly religious here, but what you're really talking about is what Jesus or other prophets have done . . . essentially manifest things like turning water to wine or curing the sick. Right?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes. It's the same principle only I've described it instead of performed it. It's much easier to perform than describe.\" **Anne:** \"So now you're going to tell me you can turn water into wine?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Actually I've never tried that before, but yes, all of the members of the Labyrinth Group can manifest physical objects from out of LERM. This was actually one of the outcomes of Fifteen's discovery. The process of orchestrating LERM and manifesting physical objects on demand.\" **Anne:** \"Okay, now you've definitely got my interest, but I'm feeling a little guilty because I swore I was going to stay on the subject of the WingMakers and the Ancient Arrow project.

Dr. Anderson just made a ball of twine appear out of no where. He just made it disappear as well. Now it has reappeared again. This is incredible. He's not holding it, so it's not like a magician who's making this appear from his sleeve or from behind his hands somehow. It's quite literally appearing and disappearing on a table about 3 feet in front of him, which is about 6 feet away from me. I can see it all very clearly. \"I'm picking up the ball of string and it is definitely a physical object . . . not simply a mirage or . . . or hologram. It has all the normal properties . . . weight . . . texture . . . it's slightly warm to the touch, but in every other respect, it's exactly how I'd expect a ball of twine to feel. \"Can you make something else appear . . . something more complicated, like a million dollars in cash?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes.\" **Anne:** \"Okay, let's see it.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"You see this is the problem with these discoveries and capabilities.

I'm going to need to quit my job for at least a few months to get this story out to the public and maybe even relocate or move underground somewhat. What if I kept just . . . $10,000 to help me through the next two months? Could that work for you?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, I could do that.\" **Anne:** \"I'm now looking at a loose pile of $100 bills that appear to be perfect replicas. I'm touching them . . . again they feel slightly warm to the touch, but these would definitely pass as the real thing . . . wow . . . I can't believe it. But this can't be a million dollars, you only manifested $10,000 didn't you?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, give or take a few hundred dollars.\" **Anne:** \"You do realize that you just undermined your own credibility to those who will read this transcript. You just made yourself unbelievable. I'm not even sure I should include this because no one will be believe it anyway, and it may instead hurt your credibility in all the other areas of our discussion. This is truly not a believable experience unless you see it with your own eyes. What should I do?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Anne, whether any one believes me isn't important. No one believes anything anyway unless they experience it, and even then, most people fall back into doubt. Belief is short-lived and always questioned; as it should be. Even the most devote believer is in doubt most of the time, regardless of what they say. So don't worry about whether this impairs my credibility or not. I don't care. It doesn't matter because I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything. I'm only trying to get information about the WingMakers to people who can make their own determination of what is true and believable.\" **Anne:** \"Okay . . . so much for my concern.

The same principle would apply to BST or any other technology discovered by the Labyrinth Group that could be used for personal gain or benefit.\" **Anne:** \"Man, you must be a very disciplined group. I don't think I could resist.\" **Dr. Anderson:** The truth is, I'm sure all the members of the Labyrinth Group have, from time-to-time, experimented with this technology in the privacy of their own homes.\" **Anne:** \"Why do you refer to it as a technology? It seems to me that it's a mental thing. You weren't using anything other than your mind were you?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"It's a technology only from the standpoint of understanding the mental process. There's nothing electronic or mechanical if that's what you mean. But it's more than mind control. It's really a belief in LERM and its unerringly perfect processes of creation -- moving quantum objects from non-space and non-time to the world of matter in our time and space. It's more closely related to faith than technology . . . as odd as that may sound.\" **Anne:** \"Actually, I was figuring that if Jesus and others who've walked the earth could do these things thousands of years ago, it must not have much to do with technology. But when you see it happen with your own eyes, you have a tendency to think there's some technology behind the scenes that's doing it. That it couldn't just be a natural power of humans . . . that doesn't seem possible to me for some reason.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I understand, but nonetheless, it's really a matter of perspective, and once you have the perspective on LERM and it becomes a fundamental construct of your belief system, it becomes amazingly easy to do this. It's a little like a sophisticated optical illusion based on a hologram that takes you several months of concentrating to see the picture that is subtly embedded, but the moment you see it, you can instantly see it the rest of your life without effort. That's how this operates.

It's related to understanding and belief. The understanding comes from seeing the existence of LERM and understanding how it operates at its fundamental level. Whether you have an average intelligence or are a genius, it doesn't matter, so long as you understand and believe what you understand.\" **Anne:** \"So how do you get me to believe in LERM?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"You already do deep inside you. It's your conscious mind that rejects your deeper belief and understanding. So I would help you to consciously understand what you already know at a deeper level of your being. And I would do this by showing you LERM.\" **Anne:** \"And how would you do that?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"You would need to come to the Labyrinth Group's research facility in Virginia. It's the only place in the world where I can show you the indisputable evidence of LERM.\" **Anne:** \"Under the circumstances, that doesn't seem like a scenario that will ever happen. There must be another alternative . . . or said another way, what is it that I'd see at this research center that I couldn't get somewhere else . . . or through some other means?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I'm not saying that the only way to acquire this ability is by seeing LERM in action, but it is very convincing. The Labyrinth Group has a technology -- designed by Fifteen himself -- that quite literally enables an individual to experience LERM. There are also the mystical or shamanic means, but these are far less likely to occur in a two-week period of time. These methods seem independent of circumstance and more dependent on some deeper, predestined or pre-encoded awakening that the individual is not aware of consciously, but nonetheless triggers an awakening that causes them to transform their understanding by themselves. In some instances this awakening includes an ability to manifest physical objects, but generally, it's done without a conscious knowledge of how it's done. It just works.\" **Anne:** \"Okay, so let's assume I'm not cut out to be a mystic or shaman, what would I see with this technology that would convince me of my abilities to do what you just did?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I can't really tell you.

It's one of those experiences that words are wholly inadequate to describe or explain. About all I can tell you is that LERM is experienced through this technology, and it essentially, as a result of the experience, re-wires your internal electrical system. In this process, new circuits are cut in your nervous system, and these new circuits enable you to utilize LERM as an outgrowth of your experience of it. \"I doubt this explanation does you any good whatsoever. I've never tried to explain it before, and I can see by the look on your face that I failed miserably . . . \" **Anne:** \"No, it's not that. I'm just tired of always feeling like I've lived on a different planet all my life. That I've missed out on all of this . . . it's really distressing to me when I think about it. \"I remember reading a biography about Einstein and he was quoted saying something like we humans only use about 2% of our intellectual capability. Well, that's about how I feel right now. That I've lived my life at about the 2% level -- if that -- and I'm just beginning to see what he meant. I never had a comparison before now that let me see what the other 98% might be like. It's not altogether pleasant to see what's been left out or overlooked . . . or undervalued.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I understand.\" **Anne:** \"On to something else. You said earlier that certain technologies like LERM and BST were not allowed to be used for personal gain by members of the Labyrinth Group. Yet, if BST did exist, wouldn't everyone line up and ask to use it? I know I would. There are a lot of events in my life I'd change if I could. Once the cat's out of the bag, how could BST ever be kept under wraps?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Like everything, there are implications and moral and ethical considerations that have to be weighed. One of the things that Fifteen and more generally the Labyrinth Group is good at, is to consider these implications in the broader scope of the social order.

This is an integral part of any project's development.\" **Anne:** \"That's good to hear, but couldn't such a charter also be used to prevent the spread of these technologies to a broader audience?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Unquestionably. A technology like BST -- once developed and tested -- could, in time, become a consumer technology. But as long as the Labyrinth Group exists, it would protect BST from any and all outside forces. Within the Labyrinth Group there is a committee called the Technology Transfer Program or TTP Committee. This committee has two missions, one, to assess the incoming technologies that are assimilated from ETs, and two, they're responsible for which technologies and in what state of dilution they're transferred to our private industry partners, NSA, or the military. The TTP Committee is in control of the pure-state technologies that are developed by the Labyrinth Group. These pure-state technologies are virtually never transferred to outside organizations. Even those staff members in the ACIO who are not part of the Labyrinth Group are unaware of these pure-state technologies, and when . . . \" **Anne:** \"But if I place these interview transcripts on the Internet or some media publication picks up this story, more than just the ACIO staff members are going to know about this stuff. Isn't this going to screw up the Labyrinth Group's cloak of secrecy?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"No. The Labyrinth Group is more than a secret organization. For all practical purposes, it doesn't exist. The ACIO doesn't exist. No one will be able to trace the ACIO let alone the Labyrinth Group. Their security technologies are so vastly superior they are completely invulnerable in this regard. Nothing I say, or you publish, will make them more vulnerable.

It's very clear why the paranoia must be part of the culture. But over time, certain individuals find it suffocating.

I'll be the first to experience normal society . . . as a normal person.\" **Anne:** \"Well, at least you won't have any problem getting a job . . . what am I saying, you won't even need to work.

He's a big believer in this, and he himself, even more than I, lives humbly.\" **Anne:** \"I find this really hard to believe. I think of just about everything you've told me so far, this is one of the hardest things to believe. I'm totally baffled here . . . \" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I can appreciate that, but what I'm telling you is the truth. \"Initially, the way new people are recruited to join the ACIO is largely because of the monetary incentives. These are extremely bright and capable people and could easily secure positions in academia or private industry making $200,000 per year. The ACIO lures them by at least doubling their salary and offering them lifetime employment contracts. But those who ultimately earn the right to enter the 12th level are then inducted into the Labyrinth Group, and by the time an individual has risen to this status, money has become increasingly unimportant . . . particularly after the Corteum intelligence accelerator experience . . . after the LERM experience, it's diminished even more. \"You'd probably find it interesting that Fifteen lives in a small, three-bedroom home in a regular community where the average property value is about $200,000. That's not much of a house by East Coast standards. His automobile must have at least 100,000 miles on it, no air conditioning, and he's perfectly content with his situation. New ACIO recruits are always amazed at Fifteen's thrift . . . I think bewildered is a better way of putting it. But over time, they learn to respect him not as an eccentric, but as an extremely dedicated genius who simply likes to live like other people and blend in.\" **Anne:** \"Okay . . . I've got to get personal here, and I know I've totally betrayed my agenda, but you've got to tell me a few things about . . . well like, what do your neighbors think you do?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I don't know my neighbors very well.

It's also why we keep to our own . . . we can tell the truth among ourselves.\" **Anne:** \"When I first heard about the ACIO and its secret mission, and that you were defecting and afraid for your life . . . I thought the ACIO was an evil-minded, control-the-world type of organization.

You completely destroyed it. So why are you so afraid?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The Labyrinth Group, because of its connection to the ACIO, is still very much connected to the secret network of organizations who control a great deal of the world's monetary and natural resource assets.

It makes me a security risk.\" **Anne:** \"Why? I mean if the ACIO and Labyrinth Group have so much money . . . why work with these evil groups?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"First of all, they're not evil. These organizations consist of well-educated elitists who're self-absorbed perhaps, but not evil. They look at the world as a biological experience where the strong survive, the powerful thrive, and the secretive control. They like being in control of the experience. They are the ultimate control freaks, but not for the sake of adoration or ego-gratification, but for the sake that they genuinely believe they're the best at making policy decisions that effect the world's economy and security. \"So, don't confuse control with evil intent. It's not necessarily one and the same thing. That's the game they choose to play. The fact that they make incredible sums of money, is simply part of the game, but it's not the reason they sit in the driver's seat of the world's economy . . . they simply want to protect their life's agenda like anyone else would. It's just that they're in the position to actually do it. They get their security from being at the top of the economic food-chain.\" **Anne:** \"But they're manipulating people and keeping information from them.

This, they're deciding on their own. The secret organizations that I'm pointing the finger at are opposed to these military build-ups because they interject a degree of uncertainty in their models for controlling economic and social order. \"The politicians and military leaders are the ones who're investing time, energy, and money in weapons of mass destruction, and these, if there is such a thing as evil, are it.\" **Anne:** \"Okay. I see your point. But you implied that these secret organizations would try and kill us if we published and distributed all of this? I still don't see how that makes them so noble.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I don't think you have to be concerned about these secret organizations. You don't know enough to be dangerous to them. Besides, they're used to journalists snooping around and trying to expose them. None have succeeded in any meaningful way. Dozens of books have been written about them.

How do you manufacture it? I assume Intel isn't doing the manufacturing. Right?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Correct. There's no one on this planet that can manufacture these technologies. They're all based upon the Corteum technology -- which is about 150 generations ahead of our best computer technologies here on earth. For example, the LERM project used only one domestic technology in the total array of about 200 different technologies, and it was a relatively insignificant part of the project . . . \" **Anne:** \"What was it?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"It's a derivative of a laser telemetry technology that the ACIO developed about 20 years ago, but it filled the specific needs of the LERM project because it was based on analog protocols which were required for the application in that specific part of the experiment.\" **Anne:** \"So the Corteum performs all the manufacturing of what the Labyrinth Group designs.

What if the Corteum decide, for whatever reason, not to share these technologies all of sudden? Wouldn't the Labyrinth Group cease to exist?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Perhaps. But Fifteen is shrewd and he's put certain contingencies in place to help ensure nothing like that would ever happen. Bear in mind, that the Corteum are at least as motivated as we are to develop this technology, perhaps more. They have tremendous respect for Fifteen as well as the other human contingent of the Labyrinth Group. However, when the Labyrinth Group was first formed, Fifteen negotiated with the Corteum to share all source code for the projects that came out of BST research. All base technologies were replicated in two separate research labs. There's complete redundancy right down to the power supplies.\" **Anne:** \"Won't the leaders of these secret organizations try and pressure Fifteen to find you . . . with their remote viewing technology, can't they find you easily?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"The leaders of these secret organizations well know they have no leverage with Fifteen. After they read this information, they will know they have even less leverage. Fifteen and the Labyrinth Group designed and developed all of their security systems. Every last one. They knew they had to be indebted to the Labyrinth Group for certain technologies that made them -- speaking metaphorically -- invisible. Fifteen cannot be pressured. In fact, it's just the opposite, Fifteen can pressure them . . . though he never would. To Fifteen, these organizations simply represent the best alternative to letting our own governments take control of the economic engines and social order of the world infrastructure. Hence, he sympathizes with them and tries to help them to the extent he can afford the time and energy.\" **Anne:** \"So how will you hide from them?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I began this process of defection nearly a year ago. As I told you before, I began to systematically disentangle myself from the ACIO's invasive security precautions . . . which include electronic sensors implanted underneath the skin in the back of the neck. I effectively stripped myself of these devices so I'd have a chance of remaining underground until a reasonable solution could be negotiated.\" **Anne:** \"I assume there's nothing the police or FBI could do to help?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Nothing that I'm interested in.\" **Anne:** \"But what will you do to protect yourself?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"As you can imagine, Anne, there's certain information I can't share with you given the nature of these interviews.

I'm not usually so scattered by the way. It's just that you're telling me things that get me going in a hundred directions at once and I can't keep myself focused. Sorry . . . \"Any rate, tell me more about your experiences with the WingMakers. You said earlier that you had visitations with them . . . right?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes.\" **Anne:** \"So what were they like and what did they tell you?' **Dr. Anderson:** \"Well I suppose the best way to describe them is that they were like a lucid dream. The first time I actually interacted with them, I was taking a catnap at the lab and I suddenly woke up like someone had tapped me on the shoulder to awaken me, and when I turned around, there was no one there. I shrugged it off as a dream, and went back to my nap. The next thing I remembered I woke up and saw two luminous objects about the size of a human being and with the general appearance of a body . . . though they were too bright for me to look directly at them . . . so I wasn't really sure of their appearance initially. \"The light had a rhythmic pulsing quality to it and this pulsing seemed to entrain my own consciousness. It was like . . . like feeling something that was extremely powerful, but equally gentle at the same time... the dipole effect was very unusual. I had no fear of these objects emotionally, but mentally I felt at odds with my trust, as if I should feel fear. I must've remained semi-conscious of this experience for maybe ten seconds or so, and then I felt my mind become linked to the mind of these beings. \"They told me they were WingMakers and that they had entered my time to help me.

They encoded their messages for two reasons: one, to ensure security of their time capsule and its contents, and two, to make certain that the ones who discover it will serve the WingMakers' agenda and not their own.\" **Anne:** \"So are you saying they felt that the Labyrinth Group was not going to apply their own agenda? If that's the case, I don't these WingMakers have much insight into the Labyrinth Group.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Except for one small issue. The WingMakers are the Labyrinth Group . . . only 750 years in the future.\" **Anne:** \"You're kidding. How could that be?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"That's almost exactly what I said at the time, only it was expressed with more amazement. We had considered the possibility as one of our early hypotheses, but it was never taken that seriously because we never had proof or evidence other than symbolic representations. \"Anyway, that was essentially what they wanted to communicate to me in that first conscious interaction. They, for whatever reason, had chosen me to be their liaison and were intent on helping me bring the contents of their time capsule to the public domain, and more specifically, to the Internet. That was the essence of their instruction. \"So when . . . \" **Anne:** \"I still don't understand how they could represent the Labyrinth Group . . . If they have BST then why not hand it over like I said before? What's their concern?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Like most things concerning BST, you have to unlearn all of your conventional precepts about how things work before you can understand the nature of BST. \"The WingMakers are the result of a whole new evolution of humankind. They're not time-bound. They're able to separate their physical and non-physical selves and, in the latter state, travel across vertical time and interact with it. I'm not sure that it's exactly the form of BST that Fifteen has in mind . . . it's seems more like bi-location except in different time periods instead of space. While in the foreign time they can re-materialize their physical bodies and interact with the physical environment if they choose. They can even bring objects with them and transfer these objects to the foreign time, as they did in the case of the Ancient Arrow site. \"But to give BST, or any aspect of it, to any individual, organization, or government, you first have to completely understand them and through that understanding, trust them.

That takes time and observational experience. It also takes testing. And I think that's what the WingMakers are doing with their time capsules. They're testing the Labyrinth Group, and Fifteen in particular, to see what his true intentions are.\" **Anne:** \"I know this is going to sound like a tangled up question, but the WingMakers are 750 years ahead of us. Right?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes.\" **Anne:** \"And in their future, they represent the Labyrinth Group. Right?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, that's right.\" **Anne:** \"And they don't trust the current membership and/or leadership of the Labyrinth Group. Right?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Apparently not enough to simply hand over their technologies.\" **Anne:** \"So that's why they've placed their knowledge of BST inside seven time capsules and planted them inside or underneath rock formations or wherever. But I read in one of the ACIO memos or . . . maybe you told me . . . that the final time capsule wouldn't be discovered until the year 2023. And that's after the takeover bid by this hostile alien force. It doesn't make sense.\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"I understand your line of questioning. Unfortunately, my interactions with the WingMakers have been on different topics so far. Perhaps later I'll learn more about their plan as far as the 2018 elections and hostile takeovers are concerned. I've only had three interactions with them thus far, and all three have been brief encounters, and mostly one-way communication . . . they communicating messages to me.\" **Anne:** \"I'm feeling the need to bring this session to an end. My mind is quite literally filled to the brim. I think if you told me anything profound right now, it'd just go in one ear and out the other.

They were changed sometime in mid-2001. Starting in early 2001, the entire WingMakers website, which had remained unchanged up to that point, began to change and take on a new flavor. **Though subtle, the changes often appeared designed to lead readers back to hierarchical ways of thinking and to the need for saviors in the form of a Central Race. **This is quite a contrast to the message in the [WingMakers philosophy](https://www.WantToKnow.info/divinewisdomunderstanding). Though other parts of the current website have continued to change and develop, we have not seen any further changes to the two interviews since they were first changed in 2001. However, two additional interviews which were not part of the original WingMakers website were later added. You can verify all of this using archive.org, which shows how the website appeared at various times in the past.

As the two interviews are quite long, we will present a few of the major changes here which demonstrate that they were more than simply \"additions\" to the story, as has been claimed numerous times by James. For those who don't know, James appeared on the website in 2001 claiming to be the originator of all of the WingMakers material. He also claimed that the WingMakers story was only a modern day myth.

I invite you to open to your own spiritual guidance and draw your own conclusions as you explore these intriguing matters. **Summary and Exploration** **Here are some samples of changes demonstrating that the changes made to the interviews were much more than just additions to the story**, as James has claimed in a [personal email to me](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakersorig/wingmakersmarkhempeljames) and elsewhere. All comments not part of either the original or changed interviews are in italics. *Original interview text (deleted from interview on current wingmakers.com website):* Dr. Anderson: \"I decided to leave the project after I was successful in deducing the access code for the optical disc. Shortly thereafter I became aware of what I can only describe as the presence of the WingMakers. I felt as though they were visiting me . . . even assisting me in my work . . .\" *The same passage in the changed interview (Dr. Anderson becomes Dr. Neruda in changed interviews):* Dr. Neruda: \"I decided to leave the project after I was successful in deducing the access code for the optical disc, and felt that the ACIO was going to prevent the public from accessing the information contained within the Ancient Arrow site. There were other reasons, but it's too complicated to explain in a concise response.\" *This below section comes from the original interview immediately after the first paragraph above. This exchange between Anne and Dr. Anderson was completely deleted from the changed version.* Anne: \"When you say 'visiting you', what evidence did you have that the WingMakers might be visiting you?\" Dr. Anderson: \"I was spending 70 hours per week working on the decoding formulas for the symbol pictures, and this went on for about 8 months. During this time I tried every conceivable combination to create an access code to the optical disc. I was convinced it was the only way to open it. I was also convinced that it was purposely made to be difficult, at least to our present-day brains. It was almost as though the struggle to decode their language was exercising a part of my brain or nervous system that was enabling me to communicate with them.\" \"I began to hear them speaking to me.

It began as a word or two . . . then a sentence . . . maybe just once a day. It didn't make much sense . . . what I heard. But then one day I was working on a chamber painting and I saw something move in the painting. One of the symbols moved and it was absolutely not an illusion or trick of the light. Then I realized that the WingMakers could interact with me, that they were time traveling to my time and that somehow their paintings were actually portals in which they moved through time. ... When I finished with the access code and it worked, I knew then that I was indeed communicating with them.\" Anne: \"Did you tell anyone? I mean about the fact that you were communicating with the WingMakers?\" Dr. Anderson: \"I kept it a secret. I wasn't sure how I would be able to explain the phenomenon and I didn't want to arouse suspicions. ... They visited me a total of three times -- always in my home at night -- and told me that I had been selected to be their liaison or spokesperson. Of course I asked them why me and not Fifteen, and they said that Fifteen was unable to speak for them because he was already the pawn of the Corteum.\" *Note that any reference to Fifteen being a pawn of the Corteum is deleted in the changed version of the interview. Is this just an addition, as claimed by James? The changed interviews also delete numerous passages which talk about Dr. Anderson's special energetic connection with the WingMakers. In fact, the WingMakers there are described as being part of a superior Central Race which is intent on saving us from an evil alien race, which in the changed interviews is called the Animus. Yet the original WingMakers philosophy is very clear that in the new paradigm, our task is to transcend hierarchical ways of thinking and stop seeking saviors outside of ourselves, choosing instead to search for the deepest wisdom within.* *Also deleted from an early portion of the original version of the first interview:* Dr. Anderson: \"The other outcome of immersion in the time capsule's contents was a sense of loyalty to the WingMakers' philosophy and approach to life. I found myself becoming less and less technology-centric and more and more spiritually focused. There was a sense of entrainment caused by their teaching that I couldn't explain.

For whatever reason, I began to loose my objectivity as a researcher, and felt myself more of an advocate of the WingMakers.\" *The new version appears to downplay any spiritual aspects and focus more on scientific and military matters. * * In the changed interviews on the current website:* Dr. Neruda: \"The Labyrinth Group believed that the WingMakers are representatives of the Central Race, and that they created our particular human genotype to become suitable soul carriers in our particular universe. The Ancient Arrow site is part of a broader, interconnected system of seven sites installed on each continent. Together, we believe this system constitutes a defensive technology.\" *He later adds:* Dr. Neruda: \"The Central Race is divided into seven tribes, and they are master geneticists and the progenitors of the humanoid race. In effect, they are our future selves. Quite literally they represent what we will evolve into in time and towards in terms of space. ... The Central Race resides in the most primeval galaxies nearest the centermost part of the universe. ... The central universe is the material home of First Source and is eternal. ... The Central Race is known to some as the creator gods who developed the primal template of the human species and then, working in conjunction with the Life Carriers, seeded the galaxies as the universes expanded.\" *The WingMakers on the original website clearly imply that the home of First Source is found deep within each one of us. No mention is ever made on the original site of the WingMakers being involved in military matters or being part of a Central Race from the center of the universe. The term Central Race was never even mentioned. In the original interviews immediately below, Dr. Anderson expresses his belief that the WingMakers may actually be a future version of the ACIO's Labyrinth Group, a view which is expunged from the changed version. * *Original interviews:* Anne: \"Can you elaborate on the WingMakers and who you think they are or represent?\" Dr. Anderson: \"I don't know who they are, but they represent themselves as human time travelers from the middle part of the 28th century. They could very well be the future version of the Labyrinth Group, or some other powerful organization.\" *The original interviews further comment:* Anne: \"But if the WingMakers are so advanced technologically, why time capsules?

Why not just appear one day and announce what ever it is they want to share? Why this game of hide and seek and hidden time capsules?\" Dr. Anderson: \"Their motives are not clear. I think they planted these time capsules as their way to bring culture and technology from their time to ours. And they decided to do this by leaving behind these miraculous structures or time capsules that, once discovered, would lead people to a new philosophy or level of understanding. I think they're as interested in our philosophical outlook as our discovery of BST. Perhaps more so.\" *In the changed version of the above (note that Anne's name is changed to Sarah):* Sarah: \"Back to the WingMakers for a moment, if they're so advanced technologically, why time capsules? Why not just appear one day and announce whatever it is they want to share? Why this game of hide and seek and hidden time capsules?\" Dr. Neruda: \"Their motives are not clear. I think they left behind these time capsules as their way to bring culture and technology from their time to ours. We also believe that these sites represent a defensive weapon. A very sophisticated defensive weapon.\" *Again the emphasis in the changed interviews is on the WingMakers being involved in military matters, which is of prime importance to the ACIO on both the original and changed websites. * *In the changed interviews (no equivalent in the original interviews):* Dr. Neruda: \"The Animus desire to own this planet in order to own its genetics. As I've already mentioned, this is a synthetic race. A species that can clone itself and fabricate more and more of its population to serve the purpose of its colonization program. However, it desires more than the expansion of its empire. It desires to become a soul carrier -- something reserved for pure biological organisms. Synthetic organisms are not able to carry the higher frequencies of soul, which absolutely require an organic nervous system.\" Sarah: \"So they want a soul?\" Dr. Neruda: \"They want to expand throughout the universe and develop their organic nature through genetic reengineering. They want to become soul carriers in order to achieve immortality. They also want to prove what they already believe, that they are superior to all other pure organics.\" *The original interviews talk about an alien race (called the animus in the changed interviews) which is from a galaxy 2.6 million light years away.

In the changed interviews, the distance is changed to 37 million light years. In the original interviews, the Corteum is described as coming from a planet 15,000 light years away. In the changed version, this number is changed to 15 million. Why would someone go to the trouble of changing these distances if they were only \"additions\" to the story? Could it be that someone doesn't want us to look on star charts and figure out which solar systems and galaxies are involved? * *Original interview:* Dr. Anderson: \"Actually, we've tried our remote viewing technology on the WingMakers. It was one of the first things we tried. But we got nothing. In fact, it was the first time when our technology was completely ineffective. We assumed that the WingMakers had developed some form of security that prevented remote viewing. But we weren't sure.\" *Changed version:* Dr. Neruda: \"The ACIO has a department that specializes in Remote Viewing technology, and within this department was a woman of unparalleled capability as an RV. She was assigned to the project as its RV, and she was a critical element in determining the identity and purpose of the WingMakers. ... She was able to make contact with the original planners of the Ancient Arrow site. Through these two RV sessions we were able to determine that the identity of the WingMakers was an ancient -- the most ancient -- race of humankind.\" *Yet the original interviews clearly state that the WingMakers are a future version of humanity. Dr. Anderson later states: *\"The WingMakers are the Labyrinth Group . . . only 750 years in the future.\"* You will find this and related beliefs edited out on numerous occasions in the new version. And why change the remote viewing from \"completely ineffective\" to \"a critical element in determining the identity and purpose of the Wingmakers\"? * *** Note: **From here down quotes are from the original and changed versions of the second interview*. *Original interview:* Anne: \"Okay, last night you mentioned that the WingMakers had appointed you to be their liaison. You also said that they wanted you to be their liaison because Fifteen was a pawn of the Corteum. Can you elaborate on that?\" Dr. Anderson: \"I was apparently selected to be their spokesperson in this time, and not only help translate their text, paintings, and symbol pictures, but also help in bringing these things to the public's attention.

In other words, I don't think the WingMakers desired the contents of their time capsules to be held in a secret repository deep within the bowels of the Labyrinth Group.\" *The changed version appears to make the Labyrinth Group's leader Fifteen a much more respected person, while the originals seriously question his intentions.* *Original interview:* Dr. Anderson: \"It was a pure grade titanium-beryllium composite, which, as you may know, is extremely rare.\" *Changed interview:* Dr. Neruda: \"It was a pure grade composite of unknown origin.\" *Could it be that someone wanted to hide the composition of the material mentioned at this point in the interviews? Why else would they delete it on making changes? More detail generally makes for a better story.* *Original version:* \"After the initial discovery of the Ancient Arrow site, all of the physical artifacts that could be removed from the site were carefully packed in shipping crates and shipped to the ACIO research lab in Virginia, and are held by the Labyrinth Group in its own laboratory.\" *Yet in the changed version here and in another section, the location of the ACIO research lab is changed from Virginia to Southern California. If it's only a modern day myth or additions to the story, why bother with this change? Virginia, for those who don't know, is the hub of a lot of top-secret intelligence activities. * *Original interview:* Dr. Anderson: \"If you take the WingMakers on face value, in other words, what do they say it is, it's a time capsule that will help facilitate the development of a global culture. They claim that somehow, when all seven of the time capsules are discovered, that they'll serve as a communication bridge between humans of today and their future selves.\" *Changed version:* Dr. Neruda: \"The Ancient Arrow site was labeled initially as an Extraterrestrial Time Capsule, or ETC, however, it is not actually, in my opinion, a time capsule. ... The site is part of a larger structure that's interconnected through some means I don't understand. We know there're seven sites that have been constructed on earth -- presumably in the ninth century. We know that these sites have some defensive purpose, and we know that the sites planners represent themselves are culture bearers, and are most likely representatives from the Central Race.\" *In the changed version, Dr. Neruda says he believes the ancient arrow site is not a time capsule, whereas in the original, Dr. Anderson talked very", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviewschanges.txt:6:7924172fd563", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15786, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviewschanges.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviewschanges", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "interconnected through some means I don't understand.

The changed interviews also focus heavily on the importance of DNA, where the original WingMakers philosophy discuss how genetics is being used by the hierarchy to control us and keep us from finding wisdom within ourselves. In the changed version there is also a heavy emphasis on souls and soul carriers, when this is hardly mentioned in the original. * **Final Note** From these changes and lots more, it is apparent that the additions James claims to have made to the original story are much more than just additions. The changes in fact have a very different quality and flavor from the originals. Almost as soon as the website began to change in 2001, I and many others who strongly resonated with the amazing materials on the original website suspected intervention with an agenda. If the intriguing story of the WingMakers on the original website were true, we would expect the ACIO to do their best to either remove the WingMakers website or distort the information to lead readers back to their own agenda. I strongly suspect that the ACIO did, in fact, put lots of resources into gradually and subtly bringing these empowering materials back in line with their own hierarchical agenda. It is even conceivable that the James, who now claims to have originated all of the WingMakers materials, is the linguist Dr. Anderson, but has now had his memories erased and is back under the control of the ACIO, as he clearly stated might happen. Yet each one of us must draw our own conclusions.

I found James response to your question on this particular change to be very revealing. His argument that the shift was due to a change of emphasis from the individual activation/enlightenment focus to collective species evolution was not convincing at all. His view that individuals would not be able to provide answers to the contingencies of the evolution of a whole species, thereby requiring an external intervention is really the critical issue here. **Without explicitly saying it, James was justifying a form of \"spiritual coup d'etat\" whereby human evolution would be directed by the Central Race and their Lyricus Teaching Order who have the sufficient spiritual resources, history and stature to guide the human race forward.** In short, an individualized response would be too unpredictable and chaotic to handle such a delicate task. This kind of approach to human evolution is something that Lynne Picknett and Clive Prince warned about in their book, *The Stargate Conspiracy*. They argue that there has been a long term effort to condition humanity in a way so that at a certain point in our history/evolution, we would accept a new cosmic religion. I was wondering how that agenda would express itself since there are a number of candidates that might qualify, *The Urantia Book*, *The Keys of Enoch*, *Council of Nine*, etc., all posit hierarchical systems that would legitimate external intervention by a \"Central race\" to correct the course of human history. **The refocused WM material now also provides a Centralized authority guiding human evolution, and provides the foundation for that authority intervening at a future crisis moment, which now can be manufactured at any time. They can thus simply take over. So much for human sovereignty.** The original WM material with its emphasis on individual activation/enlightenment and references to the WM as humans from 750 years in the future (an evolved ACIO) is much less suited as providing a foundation for a new Cosmic Religion. Indeed, the psychological reaction towards contact with a future group of humans (our descendents) is very different to that of possible contact with an ancient Central Race that first spawned the human species and are its cosmic protectors. Neil Freer's book, *Breaking", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviewsdifferences.txt:0:9a537737a517", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15789, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviewsdifferences.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviewsdifferences", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "original WM material with its emphasis on individual activation/enlightenment and references to the WM as humans from 750 years in the future (an evolved ACIO) is much less suited as providing a foundation for a new Cosmic Religion. Indeed, the psychological reaction towards contact with a future group of humans (our descendents) is very different to that of possible contact with an ancient Central Race that first spawned the human species and are its cosmic protectors. Neil Freer's book, *Breaking the Godspell* nicely illustrates the imperative of not simply returning to an old paradigm whereby the 'gods' solve our problems. So simply on that argument, I would view the original WM version as displaying less evidence of framing information in a way intended to deceive us and undermine human sovereignty. I also found the shift towards the description of the seven ancient arrow sites as a defensive weapon rather than as individual activation mechanisms to be very telling. That was something that I eventually felt very uncomfortable about when I read the WM material after the changes had been made. It provided a national security spin that has guided our thinking down a path that encouraged centralization and hierarchy. Much effort needs to go into countering the national security filters that will be attached to future disclosure of extraterrestrial life. **A contrived national security approach is something we need to guard against as our planet evolves into a galactic society and deal with a number planetary contingencies along the way.** I appreciated you pointing this shift in your analysis. Finally, your response to James that the idea of humanity ascending into more rarefied dimensions is part of an 'old' paradigm is really very important. The idea that individuals/species evolve 'upwards' in this way naturally leads to ideas that we need to escape the coarseness and brutality of lower dimensions/densities. So models of separation are proposed, an Ascended 4D/5D Earth for the enlightened vs a 3D earth for the recalcitrants, Heaven vs Hell, etc. Religious orders and spiritual traditions have been traditionally based on this old paradigm of spiritual liberation in order to escape suffering, rebirth, etc. In this new paradigm we are not talking so much of souls liberating themselves, but of a Divine force using incarnated souls to infuse this material plane with spiritual energy. In other words, **the new paradigm is one wherein Spirit infuses lower densities with soul force that serves a Divine purpose.** So in this model, James' idea that an external agency, the LTO, is needed to guide human evolution upwards is mistaken. What is necessary is individual activation/enlightenment that can assist the devolution of the Divine into lower densities with souls ready to take on this grand adventure. So the goal shifts to transformation, rather than liberation. **Note:** For lots more on changes to the WingMakers website, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakersorig/wingmakerschanges).", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersinterviewsdifferences.txt:1:50f5dc87dcad", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15790, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "WingMakers, ACIO [The ACIO](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakersorig/acio/www.wingmakers.com/arrow/acio/acio1.shtml) | [Time Capsule](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakersorig/www.wingmakers.com/arrow/chambers/capsule.shtml) Project Briefing and Background In 1972, in a remote section of northern New Mexico, a group of hikers discovered an unusual artifact and pictographs within an obscure canyon. An archeologist from the University of New Mexico analyzed the artifact and searched the area where it was discovered, but found no signs that a prehistoric culture had established any permanent site in the canyon. It was presumed that a nomadic, Native American Indian tribe had occasionally used the canyon as a temporary settlement and had left behind a few artifacts of their presence as a consequence. There were, however, two very puzzling questions. All but one of the artifacts could be dated to the 8th century AD. The exception, known as the \"compass\" artifact, appeared to be an unusual form of technology, and was found among more typical artifacts like pottery and simple tools. The compass was covered in strange hieroglyphic symbols, some of which were also found on the pottery. Secondly, the pictographs that were found in the area had inexplicably appeared, and they were strikingly different than any of the other native petroglyphs or rock art found in the southwest or the entire continent for that matter. Because of these two anomalies, the artifacts and the entire project quickly became the property of the US government, or more specifically, the National Security Agency. It was decided that these artifacts might suggest a pre-historical, extraterrestrial presence on earth, and that the NSA had the appropriate agenda and wherewithal to initiate a full-scale, scientific expedition to determine the nature and significance of the site. The site was completely searched by a secret department of the NSA in 1973, but it only resulted in a few additional findings, and none of them were designated as technologies or evidence of an extraterrestrial presence. Additional pictographic symbols were found, but decoding them was a difficult and frustrating process. Experts were called in to help, but it was impossible to reach a consensus as to what the pictographs meant. As quickly as the project had risen as a priority investigation, it fell into the archives of the NSA under the code name, Ancient Arrow. Twenty-one years later, in 1994, a series of rockslides opened up a section of the Ancient Arrow site. The canyon was in a naturally obscure section of park land held by the state of New Mexico. After its discovery in 1972, it had been officially sanctioned off-limits to hikers and campers and was to be left in its natural state. From time-to-time, scientists -- sponsored by the NSA -- would visit the site hoping to uncover new evidence, but were invariably disappointed. Shortly after the rockslide occurrence, a small team of operatives from the NSA visited Ancient Arrow canyon to do some follow-up research. They discovered the rockslide had exposed an entrance to a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro.txt:0:6c561adab0ae", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15791, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "New Mexico.

From time-to-time, scientists -- sponsored by the NSA -- would visit the site hoping to uncover new evidence, but were invariably disappointed. Shortly after the rockslide occurrence, a small team of operatives from the NSA visited Ancient Arrow canyon to do some follow-up research. They discovered the rockslide had exposed an entrance to a hidden cavern that led deep within the canyon walls. At the back of this cavern, the research team discovered a well-hidden entrance into the interior of the canyon wall or rock structure of the Ancient Arrow site. There they found a system of tunnels and chambers that had been carved out from solid rock. There were a total of 23 chambers, all intricately connected to an interior corridor, and each chamber held a specific wall painting, series of pictographs, written hieroglyphs, and what seemed to be dormant, alien technologies. Once this entrance to the cavern was found, a report was immediately filed with the Director responsible for the Ancient Arrow project. The project was then formally brought under the jurisdiction of the Advanced Contact Intelligence Organization (ACIO), which organized an inter-disciplinary research team to assess the exact nature of the site and attempt to discover additional artifacts or evidence of an extraterrestrial visitation. The ACIO is a secret or unacknowledged department of the NSA. It is headquartered in Virginia, but also have personnel in Belgium, India, and Indonesia. They are largely unknown, even to senior directors within the NSA. The ACIO is the lowest profile organization within the entire intelligence community. Its agenda is to research, assimilate, and replicate any technologies or discoveries of extraterrestrial origin. Its personnel consist mainly of scientists who are completely anonymous, yet are paid salaries in excess of $400,000 per year because of their security clearance and IQ. This secret organization not only possesses enormous brain power, but it is also in possession of technologies that are far in advance of any other research facility on the planet. They are, in a word, privileged. The artifacts found at the Ancient Arrow site were virtually incomprehensible to the research team. There were many mysteries. Why would an advanced culture leave their artifacts in such a precise and seemingly ordered manner? What was the message they were trying to leave behind? What were their technologies and why did they leave them behind? Did the creators of this site intermingle with the native tribes or remain an isolated culture? Who were they and why were they here in the 8th century? Were they planning to return? These were only some of the mysteries that challenged the research team. Throughout the seven months of restoration, cataloguing, and analysis, the Ancient Arrow project was a complete enigma.

Who were they and why were they here in the 8th century? Were they planning to return? These were only some of the mysteries that challenged the research team. Throughout the seven months of restoration, cataloguing, and analysis, the Ancient Arrow project was a complete enigma. More of the energy went into the safe preservation of the artifacts, rather than attempting to solve the puzzle of their existence, though speculations were a topic of every conversation. Gradually, a hypothesis was structured by the research team that an extraterrestrial culture established an earth colony in the 8th century and isolated itself within the Ancient Arrow canyon. They brought with them a very precise mission to leave behind a massive \"time capsule\" that would prove to be discovered in the late 20th century. While the exact nature of the time capsule was unclear to the research team, it seemed probable that it was a cultural exchange of some kind and had no invasive intent to earth or its people. It took a team of researchers nearly two years after the restoration was completed to decipher a partial meaning of the chamber artifacts. The 23 separate chambers seemed to be linked together to form some specific message or purposeful mission. In the 23rd and final chamber, they recovered a small optical disc that was presumed to hold digital information that could be the key to deciphering the artifacts. Scientists eagerly analyzed the disc, but they could not figure out how to access its content. The ACIO's finest computer experts were called in to try and unlock the encoded disc, but to no avail. Several more months were spent trying every conceivable method to access the contents of the disc, but nothing worked. The Ancient Arrow project, for the first time in nearly a year, had hit a dead-end and funding for the project was rapidly weaned by the ACIO. After two more months of unsuccessful efforts, it was decided that the technology to access the disc was simply not available. The optical disc and all of the artifacts and findings would be carefully placed in secure storage until the technologies were available to unlock the disc and harvest its content. It was presumed that the disc held star charts, translation indexes, glossaries, and all the answers to the various mysteries of its creators and, perhaps more importantly, their intentions for earth. While the optical disc was considered to be the key to unlocking the meaning of the time capsule, the ACIO had little choice, but to place the project into storage and await the arrival of technologies that would permit them to unlock the disc.

However, there were two scientists from the research team who theorized that the disc could be unlocked by understanding the meaning of the wall paintings in each of the 23 chambers. In their minds it was not a complex, technological solution, but rather a language or translation solution that would unlock the disc. After much persuasion, the ACIO agreed to allow the two researchers to assemble a replica of the time capsule's contents. The replica time capsule consisted of detailed drawings and photographs of all the artifacts from each of the 23 chambers, including detailed, high-resolution photographs of the wall paintings. The two scientists would be allowed to continue their research on their own time provided they maintained utmost secrecy and reported all of their findings directly to the ACIO division head and project director. The optical disc was securely stored away in a vault within the ACIO. The project was officially put on indefinite hold, and all personnel associated with the project were reassigned (with promotions) to different projects. The Ancient Arrow project was not to be spoken of again until which time the technologies ­­ or some other means ­­ provided a way to unlock the optical disc and access its contents. The scientists spent nearly five months in partnership, trying unsuccessfully to decode the Ancient Arrow artifacts and establish the means to unlock the optical disc. During this time, the ACIO regularly experimented with new technologies or methods, and they too, were unsuccessful in unlocking the content of the optical disc. One day, late in the summer of 1996, one of the scientists (a linguistics expert) had an insight into how to unlock the optical disc by reducing the symbols of the wall paintings to their closest facsimile found in an ancient Sumerian text. While the Sumerian language is extinct, it was sufficiently comprehensible to this scientist that he was able to decode the symbols of the paintings, and, placing the 23 words in the same order as the Ancient Arrow chambers, he was able to finally unlock the optical disc. The connection between the Sumerian language and the time capsule was the breakthrough the ACIO team had been waiting for. A simple set of 23 words elicited over 8,000 pages of data from the optical disc. Unfortunately, the data was incomprehensible because there was no character set in the computer that could emulate the hieroglyphics and unusual symbols of the language. Thus, a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro.txt:3:79c47b03e4fe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15794, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "the same order as the Ancient Arrow chambers, he was able to finally unlock the optical disc. The connection between the Sumerian language and the time capsule was the breakthrough the ACIO team had been waiting for. A simple set of 23 words elicited over 8,000 pages of data from the optical disc. Unfortunately, the data was incomprehensible because there was no character set in the computer that could emulate the hieroglyphics and unusual symbols of the language. Thus, a translation index needed to be developed, which took an additional six months. Finally, once a translation index was programmed into the computer, the data, while it could be printed out or viewed on the monitor in its hieroglyphic form, still required translation to English. And this translation process was extremely tedious and could not be facilitated through computers, owing to the subtlety of the language and its intricate connection to the wall paintings and pictographic representations elsewhere within the Ancient Arrow site. As partial translations began to be developed, it was determined that even within the optical disc there was a segmentation of the data into 23 units. Each unit appeared to correspond to a specific chamber. As the first two chambers began to be translated, it was further shown that each unit contained philosophical and scientific papers, poetry, music, and an introduction to the culture and identity of its creators. The creators of the time capsule referred to themselves as WingMakers. They represented a future version of humanity who lived some 750 years in our future. They claimed to be culture bearers, or ones that bring the seeds of art, science, and philosophy to humanity. They had left behind a total of seven time capsules in various parts of the world to be discovered according to a well-orchestrated plan. Their apparent goal was to help the next several generations of humans develop a global culture; a unified system of philosophy, science, and art. In early 1997, the ACIO scientist who had originally discovered the access code for the optical disc became strangely sympathetic with the WingMakers' mission. He was convinced that the ACIO would never share the discovery with the public, and he was certain that it was too significant to withhold. He also claimed that he was in communication with the WingMakers and that they were watching the ACIO's progress and would, at the appropriate time, make the time capsule and its contents available to the public. This assertion troubled the ACIO and particularly the Ancient Arrow project director, who eventually recommended a leave of absence for the scientist and was summarily dispatched from the project. The scientist was afraid that his memories would be tampered with or destroyed altogether, and so he defected from the ACIO, quite literally the first to ever do so. Soon after his defection, the scientist disappeared.

Soon after his defection, the scientist disappeared. However, before his disappearance, some of his materials regarding the WingMakers and their time capsule were given to a journalist that he had selected at random. The author of this document is that journalist. I am in possession of photographs, music, poetry, artwork, translation indexes, copies of secret documents, and a variety of translated philosophical texts that all stem from the Ancient Arrow project. I've taken every precaution to remain anonymous so I can't be traced. I'm convinced that these materials are released against the wishes of a secret organization that probably has powers that even our government is unaware of. Before the ACIO scientist had contacted me, (whom I will hereafter refer to as Dr. Anderson), I felt little or no interest in matters related to time-travel, extraterrestrials, secret organizations, or anything else similar to these issues. When I initially heard the story it seemed preposterous, but I kept my journalistic objectivity, and met with Dr. Anderson and reluctantly concluded that it would be unlikely for an individual to fabricate this story with such detail and supporting evidence, and then desire to remain anonymous. Dr. Anderson had brought files of photographs and drawings of odd-looking technologies that had strange symbols engraved on their outer casings. Research reports referencing the translation tables, cipher protocols, star charts, and dozens of memos from the ACIO department heads discussing the Ancient Arrow project. Everything, including about 400 pages of philosophical text had an authenticity to it that I was unable to reproach or ignore. In fairness to those who will suggest I should investigate further in order to get independent corroboration before I present these materials, let me just say, that I'm unable to corroborate his story because of the very nature of the ACIO. However, for whatever reason, I trust Dr. Anderson who gave me these materials. He asked nothing from me. He desired no money or recognition. His only request was that I decide how best to bring these materials to the public. He counseled me not to investigate the ACIO because he was convinced the NSA would use misinformation tactics that would simply waste my time and make the goal of releasing these materials difficult if not impossible. I've not contacted any other office of the government because Dr. Anderson told me that this would be traced by the ACIO who had high-level operatives in both the NSA and CIA, and, at best, would only invite", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro.txt:5:4d5cbe2cab01", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15796, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "bring these materials to the public.

I'm in possession of certain documents that I'll withhold from the WingMakers' web site, but if anything were to happen to me, I've arranged to have these documents shared with major media companies whom I know. These are my only safeguards in presenting these materials. My only interest is in the release of these materials to the public, and then they can decide what to do about them. They may desire to pressure their politicians or take other action, it's their choice. I'm convinced that this story is too important to be held in the hands of an elite organization whose only interest is to re-engineer the technologies found in the Ancient Arrow site and apply them for their own agenda; no matter how noble that agenda may be. I also realize that the Internet Service Provider who is hosting this web site may come under scrutiny, but if any pressure is exerted on this ISP to abandon its hosting service for this site, then this may also cause me to distribute the documents I referred to earlier. Let me be clear, these documents provide incontrovertible evidence of this secret organization known as the ACIO, and its elite directors are named and their real identities exposed. I've spent the last several months agonizing about how these materials should be presented, and it seemed most appropriate to place them on the Internet to enable a global audience to access them. I have a close friend who created this web site whom I trust completely. Other than that, no one knows what I have done here (including my web site host). You might ask why I've chosen to reserve full-scale media disclosure of the materials given to me by Dr. Anderson. I can only tell you that I don't want to create a circus atmosphere surrounding this discovery. It may ultimately end-up in the mass media, but for now, my instincts are to keep a low profile for both these materials and myself. In doing so, I hope to preserve some sense of the dignity of these artifacts and let it grow from there. I've never been involved in any story approaching this magnitude of importance, and I'm certain that if you spend some time on this web site and suspend your disbelief, even for a few minutes, you will see how important a discovery this", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro.txt:6:8bd5a345f953", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15797, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__WingMakersintro", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "but for now, my instincts are to keep a low profile for both these materials and myself.

The best way you can help is to spread the word about this discovery, and open the eyes of your political representatives. If you have web sites of your own, please link to the WingMakers' site. Dr. Anderson had warned me that the ACIO has an advanced version of a technology based on what he called remote viewing. As I understand it, remote viewing is the ability to ascertain the whereabouts of people through some sort of \"psychic insight\" by someone trained in this technology. I know this sounds far-fetched, but Dr. Anderson was insistent that they had this capability and that it was one of their most feared technologies by those within the ACIO. In effect, it was known to keep their personnel loyal. Unfortunately, this will force me to stay underground and remain very mobile over the next several months, so don't expect too much change to the web site. Believe me, I know that this whole story may seem impossible, but I can only tell you that I've seen detailed drawings and photographs of the artifacts taken from the Ancient Arrow site, and these are most assuredly, to my eyes, not of this time or world. They're unlike anything I've ever seen. Either the WingMakers are real, or someone has gone to a lot of trouble to convince me otherwise and again, I'm a simple journalist without any ax to grind relative to secret government operations, ETs, time travel, or alien artifacts. I'm not here to convert anyone. There is nothing to convert to. I simply want to disclose this material and let each individual absorb it as they choose. I will add additional documents and artifacts from the Ancient Arrow site when I feel it is safe to do so, but for now, there's enough material on this site to introduce anyone to the culture of the WingMakers. I hope you take the time to immerse yourself in these materials. If you do, you may be surprised at the result.

I have been following developments on the wingmakers.com website ever since I first discovered it in late 2000. I was astonished back in early 2001, when I saw the highly intriguing [original WingMakers website](https://www.wingmakers.us) begin to be changed and distorted from its original purpose of encouraging people to look for the deepest answers within. Someone named James also for the first time claimed he had created all of the WingMakers material. For more on these major changes, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakersorig/wingmakerschanges). I was very interested when in February of 2008 a friend told me that he had received an email response from Mark Hempel, the man who apparently originally posted and hosted the WingMakers website back in late 1998. Inspired by this friend, I sent an email to Mark. I was very excited that he responded to my questions about the changes to the website. I then sent a second email asking harder questions. At this point, he referred my questions to James, the man who claims to have created the whole website and now claims that it is a modern day myth. I was absolutely thrilled when James gave a detailed response to my email. His responses to my questions, however, did not convince me that he was the true creator of the WingMakers website. I sent a second email to James asking even deeper questions about the changes that were made. Sadly, James never responded to this message. For those who are interested, I've included the entire exchange of emails I had with both Mark Hempel and James below.

From my extensive research on this topic, I believe you first posted the WM website on the Internet in late 1998. I first came upon it through a wonderful friend's recommendation in November of 2000. Though I initially had serious questions and doubts about much of the mind-boggling information on the site, I was immediately struck by the depth, clarity, and beauty of the philosophical writings. Tears welled up in my eyes as I had never in my life read anything which resonated so deeply in my soul. As I found the WingMakers philosophical material to be so deeply moving, I decided back then to copy the information on the website for future study. But then within a few months, I saw the website gradually begin to change from it's original form. Where it once freely provided inspiration through a story, poetry, paintings, philosophy, and music, the WingMakers website began to transform into a commercial endeavor, making the original content and other material available for sale. Whose decision was this? When did James come in, and how did you know to believe that he was responsible for the material? Did you know that the story around the discovery of the WingMakers site was changed and gradually given a very different spin? Are you aware that the discovery date of the Lost Arrow site was changed from 1972 to 1996? Two additional philosophical writings (both of which overall did not deeply resonate with me) were also added to the original two (which were both originally given on one webpage). Were these given to you by the same person who gave the original philosophy essays? As I mentioned, I have awakened literally thousands of people to the WingMakers materials. I refer these people to the originals, as I find the changes made to the website after 2001 to have taken on somewhat of a hierarchical flavor which goes against the intentions of the teachings in the WM philosophical essays.

It's good to meet you, and better understand what you do. Question 1: Where it once freely provided inspiration through a story, poetry, paintings, philosophy, and music, the WingMakers website began to transform into a commercial endeavor, making the original content and other material available for sale. Whose decision was this? Answer 1: There are many dimensions to this question. First and foremost I think it's important to understand that the web in 2000 was quite different than it is today, relative to bandwidth. Most people were operating with 56K dial-up modems, which meant that downloading 20MB music files and 200MB art graphics was not an option. James felt that the encoded information contained in the music and art was best appreciated in higher resolution than the compressed file format of 100K JPEG and 96K MP3 files. Shortly after I was contacted by Sarah and James to launch the site, they asked me for my opinion on how to bring the higher resolution files to the internet. I explained that CD-ROM would be a good option and the First Source disc was born. James is an experimenter in terms of how to release the encoded data streams (EDS) to the public. One of the reasons he originally contacted me (I learned later) was because of my work with Internet radio, having been one of the founders of the NetRadio, the Internet's first multi-channel radio station. James knew that it would take another 5 years before broadband became more ubiquitous worldwide. So, this was the primary motive behind getting EDS content to the masses. Remember, everything in existence is composed of frequencies. These frequencies entrain and resonate with other frequencies. The higher frequencies contained in light (chamber paintings) and sound (chamber music) are not transmittable via low quality, compressed files. Now, that said, let me make clear that nothing that was on the site previous to the sale of the high resolution music or art was subsequently made available for sale afterwards. Everything that was free before was free after... no exceptions. In fact, since the \"commercialization\" of the WingMakers site much more free content has been added, not to mention the sites of Lyricus and Event Temples-both of which are completely", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt:2:2edd697b51cf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15802, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "are not transmittable via low quality, compressed files. Now, that said, let me make clear that nothing that was on the site previous to the sale of the high resolution music or art was subsequently made available for sale afterwards. Everything that was free before was free after... no exceptions. In fact, since the \"commercialization\" of the WingMakers site much more free content has been added, not to mention the sites of Lyricus and Event Temples-both of which are completely funded by WingMakers and are 100% free. Which is all part of the plan. Question 2: When did James come in, and how did you know to believe that he was responsible for the material? When I started getting the materials sent to me to publish the site, I knew someone was behind the content creation that was not a regular guy, so to speak. I didn't know it was one person as it seemed logical that a group was behind the content. However, as I began to get involved in the production of the First Source disc, I began to interact more with Sarah and finally James came into the picture about the middle of production. He began to make his presence felt in the reviews of the interface, content, and overall design. And then I had a formal email introduction and it was clear, or at least clearer, what the project was about and who was its creator. That said, I remained a doubting Thomas right up to the day I met James in person in upstate New York. That meeting made it clear that he was orchestrating not only the content but the entire vision of what WingMakers > Lyricus > and Event Temples was creating. Question 3: Did you know that the story around the discovery of the WingMakers site was changed and gradually given a very different spin? Yes, of course, but I would disagree that it was given a very different spin. I think it's actually quite similar, but there is much more texture and detail in the Ancient Arrow story than was ever released in the initial story, which was really a placeholder of sorts. The original site was planned to be a bit of a sleeper site in the sense that James was not really expecting it to be seen by many people, because we weren't going to promote the site, but simply release it without any fanfare or publicity. This would permit us to modify the content. This was before the time of staging servers and production servers. But someone or some group got wind of it and it sort of \"busted\" into the mainstream in a matter of a few days. It really surprised me how fast and furious it happened. In any case, that's the main reason the story seems different. The first story was meant as a placeholder,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt:3:9790b9fc170b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15803, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "simply release it without any fanfare or publicity.

In any case, that's the main reason the story seems different. The first story was meant as a placeholder, while the full story was being edited and prepared to replace it. Question 4: Are you aware that the discovery date of the Lost Arrow site was changed from 1972 to 1996? I knew about this, but in light of what I mentioned in the last question, it didn't make an impression on me. Question 5: Two additional philosophical writings (both of which overall did not deeply resonate with me) were also added to the original two (which were both originally given on one webpage). Were these given to you by the same person who gave the original philosophy essays? Yes, James is the author-creator-translator-composer-artist of all of the content related to WingMakers, Lyricus, and Event Temples. Question 6: I refer these people to the originals, as I find the changes made to the website after 2001 to have taken on somewhat of a hierarchical flavor which goes against the intentions of the teachings in the WM philosophical essays. I would very much appreciate if you could tell me something about how these first changes were made and your involvement. Many people have asked and continue to ask me about this, so I would deeply appreciate an answer. I'm not sure how to answer this question since the only thing I have personally seen-relative to the content from James-is that it seems to get more practical and heart-centered. I don't get any sense of \"hierarchal flavor\" as you put it. If any thing, the latest content releases from James seem more grounded and down-to-earth. If you read *The Rising Heart* (James' latest writings), I think you'll see what I mean. While the writing is similar to the Chamber Philosophy, it also provides very practical instruction with graphics. His previous paper *Living from the Heart* is even more practical and feels more of the street than the sky. James is not a televangelist personality or one of those authors who latches on to the lecture circuit and beats the pavement to sell books. He is quietly behind the scenes providing a framework for consciousness and how one can live from their heart through the practice of the six heart virtues. His encoded data streams are his way of \"re-packaging\" the cosmic sound and light into a three-dimensional construct. He never talks down to anyone or bad mouths any other approach to one's divinity.

I deeply appreciate your willingness to address my concerns about changes to the original WingMakers website. Though for me the website clearly took on a more hierarchical flavor during the changes made in 2001, I very much agree that in his recently developed content, James seems more grounded and heart-centered than earlier on. I read his *Rising Heart* essay, and though it did not nearly reach the level resonance of the original WM material, I was very pleased that it was significantly less hierarchical than previous material attributed to him, and much more centered around the heart and inner wisdom. Here is why I don't trust the changes made in 2001, Mark, and even much of the content on the current website. The 2001 changes introduced the concept of a superior Central Race (of which the WingMakers are supposedly a part) which can save us, of a Lyricus teaching order from this race, and of a mysterious \"grand portal\" leading to scientific proof of the soul. None of these concepts were part of or even mentioned on the original WingMakers website. Yet the insertion of these key concepts was among the first changes to the website. These concepts are quite different from the original WingMakers writings, which were all about opening ever more to divine wisdom from within ourselves, and about moving beyond the teacher/student ordering of the hierarchical paradigm to recognize the divine equality of all beings. Among other major changes in 2001, I was amazed to watch the interviews section of the site change so that some parts were", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt:5:0d8e9b76a883", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15805, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "Yet the insertion of these key concepts was among the first changes to the website.

Among other major changes in 2001, I was amazed to watch the interviews section of the site change so that some parts were completely deleted, others added, and certain distances of stars mentioned were even changed. Why would anyone go to the trouble of changing the distances of the stars mentioned? If there is only one question you can answer, this is the one that is most important to me. When I compared the original interviews with the changed version, it became quite clear to me that someone was trying to hide something. Did you ever compare the changes made, Mark? I would also point out that for the first couple years after 2001, virtually no mention was made on the website of the gradual, yet significant changes being made. Clearly significant money was supplied to create the sophisticated changes made to the website in a gradual way so that they wouldn't be easily noticed. Can you tell me where that money was coming from for all this? I will share honestly with you my suspicion that some highly intelligent group, which obviously has ample funds, took control and gradually changed the original website, distorting the information so that those seeking the deep WingMakers wisdom would be subtly led back towards hierarchical ways of thinking. I suspect James is the spokesperson or public face for this powerful group. The WingMakers would never have considered themselves part of a superior race or recommended following the teachings of a special order of teachers. The deepest wisdom resides within each one of us. Those of us who understood and resonated deeply with the original material knew without doubt as soon as the changes began to be implemented that the new material was of a different source. I don't in any way mean to blame you or James or make you wrong, Mark. I am simply one who has been on a deep, lifelong mystic path of spiritual self discovery. Upon reading the original WM material, I wept at reading wisdom far, far more profound than anything I had ever come across in my many years of reading and study. As I watched the intent of those original writings become gradually watered down and distorted from their original purpose, I think you can understand why I was dismayed, and why I'd like to know what happened.

So, I forwarded your email to James yesterday. I can't guarantee he'll answer you because I'm not sure what his response percentage is, but I know he does answer some of the emails I forward because I've heard back from some people who were thankful for his response and they copied me. I've also heard from others that he didn't respond. So, what I'd propose is that you wait a week and if you don't hear anything drop me a line and I'll compose my answers as best as I can.

A1: The *changes*, or, as I would prefer to have them understood, *additions*, within the WingMakers site that you reference in your question exist for reasons I will describe below. They were not added to imbue a sense of external authority or artificial layering of hierarchal controls from a far-flung race of superior beings; quite the contrary I assure you. Let me start at the beginning of the mythology-though this is, I'll dutifully inform you, the shorthand version. The WingMakers are the future of humanity ascended into a higher dimensional, albeit human format-one that is not constrained by time and space. Within the WingMakers (or Central Race) is an organization known as the Teachers of Light and Sound, or, in the context of the WingMakers mythology, the Lyricus Teaching Order (LTO). The LTO exports its teachings to emerging, humanoid civilizations within a local universe for the purpose of activating the specie's awareness of its grander purpose as a collective entity. This activation takes many, many forms, some recognizable and some completely invisible. Over time, as the species evolves through the second, third, and fourth dimensions, it begins to nudge against the fifth dimension, which is the time we are presently in. There are within the human species those who operate in the second, third, and fourth dimensions as their dominant realities even today, but the Collective Consciousness is measured in ratios, and the present ratio is centered on what I will call the lower-midpoint of the fourth dimension, but this will be shifting very rapidly over the next four and half years to the higher midpoint of the fourth dimension, which is the gateway to the fifth dimension. This shift, though it may seem small in terms of degree, is actually the most radical shift since the inception of the planet. The dimensions are not logarithmic in their scope and scale, and the higher one ascends the more expansive they become. I understand that the framework of dimensions instills a hierarchical ordering of the universe, but this is the method in which a species-in this case, humanity-ascends the spiral staircase of consciousness and ultimately unifies through", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt:8:3957643f330b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15808, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "fifth dimension.

The dimensions are not logarithmic in their scope and scale, and the higher one ascends the more expansive they become. I understand that the framework of dimensions instills a hierarchical ordering of the universe, but this is the method in which a species-in this case, humanity-ascends the spiral staircase of consciousness and ultimately unifies through the tempering of the lower dimensions so it may employ the higher dimensional capacities and capabilities as co-creators of First Source and Source Intelligence. Without this tempering, the human species would retain its quarantine from the higher frequencies of the Universal Spirit that will unite it and anoint it as co-creators. All of this applies to the species as a whole, not individuals. Individuals can operate as cocreative outposts of First Source, but if unconnected to a species-wide movement, they remain locked out of the grand design embedded in the imaginings of our Creator. The WingMakers Materials are one of the activators that the LTO has exported to this planet at this time, designed for those within the human species who are connected to the Grand Portal discovery. Embedded within these materials are encoded data streams that are time-artifacts of the Light and Sound of First Source, stepped down into dimensional frequencies that anyone within the human family can access, if they desire. It is not that individuals cannot activate themselves, or lack the natural capacity to shift dimensionally. They can and do. The problem is that the \"noise\" levels are very high within the world because of the spread of consciousness from the second to the fifth dimension. In other words, the species is stretched, in a sense, across four major dimensions and this creates noise. *Noise* in this sense: The frequencies that are radiating from the human family (and because of human invention) are dissonant and incoherent, competing and interfering with the field of unity, which is the sub-quantum bedrock from which we all arise. Amid this *noise*, the *signal* of First Source is diminished, and sometimes indistinguishable from the noise itself. You can think of it this way. Deep in the woods on an autumn day, if you are quiet and focused, you can hear a single leaf hit the forest floor with amazing clarity-even at a distance of 20 meters. But in the heart of the city, you will never have that experience because the ambient noise level is too high. The signals of nature are lost in the swell of mechanical inventions-sirens, buses, whirring hard disks, HVAC systems, cars, and even electromagnetic fields. If something could transport you, momentarily, from the city to the forest, and you could tune in to the subtle sounds, you would be startled at what your body can perceive.

If something could transport you, momentarily, from the city to the forest, and you could tune in to the subtle sounds, you would be startled at what your body can perceive. Again, this is all about ratios. As a species approaches the fifth dimension, its variation and dimensional separation is what generates the dissonant noise field. First Source, as you can well imagine, is fully aware of this phenomenon and has established compensatory systems. One of these is to boost the signal of unity by aligning the planetary position relative to Central Sun or the galactic source of higher dimensional frequencies. This alignment is not happenstance or coincidental, it is all part of a highly orchestrated plan. The other way is to create \"pockets\" of coherence that provide a sober, exploratory entrance to the deeper teachings that empower the individual to activate their energetic responsibility-the transmission of their personal energy system to the benefit of their fellow creatures and the planet upon which they live. Perhaps the compensatory system that is least understood is that of the planet itself. As an entity of consciousness, earth is dimensionally ascending according to it own plan. As the human species spreads and extends the reach of its consciousness, it signals the planet that it is time to shift dimensionally into a higher frequency field. Earth is undergoing this dimensional shift now and will complete it over the next four and half years. There is, as Hollywood coined it, the \"Perfect Storm\" of human consciousness spread, galactic alignment, and intentional planetary dimensional shift. This confluence of interlocking processes is, as previously stated, carefully orchestrated through Spirit or Source Intelligence. This particular aspect (planetary shift) requires, in most cases, a parallel planet to be engineered to provide a maturing environment for those whose energetic, subatomic structures are not suited or properly conditioned for the higher dimensional frequencies in which earth is unerringly approaching. I will use an analogy to ensure clarity. Imagine that there was a group of fleas riding atop a wild dog. The dog was subject to temperature extremes, running through the brush, and a variety of other challenges-all of which favored the fleas that had conditioned themselves to hang on and adapt to the conditions present in the wilderness. Those that couldn't hang on were mercifully placed on a domesticated dog that was appropriately pampered in a fenced, manicured yard. Admittedly, while this is a crude analogy, it does make the point that humans are guests upon earth, and earth is indeed the host. Those unable to adapt to the frequencies of the new", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt:10:388740f86f23", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15810, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "variety of other challenges-all of which favored the fleas that had conditioned themselves to hang on and adapt to the conditions present in the wilderness.

Admittedly, while this is a crude analogy, it does make the point that humans are guests upon earth, and earth is indeed the host. Those unable to adapt to the frequencies of the new earth, will be gently \"shuttled\", reincarnationally speaking, to a planet comparable to earth so they may progress in their own time. It is somewhat like cell division, where the human family divides into two worlds, each the \"zygote\" of a new species divided only by time and space, and ultimately unified when time and space recede beneath the horizon of eternity. (This is an echo of the relationship between the WingMakers and Humanity.) The evolutionary journey of the species is set with checkpoints that typically lay as dimensional barriers. Frequency coherence is the key attribute by which a species can pass through the checkpoint and obtain a higher frequency experience of their human instrument and the planet upon which they live. The ultimate checkpoint is the Grand Portal, which stands between the higher 4th and lower 5th dimensional plane of existence. The Grand Portal was introduced in the later works of the WingMakers as a means to depict the underlying purpose of the work. The Grand Portal signifies a shift of humanity from the 4th dimension to the 5th dimension, and while this shift is still far in the future (insofar as the human species is concerned); it will become understood by science in approximately 75 years and become the backbone of science and religion as they merge into one integrated system of experience and expression. Thus, the additions to the WingMakers Materials were key elements pointing to the Grand Portal. They were required additions in order to aptly define the human trajectory of evolution. What you have sensed was simply the shift of emphasis from the individual rendering of the \"activator\" to that of the human species. When this shift was made, it appeared to change the materials, ordering them into a more hierarchical structure, but that is only a result of the introduction of the Grand Portal, which necessitated a more species-level depiction of the materials. The role and definition of the LTO was delineated as part of the disclosure of the Grand Portal, since the LTO helps to disseminate this activating vision to the species. Again, you can argue that any organization in charge of activating a vision and mission as broad as the Grand Portal is hierarchical in nature, but I would ask you, if not the LTO, who? Who would provide this architecture of human achievement?

Who would provide this architecture of human achievement? The movement of the human family into the fifth dimension is a collective crossing; it is not the purview of any one individual, or for that matter, organization. It is not enough for the individual to achieve cosmic consciousness while in the human instrument. To what end? To write poetry like Whitman? To espouse new philosophical insights like Plato? Or perhaps, more metaphysical elaborations like Bohm? Individuals achieve cosmic consciousness and it opens them to a finer mesh connection to the Universal Field, and they become transmitters of the ability within the human family. But the new consciousness that is now forming within the human family is not rooted in the historical insights of God or Spirit, but in an intelligence that is present in every square nanometer of space, every moment of time and every point of energy, and this consciousness is awakening inside the human instrument within all who are prepared so we can become the universal species as envisioned by the LTO. This is not a time of individual ascension and then dutiful service to teach. Rather it is a time of unification and collective intelligence working to move the species from separatist isolationism to universal connection and awareness. Q2: Among other major changes in 2001, I was amazed to watch the interviews section of the site change so that some parts were completely deleted, others added, and certain distances of stars mentioned were even changed. Why would anyone go to the trouble of changing the distances of the stars mentioned? If there is only one question you can answer, this is the one that is most important to me. When I compared the original interviews with the changed version, it became quite clear to me that someone was trying to hide something. A2: There were a handful of changes made in the interviews, but I'm not sure why this would be so important to anyone, especially the type of changes you've referenced in your question. The simple and prosaic answer is that I created slight variations in the WingMakers Materials as a means to track them. As you're undoubtedly aware, placing content on the web is different than a book format in the sense of the copyright controls.

I was aware that this would be an attribute of using the web as a distribution center for these works, and wanted to track the permutations. Q3: I would also point out that for the first couple years after 2001, virtually no mention was made on the website of the gradual, yet significant changes being made. Clearly significant money was supplied to create the sophisticated changes made to the website in a gradual way so that they wouldn't be easily noticed. Can you tell me where that money was coming from for all this? A3: The projects related to WingMakers.com, Lyricus.org, and EventTemples.org are all funded 100% through the sales of the WingMakers CDs and art reproductions.

Those of us who understood and resonated deeply with the original material knew without doubt as soon as the changes began to be implemented that the new material was of a different source. A4: I think I have answered this question already, but to put a finer point on it, I would add that while the deepest wisdom resides within the individual, there is no one who finds it without help. There is a need to have teachers and way showers. There is a need to have activating content. There is a need to have one another to inspire the insights and fire the imagination. The Universal Field of Living Truth flows underneath each of us just as surely as water flows beneath the ice of a frozen river. But there are certain outlooks, certain perspectives, and certain techniques where the interface to the deeper truths is improved, and it is easier to break through and draw it into your life.

I can assure you that the source of the information did not change; the mission broadened, as planned, and the work reflected this. The entire body of work will unfold and it will continue to change, and certainly not for the sake of confusing anyone or watering down the content's truth. Rather, it will change because the mission is multidimensional. For example, the WingMakers materials resonate and activate different frequency domains of the human instrument. There are certain passages of music and poetry that are utterly without connection to the mind. The art is the same way, it activates different recesses of the heart one time and the mind another. The philosophy of Chamber 2 is very different than the Lyricus discourses, and the discourses are very different from the Event Temples e-paper entitled *Living from the Heart**.* The animation from the Event Temples is very different than the *Meditations of Time-Space DVD.* All of the content is connected to a larger plan, and if you slice it into sections and compare one section with another, you will see differences to be sure, but you may also miss the larger relationship-the larger plan-both of the content, as well as its useful service to your own life and purpose. There is so much information in the public domain that pertains to the spiritual realms, some of it is reinforcing and resonant, but most of it is splitting and separating the consciousness of humanity. For example, today I received a letter from a young man in Sao Paulo, a partial quote follows: *\"What is happening? What is it all about? This theories. This prophecies. Hollow Earth, **Shamballa, Agartha, Astral Travel, Channelings, Telepathy, Nibiru, Annunaki, The **Mayan Calendar, Planet X, Ashtar, The Armageddon. I'm sorry but, i don't know if i'm **the only one, but i'm really lost. I Don't know what to do. Which way i should go? What **should i believe? What can i do? I'm so lost. Seriously. I'm so lost.\"* Now, this person is only 18 years old, so he has less life experience than some, but you can hear the confusion and frustration in his voice, and his sentiments speak for thousands, if not millions, of others. The list he cites could have been ten times longer, but the point remains: How do any of us-in the face of the separation that exists in our philosophical realm-find agreement in belief?

And not only agreement, but, more importantly, a sense of confidence that we are on the right path, the path of enlightenment, and not further confusion or the distraction of half truths. We all have access to the Living Truth within us, and yet we remain tethered to our doubts and fear-based living. This is the mirrored reflection of the spread of consciousness, that, as a collective thing, is not coherent and therefore it is not aligned to the Living Truth. Today a thousand, no, a hundred thousand writers speak their truth and share it, but the resulting picture of \"truth\" is a blurry mosaic that casts doubt on the human mind's ability to define truth, let alone a path into enlightenment. Does this mean that humanity requires a savior? Does it show evidence that the spiritual realm, as an object of knowledge, is unknowable? No, not in my opinion, but it does suggest that the six heart virtues and their everyday application and expression is a far better route to forming a spiritual purpose than the framing of words in a philosophical soup. Too much is made of the word choice instead of the behavior choice. It is through the latter that we define our truth, and this is the living truth that flows from the innermost worlds of our existence into the outermost worlds of our five senses and physical body. We are here to be of service, and this applies to each and every one of us. Our service contribution is the energetic transmission contained in our expression of the six heart virtues, and our ability to achieve and sustain personal coherence in our daily affairs and relationships. This is the real value in the spiritual life because it does not separate with words, but rather bonds with behaviors. And it injects *meaningfulness* into the smallest moments of our life. Our media and popular culture make the focus of life a quest for glamour and prestige and power and money. We are seduced by these things because they are burned so deeply into our psyche that it is near impossible to resist. But even those few who achieve these things feel lost, perhaps even more so as a result of their achievement.

But the expression in the behaviors of appreciation, compassion, humility, forgiveness, understanding, and valor, these leave an energetic \"fragrance\" that lasts forever because it entangles and resonates with the Universal Field, and Spirit *reapplies* this energy to the betterment of the planet and all who live upon her. In short, we need more people who apply the six heart virtues even in the most insignificant corners of their life. I don't say this lightly, either. I am well aware that it is not easy to outflow compassion to someone who just gave you the finger after cutting you off on the highway. It is not easy to understand why there is so much hatred surfacing between religious organizations or governments or members of the human family. It is not easy to forgive someone who wrongs you intentionally. But this is what is required of those who will assist the human family to become unified and coherent so it may knock upon the door of the Grand Portal, seeking entry into the fifth dimension as a coherent collective and not simply as a group-large as it may be-of individuals. I hope my responses provide some measure of understanding to your questions. From my world to yours, James From: Fred Burks **Sent:** Wednesday, February 27, 2008 11:38 AM **To:** Mark Hempel **Cc:** Chris Bowers **Subject:** Mark, questions about WM website from a former presidential interpreter Hi Mark, Thank you so much for forwarding that in-depth response from James. I am deeply grateful to both you and James for taking the time to respond to my questions. Could you please send James my response below? Thanks again for playing a key role in the major expansion of my own awareness, and you have a great one! With deep gratitude and joy, Fred Dear James, I deeply appreciate your in-depth response to my questions about changes in the WingMakers material. I very much respect your intentions of spreading heart energy in the world and preparing humanity for a major shift. As I have followed changes to the WM website since 2000, I've been happy to see in the last year or two what has felt like a more open and heart-centered energy.

As I have followed changes to the WM website since 2000, I've been happy to see in the last year or two what has felt like a more open and heart-centered energy. I also know you've been in communication about your work with wonderful people like Teka Lutrell, someone whom I deeply respect for his commitment to shifting the paradigm on our planet. Thank you for opening to this kind of collaboration and for inviting us all to open our hearts more. I have some important questions regarding your response to my previous message. To give a quick background, even as a child I understood sacred love and the interconnectedness of all beings. I have been on the mystic path for most of my life on this beautiful planet. Though I've never followed any one path exclusively, I have studied and participated in most major religions and their associated mystic branches, finding that each of these contains their own unique kernels of truth and wisdom. I love a saying of Gandhi, \"If a man reaches the heart of his own religion, he has reached the heart of all religions.\" In recent years, I have become aware of the spiritual hierarchy discussed by key figures in the metaphysical and occult literature like Alice Bailey and in tools like the Urantia book. Having studied and explored many different aspects of spirituality over the years, I was amazed when I came across the original WM philosophy in 2000 to find something far deeper than I had ever found in my many years of spiritual exploration. I instantly felt an incredibly rich, deep resonance with this material, as well as with the creators of the material. Though my eyes and spirit were opened in incredible ways on a conscious level, on another deeper level, I realized I had already known everything that was being shared. I was rapidly activated to a significantly expanded state of consciousness by this amazing material. The most powerful opening I experienced in digesting the original WM philosophy had to do with the ascension agenda. Like so many here on Earth and in other star systems, I had shared in the collective desire to get beyond the trials of this planet, to soar beyond this physical reality and ascend to higher spiritual realms. After being so powerfully activated by the WM material, however, I instantly realized how mistaken I had been. I saw that my mission is not at all about ascending. Ascension often reflects a desire to abandon those we consider to be lower than ourselves in hopes of reaching a higher state where we leave all of the dense", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt:17:ba30c0131337", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15817, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "collective desire to get beyond the trials of this planet, to soar beyond this physical reality and ascend to higher spiritual realms. After being so powerfully activated by the WM material, however, I instantly realized how mistaken I had been. I saw that my mission is not at all about ascending. Ascension often reflects a desire to abandon those we consider to be lower than ourselves in hopes of reaching a higher state where we leave all of the dense vibrations behind. Yet now I see so clearly that my life is not about ascending to other dimensions. I am here to embrace all people and all beings no matter what their level of vibration or understanding. I want to leave no one behind as we all expand our consciousness to ever greater awareness. And many others resonate with me on this. We are all about presencing the divine here on this planet, even in these dense realities. Here is the key quote from the WM on this: *When the fragments are aligned and inter-connected, the entity becomes the instrument that facilitates Source Reality expansion. Thus, the entity does not ascend from the time-space universes, but rather coalesces into a state of wholeness whereby its sovereign expression can assist in the expansion, or in a different context, the descent, of Source Reality into the time-space universes. Ascension is often construed as the natural outcome of evolution. That all planetary systems and species are evolving to the point where they ascend from limitation, and that eventually, the time-space universes will somehow fold into Source Reality and cease to exist as fields of vibration. **It is actually quite the opposite. Source Reality is descending.** It is inclusive of all things, and it is the Source intention to expand, not retreat. The entity transforms to wholeness within the cradle of the time-space universe, and, in so doing, becomes the accessory of Source Reality's intention to expand. * These words powerfully awakened a part of me that had been dormant during this particular life sojourn, James. I and many others on a path similar to my own were thrilled with how this material awakened us. We right away felt and resonated with the very high vibration. Starting in 2001, we also felt how that high vibration was subtly, yet significantly diluted with all of the changes made. In my core essence, I know that the author of the original WM material and the author of the changed material are not the same. The vibration is just too different. Yes, the beings behind both the original material and the changed material are ultimately from First Source or Prime Creator, as we all are, but there is a very difference resonance between the original and the changed materials. In your response to me you mention several times the ascension of humanity to higher dimensions.

In your response to me you mention several times the ascension of humanity to higher dimensions. You talk of \"ascending the spiral staircase of consciousness.\" You talk about a \"galactic source of higher dimensional frequencies.\" Yet all of these are what the original WingMakers would call old models of existence which we are now preparing to move beyond. You also talk about the species evolving, when in the original WM philosophy, which is still posted on your current website largely unchanged, evolution is clearly presented numerous times as the old model of existence which we are now moving beyond. To quote the WingMakers material still posted on your site: *It will become the fundamental purpose of the hierarchy to slowly remove these barriers to equality in such a way that the hierarchy appears to be the savior of consciousness rather than the guard of consciousness.* Much of the new material for me resonates at the level of the hierarchy referred to in the above quote. Though recently I have seen more heart energy -- which I truly appreciate -- there is still a lot of hierarchical language being used on the current website and in your letter to me. Yes, it is subtle and your material clearly vibrates at a rate higher than most of what is available currently on this planet, yet the original WM material had none of this. Considering this, can you honestly tell me that you wrote the original material and that all of these changes are simply additions? Back in 2001 and 2002, I carefully compared the many changes made to the interviews, and it is not only star distances that were changed. Regarding star distances, I know that whoever changed those distances wanted to hide what's really going on related to certain ET species. Can you give me a valid reason why someone would change the star distances if only making \"additions\" to the story. And there are so many other changes. The portrayal, for instance, of 15 is shifted such that he appears much more benign than he was in the original interviews. I can show you the many specific deletions and additions which reveal a very specific, albeit subtle, hierarchical agenda behind all of these changes. Were all of these simply \"additions\"? I have revealed a great deal of who I am and who we are to you here, James. So I would now like to ask you directly, who is behind all of these changes?

Who are you working with, and how much do you really know of all that is going on here. I understand that you may not be at liberty to reveal some of these things, but I would appreciate an honest answer. I resonate strongly with the original WingMakers, so I can perceive the resonance at which you vibrate in your communications, and it is not the same. I have been aware of the parallel planet agenda for some time. On a spirit level, I know that this is the hierarchy's agenda. I understand that you support this agenda and trust that you are doing what you believe to be best. Yet when I open up to guidance from the divine for what's best for all of us, I have received clear guidance to reveal the parallel planet agenda as a means of separating us from ourselves, because I know -- and you know -- that we are all interconnected on the deepest levels. I want to be a force which invites every one of us to connect ever more clearly with all of us through our divine essence. I don't want to abandon to another planet the more dense aspects of myself, which are a more dense aspect of all of us. I want to invite all densities to dance together in this beautiful cosmic dance. If it feels right to you, I invite you to join me and the many who resonate with me in this exciting expansion of divine energy into all densities. The most profound truths are quite simple, James, and anyone can access them. You know this and are even teaching some things along these lines now. Yes, the energies can be confusing to many living in the thick Earth density, yet whenever anyone chooses to open to the deep wisdom within their own soul, the Divine reaches out (or reaches in) to touch that soul and guide them. I invite you and your colleagues of the LTO to join those of us who are here to assist in this process of the expansion of the divine into all universes. Like all beings, you and the LTO are always free to choose the path that you believe is best. Yet also be aware that I and many others are working to invite all here to open to the wisdom that lies deep within without any need for external teachers or", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt:20:88e176ba1ca7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15820, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "invite you and your colleagues of the LTO to join those of us who are here to assist in this process of the expansion of the divine into all universes.

I am thrilled to have had the privilege to open many thousands of people to the wisdom of the original WM material. I know that I am one of those who is building bridges, yet there is no name on the bridge. It is simply a bridge, a neutral tool which takes people deeper into their own divine wisdom understanding. Thank you for the key role you are playing in all of this James. I don't know how much you are aware of what you are doing on the deepest energetic levels in your work, yet I am fully aware that everything that you and I are doing is all a part of the expansion of the divine in our world. In the end, every one of us is playing our role with divine perfection. I am deeply grateful for the role you are playing, James, and the role being played by those working with you. In the end, we are all beautiful mirrors for each other reflecting the many amazing and unique parts of ourselves to each other. And when we come together to work for both personal and universal transformation, life cannot help but become a rich, miraculous journey for us all. Thank you for your presence on this planet, and I very much welcome your thoughts on all of this. With abundant love and warmest wishes for you and for all of us, Fred **Note:** My unwavering life commitment is to what's best for all beings and to personal and global transformation through love and empowerment. **Final Note:** I did not receive any response to the above email from Mark Hempel or James. For a detailed, revealing comparison of changes to the WingMakers interviews, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakersorig/wingmakersinterviewschanges). These changes raise serious questions about some of the claims of James above. To make things more complex, in November of 2008, James consented to do a written interview with the awesome website [Project Camelot](http://www.projectcamelot.org). I was both fascinated and excited to read what James wrote. You can read his profound interview [at this link](http://projectcamelot.org/james_wingmakers_sovereign_integral.html). Quite different from his response above, in his response to question seven in the Project Camelot interview, he states: *Ascension is of the teacher-student ordering of the universe ... It defines the subtle aspects of self-deception that are caught-up in the spiritual belief systems of Earth and the interdimensional planes", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt:21:7c60ef54de20", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15821, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__wingmakersmarkhempeljames", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "do a written interview with the awesome website [Project Camelot](http://www.projectcamelot.org).

It defines the subtle aspects of self-deception that are caught-up in the spiritual belief systems of Earth and the interdimensional planes as well. If you believe you are in the process of ascending, ask yourself the questions: Where I am ascending to? Are my mental pictures of ascension based on my own experience or have they been downloaded from the information and knowledge systems of humanity? ... All of the energy, efforts, attention and learning that are placed on the ascension process are a diversion from your own realization of the Sovereign Integral. * I am thrilled that James' own view seems to be evolving. In this interview, he seems to be inviting us not to abandon others by hoping that some will ascend to a heavenly version of Earth, while others will suffer on a hellish Earth. He is no longer supporting the ascension process and the parallel planet agenda mentioned in his communication to me. Thank you, James, for opening more to the interconnectedness of all of us. May we all embrace all beings as our divine brothers and sisters, as beautiful manifestations of All That Is. I wish you a beautiful journey in your explorations of the WingMakers material and of life and the world and universe in which we live. Remember that the deepest answers are always there inside of you. The Divine is patiently waiting to reach out (or reach in) to touch and guide any soul who asks from their heart for guidance.

The ten compositions that are available on this web site derive from the optical disc found in the 23rd chamber of the WingMakers' time capsule. ** **Anne:** \"Was the music already on the optical disc and you simply captured it from the disc, or was it basically produced by the Labyrinth Group based on the musical notations?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Actually, it was a bit of a combination of the two. Their musical notations were very precise and they left digital samples of each of their instruments - even vocals. So we simply translated their digital samples to a MIDI standard and produced our own version of their music. Of all the things that we've translated, the music was the easiest to produce, but also the one that we're not sure as to its accuracy.\" **Anne:** \"So were you involved in the music translations as well?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes. I helped in the initial discovery of their musical notation and helped with the translation indexes. I wasn't involved in its production phase, though I was very curious as to what it would sound like.\" **Anne:** \"Can I hear any of these compositions?\" **Dr. Anderson:** \"Yes, of course. When I left, the ACIO had successfully translated 10 of the 23 music compositions. I have these. And they've been converted to both CD and cassette standards.

The Sovereign Integral is the fullest expression of the entity model within the time-space universes, and most closely exemplifies Source Intelligence's capabilities therein. It is also the natural state of existence of the entity that has transformed beyond the evolution/saviorship model of existence and has removed itself from the controlling aspects of the Hierarchy through the complete activation of its embedded Source Codes. This is the level of capability that was \"seeded\" within the entity model of expression when it was initially conceived by Prime Creator. All entities within the time-space universes are in various stages of the transformational experience and each are destined to achieve the Sovereign Integral level as their Source Codes become fully activated. The transformational experience is the realization that the entity model of expression is capable of direct access to Source Intelligence information, and that the information of Prime Creator is discovered within the entity level of the Sovereign Integral. In other words, the human instrument, complete with its biological, emotional, and mental capabilities, is not the repository of the entity's Source Codes. Nor is the human instrument able to reach out and gather in this liberating information--this glorious freedom to access All That Is. It is the entity that is both the harbor of, and instrument of access to, the Source Coding activation that permits the transformational experience to manifest through the integration of the human instrument and the sovereign entity. The transformational experience consists of the realization that perceived reality is Source Reality personified in the form of individual preferences. Thus, Source Reality and sovereign reality become inseparable as the wind and air. This confluence is realized only through the transformational experience, which is unlike anything known within the time-space universes. There have been those upon terra-earth who have experienced a shallow breath of wind from this powerful tempest. Some have called it ascension, others have attributed names like illumination, vision, enlightenment, nirvana, and cosmic consciousness. While these experiences are profound in human standards, they are only the initial stirrings of the Sovereign Integral, as it becomes increasingly adept at touching and awakening the remote edges of its existence. What most species define as the ultimate bliss is merely the impression of the Sovereign Integral whispering to its outposts of form and nudging them to look within to their roots of existence and unite with this formless and limitless intelligence that pervades all.

What most species define as the ultimate bliss is merely the impression of the Sovereign Integral whispering to its outposts of form and nudging them to look within to their roots of existence and unite with this formless and limitless intelligence that pervades all. The transformational experience is far beyond the calibration of the human drama much like the stars in the sky are beyond the touch of terra-earth. You can observe the stars with your human eyes, but you will never touch them with your human hands. Similarly, you can dimly foresee the transformational experience with the human instrument, but you cannot experience it through the human instrument. It is only accessed through the wholeness of the entity, for it is only in wholeness that the Source Codes and their residual effects of Source Reality perception can exist. And truly, this wholeness is only obtained when the individual consciousness is separated from time and is able to view its existence in timelessness. Nevertheless, the human instrument is critical in facilitating the transformational experience and causing it to trigger--like a metamorphosis--the integration of the formful identities into the Sovereign Integral. This is the next stage of perception and expression for the entity model, and it is activated when the entity designs its reality from life principles that are symbolic of Source Reality, as opposed to the reality of an external source that is bound to the evolution/saviorship model of existence. These life principles are Source Intelligence templates of creation. They are designed to create reality from the perspective of the Sovereign Integral and hasten its manifestation within the fields of vibration that has thus far repelled it. They are principles that construct opportunities for the integration of the entity's formless and formful identities. They are bridges that the human instrument--with all of its componentry intact--can experience the Sovereign Integral perception of wholeness. As the human instrument becomes increasingly responsive to Source Intelligence it will gravitate to life principles that symbolically express the formative principles of prime creation. There are wide ranges of expressions that can induce the transformational experience of the Sovereign Integral and liberate the entity from time-space conditioning and external controls. Inasmuch as the expression can vary, the intent of the expression is quite narrowly defined as the intent to expand into a state of integration whereby the human instrument becomes increasingly aligned with the Sovereign Integral perspective. There are three particular life principles that accelerate the transformational experience and help to align the human instrument with the Sovereign Integral perspective. They are: 1) Universe relationship through gratitude 2) Observance of Source in all things 3) Nuturence of life When the individual applies these", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__chambers__indexes__philo.txt:1:da3450be907b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15828, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__chambers__indexes__philo.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__chambers__indexes__philo", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "expression can vary, the intent of the expression is quite narrowly defined as the intent to expand into a state of integration whereby the human instrument becomes increasingly aligned with the Sovereign Integral perspective.

They are: 1) Universe relationship through gratitude 2) Observance of Source in all things 3) Nuturence of life When the individual applies these principles, their life experience reveals a deeper meaning to its apparently random events--both in the universal and personal contexts. Universe Relationship through Gratitude This is the principle that the Universe of Wholeness represents a collective intelligence that can be personalized as a single Universal Entity. Thus, in this model of inference, there are only two entities in the entire cosmos: the individual entity and the Universal Entity. Inasmuch as the individual is impressionable and constantly changing to adapt to new information, so is the Universal Entity, which is a dynamic and living template of potential energies and experiences that are coherent and as knowable as a friend's personality and behavior. The Universal Entity is responsive to the individual and its perceptions and expressions. It is like a composite omni-personality that is imbued with Source Intelligence and responds to the perceptions of the individual like a pool of water mirrors the image that overshadows it. Everyone in a human instrument is indeed, at their innermost core, a sovereign entity that can transform the human instrument into an instrument of the Sovereign Integral. However, this transformation is dependent on whether the individual chooses to project an image of a Sovereign Integral upon the \"mirror\" of the Universal Entity, or project a lesser image that is a distortion of its true state of being. The principle of universe relationship through gratitude is primarily concerned with consciously designing one's self image through an appreciation of the Universal Entity's supportive \"mirror\". In other words, the Universal Entity is a partner in shaping reality's expression in one's life. Reality is an internal process of creation that is utterly free of external controls and conditions if the individual projects a sovereign image upon the mirror of the Universal Entity. This process is an interchange of supportive energy from the individual to the Universal Entity, and this energy is best applied through an appreciation of how perfect and exacting the interchange occurs in every moment of life. If the individual is aware (or at least interested in having the awareness) of how perfect the Universal Entity supports the individual's sovereign reality, there is a powerful and natural sense of gratitude that flows from the individual to the Universal Entity. It is this wellspring of gratitude that opens the channel of support from the Universal Entity to the individual and establishes a collaboration of purpose to transform the human", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__chambers__indexes__philo.txt:2:4ad4defb6c2e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15829, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__chambers__indexes__philo.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__chambers__indexes__philo", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "exacting the interchange occurs in every moment of life.

It is this wellspring of gratitude that opens the channel of support from the Universal Entity to the individual and establishes a collaboration of purpose to transform the human instrument into an expression of the Sovereign Integral. It is principally gratitude--which translates to an appreciation of how the inter-relationship of the individual and the Universal Entity operates--that opens the human instrument to its connection to the sovereign entity and its eventual transformation into the Sovereign Integral state of perception and expression. The relationship of the individual with the Universal Entity is essential to cultivate and nurture, because it, more than anything else, determines how accepting the individual is to life's myriad forms and manifestations. When the individual accepts changes in sovereign reality as the shifting persona of the Universal Entity, they live in greater harmony with life itself. Life becomes an exchange of energy between the individual and the Universal Entity that is allowed to play out without judgment and experienced without fear. This is the underlying meaning of unconditional love: to experience life in all its manifestations as a single, unified intelligence that responds perfectly to the projected image of the human instrument. It is for this reason that when the human instrument projects gratitude to the Universal Entity, regardless of circumstance or condition, life becomes increasingly supportive in opening the human instrument to activate its Source Codes and live life within the framework of the synthesis model of expression. The feeling of gratitude coupled with the mental concept of appreciation is expressed like an invisible message in all directions and at all times. In this particular context, gratitude to the Universal Entity is the overarching motive behind all forms of expression that the human instrument aspires to. Every breath, every word, every touch, every thought, every thing is centered on expressing this sense of gratitude. A gratitude that the individual is sovereign and supported by a Universal Entity that expresses itself through all forms and manifestations of intelligence with the sole objective of creating the ideal reality to activate the individual's Source Codes and transform the human instrument and entity in to the Sovereign Integral. It is this specific form of gratitude that accelerates the activation of the Source Codes and their peculiar ability to integrate the disparate componentry of the human instrument and the entity, and transform them to the state of perception and expression of the Sovereign Integral.

Time is the only factor that distorts this otherwise clear connection between the individual and Universal Entity. Time intervenes and creates pockets of despair, hopelessness, and abandonment. However, it is these very \"pockets\" that often activate the Source Codes of the entity and establish a more intimate and harmonious relationship with the Universal Entity. Time establishes separation of experience and this creates doubt in the Universal Entitys system of fairness and overarching purpose. In turn, this creates fear that the universe is not a mirror but rather a chaotic, whimsical energy. When the human instrument is aligned with the Sovereign Integral and lives from this perspective as a developing reality, it attracts a natural state of harmony. This does not necessarily mean that the human instrument is without problems or discomforts, rather it signifies a perception that there is an integral purpose in what life reveals. In other words, natural harmony perceives that life experience is meaningful to the extent you are aligned with the Sovereign Integral, and that your personal reality must flow from this strata of the multidimensional universe in order to create lasting joy and inner peace. Gratitude is a critical facet of love that opens the human instrument to acknowledge the role of the Universal Entity and redefine its purpose as a supportive extension of sovereign reality, rather than the whimsical outreach of fate or the exacting reaction of a mechanical, detached universe. Establishing a relationship with the Universal Entity through the outflow of gratitude also attracts life experience that is transformative. Experience that is richly devoted to uncovering life's deepest meaning and most formative purpose. Observance of Source in All Things This is the principle that Prime Creator is present in all realities through all manifestations of energy. IT is interwoven in all things like a mosaic whose pieces adhere to the same wall, and are thus, unified. However, it is not the picture that unifies the mosaic, but the wall upon which its pieces adhere. Similarly, Prime Creator paints a picture so diverse and apparently unrelated that there appears to be no unification. Yet it is not the outward manifestations that unify, it is the inward center of energy upon which the pieces of diversity are layered that unifies all manifestations. This centerpiece of energy is the collective storehouse of all life in all fields of vibration within the Universe of Wholeness. It is Prime Creator who divests ITSELF in all forms through the projection of ITS Source Intelligence in to all fragments of life.

It is Prime Creator who divests ITSELF in all forms through the projection of ITS Source Intelligence in to all fragments of life. Thus, Source Intelligence--acting as an extension of Prime Creator--is the unifying energy that is the \"wall\" upon which all the pieces of life's mosaic adhere. Life flows from one energy Source that links all to All and one to One. Observance of Source in All Things is the principle that all manifestations of life convey an expression of Prime Creator. It does not matter how far the unifying energy has been distorted or perverted; the Source can be observed. It is the action of perceiving the unification of energy even when the outward manifestations appear random, distorted, unrelated, or chaotic. When all manifestations of life are genuinely perceived as fragmentary expressions of Prime Creator, the vibration of equality that underlies all life-forms becomes perceptible to the human instrument. Life initially emerges as an extension of Source Reality, and then, as an individuated energy frequency invested within a form. It vibrates, in its pure, timeless state, precisely the same for all manifestations of life. This is the common ground that all life shares. This is the tone-vibration of equality that can be observed within all life forms that unifies all expressions of diversity to the foundation of existence known as Prime Creator. If an individual is able to look upon any form of life with the outlook of equality, then they are observing Source in all things. While this may seem like an abstract concept, it is actualized through the practice of looking for the outward and inward manifestations of Prime Creator. In a very real sense, the individual expects to observe the workings of Source Intelligence in every facet of their experience. It is the unassailable expectation that everything is in its rightful position, performing its optimal function, and serving its purpose to activate the fullest expression of its life in the present moment. It is the outlook that all life is in a state of optimal realization and experience regardless of condition or circumstance. It is the perception that life is perfect in its expression because it flows from perfection, and that no matter how divergent its manifestations are, life is an extension of Source Reality.

How can life--in all its forms and expressions--be perceived as optimal or perfect? This is the great paradox of life, and it cannot be reconciled with the human instrument's mental or emotional capabilities. It can only be understood in the context of the entity, which is deathless, limitless, timeless, and sovereign. Paradoxes exist because the human drama is too limited in scope and scale to allow a perception of wholeness to intervene and illuminate how the pieces of the puzzle are unified in perfect relation. The human drama is circumscribed by the dimensions of time and space and the elements of energy and matter. It is played out upon the stages of survival and dysfunctional behavior because of the Hierarchy's methods of controlling information and manipulating conditions. The entity within the human instrument is largely unexpressed and under-utilized in the human drama, and therefore, life's apparent perversions and imperfections are seen in isolation as impediments to perfection rather than perfection itself. Life is perfect in its resolve to expand and express an intelligence that is limitless. This is the fundamental purpose of life in all its diverse manifestations, and this is the presence of Prime Creator--expressing ITSELF as a vibration of equality--that can be observed in all things. Sensory input derived from the human instrument is limited to frequencies in specific ranges that only convey an echo of this Source vibration. The true frequency is understood through deliberate and focused contemplation of equality inherent in all things, and the ability to penetrate beyond the picture of a thing to the origin of the picture. These insights require a new sensory system beyond the five-senses that rule the human world in your time. These new senses are the outgrowth of the Source Code activation, and represent the first stage of the transformation experience. With this new perceptual ability, the human instrument will be capable of sensing not only the presence of Prime Creator, but also the timeless essence within all life that is individualized and uniquely separate from Prime Creator. Calling forth the perceptions of the entity within the human instrument is the ideal method to access a lasting sensitivity to the Source vibration. This is how an individual can develop the ability to observe Source in all things. It is not only that Prime Creator is within every individual manifestation of energy, but is also the wholeness of life itself. Thus, the principle requires an observance of Source in all ITS diverse forms of manifestation, as well as in the wholeness of life.

Thus, the principle requires an observance of Source in all ITS diverse forms of manifestation, as well as in the wholeness of life. Nurturence of Life Life, in this definition, is an individual's sovereign reality. It is subjective and impressionable to the human instrument. Life is the wholeness of experience flowing past the individual's field of perception in the dimension of nowness. There is never a closure to life or final chapter written. It is eternal, but not in the abstract sense of never ending or beginning, but rather in the real sense that life is ever expanding in order to express Source Intelligence in all fields of vibration within the Universe of Wholeness. The nurturence of life is the principle that an individual is in alignment with the natural expansion of intelligence inherent within all life. This is an alignment that enhances the life-energy that flows past the individual with the clear intent of gentle support. It is the action of identifying the highest motive in all energy forms and supporting the flow of this energy towards its ultimate expression. In so doing, the action is performed without judgment, analysis, or attachment to outcome. It is simply nurturing the energy that flows from all manifestations and supporting its expression of life. This is a departure from the normal perception that nurturing support can only be granted when energy is in alignment with personal will. However, when the individual can view life as an integrated energy flowing in the expression of expanding intelligence, life is honored as an extension of Prime Creator. In this context, there is no energy that is mis-directed or unworthy of support and nurturence. While this may seem contrary to the evidence of abusive energy upon terra-earth, even energy that is laden with \"evil intent\" is nevertheless energy that is flowing outward in search of a higher expression. All forms of energy can be nurtured and supported to their highest expression, and this is the fundamental action of this principle. It requires the ability to perceive the causal motive and ultimate expression of life-energy as it passes through the individual's sovereign reality. Energy is an element of life that is so subtly interwoven with form that it is one; in much the same manner as space and time are inextricably linked in union. Energy is a motive.

It is intelligent beyond the mind's ability to reason. While it is a force that can be subject to human applications that deny its highest expression, energy is always imbuing life with the motive to expand and evolve. Life-energy is always in a state of becoming. It is never static or regressive in its natural state. The human instrument is very capable of nurturing this natural expansion of energy to forge new channels of expression and experience. In fact, it is the primary purpose of the human instrument to expand the life-energy that encircles its sovereign reality within physical existence and transform it to new levels of expression that more accurately reflect the perspective of the Sovereign Integral. There are many specific actions that can be taken to nurture life. Each entity is, in a sense, programmed within its Source Codes to transmute energy through a tremendous variety of means. Working through the human instrument, the entity is able to collect and store energy within the human instrument and re-direct its purpose or application. The transmutation of energy can occur on either the personal or universal levels of expression. That is, within the sovereign reality of an individual, energy can be transmuted to conform to a vision of personal welfare, or aligned with a vision of universal welfare and goodwill. One of the best methods to transmute energy is through one's belief system. All beliefs have energy systems that act like birthing chambers for the manifestation of the belief. Within these energy systems are currents that direct life experience. The human instrument is aware of these currents either consciously or unconsciously, and allows them to carry it into the realm of experience that exemplifies its true belief system. By cultivating beliefs that expand and transform energy, the human instrument is able to engage energy systems that are nurturing to life in all its myriad forms. When beliefs are clearly defined as preferred states of being, the energy system is engaged in nowness--not in some future time. Now. The energy system becomes inseparable from the human instrument and woven into its spirit like a thread of light. Clarity of belief is essential to engaging the energy system of the belief, and allowing the nurturence of life to prevail in all activities. So again, the nurturence of life is critical to both personal and universal realities within the Universe of Wholeness which contains all the fields of vibration that are interlinked like threads of an infinitely expanding fabric.

Thus, as the individual awakens to their creative power to transmute energy and enhance it with the clear intent of gentle support, they become transmitters of Source Reality and architects of the synthesis model of existence. Through the ongoing application of these life principles, Source Intelligence increasingly becomes the identity of the entity, and the entity becomes the identity of the human instrument. Thus, identity is transformed, and in the wake of this transformation, the Sovereign Integral unifies the human instrument with the entity, and the entity with Source Intelligence. It is this unification and shifts of identity that is the explicit purpose in expressing the life principles of the Sovereign Integral. If there is any other intention or objective these principles will remain misunderstood and their catalytic powers dormant. It is the perspective of the Sovereign Integral that all life is pure love in its fullest expression, and that in this single concept, all life is conceived and forever exists. This becomes the core belief from which all other beliefs arise, and by their extension, one's belief system emerges with a clear intent of supporting this fundamental perspective. Of nurturing, observing, and appreciating the Universe of Wholeness as the cradle from which all life is created, evolves, and ultimately acknowledges. These life principles are merely symbols represented in words and served to the human instrument as a potential recipe to stir awake the embers of light that tirelessly burn within. There are no specific techniques or rituals that are required to invoke the power of these principles. They are simply perspectives. In a real sense, they are intentions that attract experience that expand consciousness. They do not provide quick fixes or instant realizations. They are amplifiers of personal will and intention that clarify how one lives. Their transformative power is contained exclusively in the intent of their application. Through these life principles of the Sovereign Integral, the individual can become a master of unlimiting the Self. Boundaries are set, veils are pulled down, and one's light is subdued, simply because external, hierarchical controls create fear of the unknown and mystical practices of a sovereign being. In these life principles, if they are truly applied with proper intent, are the tools to accelerate the emergence of the Sovereign Integral and feel its perspective, its insights, and its empowered abilities to create new realities and shape them as learning adventures that liberate and expand consciousness.

This is the underlying purpose of the principles and perhaps the best reason to explore them. **The Shifting Models of Existence** The consciousness of the Sovereign Integral is the destination that beckons the human instrument inward into the reality of Prime Creator. In all of the wanderings of the human consciousness from Source Reality, it has eliminated the compelling features of Source Reality through the application of the logical mind and the persistent belief in the language of limitation that flows from the external controls of the hierarchy. Source Reality, hidden behind language, has gradually become \"illuminated\" by the prophets of your world, and has thus, taken on the image of language, rather than the expression of its compelling features. Language is the purveyor of limitation. It is the pawn of tyranny and entrapment. Virtually all entities within the time-space universe desire to preserve a dependence upon a hierarchy that stretches between the individual and the compelling features of Source Reality. It is the hierarchy that utilizes language as a form of structural limitation, though in relative terms, it can appear to be liberating and empowering. Source Reality is the dwelling place of Prime Creator, and it dances outside of the constructs of any language. It is complete within itself, and has a singular purpose of demonstrating the collective potential of all species within the Universe of Wholeness. It is the archetype of perfection. It is the standard bearer of each entity's innate design and ultimate destiny. ITS essence is so far beyond conception, that the human instrument's tendency is to resort to the language of externals--and ultimately the hierarchy--to define Source Reality. The hierarchy, through the purveyance of an evolution/saviorship model of existence, has attempted to guide the development of all entities throughout the Universe of Wholeness. The connection between the individual and the Source is subtly undermined through the layers of language, belief system manipulation, and ritual controls designed by the hierarchy to intervene between the spiritual essence of entities and their source, Prime Creator. Each individual must know themselves to be free of all forms of external reliance. This is not to imply that one should not trust others or band together in alliances of friendship and community.

When the hierarchy withholds information, the interpretive centers for relative truth are positioned to acquire and maintain power rather than dispensing the empowerment of Source equality. There are so many layers of relative truth that if you listen to the language of externals, you will most likely abandon your own power in favor of the proclamation of language. Language is seductive to the ego's drive for power and control, as well as the mind's inclination to surrender to, and believe in, the language of externals. It can lure the unsuspecting into believing images and ideas--real or imagined--for the sake of holding individuals in bondage to a lesser truth, or keep individuals supporting the hierarchy when it no longer serves a purpose. The time is fast approaching when the veils of control at all levels of the hierarchy will be rendered obsolete by entities who are destined to pull down the veils and allow sovereign power to prevail over hierarchical power. There are entities who have woven their future existence with terra-earth and are destined to demonstrate the truth of Source equality among all entities at all levels of expression. It will become the fundamental purpose of the hierarchy to slowly remove these barriers to equality in such a way that the hierarchy appears to be the savior of consciousness rather than the guard of consciousness. There are those present who will ensure that the curtain falls swiftly for those who are ready to be equal with their Source, are willing to skirt the hierarchy's tangled pathways, and embrace their divinity as sovereign expressions of Source Reality. The hierarchy represents diverse interests, perceptions of reality, and motives of action. It is this diversity that causes the hierarchy to become ineffective in leading individuals to their equal status with Prime Creator. However, this diversity is also what permits the hierarchy to attract and initially awaken such a breadth of individuals to their spiritual energies and intuitive centers. Nevertheless, the hierarchy has trapped itself in diversity and vested specialization that prevents it from evolving from an arduous ladder of evolution to a joyous river of Light that is aligned with the purpose of empowering entities to Source equality.

These feelings are related to the fragmentation of the human instrument and its inability--while fragmented--to fully grasp its wholeness perspective and reach into its divine origins and accept itself as equal with Prime Creator. Thus ensues the seemingly endless search to be saved from the inadequacy and insecurity that result from the fragmentation of the human instrument. The motive to evolve consciousness derives from the feeling of being less than whole. And in particular, the feeling of being disconnected from Prime Creator due to imperfect judgment caused by the fragmentation of the human instrument. It is through these feelings that the fragmentation perpetuates itself for the entire species and is passed into the genetic mind which is the shared foundation of the human instrument. The genetic mind of the human species is the single most powerful component of the hierarchy and it is formed by the very conditions of the human instrument living in a three-dimensional, five-sensory context that is all-consuming. When the entity initially enters a human instrument at birth, it is immediately fragmented into a physical, emotional, and mental spectrum of perception and expression. From that day forward the entity is carefully conditioned to adapt into, and navigate within, the three-dimensional, five-sensory context of terra-earth. In effect, the entity purposely fragments its consciousness in order to experience separation from wholeness. In this state of separation, the entity has handicapped itself for the purpose of new experience and a deeper understanding of the Primal Blueprint or grand vision of Prime Creator. Through this deeper understanding, the entity can, through the human instrument, transform the three-dimensional context into a self-aware, integrated component of the Universe of Wholeness. This magnificent and purposeful endeavor produces the urge within the human instrument to seek out its wholeness and re-experience its divine connection to Prime Creator. This search, in large measure, is the fuel that drives the individual to seek out and explore the evolution/saviorship model of existence. It provides the individual with the motivation to seek help and guidance from a specific subgroup of the hierarchy, and in so doing, develop a sense of belonging and unity. It is this very same sense of belonging and unity that helps to catalyze a growing awareness of the underlying union between the human instrument, the Entity Consciousness, the Universe of Wholeness, Source Intelligence, and Prime Creator.

This is why the evolution/saviorship model is so critical as a component to the Grand Experiment. It is the stage whereby the human instrument develops a sense of unity and belonging. A sense of relationship to some grand and encompassing vision. This is why the hierarchy nurtures saviors. It is also why the feelings of inadequacy and insecurity are developed and nurtured by the hierarchy. It actually hastens the unification of humanity, which in turn, will hasten and lead to the unification of humanity with the Universe of Wholeness. Spiritual leaders are able to peer deeply beneath the surface reality of life and experience how intricately connected every life form is, and how this composite of life is intelligent far beyond the human instrument's capability to both perceive and express. It is because of this condition that spiritual leaders can only interpret reality through their personal abilities to perceive and express life's dimensional depth and limitless intelligence. No one is able to articulate life's dimensional depth and breadth with the tools of language. They can only, at best, describe their interpretation or their impressions. Every human is able, in varying degrees, to peer beneath the surface reality of life and perceive and express their personal interpretations of the Universe of Wholeness. They require only the time and intention to develop their own interpretations. And this is precisely what all the great spiritual leaders have taught. Life's deeper meaning is not an absolute to be experienced by the chosen few, but an evolving, dynamic intelligence that wears as many faces as there are life forms. No life form or species has the exclusive portal into the Universe of Wholeness in which Prime Creator expresses ITSELF in all ITS majesty. The portal is shared with all because Prime Creator is within all things. The great spiritual leaders of terra-earth have all, in their own way, interpreted the Universe of Wholeness and humanity's role therein. In so doing, their interpretations, because they were articulated with authority and depth of insight, became a target of debate among various subgroups of the hierarchy. This debate and inquiry process creates a polarity of belief.

The spiritual leaders that are recognized as great prophets or saviors have produced a vision of the Universe of Wholeness beyond what was currently defined by the hierarchy. They created a new portal into the Universe of Wholeness and were willing to share their vision at the expense of debate and probable ridicule. These men and women were the gateways for humanity to explore new facets of itself. To engage a part of its oversoul or universal consciousness that was essential at that particular time in its evolutionary cycle. But the leader's interpretations too often become interpreted by the followers who desire to create a religion or sect, and the vision quietly recedes into the hands of the hierarchy where it becomes de-vitalized by the very fact that it is connected to a massive structure that both protects and promotes it. Prime Creator is connected to individuals not organizations. Thus, the hierarchy is unconnected to the Source in a vital and dynamic way. The hierarchy is more connected to its own collective desire to help, to serve, to perform a function that allows the use of power to drive toward the vision of its leaders. In itself, this is not wrong or misguided. It is all part of the Primal Blueprint that orchestrates the unfoldment of consciousness from Prime Source to entity, and entity to Collective Source. This is the spiral of integration that breeds wholeness and cascading beauty within Source Intelligence. What the hierarchy has loosely labeled as Spirit comes as close as any word to the symbol of Source Intelligence. Source Intelligence inhabits all fields of vibration as an extension of the Source. It is the emissary of Prime Creator that interweaves with the hierarchy as its counter-balance. Source Intelligence is the factor of integrity and alignment, which ensures that the hierarchy is serving its purpose within the Primal Blueprint. Source Intelligence is, in effect, the \"scientist\" who oversees the Grand Experiment and establishes the criteria, selects the variables, monitors the results, and evaluates the alternative outcomes in the laboratory of time and space. The Grand Experiment is the ongoing transformation and expansion of Source Intelligence through all entities in all dimensions of existence.

It is the purpose of the Grand Experiment to test alternative models of existence to determine, with some certainty, the model that is best able to unify consciousness without impinging on the sovereignty of the entity and Prime Creator. The Grand Experiment is composed of many distinct stages that interlink, leading to the Great Mystery. Most of these different stages are being simultaneously played out within the time-space universe in order to prepare the universe for the impending expansion of Source Reality into all dimensions of existence. In the case of terra-earth, this is the stage of existence that promotes the clear connection of individual consciousness to the compelling features of Source Reality without the intervention of a hierarchy of any kind. This is when the fables and myths of history step into the light and become known as they truly are and have been. This is the time when language will be transmuted into a new form of communication that exhibits the compelling features of Source Reality in an artistry of energy and vibration that break down all barriers of control. It is time to recognize that the hierarchy extends throughout the cosmos to the very borders of discovery. It has branches that extend from every star system, every known dimension; and virtually all life forms are \"leaves\" of this vast cosmological tree. This constitutes the grand indoctrination of species, spirits, planets, and stars as they each evolve through the branches of the tree. Thus, the hierarchy is an assemblage of externals that desire to invest their energies in support of a sub-group that has nested somewhere within the greatest of all structures--the hierarchy. Service is the operational motive of the hierarchy, and in most cases, this translates into the concept of saviorship and the teacher/student ordering of the universe. The hierarchy is composed of all entities of all motives that have linked their energies into sub-groups. These sub-groups are independent branches of the vast, cosmological tree that encompasses all things outside of Source Reality. The roots of the tree are bound in the soil of genetic memory and subconscious instincts. At the base of the tree the first branches sprout and they are the oldest, representing the native religions of the species. The middle branches are the orthodox religions and institutions, while the upper branches represent the contemporary belief systems that are newly emerging throughout the universe.

This is the experiment of transformation verses evolution. Evolution is the arduous and ongoing process of shifting positions within the hierarchy--always assessing your present position in relation to a new one that beckons you. Transformation is simply the recognition that there are accelerated pathways that bypass the hierarchy leading to sovereign mastership rather than interdependent saviorship, and that these new pathways can be accessed through direct experience of the equality tone-vibration that is present within all entities. This tone vibration is not what is more commonly referred to as the music of the spheres or the vibration of spirit moving through the universe in resonance to Source intention. It is a vibration that holds together the three principles of the transformational experience: Universe relationship through gratitude, observance of Source in all things, and the nuturance of life. The application of these life-principles in a specific equation of conduct de-couples an entity from the controlling elements of the hierarchy. How can the hierarchy act in the role of an interpretive center of truth without manipulating entities, and thus, obscuring their free will? The Grand Experiment was designed with free will as its primary method of obtaining authentic information that can be used to expand Source Reality to all dimensions of existence. Free will is the thread of authenticity that imbues value in the various tests within the Grand Experiment. The hierarchy or any other external structure never jeopardizes free will. Only the entity can choose their reality, and this is the fundamental principle of free will. Free will is not obscured simply because an entity is presented with alternative realities or relative truths that delay its realization of Source equality. It is the choice of the entity to invest itself in external accounts of reality instead of delving within its own resources and creating a reality that is sovereign. The value of free will is always expanding as you move towards sovereignty, and in like manner, is always diminishing as you move towards external dependence. The choice between sovereignty or external dependence is the basis of free will, and there is no structure or external source that can eliminate this basic choice. It is an inward choice that, regardless of outward circumstance, is incapable of being denied by anything external. The Universe of Wholeness encompasses all dimensions (including Source Reality), and therefore, all realities are contained therein.

In this incomprehensible diversity, each entity is provided a structure that defines their free will in terms of its relation Source Reality. Each of these structures varies in latitude of choice, but each is connected into the superstructure of the hierarchy. The structureless reality of Source Reality is where free will was initially conceived, and when the principle expanded into the time-space universe as the thread of authenticity, it became increasingly dependent upon the entity's recognition of its wholeness in relation to Source Intelligence. If the entity was fragmented into its component parts, its comprehension of free will was limited to that which the hierarchy circumscribed. If the entity is a conscious collective, realizing its sovereign wholeness, the principle of free will was a form of structure that was unnecessary, like a fire in a summers day. When entities are unknowing of their wholeness, structure will occur as a form of self-imposed security. Through this ongoing development of a structured and ordered universe, entities defined their borders--their limits--through the expression of their insecurity. They gradually became pieces of their wholeness, and like shards of glass from a beautiful vase they bear little resemblance to their aggregate beauty. If you were to perceive the origin of your existence, you would undoubtedly see how vast the entity is. If you could pierce through the veils that cover your destiny, you would understand how much vaster you will become. Between these two points of existence--origin and destiny--the entity is always the vibrant container of Source Intelligence. It has willingly allowed itself to explore the time-space universes as an outpost of Prime Creator. Therefore, while the hierarchy may obscure the entity's comprehension of its wholeness, it is the entity who has surrendered, by choice, to listen to the language of limitation, the proclamations of externals, and become seduced by the model of evolution/saviorship. Why has the hierarchy not provided the alternative model of transformation/ mastership and enabled the entity to make a choice, and in so doing, truly exercise its free will? It is because the hierarchy, like most entities, is not aware of its wholeness. Its fragments, or subgroups, are completely devoted to boundaries. Where there are boundaries that define and limit, there is also structure. Where there is deeply ingrained structure there is a pervasive belief that transformation is impossible.

Thus, the hierarchy is unable to even conceptualize the model of transformation/mastership with any precision, let alone inform the entity that alternatives exist which issue from Source Intelligence. The hierarchy is not responsible for this condition, each entity is. The dominant model of Source Intelligence is primal. It existed before the hierarchy. It is the entity that has chosen to explore the hierarchy's model of existence for the purpose of participating in the Grand Experiment and assisting in the emergence of the synthesis model of existence. The hierarchy is quite benign as a manipulative force, and merely represents a key ingredient to the recipe of wholeness that is transforming the entity to reach beyond its role as a vibrant container of Source Intelligence, and become the bridgeway in the expansion of Source Reality into the time-space universes. There is an ancient belief, born of the hierarchy, that the time-space universes will ascend into Source Reality and the human instrument of love will accompany this ascension process. However, it is Source Reality that is expanding to encompass the time-space universes with the purpose of aligning all entities to the synthesis model of existence. Source Intelligence is stripping away the veils that hide the true meaning of the entity model of expression in the time-space universes. When this occurs, the entity will possess Source equality in all dimensions and fields of vibration, and its componentry will be united for the full expression of its sovereign perspective. This transformation of the entity is the pathway into wholeness and the recognition that the entity model of expression is a composite of forms and the formless that is unified in one energy, one consciousness. When the fragments are aligned and inter-connected, the entity becomes the instrument that facilitates Source Reality expansion. Thus, the entity does not ascend from the time-space universes, but rather coalesces into a state of wholeness whereby its sovereign expression can assist in the expansion, or in a different context, the descent, of Source Reality into the time-space universes. Ascension is often construed as the natural outcome of evolution. That all planetary systems and species are evolving to the point where they ascend from limitation, and that eventually, the time-space universes will somehow fold into Source Reality and cease to exist as fields of vibration.

It is actually quite the opposite. Source Reality is descending. It is inclusive of all things, and it is the Source intention to expand, not retreat. The entity transforms to wholeness within the cradle of the time-space universe, and, in so doing, becomes the accessory of Source Reality's intention to expand. Can you see the perfection of this Primal Blueprint? Can you feel the shifting of the matrix from which your reality is cast? Can you not also understand that you, the human instrument, consist of a componentry that is individuated as a single point of pure energy, yet live in many places on many dimensions simultaneously? Only within the entity is the place of transformation discovered, where the formless Self can enter and commune with its various outposts of form. The formless is the Eternal Watcher who lives behind the veil of form and comprehension, and draws forth the wisdom of time from the well of planets. It is the point of origination from whence Source Intelligence flows. The Eternal Watcher is the only real interpretive center for the entity. It is the only stable guidance system that can propel the entity to its wholeness. Thus, the entity is composed of both the formless identity of Source Intelligence and the formful identity of densified energy. While the formless is one, the formful is divested in many fragments of expression that isolate its consciousness as islands of perception and expression. This condition results in the entity's denial of its vast and glorious nature of existence. In the human instrument, the entity, for the most part, is silent and unmoving. It appears like a fleeting whisper of gladness that touches you like a mountain wind. It is quiet like a deep ocean. Yet, the entity is coming forward into the time-space universe as a harbinger of Source Reality expansion. It is beginning to make itself known as it truly is. Many feel the shadow of their entity as it approaches. They consign all forms of definition to this \"shadow\", seldom believing it to be the torchbearer of their total selfhood. Here is where all the vows of faithfulness, all the ceremonies of love, and all the feelings of hope should be centered and given over to the sovereign entity that we each are.

Here is where all the vows of faithfulness, all the ceremonies of love, and all the feelings of hope should be centered and given over to the sovereign entity that we each are. The primary reason that the hierarchy's model of evolution/saviorship is so compelling is because the entity has become fragmented in how it perceives its total selfhood. The Eternal Watcher that lives through the human instrument is illusive to the time-space conditioned mind, yet it is the mind that attempts to reach out and touch this subtle vibration of Source equality that is forever kindled by Source Intelligence. However, the mind is too conditioned and disempowered to realize the total scope of the entity that exists beyond the shadows of intuition. It is for this reason that the species is exploring the evolution/saviorship model of existence. They have little or no conception of their wholeness, and require a savior and the acclimation process of evolution, to bring them security and happiness. It is a natural condition of an evolving species to have a desire, implanted by the hierarchy, to be saved and to be a savior. This condition results in the teacher/student ordering of the universe, and it is a building block of evolution and the very essence of the hierarchy's structural existence. While some species resort to the drama of survival to catalyze their evolutionary progress, other species resort to the drama of being saved and being a savior. The saviorship drama is an expression of sovereign entities that are preoccupied with the evolutionary process, and it is not confined to a religious context, but indeed applies to all facets of one's life. As there are relative truths, there are relative freedoms. If you are evolving through the hierarchical process you gain an ever-increasing sense of freedom, yet you are still controlled by the vibration of externals through languages, thought forms, frequencies of color and sound, and the seemingly indelible artifacts of the genetic mind. Each of these elements can cause the human instrument to rely upon the hierarchy as it overlays a sense of inequality between you and your Source. The underlying equation of the evolutionary process is human instrument + Hierarchy = God connection. In the case of the transformational process, it is Entity + Source Intelligence = Prime Source equality. Source Intelligence, though it generally manifests as the vibration of equality, is subject to the will of Prime Creator, and as the Source intention changes through the various stages of the Grand Experiment, Source Intelligence is also changing its form of manifestation. This change is occurring now within the worlds of time and space because Prime Creator is beginning to set the stage for the integration of the two primary models of existence (evolution/saviorship and transformation/mastership) within the Grand Experiment. The time has come to integrate the dominant model of the hierarchy (evolution/saviorship)", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:wingmakersorig__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__chambers__indexes__philo.txt:20:61c46184266c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15847, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "wingmakersorig__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__chambers__indexes__philo.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "wingmakersorig__www.wingmakers.com__arrow__chambers__indexes__philo", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "to the will of Prime Creator, and as the Source intention changes through the various stages of the Grand Experiment, Source Intelligence is also changing its form of manifestation. This change is occurring now within the worlds of time and space because Prime Creator is beginning to set the stage for the integration of the two primary models of existence (evolution/saviorship and transformation/mastership) within the Grand Experiment. The time has come to integrate the dominant model of the hierarchy (evolution/saviorship) with the dominant model of Source Intelligence (transformation/mastership). This integration can only be achieved at the level of the entity. It cannot occur within the context of a human instrument or an aspect of the hierarchy. Only the entity--the wholeness of inter-dimensional sovereignty imbued with Source Intelligence--can facilitate and fully experience the integration of these two models of existence. This form of integration occurs when the entity fully explores the two models and develops a synthesis model that positions saviorship as an internal role of the entity to \"save\" itself, and not rely upon externals to perform this liberating task. This act of self-sufficiency begins to integrate the saviorship idea with the mastership realization. The next step is to integrate the time-based incremental progress of the evolutionary model with the realization-based acceptance of the transformation model. This is done when the entity is thoroughly convinced that experience and utilization of its wholeness can only occur when it is completely detached from the various structures of the hierarchy. While the entity assumes its role of personal liberation, it does not mean that the hierarchy is to be shunned or avoided. The hierarchy is a wondrous instrument. It is symbolic of the body of Prime Creator, enabling IT to submerge within the time-space universes similar to how the human instrument allows the entity to function outside of Source Reality. The hierarchy is a vehicle of transformation even when it acts to suppress information and keep species in obedience to its controlling hand. It is part of the ancient formula that prepares a new universe for the synthesis model of existence and membership in the Universe of Wholeness. The combination of self-saviorship and detachment from the hierarchy initiates the synthesis model into manifestation. The synthesis model is the next outcome of the Grand Experiment, and in certain vibrational fields of the multidimensional universe, there are entities who are indeed experiencing this stage of the experiment as forerunners of the entity model of Source individuation. These entities are specifically designed to transmit this future experience into communication symbols and life principles that facilitate the bridging of the two models of existence.

If they were to do anything more, they would rapidly become a fixture of the hierarchy and their missions would become compromised. These Sovereign Entities are not present in the time-space universe to be formal teachers. They are present to be catalysts and designers. They are present to ensure that Source Intelligence is allowed to balance the dominant force of the hierarchy and its model of evolution/saviorship. They will not create a new belief system. Instead, they will focus on developing new communication symbols through various art forms that facilitate the entity's detachment from the controlling aspects of the hierarchy. The Sovereign Entities will also demonstrate the natural ease of interweaving the two primary strands of existence into a synthesis model. In the advancing epoch of human development, entities will collectively design new pathways beyond the synthesis model of existence so that a new hierarchy can be constructed that is fashioned from Source Intelligence information. This new hierarchy will be cast from the knowledge gained from the Grand Experiments of the time-space universes, and the cosmic cycle will regenerate itself into a new field of vibration and existence. This new model of existence resists definition, and word-symbols are completely inadequate to describe even the shadowy outlines of this new form of existence that is emerging from out of the synthesis model in your future time. The WingMakers are a small team of Sovereign Entities that have designed time capsules that are catalytic in forming a Sovereign Integral perspective. Each time capsule is, in actuality, a selection system that attracts specific entities to utilize their human instrument in wholeness. This develops their sixth and seventh sense, which enables them to learn how to step out of time and the hierarchys control. When they can do this, they can design the synthesis model of existence within terra-earths hierarchical system. These entities will be transforming time-space universes from ladders of consciousness to inclusions of Source Reality. In other words, Source Reality will be extended into time-space universes, and all life forms therein will experience this extension through a new hierarchical structure that is completely aligned with Source Intelligence. What some call \"heaven on earth\" is merely an echo-realization of this impending future time. What is truly bearing down on the time-space universes is the expansion of Source Reality through the accessibility of Source Intelligence information to all entities regardless of form or structure.

When this accessibility is complete and the Source Coding is fully activated, all entities will be part of a new cosmological structure. This new structure will invoke the next model of existence, which is already being developed within Source Reality by Source Intelligence and the Sovereign Entities. What is being activated now upon this time-space universe is the initial preparations for these shifts in the models of existence. More specifically, upon terra-earth, these models of existence will be simultaneously played out over the next epoch of time. As always, it will be the choice of the entity as to which model they embrace as reality. These various models of existence will generally occur in a pre-determined sequence, but not necessarily in a pre-determined timeframe. The sequence of Source Reality expansion is: Source Intelligence creation of new fields of vibration; the ongoing development of an entity constructed hierarchy to act as the superstructure of the new creation; the emergence from the hierarchy of a dominant model of existence, in this case, the evolution/saviorship model; the introduction of the Source Intelligence model of existence, in this case, the transformation/ mastership model; the intermixing of these two models to form a synthesis model of Source equality; and finally, Source Reality expansion to the inclusion of all dimensions and entities. When this sequencing of the Primal Blueprint is achieved, the process, with all that has been learned by Source Intelligence, will be reconfigured and a new element of the Primal Blueprint will be revealed that is unknown at this stage even by Source Intelligence. The time required to fulfill the complete cycle is undetermined, but it is reasonable to expect that its completion is yet so distant in time that to attach measurement is simply a feeble attempt at estimating the unknowable. Let there be no mistake, however, that the fulfillment of the Primal Blueprint is indeed the direction all entities are traveling. While entities of all levels are bestowed free will within their own realities, they are not, as aspects of Source Reality, given free will to choose their ultimate destiny. The origin of entities is Source Intelligence, and it is Source Intelligence that determines destiny as well as origin. Still, entities are provided tremendous latitude of choices to propel themselves from origin to destiny and re-emerge into an expanded version of Source Reality with a renewed vision of their identity.

All of the highest imaginings of the human instrument are yet unaware of the deepest foundation of the Primal Blueprint. They have sought the upper reaches of the building, and remain unaware of the foundation's design. It is here, at the very bottom of existence that Prime Creator is bursting forth with ITS energy and is retreating with ITS equality of sovereign mastership. It is here that equality is realized, not in the lofty places of relative truth lodged in the hierarchy, but in the deepest part of the foundational plan of life's origins and destiny, where time rejoins itself into timelessness. The origin and destiny of existence is the tone of equality in life. Listen for this tone--this frequency of vibration--and follow it back into the very foundation from whence all things arise and return. This frequency of the tone-vibration of equality is only heard with the seventh sense by the entity who is enveloped in a human instrument. The seventh sense can be developed by the time capsules and will lead certain entities to their innermost or core expression. The core expression is what activates the seventh sense. Thus, before one can hear the tone-vibration of equality, they must gain access tot heir core expression. There is encoded in each of the time capsules, a system of languages that can lead the individual to their core expression. It is hidden because it is so powerful. And we will only lead the worthy to this power. Consider these words as symbols only. Remember that language is a tool of limitation. Feeling is an antidote of limitation that permits the human instrument to leap over the boundaries of the logical mind and witness first hand the wordless power of collective energy individuated. Feel the truth that stands behind the symbols, and tap into this energy-force that reaches out for you. Know it as a tone-vibration--a resonance that waits for you around every corner in which your life will turn. It is the beacon of the Source Vibration gathering itself into the form of language in order to usher you to the place from which you can experience the formless tone of equality. The bypass of limitation. The Primal Language of Source Intelligence that bestows to you the freedom to generate your deepest beauty in the expression of the highest truth. **Special Note:** For a glossary of terms used by the WingMakers, [click here](http://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakersorig/WingMakersglossary).

Both sides praying for protection, yet someone always gets hurt. Someone dies. Someone cries so deep they lose their watery state. Angels must be confused by war. Who can they help? Who can they clarify? Whose mercy do they cast to the merciless? No modest scream can be heard. No stainless pain can be felt. All is clear to angels except in war. When I awoke to this truth it was from a dream I had last night. I saw two angels conversing in a field of children's spirits rising like silver smoke. The angels were fighting among themselves about which side was right and which was wrong. Who started the conflict? Suddenly, the angels stilled themselves like a stalled pendulum, and they shed their compassion to the rising smoke of souls who bore the watermark of war. They turned to me with those eyes from God's library, and all the pieces fallen were raised in unison, coupled like the breath of flames in a holy furnace. Nothing in war comes to destruction, but the illusion of separateness. I heard this spoken so clearly I could only write it down like a forged signature. I remember the compassion, mountainous, proportioned for the universe. I think a tiny fleck still sticks to me like gossamer threads from a spider's web. And now, when I think of war, I flick these threads to all the universe hoping they stick on others as they did me. Knitting angels and animals to the filamental grace of compassion. The reticulum of our skyward home. **Listening** I am listening for a sound beyond sound that stalks the nightland of my dreams, entering rooms of fossil-light so ancient they are swarmed by truth. I am listening for a sound beyond us that travels the spine's invisible ladder to the orphic library. Where rebel books revel in the unremitting light. Printed in gray, tiny words with quicksand depth embroidered with such care they render spirit a ghost, and God, a telescope turned backwards upon itself dreaming us awake. Never-blooming thoughts surround me like a regatta of crewless ships. I listen leopard-like, canting off the quarantine of bodies sickened by the monsoon of still hearts. There is certain magic in the heartbeat which crowds the sound I seek, but it is still underneath the beating I wish to go. Underneath the sound of all things huddled against the tracking dishes that turn their heads to the sound of stars.

When I look to the compass needle I see a blade of humility bent to a force waylaid like wild rain channeled in sewer pipes. Running underground in concrete canals that quiver, laughing up at us as though we were lost in the sky-world with no channel for our ride. I am listening for a sound in your voice, past the scrub terrain of your door where my ear is listening on the other side. Beneath your heart where words go awkward and light consumes the delicate construction of mingled lives. I can only listen for the sound I know is there, glittering in that unpronounceable, stateless state quarried of limbs so innocent they mend the flesh of hearts.

Take me from here to there. Let the wind blow my hair and the earth's skin touch me. Open me like broken bottles that bear no drink yet think themselves worthy of the trash man. Open me to the clans from which I sprout. Are they colors separated, cast apart like memories of drunkenness? Open me to Africa, Asia, America, Australia. Open me like a package of mystery left on your doorstep in the sweetness of laughter. Open me to the crudely made lens of love that screams to be of human hands and lips. Open me to the glance that comforts strangers like the tender overture of a mourning dove. Is the wisdom of horses mine to harness? Is the muscle of wolves lawless or the healer of sheep? Is the black opal of the eye the missing link we all seek? Open me to the authors of this beaten path and let them flavor it anew. Bring them flecks of the rumored and rotten slum that waits downstream. Show them the waste of their watch. The shallow virility that exterminates. The ignominy that exceeds examination. Open me to the idols of the idle. Let me stare open mouthed at the herdsmen who turn innocence into fear. Is the plan of the sniper to uncivilize the nerveless patch of skin that grows unyielding to pain? Open me to the stains of this land that original sin cannot explain. Let these symptoms go like dead, yellow leaves fumbling in swift, guiltless currents downstream. Downstream where the slum lies in waiting. Downstream where the idols' headstones are half-buried in muddy rain. Downstream where animal tracks are never seen. Downstream where the lens of love is cleaned with red tissue. Downstream where the herdsmen herd their flock and beat the drums promising a new river that never comes. Downstream there lives a part of me that is sealed like a paper envelope with thick tape. It watches the river like the underside of a bridge waiting to fall if the seal is broken. To plunge into the current when I am opened by some unforgiving hand unseen. To be drawn downstream in the gravity of a thousand minds who simply lost their way. A thousand minds that twisted the river away from earth's sweetness into the mine shaft of men's greed. So it must be. So it must be. Open me to the kindness of a child's delicate hand when it reaches out to be held.

I have seen its ruthless eyes that always stare, burrowing their way to the crown I wear. I have sensed the holy fire like a blazing cocoon that offers no judgments amidst its power strewn. I have felt the innocent light. Of clarity in flight over native land where we are birthed apart from one command. I have touched the gentle eye that outlasts me. The huge patience upon my brow. I have offered all my earthly wisdom for the symptoms of its tongue; to drop its seeds into the fields that I plow. I have seen destiny's path gathering its flock for the journey of endless spaces. I have watched futures fall with eyelids closed and the gnawing tears of torn places. I have seen the Tribe of Light return the clock to the black pocket where all divisions occur. Where weeds secure the humble land of fires unlit, yet pure. I have heard the masters of masters speak to every cell of my body; cutting new pathways in flesh like fear's executioner. I have watched the galaxies twirl like star wheels that spiral to the thought of a holy vision. I have felt my spirit follow the one sound that is free. I have vanished before. I have taken this body to an inner place where none can see. Only feelings can hear the sound of this space. This sacred place alone has brought me here to recover the thread. To see the weaving dance that calls my name in a thousand sounds. That draws my spirit in a single, perfectly round, circle. **Awake and Waiting** Child-like universe emerging from darkness, you belong to others not I. My home is elsewhere beyond the sky where light pollinates the fragile borders and gathers the husk. In the quiet of the desert floor my shell lingers in the pallid dusk of a starved garden. What holds me to this wasteland when others clamor for shadows and resist the vital waters? Where the ripening magnet holds us blind. Far away, kindling the presence of a timeless world hunting for memories of a radiant love; wingless creatures tune their hearts to the key of silence. It is there I am waiting. Alone. O' Paradise shore give me the heart to bear. Give me the lamp that sings at night. Give me the wings to strive against wind. Give me the smile to translate life into light.

Suddenly, it's clear that I'm alone in the wilderness without human eyes to reach in to. Alone with my treasure of sounds in the pure silence of arrival. **WingMakers** I am destined to sit on the riverbank awaiting words from the naked trees and brittle flowers that have lost their nectar. A thousand unblinking eyes stare out across the water from the other side. Their mute voices seek rewards of another kind. Their demure smiles leave me hollow. Am I a perpetual stranger to myself? (The thought brands me numb.) Am I an orphan trailing pale shadows that lead to a contemptuous mirror? Where are these gossamer wings that my destiny foretold? I am waiting for the river to deliver them to me; to lodge them on the embankment at my feet. My feet are shackles from another time. My head, a window long closed to another place. Yet, there are places that salvage the exquisite tongue and assemble her wild light like singing birds the sun. I have seen these places among the stillness of the other side. Calling like a lover's kiss to know again what I have known before; to reach into the Harvest and leave my welcome. These thoughts are folded so neatly they stare like glass eyes fondling the past. I listen for their guidance but serpentine fields are my pathway. When I look into the dark winds of the virtual heart I can hear its voice saying: \"Why are you trapped with wings?\" And I feel like a grand vision inscribed in sand awaiting an endless wind. Will these wings take me beneath the deepest camouflage? Will they unmask the secret measures and faithful dwellings of time? Will they search out the infinite spaces for the one who can define me? Wings are forgotten by all who travel with their feet. Lines have been drawn so many times that we seldom see the crossing of our loss though we feel the loss of our crossing. We sense the undertow of clouds. The gravity of sky. The painless endeavor of hope's silent prayers. But our wings shorn of flight leave us like newborn rivers that babble over rocks yearning for the depths of a silent sea. I have found myself suddenly old. Like the blackbirds that pour from the horizon line, my life has soared over this river searching for my wings. There is no other key for me to turn. There is no other legend for me to face.

**Signals to Her Heart** Out where the ocean beats its calm thunder against grainy shores of quartz and sand, she strolls, hands pocketed in a flowing gown of pearl-like luminance. I can see her with hair the color of sky's deepest night when it whispers to the sun's widow to masquerade as the sickle's light. So this is she. The only one who knows me as I am though untouched is my skin. The world from which she steps pounces from mystery, announces her calm purity like a willow tree bent to still waters. In this unhurt place she takes her body to the shoreline listening for sounds beneath the waves that tell her what to do. How great is her love? Will it take her across the sea to me? Does she hear my heart's voice before the translation? She scoops some sand with her ivory hands and like an hourglass the particles fall having borrowed time for a chance to touch her beauty. Her lips move with prayers of grace as she tells the wind her story; even the clouds gather overhead to listen. Her gestures multiply my love with the sign of infinity, disentangled from all calculations, adorning her face with a poetry of tears. I am unsummoned though I hear her voice so clear it startles me. I watch her because I can. I know her because she is me. I love her because she is not me. In all my movement, in the vast search for something that will replace me, I have found her on this shoreline, her faint footprints, signatures of perfection that embarrass time with their fleeting nature. I am like the cave behind her watching from darkness, hollowed from tortured waves into a vault that yearns to say what she cannot resist. A language so pure it releases itself from my mouth like long-held captives finally ushered to their home; jubilant gods dancing away from sorrow's reach. She turns her head and looks past me as if I were a ghost unseen, yet I know she sees my deepest light. I know the ocean is no boundary to her love. She is waiting for the final path to my heart to become clear. And I am waiting for something deep inside to take my empty hands and fill them with her face so I can know the rehearsals were numbered, and all the splinters were signals to her heart. **Nothing Matters** Space is curved so no elevator can slither to its stars.

Matter flings itself to the universe, perfectly pitiless in its betrayal of soul. You can only take away what has been given you. Have you not called the ravens the foulest of birds? Is their matter and energy so different than ours? Are we not under the same sky? Is their blood not red? Their mouth pink, too? Molten thoughts, so hot they fuse space and time, sing their prophecies of discontent. Listen to their songs in the channels of air that curl overhead like temporary tattoos of light's shimmering ways. Am I merely a witness of the betrayal? Where are you who are cast to see? How have you been hidden from me? Is there a splinter that carries you to the whole? If I could speak your names I would call you to my side and take your hands so gentle you would not see me, feeling only the warm passage of time and the tremor of your spine moving you to weep. Space is curved so I must bend. Time is a spindle so I must resolve its center. Energy, an imperishable force I must ride. And matter, so pitiless I refuse to be betrayed. So I stand naked to the coldest wind and ask it to carve out an island in my soul in honor of you who stand beside me in silence. Lonely, I live on this island assured of one thing: that of space, time, energy, and matter; nothing matters. Yet when I think of you in the cobwebbed corner, hoveled without wings like a seed planted beneath a dead tree stump, I know you are watching with new galaxies wild in your breast. I know you are listening to the lidded screams smiling their awkward trust. All I ask of you is to throw me a rope sometimes so I can feel the permanence of your heart. It's all I need in the face of nothing matters.

I've let cells collide in suicide until they take me. If there were stories left to tell I would hear them. Behind the waterfalls of channeled panic spilling their prideful progeny I can stay hidden in the noise. Being invisible has its cameo rewards. It also keeps visible the durable lifeform murmuring beneath the wickedness. This is truly the only creature I care to know, with luminous ways of sweet generosity that suffers in the untelling universe of the unlistening ear. When I am found out-after I am gone-by a stranger's heart whose drill bit is not dulled by impersonation, I will open eyes, peel away skin, awaken the heart's coma. I will set aside the costumed figure and redress the host so its image can be seen in mirrors I set forth with words bugged by God. When these words are spoken, another ear is listening on the other side beaming understanding like lasers their neutral light. The common grave of courage holds us all in the portal of singularity, the God-trail of rebeginning. Somehow, so seldom, words and images thrust their meaning into heaven and conquer time. But when they do, they become the abracadabra of the sacred moment. The pantomime of the public's deepest longing. Afterwards, the improbable eyelid glances open, the skin folds away, and the heroic eye awakens and remains alert. Afterwards, the words eat the flesh and leave behind the indigestible bitterness. The emotional corpse shed, an insoluble loneliness. The cast of separation. **Memories Unbound ** I have this memory of laying atop a scaffold of tree limbs staring out to the black, summer blanket that warms the night air. I can smell cedar burning in the distance and hear muted voices praying in song and drum. I cannot lift my body or turn my head. I am conscious of bone and muscle but they are not conscious of me. They are dreaming while I am caught in a web of exemptible time. My mind is restless to move on. To leave this starlit grave site and dance with my people around huge fires crackling with nervous light. To join hand with hand to the rhythm of drums pounding their soft thunder in monotone commandments to live. I can only stare up at the sky watching, listening, waiting for something to come and set me free from this mournful site. To gather me up in arms of mercy into the oblivion of Heaven's pod.

It imposes on the known predicament with a turbulent bliss that bleeds defiance to the order. There is certain danger in the heritable ways of my people who send me the chatoyant skin humbled and circumscribed. My white appetite leached of earthly rations. Misplaced to the darshan of the devil, the very same that maneuvered my people to reservations-- the ward of the damned. (At least I have no memories of a reservation). Perhaps it is better to lay upon this mattress of sticks with my wardrobe of feathers and skins chanting in the wind. Perhaps it would be better still to be set atop the cry shed and burned so prodigal memories would have no home to return to. I have this memory of escaping the pale hand of my master that feeds me scraps of lies and moldy bread. My skin yearns for lightness, but it is the rope that obliges. I have this memory of holding yellow fingers, large and round, dripping with ancient legacies. Of seeing the rounded belly of Buddha smiling underneath a pastoral face in temples that lean against a tempest sky. I have this memory of dreaming to fly. Stretching out wings that are newly attached with string-like permanence only to fall in the blunted arms of obscurity. I have this memory of seeing my face in a mirror that reflects a stranger's mind and soul. Knowing it to be mine, I looked away afraid it would become me alone. I am patchwork memories searching for a nucleus. I am lost words echoing in still canyons. I am a light wave that found itself darting to earth unsheathed seeking cover in human skin.

Something called out. Seek me and you shall find, but when I obey I'm confounded by memory's fleeting ways. Hands immerse and return awkwardly empty like a runaway child when no one came after them. I know there is something I seek that hides from me so I can't think about what I lack. It is, however, and this is the point, too damn powerful to be silent and still. Besides, I know I lack it because I miss it. I miss it. Whatever \"it\" is. Whatever I need it to be it is not that. It can never be anything but what it is. And so I search in drawers and closets absent of why, driven like a machine whose switch has been thrown just because it can. I miss it. I wish it could find me. Maybe I need to stay put long enough for it to do so. Now there's a switch. Let the powerful \"it\" seek me out. But for how long must I wait? And how will I recognize it should it find me? There must be names for this condition that end in phobia. Damn, I hate that suffix. It all starts with a sense of wonder and ends in a sense of emptiness. God, I wish you could find me here. I'll tuck myself in a little drawer right out in the open. I won't bury myself under incidentals. I'll be right on top. Easy to find. Do you need me for anything? I hope so because I need you for everything. **Of Beckoning Places** Of beckoning places I have never felt more lost. Nothing invites me onward. Nothing compels my mouth to speak. In cave-like ignorance, resembling oblivion, I am soulless in sleep. Where are you, beloved? Do you not think I wait for you? Do you not understand the crystal heart? Its facets like mirrors for the clouds absent of nothing blue. Invincible heaven with downcast eyes and burning bullets of victory that peel through flesh like a hungry ax, why did you follow me? I need an equal not a slayer. I need a companion not a ruler. I need love not commandments. Of things forgotten I have never been one. God seems to find me even in the tumbleweed when winds howl and I become the wishbone in the hands of good and evil. Why do they seek me out?

And I see all of this and more in myself. A small animal whose debts are soon to be settled. Children are already appearing outside waiting for the smile of parents to reassure. The signature and watermark they never see. Of winter sanctuary I have found only you. Though I wait for signals to draw me from the cold into your fire I know they will come even though I fumble for my key. Even though my heart is beheaded. Even though I have only learned division.

When the sky is absent of color beneath the globe another world comes to light. When my heart is alone somewhere another heart beats my name in code that only paradise can hear. Is my heart deaf or is there no one who can speak the language of innocence? Innocence, when words suffer meaning and gallop away in its presence. I have seen it. Felt it. I have loosened its secrets in the blushing skin when upturned eyes witness its home and never turn away. And never turn away. There is this world of slumbering hearts and hollow love, but it cannot carry me to daylight. My craving is so different and it can never be turned away. **Temptress Vision ** A temptress vision has encircled me like a willful shadow of a slumbering dream. Is it the powerful light of purpose? If I squint with all my strength I may see it. Always must it be inside of me like a pilot fish inseparable from its host. It fearlessly drinks my essence. Such a bitter taste I muse. Spit it out upon your table of perfection. Compare this grain of sand with your galaxy. This spire of sorrow with your deepest eye. If my callous mind can see you, there are no interventions. No pathway away. Convergence. I am a lock-picker. A tunnel-digger. A fence-cutter of the wicked watchers. A traveler that has sought the mystery that alludes all but the outlaws. The wild-eyed, unrelenting fools of purpose that remain outside the laboratory of wingless flight. You are the eternal Watcher who lives behind the veil of form and comprehension, drawing forth the wisdom of time from the well of planets. You cast your spell and entrain all that I am. Am I just a fragment of your world? A memory hidden by time? A finger of your hand driven by a mind unfamiliar with skin. Touch yourself and you sense me. Visions wild with love. Splendor that beckons like a secret whisper of gladness spread on the winds by an infinite voice. The sound of all things unified. I am part of that voice. Part of that sound. Part of that secret whisper of gladness. This limitation must end in lucid flesh. The dream of sparks ascending quickening the cast of hope. Avoid the brand of passivity the signs complain. Shun manipulation before you are stained. Spurn all formula and write new equations in the language of sand.

Doors that collapse at a mere breath and behind which lay more pieces to collect for the Holy Menagerie. The never-ending puzzle. All the stars in the sky recall the purpose of your hallowed light. Burn a hole through the layers. Peel all the mockery away. Enjoin the powers to answer this call: Bring the luminous vision hidden behind the whirling particles of the Mapmaker. Let it enter me like a shaft of light that enters a cave's deepest measure. Ancient fires still burn in these depths. Who tends them? What eyes are watching? Waiting. Waiting for time's flower to bloom. To submerge in the relentless subtlety that moves beyond my reach with a jaguar's stealth. To dream of elder ways that leap over time and leave behind the puzzle of our making. O' temptress vision you steal my hunger for human light. If there is anything left to hollow let it be me. If there is anything left to cage let it run free. If there is anything left to dream let it be our union.

You have kept so much at bay I wonder if your enchantment is to tame passion. Cornered by your savage artillery you sling your bullets like schools of fish darting to a feast, and I surge ahead tired of being the food. When I look back I can see fragments of you hiding in the underbrush, stubborn remnants of your vanished heart. I can still love them. I can still hold their fragile nerves clustered with a welder's tongue seething light as pure as any ever beheld. Perhaps I drift away because of the chasm I see. Bullets and light. How strange bedfellows can be. But you will never confess nor shed your doubt of me. I will always remain an enigma hurling itself like litter across your absolute path. A sudden shaft of light that begets a deep shadow that temporarily blinds. Hope-stirred eyes have always sought to steal you from the simian nature that collects at your feet and pulls at you like derelict children. My unearthly hunger drew me away from you, even against my will, or at least my conscious will. There was always something calculating the distance between us. Some cosmic abacus shuffling sums of bullets and light looking for the ledger's balance, but never quite locating its exact frequency. **The Nature of Angels** Midnight in the desert and all is well. I told myself so and so it is, or it is not, I haven't quite decided yet. Never mind the coyotes' howl or the shrinking light. Holiness claims my tired eyes as I return the stare of stars. They seem restless, but maybe they're just ink blots and I'm the one who's really restless. There is something here that repeals me. In its own abundance I am absent. So I shouted at the desert spirits, tell me your secrets or I will tell you my sorrows. The spirits lined up quickly then. Wings fluttering. Hearts astir. I heard many voices become one and it spoke to the leafless sky as a tenet to earth. We hold no secrets. We are simply windows to your future. Which is now and which is then is the question we answer. But you ask the question. If there is a secret we hold it is nothing emboldened by words or we would commonly speak. I turned to the voice, what wisdom is there in that? If words can't express your secret wisdom, then I am deaf and you are mute and we are blind. At least I can speak my sorrows.

Again the wings fluttered and the voices stirred hoping the sorrow would not spill like blood upon the desert. But there were no more sounds save the coyote and the owl. And then a strange resolution suffused my sight. I felt a presence like an enormous angel carved of stone was placed behind me. I couldn't turn for fear its loss would spill my sorrow. But the swelling presence was too powerful to ignore so I turned around to confront it, and there stood a trickster coyote looking at me with glass eyes painting my fire, sniffing my fear, and drawing my sorrow away in intimacy. And I understood the nature of angels.

How can souls be eclipsed by such tiny minds? Do we love the damp passageways of Hell? Where every drop of pale water that falls from the cavern walls is unwashed music etched in silence... My favored dreams have disappeared astride the backs of eagles. With wings sweeping downward, lifting upward, they are carried away like finespun, elegant seeds on a crystalline wind. Without them I am divinely barren like an empty vessel denied its purpose. I can only stare into the silence ever listening for heaven's murmur. Knowing that behind the darkening mist angels are building shelters for human innocence. Shelters torn from something dark and gravely wounded. Havens resistant to all disease. I thought I was endowed with a promised beauty that would free the neglected dreams of a demigod. That would untie their feeble knots and release them into light's caress. But the glorious reins that had once been mine, tattered and stained with blood, have slipped from my hands in disuse as a web abandoned to a ghostly wind. I can still reach them. I can feel their shadow across my hands. Their power, like an electric storm wandering aimlessly without fuel, soon to be exhausted. This piece of paper is torn from something dark and gravely wounded. It is the mirror I hold up to the blackened sky. A devious sacrifice. Leaping from star to star my eyes weave a constellation. My thoughts in search of the endless motherload. My heart listening for the sound of unstained children dreaming. The dream wanderer looks back at me. Calls my name in a whispered voice. Beckons me with an outstretched wing. \"Fly! Your favored dreams await you!\" The voice boomed like thunder swearing. My wings trembled with forbidden power as they searched the wind's current for signs of release. Currents that would carry me to the high branches of trees suckling the sun in fields beyond my kingdom. In a moment's interlude I unfolded my wings and vaulted skyward, into the blue vestibule. Sheer speed. Rivers beneath were brown veins swollen on earth's legs, or savage cuts that bled green. The sun sliced holes in the clouds with tender spears of crimson light. The moon was rising in the eastern sky- an oyster shell pitted by time. Lonely winds would rush by searching for an outpost of stillness. The earthen dungeon peered up at me with contempt like a nursemaid relieved of her duty. I forgot the ground. I canceled gravity.

I thought only of the dream wanderer... the holy wind that rekindles my exquisite longing for raw truth. To seize it like medicine in a sleepless fever hoping to be healed. The halcyon spire! The dusty places of purity. These wings are torn from something dark and gravely wounded. They carry me to my favored dreams and choke the inertia of indifference dead. Their strength is perfectly matched to my destination. One more mile beyond these trees, I would fall like a fumbled star into the moat of a starving world. My favored dreams will wander again. In time they will soar to trees of a richer kingdom. My wings will again follow their flight, track their heartbeat and build a quilt of a thousand dreams intermingled. One more turn of the infinite circle. The dream slate revivified. Navigable- even in the murky waters and cloudy skies of the itinerant traveler. The dream wanderer reveals (with a flip of the hourglass of heaven), as above so below. Create your world and let it go forward entrusted to the one that is all. The leavening will prevail. It is the lesson I learned with my wings outstretched beneath the glaring sky. It is the rawness I seek untouched by another's polish. **Forgiver** Last night we talked for hours. You cried in unstoppable sorrow, while I felt a presence carve itself into me source and savior of your dragging earth. You feel so deeply, your mind barely visible staring ahead to what the heart already knows. I see the distance you must heal. I know your pacing heart bounded by corners that have been rounded and smoothed like a polished stone from endless waves. For all I know you are me in another body, slots where spirits reach in to throw the light interpreting dreams. Prowling for crowns. Are there ways to find your heart I haven't found? You, I will swallow without tasting first. I don't care the color. Nothing could warn me away. Nothing could diminish my love. And only if I utterly failed in kinship would you banish me. Last night, I know I was forgiven. You gave me that gift unknowing. I asked for forgiveness and you said it was unneeded; time shuffled everything anew and it was its own forgiver.

Curled so casual in sheets inlaid by your beauty. I held my hand to your face and touched as gently as I know how so you could linger with your dreams. I heard soft murmurs that only angels make when they listen to their home. So I drew my hand away uneasy that I might wake you even as gentle as I was. But you stayed with your dreams and I watched as they found their way to you in the kindness of sleep. And I dreamed that I was an echo of your body curled beside you like a fortune hunter who finally found his gold. I nearly wept at the sound of your breath, but I stayed quiet as a winter lake, and bit my lip to ensure I wouldn't be detected. I didn't want to intrude so I set my dream aside and I gently pulled your hand from underneath the covers to hold. A hand whose entry into flesh must have been the lure that brought me here. And as I hold it I remember why I came to feel your pulse and the beating of your heart in deep slumber. And I remember why I came in the kindness of sleep... to hold your hand, touch your face and listen to the soft breathing of an angel, curled so casual in sheets inlaid by your beauty. **Warm Presence** I once wore an amulet that guarded against the forceps of humanity. It kept at bay the phalanx of wolves that circled me like phantoms of Gethsemane. Phantoms that even now replay their mantra like conch shells. Coaxing me to step out and join the earthly tribe. To bare my sorrow's spaciousness like a cottonwood's seed to the wind. Now I listen and watch for signals. To emerge a recluse squinting in ambivalence inscribed to tell what has been held by locks. It is all devised in the sheath of cable that connects us to Culture. The single, black strand that portrays us to God. The DNA that commands our image and guides our natural selection of jeans. Are there whispers of songs flickering in dark, ominous thunder? Is there truly a sun behind this wall of monotone clouds that beats a billion hammers of light? There are small, flat teeth that weep venom. There is an inviolate clemency in the eyes of executioners while their hands toil to kill. But there is no explanation for voyeur saints who grieve only with their eyes. There is only one path to follow when you connect your hand and eye and release the phantoms.

This poem is a shadow of my heart and my heart the shadow of my mind, which is the shadow of my soul the shadow of God. God, a shadow of some unknown, unimaginable cluster of intelligence where galaxies are cellular in the universal body. Are the shadows connected? Can this vast, unknown cluster reach into this poem and assemble words that couple at a holy junction? It is the reason I write. Though I cannot say this junction has ever been found (at least by me). It is more apparent that some unholy hand, pale from darkness, reaches out and casts its sorrow. Some lesser shadow or phantom positions my hand in a lonely outpost to claim some misplaced illuminance. The phantom strains to listen for songs as they whisper. It coordinates with searching eyes. It peels skin away to touch the soft fruit. It welds shadows as one. I dreamed that I found a ransom note written in God's own hand. Written so small I could barely read its message, which said: \"I have your soul, and unless you deliver--in small, unmarked poems--the sum of your sorrows, you will never see it alive again.\" And so I write while something unknown is curling around me, irresistible to my hand, yet unseen. More phantoms from Gethsemane who honor sorrow like professional confessors lost in their despair. I can reach sunflowers the size of moonbeams, but I cannot reach the sum of my sorrows. They elude me like ignescent stars that fall nightly outside my window. My soul must be nervous. The ransom is too much to pay even for a poet who explores the black strand of Culture. Years ago I found an impression--like snow angels--left in tall grass by some animal, perhaps a deer or bear. When I touched it I felt the warm presence of life, not the cold radiation of crop circles. This warm energy lingers only for a moment but when it is touched it lasts forever. And this is my fear: that the sum of my sorrows will last forever when it is touched, and even though my soul is returned unharmed, I will remember the cold radiation and not the warm presence of life. Now I weep when children sing and burrow their warm presence into my heart. Now I feel God adjourned by the source of shadows.

Now I feel the pull of a bridle, breaking me like a wild horse turned suddenly submissive. I cannot fight the phantoms or control them or turn them away. They prod at me as if a lava stream should continue on into the cold night air and never tire of movement. Never cease its search for the perfect place to be a sculpture. An anonymous feature of the gray landscape. If ever I find the sum of my sorrows I hope it is at the bridgetower where I can see both ways before I cross over. Where I can see forgeries like a crisp mirage and throw off my bridle. I will need to be wild when I face it. I will need to look into its unnameable light and unravel all the shadows interlocked like paper dolls and cut from a multiverse of experience. To let them surround me and in one resounding chorus confer their epiphany so I can hand over the ransom and reclaim my soul. When all my sorrows are gathered round in an unbroken ring I will stare them down. Behind them waits a second ring, larger still and far more powerful. It is the ring of life's warm presence when sorrows have passed underneath the shadows' source and transform like the dull chrysalis that bears iridescent angels.

So often there were poems, paintings, music that flowed in one stream that held messages that only I could hear. But I would take them and fold them into something I hoped others would also hear. So often the folded thing would resonate in solitude yet escape the touch of another. So often I would look to you and hope that you would see and hear what I have seen and heard. But the message would waver and disappear like smoke ascending into air. So often I have wondered why there is no one to share these folded things; as if only I could understand their solitude. As if only I could feel their heartbeat beneath the emptiness in which they sleep. If all of these are summed and divided by love you would know them as your own children. You would see them as they are. Yet they are mysteries viewed as mere elements of time. So often I have taken these folded things and left them behind for others to unfold and wear. And when I look back at their clothing they appear like stars against the persistent blackness. Like comets dancing to the forbidden music of another world. Calling so softly... when it is heard, the folded things unfold their beauty and nothing is forbidden again. **Spiral** Inside there is something gnawing with silken jaws and wax teeth. It holds me still in pureness like a circle whose middle is my cage. While you went away from me I was ever tightening my circle. A spiral cut in glass. A flower's bloom dropping petals. A winnowed ball of yarn spilling color. I see the inside of your thigh brilliant in its smoothness, and I spiral ever closer to your edge. Paper cut touching I burn bleeding without pain. How could I spill so easily without knowing why? When I hear your voice there is no quenching this ache to hold you. Like one who draws near and then forgets the story they came to tell, I circle you waiting for thread's tautness to draw us ever closer though I know not how. The final luxury is the kiss of your boundless heart. The final beauty so pure all else limps behind blissfully in your wake. Drawing from your shadows the light of saplings lurking on the forest floor. If I could unbutton you, take your dress down I would see a map of my universe.

Sending olive branches with thorns was only one of your repertoire. You offered me a book where all the answers lay encoded in some strange dialect. Symbols undulating like serpents restless for food. If I was windborne as a lambent seed you would still the air and I would fall into the thicket. If I yearned for sweet water you would pass me the bitter cup. If I was an injured fawn you would flush me from the cloister, corner me against cold stone, and admire my fear. Everywhere I steer I seek the one look of love; yet love humbles itself like a mannequin changing its clothes to accommodate the dressmaker. Underneath there are bandages of the beast. Underneath there is the tourniquet of deliverance. But beneath the shell there is emptiness, so defiant it is clothed in finery that neither dressmaker nor beast can touch. You have mistaken my search as my soul. Raking through it for clumps of wisdom, you have found only what I have lost to you. Held like rootless dreams I will vanish in your touch. If you pass your rake over this emptiness you will feel clumps of my spirit. You will find me like tiny pieces of mirror broken apart yet still collected in one spot. Still staring ever skyward. Still reflecting one mosaic image. Still the accompanist of myself. **Half Mine** When I see your face I know you are half mine separated by the utmost care to remember all of you. When I undress my body I see that I am half yours blurred by sudden flight that leaves the eye wondering what angels carved in their hearts to remind them so vividly of their home. When I see your beauty I know you are half mine never to be held in a polished mirror knowing the faithful hunger of our soul. When I watch your eyes I know they are half mine tracing a trajectory where sensual virtue is the very spine of us. When I hold your hand I know it is half mine wintered in kinship, it circles tenderness beneath the moon and well of water when the feast is done. When I kiss your lips I know they are half mine sent by God's genealogy to uncover us in the delicious cauldron of our united breath. When I hear you cry I know your loneliness is half mine so deep the interior that we are lost outside yearning to give ourselves away like a promise made before the asking.

At least, to me, it seemed dead. I felt like a liberator of life force renewing the blistered and dying grasses. Actually, more weeds than grass, but nonetheless, the flora had flat-lined. I peeled back skin with holy flame and brought everything to black again as though I called the night to descend. From blackness will arise a new skin cresting green architecture from a fertile void. As the flames spread their inviolable enchantment I saw your face spreading across my mind. Remember the fire we held? I hoped it would unfurl a new skin for us as well. I still hold this hope. Forever it will roam inside me invariant to all transformations and motions. One person may hide another, but behind you, love is molting a thicker skin than I can see through. No flame can touch its center. No eyes can browse its memory. I want nothing behind you in wait. Seconds tick away like children growing in between photographs. I will not forget you in the changes. Cursed with memory so fine I can trace your palm. I can inhale your sweet breath. I can linger in your arms' weight. I can hear your exquisite voice calibrate life with celestial precision. One purpose may hide another. I heard this as the fire died out to reveal the scent of the wet earth and growing things. I could feel my love decompose returning to the uninhabited realm where it belongs. Where all hearts belong when love is lost, and the code of the mute, coiled in fists that pound, reveal the wisdom of another. **Life Carriers** Life carriers spawn in the primal waters of a giant embryo. Their progeny will settle in human dust. Pieces of clay with tiny thoughts of flight. Knife-points veiled in turbid cloaks that shun the light of a tranquil star. In the remote wilds the life carriers emerge and perch upon the shoulders of gray stones. They signal their desires to fly, but their homes are suited for the comforts of rain and earth. The sky must wait. (The dirt companion smiles.) Circles break. Barriers overrun. Life carriers deny their ancient pull from the ground. Wings sprout like golden hair sinuous with nature's artifice. Ragged feet are left behind. The earth replaced with vivid sky. Gravity shines its menacing stare to hold them with assertive hands. Homeless cages are left to rot. To sink behind the groundless sky. Earthen faces have dropped their smiles and lost their smell of fresh dirt. The dream of flight has invaded somber walls-- life carriers have bounded to the other side.

My eyes, closed like shutters with slats that remain open, wait to invent dreams of some charred reality. I sense you, but no weight on my bed. No shift or creaking other than my own restlessness. Wandering words self-gathered, self-formed, and released to the night like a mantra slowly drowned in music. Your presence grew with the music devouring it in silence. You came to me so clear my senses aroused in electric storms of clarity. The buzz of mercury lamps alongside rutted roads, shedding their weightless light. In all of this waiting for you no fortress or foxhole bears my name. I lay on the Savannah staring at the sun hoping against hope it blinks before I do. My wounded cells, tiny temples of our mixture, have weakened in your absence. I can feel them wail in their miniature worlds. My feet resist their numbness, deny them their war. As I lay here alone waiting to be gathered into your arms, I ask of you one thing, remember me as this. Remember me as one who loves you beyond yourself. Who pierces shells, armor, masks, and everything protecting your spirit in needless fervor. Remember me as this. As one who loves you unmatched by the deepest channels that have ever been forged. Who will love you anywhere and always. And if you look very closely at my love you will not find an expiration date, but instead, the word, imperishable. **Of This Place** Her heart ran in the wilds of deserted plains. Sun-etched land barren of clouds and singing water. If she listened closely her hand would call and signal its thoughts upon her brow. But in this place she could only offer her arms to the sky like a tree its branches and a flower its leaves. In this dusty basin, silence gathered like smoke clearing the mind of the scoundrel. The infidel of thoughts. Blots of yellow leaves and white bark could be seen hiding in pools of life surrounded by red rock spires. Clustered sand monuments held together by some other life form. She wasn't sure. Perhaps one life is the same as another only tilted sideways. Caught from underneath by some invisible hand that animates even the coldest stone of this place. A smile emerged and perched upon her face drinking the sun's clear ways. She could spear a million miles of air in a glance and send the window of her flesh into the cloudless sky. Upon this ocean a hawk sailed ever closer. She watched the silver speck spiral overhead dreaming through its eyes. Feeling the winds gild her wings in the softest fold of time.

A tree of pine sent its sky roots deep within the air to weep its sweetness. She entered, gliding through branches to every needle in their factory of air. So strange to feel the pull of earth in flight, but she knew the antagonism well in the splendor of this place. She knew it had settled deep, lodged like permanent ink in the heart of her. Under skin, muscle, bone it fought the single path. What madness calls her away? What dream is stronger than this? What heart beats more pure? Of this place, it is so hard to know which is host and which is guest. Which is welcome, which is pest. Which is found and which is lost. Which is profit, which is cost. She gave her prayers to the skypeople and waited for a cloud-- her signal to leave. She should return home before dusk settles in and the golden eyes peer out against the black code. In a single breath she held the ancient ways that never left. She turned them inside out and then outside in. Again and again. Waiting for her signals in the sky. If not a cloud... then perhaps a shooting star. (Besides, it was too dark for clouds anymore.) When the first star fell she held her breath afraid she would miss its spectral flight. She wondered with whom she shared its final light. What other eyes were heaven bound in that secret moment? Was this their signal home as well? And what was it they found buried so deep in a whisper of light that none can tell? She waited with solemn eyes for more stars to fall, to gently sweep her away from the magnets of this place. If she listened to her hand it would scratch a sign in the sand for another to take her place. It would touch the land in honor of its grace and wisdom, and become a tree, rock, hawk, or flower.

In this moment all that exists is here. But you are not. There are so many footprints leading to my door. Let us enter, they say. We cannot sleep in the desert it is too cold. Our tears will dry too fast. Our ears will hurt from the silence. Let us in. And so I gather them all up, swing wide my door, and step aside as they enter hoping they will lay in peace beside my fire. You were not among them. I looked everywhere for your face and saw only mimicry. The blind eye buried behind brain searching for your heart. An antenna so alert there is a peculiar nearness of you flying inside my body. I can hold this like a tiny bird in my hands; fragile, vulnerable, waiting for my move to decide its fate. You are not here. I wish I could reach your skin, remove the camouflage tearing it away like black paper held before the sun as a shield. Unbundle you from your other lives and distill you in my now. You are my last love, my final embrace of this world and all the others that drop their prints at my door are dimmed by your approaching steps. I can see you will be here soon. There is victory in my heart and something invisible yet massive wants to speak. Reminding me of you and your coming. Quick, I plead, give me your lips. Give me your womanly tenderness that understands everything so I may lose myself in you and forget my loss. If you were here, I would tell you this secret. But you would need to be staring up at the stars when I told you, held within my arms feeling the earth rise up beneath you like a holy bed. You would need our union to be your ears. **Like the Songs of Whales** Your voice lingers when it speaks like rippling heat over desert floor. It draws my heart and I find myself leaning toward its source as though I know it will take me where you always are. It draws me near to your breath-the spiracle that holds the words of home. It draws me to the blanket you hold around your soul you so willingly share. If you were to dive below the waters where the whales sing their songs into the gathering of deep currents that pull our courage along, channels that flow free of worldly levels, you would find me there. Listening to the voice I hear in you. Feeding my heart in the waters of deep blindness where currents flow mindful of you and your spirited ways.

Sometimes I would look inside the smoke but it curled away and covered itself with a cloak so opaque I could only cry. It became the mask of its consumption. The dream of its new life. The victorious skin always changing yet everlasting. There was a fire last night that proclaimed news of a newer testament that drinks tears, lies, vile words, even the deep fears that linger underneath the turncoat. I usually lurch away when it calls. To me, it burns too cold like a skinwalker lost in a body devoured by time. Sometimes I would dream it alive and it would blaze--a vibrant sun-- more durable than a grave. In times of stillness it would speak like a codicil of some lidless dream that words could not preserve. \"The time has come to lift your gaze from the fire's brightness and cast shadows of your own.\" The words would echo into oblivion like stars lost in the swell of the sun's awakening. In these flames I see my consumption fit and proper. In its smoke I am stored away like so many jars in a broom closet. Waiting to flee. Drawing my feet to oppose the floor. Struggling to reach the door inside these jars of sealed air. Stories escape the writer's hand and pursue me as though I alone held their vigil. Their very soul. When indeed these stories have never been told. They have never found words to hold though they ceaselessly try. Fires blind nature. They invest their life in her death. But the end is always beginning toward another end. And the dreams of the untold are always pursuing another mouth, another hand, another mind open. Sometimes I look to the errant expression of hope, and ask it to bring its flames deeper into my heart. To burn a clear sense of purpose. To burn away the fool's crevice and enshroud me in its skin of smoke. Sometimes I offer myself to these flames and know they listen. Devising my world. Reality coalesces around their finery like a tower of glass enclothes a shell of steel. Sometimes I feel the flames send me words, notes, tones. Enchantment. Products of another kind. Tiny crucibles of earth that burn so brightly they can blind the sun's creatures of whimsy. And sometimes, without even thinking, I peek into these flames when the smoke peels away for an instant. There, behind the mask, is my future. Our future. The future. The present in another world.

I ache and long to have you with me so close our skin would melt together like two candle wicks sharing wax. I only know that what is of soul is of longing and ache. It delivers me to the edge, the precipice where I look down and see myself inextinguishable, longing to be consumed by you. And in that glittering place let me stretch with your heart at full speed, blind and intent. Let me dwell in you until I am so familiar with our union that it becomes part of my eyes. With memory full, we can imagine home, in the permanence of longing. So much a part of the other that the \"other\" does not exist.

Ordering my world like architecture of feelings bound to you, held for you as shields of hope. In the dispersion of love, identical throbbing has been our call answered in the sweetest caress two can share. And you wonder if ecstasy will diminish us like rain the sun or wind the calm. When we know one another in the deepest channel of our hearts we can only utter one word cast from this stone's mind: forever. Forever. When winter calls my name in the highest desert of light, I will not despair because I know you in the deepest channel of my heart where I understand the word, forever. Instantly healed by your caressing lips that unmasks all that has tortured me. The panting of mouths tired but astir in passion's flame can only cease when I have entered you forever. I carry you in this flame, emerald-colored from my dreams of you beneath the trees within where your beauty consumed the sun and snared my soul so completely. I cannot truly know you apart from a throne. Spirits made to shine beyond the din of boorish poets that strike flint below water and cry without passion. I have known you forever in lonely streets and the thundered plain. In wilted villages and cool mountain terraces. I have watched all of you torn open to me speaking like a river that moves on forever. And I have waited like the greedy mouth of an ocean drawing you nearer to my lips so I can know you forever as you empty into me abandoned of all fear.< **Of Luminous Things** Of luminous things I have so little experience that I often think myself small. Yet when I think of you and your luminous ways my being swells with hope and prayers that you will permit the flames to grow. In mercy, we are torn apart into separate worlds to find ourselves over and over a thousand times aching for the other half. To dream of nothing but the One between us. Of luminous things I have squandered none nor have I held them to my heart and asked them to dissolve into me. Yet when I think of you, I desire only this. And if you disrobed your Self and watched it watch you, you would see me as clearly as I am. Not small and unworthy. Unafraid of fear. Not uncertain like empty space. But luminous like white light before the prism. In my thoughts I hold your heart sculpting away the needless for the essence.

We were made for these times. I have heard from so many recently who are deeply and properly bewildered. They are concerned about the state of affairs in our world now. Ours is a time of almost daily astonishment and often righteous rage over the latest degradations of what matters most to civilized, visionary people. ** You are right in your assessments. The lustre and hubris some have aspired to while endorsing acts so heinous against children, elders, everyday people, the poor, the unguarded, the helpless, is breathtaking. Yet, I urge you, ask you, gentle you, to please not spend your spirit dry by bewailing these difficult times. Especially do not lose hope. Most particularly because, the fact is that we were made for these times. Yes. For years, we have been learning, practicing, been in training for and just waiting to meet on this exact plain of engagement. I grew up on the Great Lakes and recognize a seaworthy vessel when I see one. Regarding awakened souls, there have never been more able vessels in the waters than there are right now across the world. And they are fully provisioned and able to signal one another as never before in the history of humankind. Look out over the prow; there are millions of boats of righteous souls on the waters with you. Even though your veneers may shiver from every wave in this stormy roil, I assure you that the long timbers composing your prow and rudder come from a greater forest. That long-grained lumber is known to withstand storms, to hold together, to hold its own, and to advance, regardless. In any dark time, there is a tendency to veer toward fainting over how much is wrong or unmended in the world. Do not focus on that. There is a tendency, too, to fall into being weakened by dwelling on what is outside your reach, by what cannot yet be. Do not focus there. That is spending the wind without raising the sails. We are needed, that is all we can know. And though we meet resistance, we more so will meet great souls who will hail us, love us and guide us, and we will know them when they appear. Didn't you say you were a believer? Didn't you say you pledged to listen to a voice greater? Didn't you ask for grace? Don't you remember that to be in grace means to submit to the voice greater? **Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach.

Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good. ** **What is needed for dramatic change is an accumulation of acts, adding, adding to, adding more, continuing. We know that it does not take everyone on Earth to bring justice and peace, but only a small, determined group who will not give up during the first, second, or hundredth gale. ** **One of the most calming and powerful actions you can do to intervene in a stormy world is to stand up and show your soul. Soul on deck shines like gold in dark times. The light of the soul throws sparks, can send up flares, builds signal fires, causes proper matters to catch fire. To display the lantern of soul in shadowy times like these - to be fierce and to show mercy toward others; both are acts of immense bravery and greatest necessity. ** Struggling souls catch light from other souls who are fully lit and willing to show it. If you would help to calm the tumult, this is one of the strongest things you can do. There will always be times when you feel discouraged. I too have felt despair many times in my life, but I do not keep a chair for it. I will not entertain it. It is not allowed to eat from my plate. The reason is this: In my uttermost bones I know something, as do you. It is that there can be no despair when you remember why you came to Earth, who you serve, and who sent you here. The good words we say and the good deeds we do are not ours. They are the words and deeds of the One who brought us here. In that spirit, I hope you will write this on your wall: When a great ship is in harbor and moored, it is safe, there can be no doubt. But that is not what great ships are built for.

The development of the [F-117 Stealth Bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-117_Nighthawk), for example, was kept secret for years before it's existence was finally revealed. The question is: How far advanced are these programs? In my research into this topic, I've learned about above top secret programs which for many years have been researching what many would consider science fiction, including invisibility cloaking, extracting energy from the quantum vacuum, and warp drive, i.e. faster than light travel, including using wormholes to travel to other planets and even other dimensions. Amazingly, there is now strong, verifiable evidence to show active scientific research in all of these areas. **Ample evidence suggests that these projects are far more advanced than most would imagine.** One group in particular has shined a powerful light into these shadowy programs. The [Federation of American Scientists](https://fas.org/) [FAS] is a nonprofit organization founded in 1945 by scientists who built the first atomic bombs during the Manhattan Project. As [stated on their website](https://fas.org/about-fas/), \"[FAS] provides science-based analysis of and solutions to protect against catastrophic threats to national and international security. Specifically, FAS works to reduce the spread and number of nuclear weapons, prevent nuclear and radiological terrorism, [and] illuminate government secrecy practices.\" Through this respected organization, the scientists who brought us into the nuclear age have done their best to keep us from destroying ourselves with their discoveries. [Steven Aftergood](https://fas.org/expert/steven-aftergood/), director of the Government Secrecy Project at FAS, has long been working to pull back unhealthy veils of secrecy through many hundreds of FOIA (Freedom Of Information Act) requests. **His invaluable work has revealed how claims of \"national security\" at times are used to drape a cloak of secrecy around activities which actually endanger citizens not only of the US, but of the world.** What has been revealed through the documents he has obtained is breathtaking. On August 15, 2018, Aftergood [submitted an FOIA request](https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2019/01/aatip-list/) to the Defense Intelligence Agency [DIA] \"for information concerning a copy of [the list](https://fas.org/irp/dia/aatip-list.pdf) that was recently transmitted to Congress of all DIA products produced under the Advanced Aerospace Threat and Identification Program contract.\" [The list](https://www.wanttoknow.info/z/aatip-list-fas-aftergood.pdf) mentioned was sent to many key members of Congress, but received no press coverage. The response he received, dated Jan. 16, 2019, is mind boggling. The DIA released a list of titles for scientific papers on 38 government projects of a highly advanced nature. You can find the list on [this webpage](https://www.wanttoknow.info/z/aatip-list-fas-aftergood.pdf).

A separate paper by Davis titled \"Teleportation Physics Study\" is available on [this page](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a425545.pdf) of a U.S. [Department of Defense website](https://discover.dtic.mil/). **The paper on wormholes and stargates is particularly fascinating, as it describes a feasible method for traversing interstellar distances using our current understanding of quantum processes.** Using the procedures described, he states, \"explorers could spend all day investigating the remote spacetime location and then return home through the stargate in time to have dinner with their families.\" Why is all of this not being reported in the mainstream media? **Why has this astounding list of hyperdimensional science studies been given to members of Congress, but not made widely available to the public?** Why did it take Steven Aftergood's FOIA request to get this information released at all? Could it be that powerful people and organizations don't want us to know how far they have gone towards interstellar travel and much more?

The poll of New York residents was conducted from Tuesday August 24 through Thursday August 26, 2004. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of +/-3.5. The poll is the first of its kind conducted in America that surveys attitudes regarding US government complicity in the 9/11 tragedy. Despite the acute legal and political implications of this accusation, nearly 30% of registered Republicans and over 38% of those who described themselves as \"very conservative\" supported the claim. The charge found very high support among adults under 30 (62.8%), African-Americans (62.5%), Hispanics (60.1%), Asians (59.4%), and \"Born Again\" Evangelical Christians (47.9%). Less than two in five (36%) believe that the 9/11 Commission had \"answered all the important questions about what actually happened on September 11th,\" and two in three (66%) New Yorkers (and 56.2% overall) called for another full investigation of the \"still unanswered questions\" by Congress or Elliot Spitzer, New York's Attorney General. Self-identified \"very liberal\" New Yorkers supported a new inquiry by a margin of three to one, but so did half (53%) of \"very conservative\" citizens across the state. The call for a deeper probe was especially strong from Hispanics (75.6%), African-Americans (75.3%) citizens with income from $15-25K (74.3%), women (62%) and Evangelicals (59.9%). W.

David Kubiak, executive director of 911truth.org, the group that commissioned the poll, expressed genuine surprise that New Yorkers' belief in the administration's complicity is as high or higher than that seen overseas. \"We're familiar with high levels of 9/11 skepticism abroad where there has been open debate of the evidence for US government complicity. On May 26th the Toronto Star reported a national poll showing that 63% of Canadians are also convinced US leaders had 'prior knowledge' of the attacks yet declined to act. There was no US coverage of this startling poll or the facts supporting the Canadians' conclusions, and there has been virtually no debate on the victim families' scores of still unanswered questions. I think these numbers show that most New Yorkers are now fed up with the silence, and that politicians trying to exploit 9/11 do so at their peril. The 9/11 case is not closed and New York's questions are not going away.\" Nicholas Levis of NY911truth.org, an advisor on the poll, agrees, \"The 9/11 Commission gave us a plenty of 'recommendations', but far more plentiful were the discrepancies, gaps and omissions in their supposedly 'final' report. How can proposals based on such deficient findings ever make us safe? We think these poll numbers are basically saying, 'Wait just a minute. What about the scores of still outstanding questions? What about the unexplained collapses of WTC 7, our air defenses, official accountability, the chain of command on 9/11, the anthrax, insider trading & FBI field probes? There's so much more to this story that we need to know about.' When such a huge majority of New Yorkers want a new investigation, it will be interesting to see how quickly Attorney General Spitzer and our legislators respond.\" SCOPE: The poll covered five areas of related interest: 1) Iraq - do New Yorkers think that our leaders \"deliberately misled\" us before the war (51.2% do); 2) the 9/11 Commission - did it answer all the \"important questions\" (only 36% said yes); 3) the inexplicable and largely unreported collapse of the third WTC skyscraper on 9/11 - what was its number (28% of NYC area residents knew); 4) the question on complicity; and 5) how many wanted a new 9/11 probe.

All inquiries about questions, responses and demographics should be directed to Zogby International. SPONSOR: 911truth.org is a coalition of researchers, journalists and victim family members working to expose and resolve the hundreds of critical questions still swirling around 9/11, especially the nearly 400 questions that the Family Steering Committee filed with the 9/11Commission which they fought to create. Initially welcomed by the commissioners as a \"road map\" for their inquiry, these queries cut to the heart of 9/11 crimes and accountability. Specifically, they raised the central issues of motive, means and cui bono (who profited?). But the Commission ignored the majority of these questions, opting only to explore system failures, miscommunications and incompetence. The victim families' most incisive issues remain unaddressed to this day. The Zogby International poll was also cosponsored by Walden Three (walden3.org) and 9/11 Citizens Watch (911citizenswatch.org), a watchdog group which has monitored the Commission since its inception and will release its findings, \"The 9/11 Omission Report,\" in several weeks. On September 9th and 11th, 911Truth.org will cosponsor two large successive inquiries in New York, a preliminary 9/11 Citizens Commission hearing and \"Confronting the Evidence: 9/11 and the Search for Truth,\" a research-focused evidentiary forum. These inquiries will examine many of the 9/11 Commission-shunned questions and discuss preparation of a probable cause complaint demanding a grand jury and criminal investigation from the New York Attorney General. Possible charges range from criminal negligence and gross dereliction of duty to foreknowledge, complicity and subsequent obstruction of justice. For details and developments, see www.911truth.org.

match fingerprints The 1970s saw the development of voice recognition systems and the 1980s brought iris recognition technology The advent of digital cameras in the 1990s paved the way for facial recognition systems However the widespread use of biometrics also raises significant privacy concerns Unlike passwords or other credentials biometric data such as DNA is immutable you can t change it

Questions Other FAQs Mercury Myths Media Claims Herd Immunity Questions Media Should Be Asking CHD s Vaccine Safety Project Mercury is Not Safe in Any Form Debunking the Myths About Thimerosal Safety Q What is Thimerosal A Thimerosal is a mercury based preservative used in vaccines and other medicines Developed by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly in 1928 over the years Thimerosal has been used in a variety of medical products including topical antiseptics nasal sprays eye drops immune globulin products and vaccines Myth My doctor says vaccines don t contain mercury anymore that the Thimerosal has been phased out Fact Thimerosal has not been removed from childhood vaccines In 2001 the Institute of Medicine reviewed the use of thimerosal containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders and recommended that thimerosal be removed from vaccines administered to sensitive populations The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices ACIP chose not to follow the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine Today Thimerosal is still in approximately one third to one half of the flu vaccines produced annually and administered to pregnant women and infants access the government s list of Thimerosal containing flu vaccines This means that the developing fetus as well as babies as young as six months are being exposed to mercury in vaccines There is also Thimerosal in the diphtheria tetanus vaccine and in one vaccine to protect against meningitis access the government s list of vaccine ingredients The CDC recommends flu shots for pregnant women six month olds and children in every year of life Pregnant women often instructed by their doctors to get two influenza vaccines if their pregnancy spans more than one flu season Myth Thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines in 2003 Fact Thimerosal wasn t so much removed as it was moved around Here s how it worked In 1999 after realizing that the cumulative amount of mercury a child was exposed to via vaccines had never been tallied the Public Health Service PHS the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP and vaccine manufacturers recommended Thimerosal be removal from all childhood vaccines Thimerosal was then in three childhood vaccines against diphtheria pertussis and tetanus DTaP against Haemophilus influenzae type B Hib and against hepatitis B However instead of requiring immediate removal the CDC allowed the pharmaceutical companies to save money by using up their inventories of mercury containing vaccines By 2003 the industry had finally used up stocks of thimerosal containing vaccines and Thimerosal is no longer used in these three vaccines At the same time mercury was finally phased out of the DTaP Hib and Hep B vaccine the CDC added the mercury containing flu vaccine to the childhood schedule At that time almost all flu vaccines contained 25 micrograms mcgs of mercury recommended to children in every year of life Myth If the CDC",

the childhood schedule At that time almost all flu vaccines contained 25 micrograms mcgs of mercury recommended to children in every year of life Myth If the CDC still allows Thimerosal in vaccines given to pregnant women then it must be safe Fact NO amount of mercury is safe for humans Thimerosal containing vaccines are especially unsafe for pregnant women Mercury is one of the most toxic substances known to man Studies have also shown that thimerosal causes debilitating brain injuries and miscarriages when pregnant women have been exposed to mercury methyl and ethyl from accidental poisonings The FDA has never tested or approved thimerosal for use in pregnancy Myth But the ethyl mercury in Thimerosal is less toxic than the methyl mercury in fish After all humans can drink ethyl alcohol even though methyl alcohol is poisonous Fact The science shows that ethyl mercury is actually more toxic than methyl mercury While this is a common argument it is simply untrue In order to exonerate thimerosal its defenders sometimes parrot the debunked industry canard that the ethyl mercury in thimerosal is less persistent in the body and therefore less toxic than methyl mercury in fish However they cannot cite a single published scientific study to support this position That s because the science says the opposite Ethyl mercury is 50 times more toxic than methyl mercury Guzzi et al 2012 and twice as persistent in the brain Burbacher et al 2005 Myth The dose makes the poison There s only a trace amount of mercury in the flu vaccine which is too small to cause harm Fact The term trace amounts means less than 1 microgram mcg Thimerosal containing flu shots contain what in biochemical terms is actually a massive dose of mercury 25 mcgs Why do I call that massive Because the Environmental Protection Agency s maximum exposure limits for methyl mercury is 1 microgram mcg per 1 kilogram of bodyweight which means a baby would have to weigh 550 pounds to safely absorb 25 mcgs of mercury At these levels a growing fetus in a mother receiving the flu shot could get up to a million times the EPA s safe levels Myth A trace amount of Thimerosal would not be harmful Fact

multi dose flu vaccines that contain Thimerosal Thimerosal free flu vaccines are available People receiving flu vaccines should be able to request and receive Thimerosal free vaccines Unfortunately some doctors insist that it is too inconvenient or too expensive to order Thimerosal free vaccines If your doctor refuses to give you a Thimerosal free vaccine find a different doctor Myth It s too difficult to remove Thimerosal from vaccines Fact Thimerosal can be easily removed from vaccines Thimerosal was quickly and easily removed from the three childhood vaccines in the United States shortly after the CDC requested its removal Most European nations have also banned Thimerosal without any noticeable impact on vaccine cost or supply Myth Epidemiological studies prove that Thimerosal was not a cause of brain damage or health problems in children Fact Despite seriously flawed scientific studies designed to exonerate Thimerosal there is ample epidemiological and clinical data showing it is toxic to children s brains Studies conducted by the CDC have linked Thimerosal exposure with tics Tics are a family of grave neurological injuries that include Tourette Syndrome CDC s senior vaccine safety scientist William Thompson Ph D himself told research scientist Brian Hooker Ph D I can say confidently I do think Thimerosal causes tics The EPA says that epidemics in a broad inventory of neurodevelopmental injuries began in 1989 the same year that the CDC vaccine division increased mercury exposures to American children from 70 mcgs to 570 mcgs The EPA calls 1989 The Gateway Year According to the CDC one in every six American children now suffers from neurodevelopmental disorders We literally have hundreds of studies like this one this one this one and this one No one who actually takes the time to examine the scientific literature can rationally conclude that mercury in any form is safe for humans Myth The government has never admitted that Thimerosal

multiple toxins including mercury aluminum formaldehyde animal and human DNA and more into infants and young children has not been tested There are no large scale studies comparing health outcomes in vaccinated children vs those who haven t received vaccines However a recent peer reviewed study found that vaccinated children had an increased risk of autism 4 2 times ADHD 4 2 times learning disabilities 5 2 times eczema 2 9 times and an astounding 30 times the risk of allergic rhinitis compared to unvaccinated children In 2016 the Vaccine Injury Adverse Reporting System VAERS collected 59 117 reports of adverse events from vaccines including 432 deaths 1091 permanent disabilities 4 132 hospitalizations and 10 284 emergency room visits According to HHS the reported events are only 1 of the actual number Therefore the U S is likely experiencing millions of adverse reactions from vaccines per year Claim 4 Vaccinations produce herd immunity and prevent dangerous even deadly diseases Anti vaxxers are causing epidemics and eroding the public trust Claim 5 Thimerosal ethyl mercury was taken out of vaccines in 1999 and autism rates still continued to rise Also the ethyl mercury in vaccines is less toxic than methyl mercury Claim 6 The study by Wakefield claiming a link between the MMR vaccine and autism has been disproven This study was retracted and the author discredited

Thompson stated I regret that my co authors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics Since 2014 requests to allow Dr William Thompson to testify have been denied by the CDC Claim 7 Autism is genetic not environmental There is no epidemic because changing diagnostic criteria explains the rise There is no such thing as a genetic epidemic and diagnostic substitution cannot account for the skyrocketing numbers of children now diagnosed with autism What we can glean from the science is that autism requires an environmental trigger to cause the epidemic increases we re seeing in not only autism but ADHD tics allergies and a laundry list of other childhood disorders that we have not seen in past generations Researchers have been searching for the elusive autism gene for decades and still haven t found it despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars in their pursuit There may be as many as 1 000 genes involved in autism risk and many of the most promising genetic findings are acquired mutations that point to environmental factors as the cause of the mutations The expansion of genetic studies has found that in families who have two children diagnosed with autism the siblings often don t share the same gene changes which has raised the possibility that the disorder isn t inherited even when it runs in families This begs the question of shared environmental factors or risk conditions One of the largest twin studies to date published in 2011 also found the role of the environment has been

that looked at abnormal brain growth associated with autism reported the abnormalities occurred prenatally but that work has been challenged by Harvard researchers who used advanced imaging techniques and reported that the brain overgrowth was being driven by the white matter of the brain The observed overgrowth of the white matter occurred after birth and may be related to the process of myelination The white matter overgrowth was also seen in infants with developmental language disorders which is often one of the first symptoms of autism in children Claim 8 The United States already has a vaccine safety commission Any appearance of vaccine safety efforts made by the CDC and its pundits is a facade A government agency charged with ensuring high vaccination uptake in the population should not be entrusted to ensure that vaccines are as safe as possible The CDC is in the vaccine business a tremendous conflict of interest when that same agency is tasked with promoting mass scale vaccination According to a 2003 UPI Investigation the CDC held 28 vaccine licensing agreements at that time In 2017 another analysis found that the CDC now holds at least 57 patents related to vaccines Members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices who determine vaccine recommendations are allowed to have financial conflicts some even profiting from the vaccine decisions the committee recommends The revolving door between the CDC and the vaccine industry is blatant and has gone unchecked for decades Claim 9 Robert F Kennedy Jr is an anti vaxxer This type of bullying

conflicts of interest among the regulators of our government agencies expected to protect Americans from harm That is the story that needs to be covered Name calling does nothing to advance the

Jr ensured that all of his six children were fully vaccinated But when he read the independent peer reviewed research linking vaccines with serious health conditions and talked to pharmaceutical and government experts he was convinced that mercury was driving the epidemic of neurological and immunological injuries impacting today s children in numbers never before seen in history Kennedy was also concerned over the lack of true vaccine safety science The few existing CDC safety studies are rife with errors and additionally CDC whistleblower William Thompson claims some of them to be fraudulent Proclaiming that Mr Kennedy is anti vaccine effectively dismisses not only what tens of thousands of parents have witnessed but also what a growing amount of published reputable science is bearing out He wants trustworthy regulators who will actually do their jobs in protecting the health of our nation s citizens Claim 10 Unvaccinated people make others sick Vaccines should be mandatory with no philosophical medical or religious exemptions History shows us that vaccinated people can also spread diseases and infections This is well illustrated by the 2016 Harvard mumps outbreak and the 2017 mumps outbreak at Syracuse University wherein all people diagnosed with mumps had received both recommended doses of the MMR vaccine As mentioned above according to two former Merck virologists who worked on the mumps portion of the MMR the mumps vaccine is not effective In addition to the lack of efficacy in vaccines such as the MMR vaccines made with live viruses such as MMR chicken pox rotavirus influenza and shingles can cause shedding of the viruses to the close contacts of those vaccinated When it comes to the safety and well being of their children parents and caregivers have every right to pose questions no matter the topic Parents research the safest car seats cribs strollers and everything else that involves their children Vaccines should also be on the table for questioning researching discussing or criticizing And if parents decide to refuse vaccines for their children those decisions should be respected One size fits all is a questionable policy when it comes to medical treatment Knowledgeable doctors realize that there isn t a single medical procedure that works well for the entire population and that includes vaccines Published science also supports the fact that some people with genetic predispositions or biological susceptibilities should not have vaccines We desperately need more research in this area so we can identify those likely

clear that American children today comprise the sickest generation in the history of our country As evidence mounts that adverse reactions to vaccines are contributing to many cases of developmental disabilities and chronic illnesses vaccine mandates are at best inappropriate In fact mandated vaccines are in direct opposition to informed consent the number one tenet of the Nuremberg Code The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential Herd Immunity Myths and Facts Myth All children the herd need to be vaccinated to protect all By JB Handley If you still need more convincing that public health officials and vaccine makers will mislead the public please consider the fable of Herd Immunity the oft cited reason that everyone needs to get themselves vaccinated If most people the herd are vaccinated against an illness the common story goes then the herd is protected from that disease In many cases pediatricians and talking heads will get very specific about herd immunity citing important sounding statistics that say vaccination rates on certain diseases must stay above a certain percentage of people in order to have herd immunity Drop below that threshold It s a recipe for disaster When there was an epidemic of measles it wasn t actually an epidemic just a very minor and typical outbreak at Disneyland a few years ago experts were often quoted on T V saying the herd immunity threshold for measles vaccine was 95 meaning 95 of the population needed to be vaccinated against measles in order to prevent epidemics Perhaps no one has beaten the herd immunity drum more loudly than California State Senator Richard Pan the author and sponsor of a bill that made California the third state in the union Mississippi and West Virginia are the other two to make vaccinations mandatory for children s school attendance In fact he used the Disneyland measles outbreak as the reason his bill needed to be passed In a recent missive to his constituents

community immunity throughout our state in the coming years Let s look at Senator Pan s words carefully Restoring community immunity has several implications Firstly it implies that California had somehow lost community immunity which is a non scientific synonym for herd immunity at some point Secondly restoring community immunity implies that until vaccination rates hit a certain threshold grave risks will be present restoration of safety is a top priority What s painfully absurd about Senator Pan s convictions about the importance of herd immunity and of hitting certain vaccination targets is that the United States has never been close to achieving herd immunity for any vaccine preventable disease for two simple reasons 1 The overwhelming majority of adults in the United States are not up to date on their vaccines and 2 The efficacy of vaccines to prevent disease wanes over time meaning protection from a vaccine wears out typically in 10 years or less To put this in perspective there are roughly 150 million adults in the United States walking around with no vaccine provided protection from many diseases that we are supposed to have met herd immunity thresholds for because most adults are not up to date on their vaccines and most vaccines wear off in 10 years or less it s called protection waning The CDC surveys adults every year so it s easy enough to find vaccination coverage rates and they are well below anything that resembles herd immunity here s just a few Hepatitis A 9 Hepatitis B 24 5 Pneumococcal 20 4 and Influenza 43 2 These adults work in schools where they don t have the same immunization requirements as children work in restaurants work in stores and are in every community which means we are nowhere close to herd immunity and never have been When people like Senator Pan pat themselves on the back for protecting society by re establishing herd immunity what they are saying has absolutely no basis in fact None With so many people

parent teacher associations waste no opportunity in perpetuating this myth Proponents have done such a thorough job of convincing the public that a parent who questions it is treated like someone who thinks the earth is flat or believes climate change is a conspiracy On the contrary an unprejudiced view of the science about vaccines and an examination of history clearly show that the herd immunity theory is and always has been flawed Surprisingly the vaccination rates amongst American children for the three primary vaccines given in the 1960s and 1970s were far lower than today s vaccination rates For example in 1977 the vaccination rate for DTP Polio and MMR was 69 62 and 65 respectively By 1991 those numbers were 69 53 and 82 Much as the question is asked of adults today where were all the childhood epidemics in 1977 and 1991 with such low vaccination rates They didn t exist Politicians stand up in front of their colleagues pound the table and advocate passing mandatory vaccination laws to preserve herd immunity Pediatricians get on T V and explain how critical it is that we all maintain herd immunity And yet the notion of herd immunity is absurd when you look at the facts and data In retrospect I did so little research before allowing my boys to be vaccinated I swallowed all these false narratives as fact and I knew so little about the medical procedures we were putting them through on their first day of life and then again at 2 months 4 months 6 months 12 months and 18 months Many people don t even consider a vaccine appointment a medical procedure but that s exactly what it is and it s a procedure that can cause serious harm to a baby I also had no idea how recently the number of vaccines given to kids had skyrocketed The truth is out there for any parent

for the Children s Health Defense at the National Press Club in Washington D C Our aim was to enlighten the media on the doubts we have in the integrity of the science related to our nation s vaccines However if I had any doubts about the state of integrity of journalism today those doubts were solidified at that very press conference You think the media is guilty of bad journalism Why There are some telltale signs Let me take you back a moment and explain how I became affiliated with Robert F Kennedy Jr and the Children s Health Defense It was on a ski lift in Aspen Colorado during Christmas vacation last year when I noticed I was sitting beside Kennedy We began to talk about the beautiful weather as one often does on a ski lift and I asked him if he was still doing his water conservation work He replied Yes and I m also working on vaccines now He proceeded to express his concerns about mercury one of the world s most toxic substances still used as a preservative thimerosal in vaccines

have been easy for this conservative to dismiss Kennedy s premise especially considering I have rarely agreed with his politics But as he continued to speak about the whistleblower Dr William Thompson the co author of one of those definitive studies and other holes in the related science it was apparent this was going to be a David and Goliath effort Kennedy could be entirely off base but what if he was right What if there really was something to it The old instincts kicked in The eyebrow went up There are telltale signs of bad journalism all of which I witnessed at the D C press conference that day The most obvious is the repetition of phrases among various news outlets It s not uncommon to see like words and phrases often repeated among news stories As a writer I find that strange at best lacking in creativity at worst None of us uses the same language to describe a single event This is a sign that a journalist is borrowing canned talking points planted by whomever they interviewed or they have simply copied and pasted from a previously written story Most it seems are not smart enough to catch it or perhaps too busy to care I often wonder if they go to a room after a news conference and collectively decide what words they are going to use In the case of the mercury autism story those common phrases are widely debunked and definitive science Google it and see for yourself You ll find other consistently repeated phrases as well Another telltale sign is the labeling of the messenger Powerful entities such as the pharmaceutical lobby or politicians will spew out labels in an effort to shut down conversation with the full expectation that the journalist will latch onto the label and regurgitate it This is often a tactic a novice or less talented reporter will

kids So why is he continually called an anti vaccine conspiracy theorist How can that be Did the reporters write the story BEFORE the press conference One has to wonder Why is the media ignoring the seeds of doubt Why do journalist disregard the personal testimonies of thousands of parents The Children s Health Defense solicited emails from parents telling their stories of vaccine injury Within a few days more than 6 000 letters poured in They were heart wrenching stories of horrific injury and even death to children who had been healthy prior to vaccination One moment their child was a robust and typical lively kid and within days or even hours of vaccination there was loss of eye contact head banging speech loss excruciating headaches and declining cognitive ability The stories were remarkably consistent These phenomena are not anecdotal they re epidemic For the parents of vaccine injured kids these unanswered questions are haunting and ongoing The helplessness they feel as parents and lack of help they receive from the media eat at their spirits like a bloodthirsty leech When it comes to our nation s kids our most treasured asset should journalists look the other way Ignore the incertitude When in doubt about a matter as important as children s health should they take the first answer and chances or should they exhaust EVERY SINGLE POSSIBILITY and seek the truth

particularly vaccines in Africa published a study of the DTP vaccine diphtheria tetanus and pertussis This is the most popular vaccine in the world and a vaccine that s given to virtually every

children were dying of were things you would never associate with vaccines What the scientists concluded was that the vaccine while it was protecting children from diphtheria tetanus and pertussis had wrecked their immune system so that they were dying of these unrelated illnesses Q Is there a surveillance system in this country that would send off an alarm if the same thing was happening here from our current vaccine program A The central mechanism for post licensing vaccine safety surveillance is called the VAERS system the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System In 2016 alone VAERS said that 59 117 Americans were injured by vaccines but according to HHS this number represents fewer than 1 of adverse events which are reported If we were actually capturing all vaccine injuries that number would be close to six million Americans injured by vaccines every year In 2010 the HHS commissioned a study to determine whether it was feasible to automate the VAERS system so they hired an outside consulting group who came in and automated a system for one of the HMOs That study confirmed these levels of vaccine injury What they found when they looked at how many people were actually getting injured a true number not reported by volunteers but taken from medical records of the 376 452 individuals who were vaccinated 35 000 of them had some kind of adverse reaction That s one in ten Q That one in ten number is very very far from the one in a million number that the industry commonly uses when it talks about vaccine injury And it s a number that most public health officials and most Americans would consider completely unacceptable Does the public know this A No The consultant group looking at medical records and inputting the data never an opportunity to perform system performance assessments because the necessary CDC contacts were no longer available So instead of expanding the system nationwide they shut it down The CDC literally stopped answering the phone calls for those consultants They had bad news and the CDC didn t want to hear it Q So the public is unaware of potential vaccine injuries but aren t vaccines safety tested to assure that this can t happen

manufacturer and distributor of the product who is responsible for safety and of course that responsibility and that liability keeps the company concerned and focused on safety In 1986 Congress passed the Vaccine Act and gave blanket immunity to vaccine companies for injuries caused by vaccines and being liability free means there s no incentive among vaccine manufacturers to conduct safety studies In fact there s a disincentive because there s a provision in the Vaccine Act that says essentially that the only way that a manufacturer can be liable is if they know of a side effect from that vaccine and they fail to warn So their incentive is to do everything that they can to not learn of any side effects Q So if the manufacturers have been lifted of any responsibility for vaccine safety well who s responsible A The Vaccine Act did not want to leave a vacuum So it said that HHS is responsible Health and Human Services Department and that specifically FDA CDC NIH and Health Resources Services Administration HRSA would be the agencies responsible Q The FDA says Vaccines undergo rigorous and extensive testing to determine their safety Is that true A There are two stages before a vaccine comes to market First the FDA has to license the vaccine Then CDC has to add it to the schedule The FDA is the agency that is in charge of the initial step of licensing the vaccine Now for most other drugs the safety testing is indeed rigorous and that kind of testing takes several thousand people who are given the drug and then the same number of people who usually similarly situated people who are given a pill that looks exactly like that drug but it s inert and neither the researchers nor the patients know which ones got the saline drug and which ones got the real drug so it s double blind Then the researchers look at both of those groups for typically five years and they look at health outcomes and that s how they figure out whether or not the drug is safe Vaccines however are characterized by FDA not as drugs but as biologics and that gives FDA the capacity to fast track them without all of that rigorous and bothersome testing For example there are the two hepatitis B

wouldn t ever be reported no one will ever know because they only look at them for four days Here s some more examples the Hib vaccines the Sanofi Pasteur version had the longest safety review period

had a safety review period of only 48 hours Look at the placebo group they tested against the DTP vaccine Q So if they are only testing vaccines for a few days in some instances how can the FDA declare them safe A The only thing that we re left with to determine whether vaccines are safe are post licensing surveillance studies and that leads us back to the woefully inadequate VAERS system mentioned above anchor back up to VAERS Q Why are you the only one talking about this Why should we believe you A It s not just me saying that the Institute of Medicine IOM top scientists in the country who are brought together to review the vaccine safety science at HHS reviewed one vaccine in 1991 DPT They found that there were 22 injuries or diseases such as Meningitis neurological damage learning disabilities and autoimmune disorders that had been reported to be caused by that vaccine The existing literature the scientific literature acknowledged that six of those 22 diseases were in fact caused by the DTP With four of those 22 diseases the literature rejected causation But look at this number with 12 of those diseases there was no literature It had never been studied Because of the lack of science they were handicapped in being able to make any kind of assessment about whether this vaccine was dangerous or safe In 1994 IOM came back and looked at four other vaccines they found that there were 54 illnesses that had been reported to be associated with those vaccines But for 38 of those 54 there was no literature It simply had never been studied So the IOM here is saying

they reviewed four other vaccines and came back with a 700 page report 155 conditions were reported For 134 we don t know and nobody knows if the vaccines are causing that epidemic because we don t have the science to reject that hypothesis This report dealt with an injury that we ve all heard about and that there s a lot of controversy about which is autism Q Did they determine whether the DTP vaccine can cause autism A What they found at the end of that report was that the evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between DTP and autism They couldn t find any study of the relationship between DTP and autism but in fact they acknowledge in the first paragraph they did find that there was one study out there but that study found that DTP does cause autism IOM decided to reject that study because it provided data from a passive surveillance system and lacked an unvaccinated comparison population The system that it relied on was the VAERS system It s HHS s own system and what IOM is saying here is HHS is so slovenly and reckless at gathering data on vaccine safety that we cannot use the one system that they have because it s so unreliable In 2008 Dr Bernadine Healy former head of NIH stated if we really want to know the safety profile of individual vaccines and the vaccine schedule there s one study that we need in order to do that That is a vaccinated versus unvaccinated study Q Has a vaccinated versus unvaccinated study been done A No but good news is that CDC has the database with a capacity to do that study The CDC s Vaccine Safety Datalink has the health records and the vaccination records of 10 million people including hundreds of thousands of children Q And why is the CDC not conducting these obvious kinds of studies A Well maybe it s because they don t like the results when those kinds of studies are conducted This is a CDC study that was done in 1999 secretly of its own vaccine safety database What they found was astonishing It looked at children who had received thimerosal vaccines and compared those to children who had not and what they found was that kids", "chunk_id":

these obvious kinds of studies A Well maybe it s because they don t like the results when those kinds of studies are conducted This is a CDC study that was done in 1999 secretly of its own vaccine safety database What they found was astonishing It looked at children who had received thimerosal vaccines and compared those to children who had not and what they found was that kids who had received the thimerosal vaccine had 1100 greater risk of receiving an autism diagnosis CDC never published this version of the study never let the public know about these risks and effectively closed the vaccine safety database to almost any independent researcher Q Why aren t they doing what s best for the health of our children A The governmental groups that are assigned with the responsibility of licensing the vaccines and adding them to the schedules are bedeviled by massive conflicts of interest that incentivize them to overlook that lack of scientific safety data The FDA is charged with the initial licensing phase of the vaccines and the specific committee charged with that responsibility is the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee VRBPAC There was an investigation of VRBPAC by the US Government Reform Committee of Congress and here s what they found is that The overwhelming majority of members both voting members and consultants have substantial ties to the pharmaceutical industries which is making huge profits on those vaccines Here are the specific conflicts that Congress found at FDA Three of the five FDA advisory committee members who voted to approve the rotavirus vaccine in December had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine One of the five voting members had a 9 million contract for a rotavirus vaccine One of the five voting members was the principal investigator for a Merck grant to develop a rotavirus vaccine One of the five voting members received approximately one million dollars from vaccine manufacturers toward vaccine development Once FDA licensed the vaccine then it goes over to the CDC s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP and they decide whether or not to add that vaccine to the schedule In 2000 an investigation by the US Government Reform Committee of the United States Congress found the same kind of conflicts of interest in CDC as they had initially found in FDA CDC granted blanket waivers to ACIP members that allowed them to deliberate on any subject regardless of their conflicts of interest for the entire year ACIP routinely used working groups where pharma insiders would effectively craft vaccine policy ACIP reflects a system where government officials make crucial decisions affecting American children without the advice

activists scientific and legal minds in the country the sum of their collective experience and expertise is not our most potent asset CHD Founder Robert F Kennedy Jr learned well over a decade ago that the movement behind CHD s mission to end childhood health epidemics is primarily fueled by parents love for their children and the innate drive to keep all children out of harm s way And as Big Pharma and corrupt federal health agencies and officials are discovering that makes CHD a powerful force to be reckoned with Many of the people working for CHD have been actively involved in the health freedom movement for years some for decades CHD s success to date is the product of these activists consistently proactive response to adversity and a testament to parental determination CHD s staff are well versed in science and know the struggles that families face when children experience regressive autism life altering neurological disorders or tragically lose their lives following vaccination They have testified before Congress written books and created grassroots organizations to help other families in similar situations But their impressive resumes are the result of years as foot soldiers in the battle to protect future generations from harm Red Pilled by the Mercury Moms Kennedy readily admits that he was dragged kicking and screaming into this brawl Like so many who find themselves confronted with the inconvenient truth about the chronic disease epidemic and its links to an ever growing childhood vaccination schedule Kennedy experienced the cognitive dissonance firsthand As a pro vaccine parent who had vaccinated his own six children he faced a difficult and pivotal moment when he was first approached by mothers of vaccine injured children including Laura Bono Lyn Redwood and Rita Shreffler In 2005 these mercury moms gathered their research and began appearing at Kennedy s speaking engagements as he toured the country raising awareness of the environmental impacts of mercury emissions in the water supply As founder of Waterkeeper Alliance Kennedy was highly regarded as one of the world s leading environmental advocates He spent his time

Program or vaccine court when the U S government conceded that vaccines caused her son s autism awarding compensation for his injuries who showed up in Cape Cod and convinced Kennedy to review the formidable stack of scientific studies she brought to his front stoop Kennedy was immediately struck by the chasm separating scientific reality from the consensus narrative perpetuated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and other alphabet agencies and constantly reinforced by mainstream media He quickly realized that vaccines are not subject to the same safety standards applied to other pharmaceutical products in the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA approval process and he was dismayed by the absence of large scale double blind inert placebo controlled studies In short no sound science supported the safe and effective mantra of the medical establishment Redwood then presented Kennedy with a copy of the Simpsonwood transcripts Obtained through a FOIA request by attorney Elizabeth Birt mother of a son with autism the transcripts document a secret emergency meeting among CDC personnel other high level public health officials and all the major vaccine manufacturers convened in response to a troubling analysis of CDC data regarding thimerosal The analysis conducted by Belgian researcher Thomas Verstraeten indicated that the massive mercury doses infants were receiving due to the recently expanded vaccination schedule were leading to an epidemic of childhood neurological disorders The transcripts reveal public health bureaucrats conspiring to bury the incriminating data making their priorities abundantly clear Those profiting from the fatally flawed childhood vaccination program were much more interested in protecting their enterprise than protecting children s brains and bodies Angered by this callous disregard for children Kennedy wrote an article co published by Rolling Stone magazine and Salon entitled Deadly Immunity inviting the

Kennedy had seen how the corrupting influence of industry transformed regulatory agencies into obedient enablers He thought he knew all there was to know about regulatory capture But in his best selling book The Real Anthony Fauci Bill Gates Big Pharma and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health Kennedy explains From the moment of my reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate in 2005 I was astonished to realize that the pervasive web of deep financial entanglements between Pharma and the government health agencies had put regulatory capture on steroids High level officials including Dr Fauci receive yearly emoluments of up to 150 000 in royalty payments on products that they help develop and then usher through the approval process The FDA receives 45 of its budget from the pharmaceutical industry through what are euphemistically called user fees When I learned that extraordinary fact the disastrous health of American people was no longer a mystery I wondered what the environment would look like if the EPA received 45 of its budget from the coal industry In 2015 while doing a promotional tour with Eric Gladen for his film Trace Amounts which documents Gladen s experience with mercury poisoning following a tetanus vaccine Kennedy realized that eradicating vaccine mandates would require more than just activism The forces arrayed against us were just too powerful We needed a paid professional staff who awakens every morning thinking of nothing except how to solve this problem how to force a national debate and expose the phony science and CDC corruption In 2016 Kennedy joined forces with Gladen Redwood and Bono to launch the World Mercury Project WMP which would eventually become Children s Health Defense WMP s original mission was to end exposure to neurotoxic mercury in fish medical products dental amalgams and vaccines and make sound science the driver of public policy If You Build it They Will Come WMP was organized around Kennedy

win justice for injured children Kennedy is known for his fierce and relentless brand of environmental activism and his advocacy for transparent government and rigorous science He is now applying his

vaccine injured and later diagnosed with autism After an eight year legal battle she had finally received compensation from the vaccine court which acknowledged that Porter got his autism seizures and brain damage from thimerosal and pertussis vaccines She persuaded me to start looking into the science RS That was a daunting request RFK I have always loved science and I m comfortable reading it By then I d handled many hundreds of environmental cases Almost all of them involved scientific controversies When I started reading about thimerosal I was dumbstruck by the gulf between the scientific reality and the media consensus All the network news anchors and television doctors were assuring the public that there was not a single study that suggested thimerosal was unsafe or that it could cause autism After a short time on PubMed I d identified many dozens of studies suggesting that thimerosal causes autism and a rich library of peer reviewed literature over 400 published studies attesting to its deadly toxicity and its causal connection to a long inventory of neurological injuries and organ damage RS What do we know about thimerosal safety testing RFK First of all vaccines are not subject to the safety rigors undergone by other pharmaceuticals in the FDA approval process There are no large scale double blind placebo controlled studies And in the one 1930 human study of thimerosal that predated its use in vaccines all the subjects injected with thimerosal died In 2004 an FDA official acknowledged in testimony before a Congressional committee that no government or privately funded study has ever demonstrated thimerosal s safety On the other hand there is plenty of science suggesting that thimerosal is NOT safe Several hundred studies available on PubMed link thimerosal exposure to the neurodevelopmental and immune system diseases that are now epidemic in the generation of American children born after the CDC dramatically increased childhood thimerosal

neurodevelopmental and immune system diseases that are now epidemic in the generation of American children born after the CDC dramatically increased childhood thimerosal exposure starting in 1988 My book Thimerosal Let the Science Speak summarizes these studies The scientific literature inculpates increased thimerosal exposure as a culprit in the explosion of ADD ADHD speech delay narcolepsy SIDS ASD seizure disorder tics and anaphylaxis including asthma and food allergies According to the CDC one in six American children the so called thimerosal generation now suffers from a developmental disability We have published a compendium of 80 published peer reviewed studies that strongly suggest a link between thimerosal exposure and autism RS The CDC started adding to the vaccine schedule in the late 1980s and all these diseases including autism began spiking among kids in the mid 1990s That s when parents started seeing perfectly healthy children regress into autism after receiving their vaccines RFK Yeah A rising chorus of complaints from parents and pediatricians linked the new thimerosal heavy vaccine schedule to an explosion in autism In response the CDC in 1999 commissioned an in house Belgian researcher Thomas Verstraeten to study the Vaccine Safety Datalink the largest American repository of childhood vaccine and health records collected by HMOs health maintenance organizations The HMO data clearly showed that the massive mercury doses in the newly expanded vaccine schedule were causing runaway epidemics of neurological disorders ADD ADHD speech delay sleep disorders tics and autism among America s children Verstraeten s original analysis of those datasets found that thimerosal exposures increased autism risk by 760 The CDC now knew the cause of the autism epidemic RS How did the CDC react to the revelations in the Verstraeten study RFK The vaccine branch called an emergency meeting of regulators from WHO FDA vaccine industry stakeholders and the American Academy of Pediatrics at the Simpsonwood Conferences and Retreat Center in Norcross Georgia They reportedly held the meeting off the CDC campus to shield the deliberations from freedom of information requests During a frantic two day debate that group decided to embargo Verstraeten s study The CDC then pushed Verstraeten aside and assembled a team of industry and CDC scientists to rework the study using dodgy statistical devices to make the autism signal disappear After four increasingly deceptive iterations that team succeeded in eliminating the signal linking thimerosal with autism and a half dozen other neurodevelopmental disorders The CDC published that version and told the public that thimerosal was safe When parents asked to see the raw data the CDC claimed that it

health of the Hudson River RS Right that s when the CDC went into the business of creating its notorious phony epidemiological studies RFK Exactly Over the next two years the CDC worked with the pharmaceutical industry to gin up seven epidemiological studies that purport to exculpate thimerosal from causing the autism epidemic None of these studies pretend to be safety studies Each of them simply looked for the presence of a small number of designated diseases in specific populations exposed to thimerosal All of them are fatally flawed due to improper methodologies or deliberate fraud Nevertheless these are the studies that the CDC lists on its website and that its spokespeople regularly cite to defend mercury in vaccines It s worth noting that the CDC itself has so little faith in these studies that it derailed a scheduled 2012 review of their underlying science by the Institute of Medicine IOM and killed a 2006 review of thimerosal safety by the National Toxicology Program Under CDC pressure the Institute of Medicine made the astonishing declaration in 2004 that based on those seven flawed studies the science was settled and no new studies on the causative relationship between thimerosal and autism should be undertaken or funded That declaration effectively cut off support for any scientist who wants to investigate the link RS The CDC touts those seven epidemiological studies across the globe as evidence of thimerosal safety RFK Yes and CDC and IOM officials left behind a very troubling email trail that makes it clear that those studies were deliberately manufactured to exonerate thimerosal By the time I came across them I was accustomed to dissecting research papers and spotting junk science In my line we call it tobacco science and the hired guns who generate it biostitutes The CDC s primary data manager on its widely touted Danish studies was a notorious con man and professional biostitute named Poul Thorsen who actually pocketed the million dollars the CDC paid him to do the research He is currently under indictment on 22 counts of wire fraud and money laundering by the U S Justice Department and is the star of the OIG s Most

clue about the pivotal role they both had played in deceiving the public about thimerosal safety Both of them spoke to me willingly Offit expressed admiration for my father which is an effective way to butter me up I asked them both the obvious question Why do we advise pregnant women to steer clear of fish because of neurotoxic mercury and yet inject much larger doses of mercury into pregnant women and their newborns They both repeated to me the thread worn industry canard that the ethyl mercury in vaccines is not as dangerous as the methyl mercury in fish which everyone admits is highly neurotoxic Offit explained to me that ethyl mercury wasn t toxic because it leaves the human body so quickly RS What was your reaction RFK By then I d read Burbacher s monkey studies which confirmed Offit s assertion that the ethyl mercury from vaccines rapidly left the blood But Burbacher had shown the ethyl mercury was not being excreted from the body as Offit implied during our telephone conversation Instead it was going directly into the brain where it rapidly metabolized into highly toxic inorganic mercury and then lodged there creating inflammation and brain damage Burbacher had shown that inorganic mercury remains in the brain for years Instead of being evidence of its safety as Offit represented ethyl mercury s penchant for disappearing quickly from the blood was testimony to its extreme peril it was disappearing due to the ease with which it crossed the blood brain barrier Ethyl mercury used in vaccines was both far more persistent and far more toxic than the methyl mercury found in fish The Guzzi study in 2012 showed the ethyl mercury was 50 times as toxic to cells When I mentioned the Burbacher study to Stratton and Offit they both went silent It was obvious

to talking to journalists who seem to have an allergy to reading science and were content to parrot their reassurances RS What did Offit say when you confronted him RFK Well he clearly knew that he was lying and now he knew that I knew he was lying There was a long awkward pause Then he had this kind of Porky Pig Epity epity epity what moment after which he launched into what is now to me a familiar Paul Offit soft shoe routine He said Well you re right Robert there is no definitive study It s really a whole mosaic of studies And then he had to go RS What was Stratton s reaction RFK Stratton was much more candid She just came out and said Well obviously it s toxic When you give it to mice bad things happen and when you give it to rats they do weird things It can t be good for

advocates for the use of thimerosal in vaccines and I caught them both lying A few days later I heard Offit repeat his good mercury bad mercury fib during an interview on NPR I thought to myself This man is a thorough charlatan a snake oil salesman and he has everyone flimflammed That made me angry After that I learned that he was also venal RS What do you mean venal RFK Well my original

When I learned about this caper and his other money schemes I just thought Well he s a hoodlum RS He s also a misogynist and a bully RFK It s disturbing because the media worships him like a deity And

efficiency I had appropriated the term to describe the autism epidemic after searching vainly for some other analogies with the power to capture the magnitude and monstrosity of this global tragedy

this issue The forces arrayed against us were just too powerful We needed a paid professional staff who awaken every morning thinking of nothing except how to solve this problem How to force a

RS Would removing mercury from vaccines guarantee us safe vaccines RFK No There are other highly toxic vaccine ingredients that must be removed Aluminum is an example But the larger problem is that the entire vaccine program is in disarray As CDC senior vaccine safety scientist Dr William Thompson has pointed out one of the primary fallouts of the mercury autism debate is that it has paralyzed science at the CDC So we know very little about vaccine safety or efficacy for that matter It s undeniable that vaccines can cause terrible injuries and even death to vulnerable subgroups There is also an assumption that they do more good than harm That may not be true for all vaccines Certain vaccines may cause more harm thimerosal laden flu and Hepatitis B vaccines come to mind Even with Gardasil and MMR which don t contain thimerosal it s very difficult to support industry claims for their safety or efficacy No one can answer these questions honestly The efficacy and safety studies that we would need to answer these questions have never been performed and the science that has been done has raised a lot of flags that should make reasonable people worry Most Americans just assume the CDC has done these studies and answered these questions People would be shocked if they knew how shoddy the CDC s science really is RS What do you imagine would happen to autism rates if the CDC removed thimerosal from American vaccines RFK In Denmark ASD rates dropped 30 when the Danish government ordered removal of mercury in 1992 So that s a bellwether The drop would likely be more dramatic in this country because the Danes had a very small amount of thimerosal containing vaccines We use much more thimerosal than the Danes ever allowed Katie Wright suggests that the Danes never had the severe brand of autism that is now common in America Having said that we need to remember that there are many other sources of mercury in the environment including dental amalgams and power

there are other toxins that may cause damage in the same parts of the brain as mercury glyphosate for example or that may have a synergistic relationship with mercury in triggering autism RS Why is no

pretending to study the environmental causes of the epidemics in pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders or food allergies The former president of Merck s vaccine division acknowledged to me recently that vaccines are a likely culprit in the food allergy epidemic but he told me that no one is studying it How can that possibly be RS Well let me ask you that How is it possible RFK The CDC has gone to monumental lengths to make sure no one performs studies that might even inadvertently expose the link between thimerosal and autism In 2004 the CDC arm twisted the IOM into making the extraordinary declaration that any questions on the links between vaccines and these diseases had been settled and ought never to be studied again When does a scientist ever say anything like that In science nothing is ever settled Everything is a hypothesis subject to revision when contrary evidence emerges Science says you always keep investigating and questioning assumptions That IOM declaration was the opposite of science It was like the Catholic Church silencing Copernicus because of its fear that scientific knowledge might endanger the institution The CDC then effectively closed access to the Vaccine Safety Data link America s largest repository for vaccine safety information and forced FDA and the IOM to abandon their own scheduled studies of thimerosal toxicity The CDC has effectively stopped everyone from studying the links Scientists who try to do the research get blackballed and the journals are too intimidated to publish research that raises questions about vaccine or thimerosal safety RS Yes it seems odd to say No studies of this should ever be done RFK It s quite extraordinary This is why most of the good science now is coming from abroad To give American

universities and research centers MIT UC Davis the Simons Foundation Princeton and Yale among many others So these researchers all get their grant money But of course they will never find the cause We know that the epidemic is caused by environmental toxins As Dr Boyd Haley says Genes don t cause epidemics Genes can provide vulnerabilities but you need an environmental toxin Yet no one is looking for the toxin It s like studying the genetic causes of sunburn without looking at the role of the sun It s all designed to keep us from learning answers that might embarrass the CDC RS And the ultimate beneficiary is Pharma RFK Vaccines have become a 30 billion dollar bonanza for Pharma and vaccine makers Just like the tobacco oil and chemical industries Pharma employs strategies to get sham science published and to block the kind of science that threatens bottom lines The food industry and corporate agriculture use the same tactics and often the same scientists and PR firms These fellows have us swimming around in a toxic soup The science journals and universities have been corrupted Science today is rarely a search for existential truth There s not much money in that We know very little about glyphosate even though it s infiltrated our food supply and our bodies Stephanie Seneff at MIT has shown that glyphosate operates along the same toxicity pathways as mercury in the brain RS Why don t pediatricians object RFK Well there are many pediatricians who have grave doubts about thimerosal safety and would like better science I meet many pediatricians who are reticent about the schedule and have seen vaccine damage in their patients but they are terrified to speak out They know they will face intimidation by their peers There s a name for this phenomenon It s called the Semmelweis reflex Ignaz Semmelweis was the obstetrician who first proposed antiseptic procedures His work implied that physicians using the current protocols were actually making people

similarly destroyed the career of British physician and epidemiologist Alice Stewart when she demonstrated that the routine practice of giving x rays to pregnant women was causing cancer in their children Herbert Needleman and Rachel Carson got the same treatment In the same way today s doctors who are brave enough to talk about vaccine safety concerns often get punished Look what happened to Andy Wakefield Mark Geier Bob Sears and Anju Usman These were all courageous physicians the kind that I would want caring for my children They each made the career mistake of standing up for their patients acting as healers questioning authority and speaking truth to power The medical establishment made examples of them RS But why don t more pediatricians stand up and speak out RFK Most pediatricians are not reading the research science In my own experience I find that even the ones that get the journals don t read beyond the abstracts which rarely contain the controversial findings Pediatricians are overworked so they trust the CDC and AAP to tell them what the science says The AAP is totally co opted by Pharma dollars And individual physicians are subject to perverse economic incentives from Pharma and insurers to keep them in line RS What do you mean by perverse incentives RFK A few weeks ago someone gave me a Blue Cross Blue Shield Compensation and Bonus Program for pediatricians The program provided a 40 bonus to the pediatrician for every on time vaccine up to 400 per child A typical practice could include 1500 children So that is a good half million dollar annual incentive to vaccinate according to the schedule and not to ask too many questions about safety Even worse the program punishes doctors who fail to fully vaccinate at least 63 of their practice on time Those doctors lose 100 of the bonus The system is designed to pressure pediatricians to vaccinate even when there are contraindications It explains why vaccine hesitant parents encounter open hostility from pediatricians when they express reticence or concern It explains why pediatricians rarely fully inform each patient about vaccine risks and side effects as the law requires RS What do

do you hope to advance this strategically RFK Our immediate efforts center on forcing a debate in the press making reporters actually look at the science and realize they ve been lied to and bamboozled by the hucksters at the CDC RS What would be the cost of switching to non thimerosal vaccines RFK I ve seen industry estimates of 20 cents per vaccine which is a relatively trivial price But Professor José Dórea just published a peer reviewed answer to this question in the November issue of Environmental Research He estimates the cost at less than 1 per vaccine The total global cost would be less than the 2 million annually for vaccines for the 100 million children currently receiving thimerosal containing vaccines That is less than the lifetime cost of caring for a single child with autism The industry already produces non thimerosal versions of all these vaccines so the switch would be quick RS I ve heard you talk about captive regulatory agencies Do you mean the CDC RFK The CDC is a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical industry The agency owns more than 20 vaccine patents and purchases and sells 4 1 billion in vaccines annually Congressman Dave Weldon has pointed out that the primary metric for success across the CDC is how many vaccines the agency sells and how successfully the agency expands its vaccine program regardless of any negative effects on human health Weldon exposed how the Immunization Safety Office which is supposed to ensure vaccine efficacy and safety has become subsumed in that metric The scientists in that part of the agency should no longer be considered part of the public safety sector Their function is to promote vaccines As Dr Thompson has attested they are routinely ordered to destroy manipulate and conceal evidence of adverse

talking about RFK Congress the regulatory agencies FDA and CDC the IOM the NIH the AAP the science journals the university science departments and the press Pharma has a broad reach RS Are you saying that Pharma also corrupts our nation s lawmakers RFK Pharma is the largest lobbyist in Washington It now has more lobbyists on Capitol Hill than there are Congress people The industry spends twice as much on lobbying as oil and gas and almost four times as much as the defense and aerospace industries Imagine that Congress was already drowning in Pharma money in 1986 when it gave pharmaceutical companies immunity from lawsuits arising from vaccine injury In that way vaccine makers rid themselves of the courts and the lawyers With Congress and the regulatory agencies already captured Pharma succeeded in thereby eliminating the final check and balance against bad corporate behavior in a free market Once they were liberated from liability vaccines became a major industry profit center It was that legislation that launched the vaccine bonanza that began in 1988 RS What has been the role of the press RFK The media is complicit in the cataclysm At least part of the reason is financial America is one of only two nations in the world that allows pharmaceutical ads on television Drug companies are the largest advertisers on TV and radio They spend 3 5 4 billion annually to saturate the airwaves with 80 advertisements every hour Anyone who watches network news quickly understands that it has devolved into a vehicle for selling pharmaceuticals That lucre seems to have neutralized the news divisions at CNN ABC NBC and CBS Fox News alone is uncorrupted but only because its shameless purpose from its inception has been to promote the ascendancy of corporate power Fox s former CEO

mentioned the science journals RFK The science journals are also corrupted It s common for these journals to receive half or more of their income from Pharma ads and reprint orders Many of them are owned outright by drug companies Dr Marcia Angell the former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine and Richard Horton the current editor in chief of The Lancet the world s two preeminent science journals have both recently declared that half of their articles are untrue concocted by authors compromised by flagrant conflicts of interest Pharma s stranglehold on the journals keeps independent vaccine safety science from ever getting published Just this month the Swiss journal Frontiers in Public Health cancelled publication of the first vaccinated unvaccinated study The study showed that vaccinated children had less measles and rubella but four times as many neurological disorders including autism and 30 times the incidence of allergies Frontiers panicked after it put up the abstract and got 78 000 views in a day and presumably a lot of heat from Pharma I could give you a parade of other examples of great studies that either can t find a publisher or get published and then taken down as soon as the journals feel the heat As it turns out the people who run those journals are no Bravehearts Self preservation is the overriding motivation RS Is there a conspiracy among

then there were a lot of power centers the industry the media the political leaders the medical community that found it in their own self interest to not scrutinize the questionable CDC narrative too closely In that way a tiny explicit conspiracy made the evolutionary leap to widespread orthodoxy Pharma s unlimited reach and wealth helped cement the consensus That proliferation of the gospel swept up the other regulators the press the environmental groups the science journals the AAP the AMA and other medical associations and the pediatricians in a kind of consensus dogma much larger than the explicit conspiracy It s akin to what happened to the Catholic Church during the pedophile scandal The institution suddenly became more important than the children it was supposed to protect Only a relatively few individuals were actively involved in raping children and shuffling known pedophile priests to unsuspecting dioceses But everyone became complicit from the bishops and priests the doctors to the press and police You can judge the power of the orthodoxy by the way it often swept up the parents of abused children and even the victims It was in everyone s self interest to keep their mouths shut Orthodoxies don t require overt collusion The same thing happened with the NFL in the concussion scandal RS You use the term orthodoxy a nd in some ways this is like a religion isn t

advertising Most reporters and media outlets accept the muzzle because they think they are safeguarding public health They believe that allowing debate about vaccine safety and CDC corruption may cause the public to stop vaccinating RS Do you think that s a legitimate rationale RFK It s not black and white There have been times in American history when journalists have agreed legitimately to hold stories for brief periods of time for national security reasons but it s always a slippery slope And this situation is unique The embargo has lasted a decade Journalism is wandering into a minefield when media outlets take on the responsibility of protecting Americans from dangerous knowledge Democracy is messy and difficult but I think journalists nearly always need to come down on the side of transparency And I don t think that coming clean will destroy the vaccine program As the late NIH Director Bernadine Healy said Americans are smarter than that Healy believed that a vigorous and open debate would not diminish but rather strengthen the vaccine program RS Is there any evidence that insulation from scrutiny has actually strengthened the vaccine program RFK That s the irony Rather than strengthening public support for vaccines the laws that shield the vaccine industry from lawsuits combined with the absence of political and press scrutiny have emboldened the CDC to sanction increasingly reckless conduct by vaccine makers Because the press won t cover CDC corruption we now have a rogue agency that s completely unaccountable Its senior vaccine safety scientist has just come forward to admit that the CDC routinely destroys data Its key studies are fraudulent If what Dr Thompson is saying is true the implications are monumental It means that CDC officials

associated in the scientific literature with vaccines mercury and with thimerosal specifically Think about when you were in school How many people did you know with peanut allergies and autism EPA scientists found that the greatest increase in ASD prevalence occurred in cohorts born between 1987 and 1992 The so called changepoint year was 1988 That s the timeframe that the CDC began expanding the vaccine schedule increasing mercury exposures from 75mcg to 237 5 mcg before the second birthday RS The fact that it s mainly boys who are injured is additional evidence of mercury s central role RFK Mercury disproportionately affects boys because testosterone amplifies the neurotoxic effects of mercury Conversely estrogen wraps the mercury molecule and protects the female brain That s why these disorders tend to selectively affect males and girls with unusually high testosterone Any scientist genuinely searching for the cause of this epidemic must begin by identifying a toxin that suddenly increased across every demographic in 1988 and affects boys at a 4 to 1 ratio RS Parents of vaccine injured children were heartened to learn that you and your law partner are trying to

subpoena a federal agency employee unless you can show that his testimony couldn t be obtained from any other source Of course that s true in this case because there were only four people who witnessed the CDC data dump and nobody else is talking However the federal law requires that the first step in that process is to petition the head of the agency and ask for permission to subpoena the employee CDC Director Dr Thomas Friedan denied our request which was not a surprise The CDC has much to lose from Thompson s truthful testimony We are now appealing that decision in federal court

thimerosal let us know Even if you have no known vaccine injuries in your family we can use you Right now we are trying to sign up pregnant women and parents with young children for planned litigation

we are getting mothers and fathers to tell their stories about their vaccine injured children We are working with the Vaxxed team on this project We need short home videos less than two minutes We want parents to tell their stories as if they were speaking in a Senate hearing We welcome the participation of anyone who has a vaccine injury story to tell We want to create an archive of stories from the autism generation Just go to the website for instructions RS Earlier you mentioned the heavy toll it takes on scientists and celebrities who question vaccine safety Do you have concerns about your own career and reputation or safety for speaking out on vaccine injury RFK Those things are irrelevant to me The injuries that I ve suffered from a decade of attacks by Pharma s trolls and toadies are dwarfed by the agonies experienced by an autistic child and his family during a single hour of any single day I don t know what to make of the countless journalists scientists and doctors

de los pequeños niños frente a los grandes Big Pharma las grandes farmacéuticas Big Tech las grandes industrias tecnológicas Big Energy las grandes compañias de energía Big Food las grandes compañías de alimentación Big Chemical las grandes empresas químicas y cómo estas industrias han subvertido y corrompido nuestra democracia nuestros organismos reguladores los brazos de investigación científica de las instituciones académicas y los medios de comunicación hasta el punto de que estas instituciones creadas para protegernos a nosotros y a nuestros hijos de la codicia corporativa ahora protegen los beneficios corporativos The Defender expone el impacto corrosivo del poder corporativo en la democracia Nuestro trabajo surge de la premisa de que las cuestiones de salud y medio ambiente son siempre cuestiones de derechos humanos y la mejor medida de cómo funciona una democracia es si mantiene los bienes comunes públicos los bienes del fideicomiso público en manos de todas las personas en lugar de permitir que se concentren y sean robados de la gente por grandes congolomerados de riqueza y poder The Defender lucha contra la censura que sirve a intereses corporativos y autoritarios y

humanidad The Defender proporciona una discusión abierta y honesta sobre los problemas sistemáticamente ignorados por la mayoría de los medios de comunicación ya sea porque los temas se consideran tabú o porque a los anunciantes corporativos se les permite una influencia indebida sobre el contenido La escasez de investigación científica de alta calidad y periodismo médico que no estén no contaminados por las farmacéuticas y otras industrias mastodónticas ha creado una crisis global de desinformación Los centros de poder arraigados han politizado secuestrado y censurado abiertamente la

should go without saying that no one making public health decisions that will directly affect the lives of millions of United States children and indirectly affect the lives of millions of international children through our global influence should have any ties to the pharmaceutical industry But sadly this is not the case Policies that do exist are either completely ignored or enforcement has been lax The CDC especially has a lengthy history of corruption and deceit and has routinely turned a blind eye to vaccine conflicts of interest while it works to protect the private good And the problem goes all the way to the top with one previous CDC director working for Merck while another resigned in disgrace after allegations of owning stock in companies working with the CDC The US urgently needs and taxpayers firmly deserve ethical leadership in government industry and media who are free from conflicts both before and after taking the job The far reaching health

make clear the passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act NCVIA in 1986 was a watershed event that emboldened vaccine manufacturers and their public and private sector accomplices notably the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC to systematically hide the serious damage caused by vaccines In addition to making a mockery of pre licensing safety testing and post marketing surveillance these entities have regularly manipulated or destroyed data to exaggerate both the benefits and effectiveness of vaccination Manufacturers have also used their money and power to subordinate the mainstream media medical journals and front groups making it possible to publish and broadcast deceptive studies that whitewash questions inconvenient to the financial bottom line From multiple standpoints not least of which is children s dismal state of health the status quo is untenable Three of the most urgent steps to be taken include repealing the NCVIA eliminating vaccine mandates making both childhood and adult vaccination voluntary and addressing conflicts of interest by establishing a fully transparent and independent vaccine safety commission research suggests that many doctors do not comply with the legal requirement to hand out much less discuss patient education materials Repeal the NCVIA The NCVIA has been an unmitigated disaster As New York University law professor Mary Holland has written the Act s passage has allowed the government and vaccine manufacturers to ride roughshod over three important legal protections Free and informed consent to an invasive medical procedure Accurate and complete information about vaccine ingredients and possible side effects The right to sue manufacturers and medical practitioners directly in the event of injury According to Holland the absence of these legal protections for vaccination is striking compared to almost all other medical interventions The legal protections are interrelated For example an individual cannot exercise truly informed consent unless he or she has access to full and unbiased information Recognizing this one provision of the NCVIA was a mandate for the CDC to develop and health care providers to distribute patient education materials about vaccine risks and benefits However not only has the CDC repeatedly dumbed down the materials in a variety of ways but research suggests that many doctors do not comply with the legal requirement to hand out much less discuss them Instead providers and the media continue to blandly assure the public that vaccine injuries are a

negative effect on vaccine safety After an extensive analysis of nationwide and state level U S data a researcher reported in 2017 that vaccines licensed after NCVIA s passage were associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse events compared to vaccines licensed prior to the law s passage The researcher concluded that product safety deteriorates when consumers are no longer able to sue manufacturers Repealing the NCVIA and reinstating product liability would not solve all of the ethical problems that permeate the pharmaceutical industry s business culture but it could curtail the free for all environment that has prevailed since 1986 and might incentivize manufacturers to treat vaccines in the same way as drugs and put safety on somewhat of a more even footing with profits

medical experts Medical experts fear of anti vaccine stigma Unavailability of medical documentation An impossibly high burden of proof for most types of injuries Despite the NCVIA legislation s focus

and parcel of the U S vaccination program and they have had a decisive and negative impact on children s health Over the years since the passage of the NCVIA a handful of courageous legislators troubled by the cozy corporate alliances that exist between industry and captured federal regulators have put forth pleas for an objective and non conflicted vaccine safety commission to investigate and resolve safety problems Some researchers likewise have called for an independent National Vaccine Safety Board separate from the CDC or any branch of government to ensure optimal vaccine safety A 2006 editorial in Nature concurred that in light of waning public confidence in vaccine safety a strong case could be made for establishing a well resourced independent national agency that commands the trust of both the government and the public in matters of health protection In early 2017 Children s Health Defense Chairman Robert F Kennedy Jr discussed the creation of a vaccine safety commission with then president elect Trump and also met with high level National Institutes of Health NIH and Food and Drug Administration FDA officials The Trump administration chose not to pursue the idea despite the glaring need to introduce transparency to the U S vaccination program In March 2018 Children s Health Defense took to the halls of Congress and shared its multi pronged Vaccine Safety Project with every member arguing among other actions for the need to Subject vaccines to a scientifically rigorous approval process Require reporting of vaccine adverse events Ensure that all parties involved with federal vaccine approvals and recommendations are free from conflicts of interest Support fully informed consent and individual rights to refuse vaccination Hopefully concerned

other information Kennedy has found additional evidence of criminal activity by the CDC consultant Poul Thorsen the author and principal coordinator of multiple CDC studies exonerating the mercury

Institutional Review Board IRB to conduct their research which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2002 and Pediatrics in 2003 In 2011 The Department of Justice indicted Thorsen on 22 counts of wire fraud and money laundering for stealing over 1 million in CDC grant money earmarked for autism research The product of Thorsen s work for CDC was a series of fraud tainted articles on Danish autism rates that today form the backbone of the popular orthodoxy that vaccines don t cause autism In 2009 when CDC discovered that Thorsen never applied for the IRB approvals staff did not report the errors and retract the studies Rather FOIA documents show that CDC supervisors ignored the missteps and covered up the illegal activity This misconduct undermines the legitimacy of these

the recent retraction of our paper Why are we vaccinating children against COVID 19 by Elsevier Toxicology Reports TR Our paper was part of a TR Special Issue on the COVID 19 pandemic and focused on 1 the myriad toxic effects of the COVID 19 vaccines on the host 2 the inadequacy of the clinical trials used to show these vaccines were safe and 3 the poor cost benefit of using these vaccines Our paper was submitted to the Elsevier journal TR in Summer 2021 underwent a rigorous independent peer review was accepted for publication and went online in mid September 2021 Our article and the other articles in the TR Special Issue was then subjected to a unilateral re review commissioned by the publisher Elsevier in late Fall 2021 This re review was managed reviewed by an Elsevier contractor and also included an anonymous reviewer of unknown independence and expertise The review comments were sent to the first author myself by Elsevier and a response to these comments was requested Both the official reviewers comments and my official response are contained verbatim in the Appendix which is the highlight of this OpEd This exchange of comments was used by Elsevier to justify the retraction of our article As the reader will see the reviewers comments were of extremely poor quality In the one area where the review manager had any expertise toxicology the main thrust of our paper the reviewers offered no comments The only comments they offered were on topics where they exhibited little if any expertise explaining in part the reason for the extremely poor quality of the review Following my response the Elsevier contractor recommended the article be retracted Elsevier informed me the article would be retracted based on their contractor s recommendation and on 30 April 2022 a retraction notice was posted on the TR Website Thus the results of a non independent non objective review by an Elsevier contractor over rode the results from a rigorous independent objective peer review to enable the retraction to occur In the interim on 21 March 2022 the Editor in Chief of TR resigned for personal reasons On the same day that the Editor in Chief resigned the Elsevier contractor who had managed and participated in the re review and who had recommended retraction of our paper was appointed by Elsevier as permanent Editor in Chief of TR Introduction The famous quote

of the unilateral retraction of our TR article titled Why are we vaccinating children against COVID 19 by the Dutch publisher Elsevier In the interests of transparency I thought it might prove useful to provide all the details of the retraction process so that the reader could decide the credibility of Elsevier s unilateral decision to retract our paper I don t know how the process used to retract our paper reflects the processes used to retract other papers since I have not studied the retraction issue and this is the first paper I ve had retracted One paper retracted relatively recently with which I have some familiarity was authored by Drs Jessica Rose and Peter McCullough The paper was titled A Report on Myocarditis Adverse Events in the U S Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System VAERS in Association with COVID 19 Injectable Biological Products It was peer reviewed and passed with flying colors The accepted paper was then published in the Elsevier journal Current Problems in Cardiology on 1 October 2021 and unilaterally withdrawn by the journal a couple of weeks later The only explanation given for the withdrawal by Elsevier was the journal is not willing to publish the paper In our case the peer reviewed TR paper was accepted for publication and posted on the TR Website as part of a TR Special Issue on the COVID 19 Pandemic Elsevier decided unilaterally to conduct a re review of all the papers in the TR Special Issue and based on the re review our TR paper was unilaterally retracted on 30 April 2022 During that seven month period of posting our TR paper achieved an Altimetric ranking of 160 20 000 000 the top one thousandth of a percent a metric of media impact I read many hundreds of the Tweets and other media postings on which the Altimetric ranking was based they were overwhelmingly positive including strongly supportive statements from many Ph Ds and M D s The remainder of this OpEd includes the timeline of events which in some sense tells the

on TR Website Expanded Timeline Our peer reviewed TR paper was available online on 14 September 2021 At some point between mid September and mid December 2021 Elsevier unilaterally decided to do a re review of all the papers in the TR Special Issue The re review would be managed by Dr Lawrence Lash who was the previous Editor in Chief EIC of TR and he would be assisted by an independent expert for each of the papers in the TR Special Issue Dr Lash was an Elsevier contractor EIC of another Elsevier journal and had recently received funding from the NIH a strong COVID 19 vaccine promoter and supporter We don t know either the conflicts or the expertise of the independent expert assigned to our TR paper since that person had not been identified I suspect there are conflicts for reasons I mention in the Appendix On 28 February 2022 I received an email from Dr Mihail Grecea Elsevier containing the Official Review Comments from Elsevier s re review of our TR paper on child vaccination and requesting my response to those official comments On 10 March 2022 I sent Dr Grecea my official detailed response to the Elsevier comments shown in Appendix concluding that none of the issues raised by the reviewers justified in any way retraction of our TR paper or even the re review of our TR paper that had occurred On 16 March 2022 Dr Grecea responded as follows The Founding Editor of

and the commissioning organization makes a decision based on the contractor s recommendations However given the low quality of the review as will be seen by the comments in the Appendix I can understand Elsevier s wanting to distance itself as much as possible from the stated decision On 21 March 2022 the TR EIC Dr Tsatsakis resigned as EIC for personal reasons and later that same day Dr Lash was appointed the permanent EIC for TR I cannot emphasize this last point too strongly Dr Lash an Elsevier contractor conducted the re review at Elsevier s request and then was rewarded with the permanent TR EIC position on the same day that the TR EIC resigned This is how Elsevier follows the COPE Guidelines on Ethics and Conflicts of Interest On 30 April 2022 a notice of retraction was posted on our paper s TR Website Overview of Main Issues Addressed in Response to Reviewers The initial section of my response to reviewers shown in the Appendix addressed 1 the ethics of censoring information that could impact life or death COVID 19 vaccination decisions and 2 the myriad conflicts of interest of both the review sponsor Elsevier and the reviewers Dr Lash and the unnamed independent expert My initial comments also identified the apparent expertise gaps of the Elsevier reviewers on some of the technical areas they chose to address and the low technical quality of the review Most interestingly in the technical area where one of the reviewers has demonstrated technical competence toxicology and which was the central thrust of our paper the reviewers offered no comments All their comments were in technical areas where they demonstrated little if any expertise perhaps explaining one reason for the extremely low technical quality of the final re review product Reviewers Main Technical Critiques The Appendix presents in detail our problems with all the technical critiques the reviewers raised and highlights the low technical quality of the review In summary I will address the reviewers three key technical critiques from the Appendix Scope Our paper focused on the detailed toxicology issues associated with the COVID 19 vaccines and is a perfect fit with

match between the theme of our article and the TR Special Issue should have disqualified his participation in the remainder of the review Terminology The Elsevier reviewers objected to our use of the term inoculation instead of vaccination We used the term inoculation rather than vaccine in the TR paper because the substance does not meet the legal definition of a vaccine nor does it function as a vaccine prevent infection prevent viral transmission In fact present data from the UK Canada New Zealand and many other countries show that after six months post inoculation the vaccine recipient enters the stage of negative effectiveness and becomes more vulnerable to COVID 19 infection than the unvaccinated What kind of protection is that The reviewers state that our use of the terms diverges from common use and are incorrect That s an opinion not a technical argument Nowhere do they offer technical reasons showing why the statement is incorrect and why this substance should be called a vaccine That s not a mystery credible evidence of the injected substance acting as a COVID 19 vaccine does not exist Attribution of Cause of Death to COVID 19 The Elsevier reviewers claim we misinterpreted CDC data that showed comorbidities accompanying each death attributed to COVID 19 As shown in the Appendix the CDC essentially admitted that only 5 of the deaths could be uniquely attributed to COVID 19 For the remainder of the deaths there were 4 0 additional conditions or causes per death Thus the attribution of deaths to anyone cause where multiple potential causes were present was completely arbitrary Additionally what the re reviewers failed to mention was that for each hospital patient who could 1 be tagged with COVID 19 by a flawed PCR test and 2 placed on a ventilator the hospital received a payment of 100 000 or more from the government in the USA Thus in a death attribution process that was completely arbitrary for 95 of the deaths attributed to COVID 19 there was a very strong financial incentive to classify deaths in this 95 group as due to COVID 19 In summary based on a highly conflicted re review process that produced a product of extremely low

science and regulatory expertise to protect and enhance the public health through the regulation of biological and related products including among other things vaccines Vaccines are given to about 4 million American infants annually and are not put through the same level of safety testing as new pharmaceuticals One can argue that vaccines which are given to healthy patients should be tested more rigorously than drugs because they are not given to treat an existing disease or condition Inadequate testing ensures that the true risk benefit assessments for the safety and cost of vaccines are impossible to calculate accurately and therefore the FDA is failing to protect the public from preventable vaccine injuries Paul Offit Unwittingly Exposes Scientific Fraud of FDA s Vaccine Licensure Many parents today are naturally concerned about the number of vaccine doses their children are exposed to by following the schedule recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC

vaccine mandates that trample on religious parental and human rights including the precious right to security of person guaranteed by Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights What some Americans may not realize is that the current push for mandates is playing out not just in the U S but in other countries as well reflecting a broader and indeed global agenda Countries such as

coercive power even though research suggests that tougher stances on the part of doctors and public health experts tend to polarize attitudes in the public Australia s 2016 no jab no pay law for example withholds thousands of dollars in childcare subsidies from parents branded as vaccine refusers and some Australian states restrict unvaccinated children s access to child care altogether One

the overblown threat du jour while around the world officials and media keep the public in the dark about the measles vaccine s risks In 2014 the Global Health Security Agenda GHSA formed to elevate global health security as a national and global priority One of the eleven Action Packages to which GHSA stakeholders agreed was an Immunization Action Package that just so happens to use measles

responsibility to respond as one In late 2016 the outgoing President Obama signed an Executive Order that cemented the GHSA as a national presidential level priority and positioned the U S as a committed long term catalyst for executing the partnership s goals At present the GHSA has 67 member countries but taking the concept of an interconnected global network to an entirely new level all sorts of public and private advisory partners are also in on the push for unitary action including various United Nations UN agencies the World Health Organization WHO the World Bank the African Union AU the European Union EU and even somewhat ominously Interpol The GHSA promotes external country level evaluations to assess among other measures steps taken to prevent infectious disease threats with prevention defined as high immunisation coverage and improve surveillance via detection assessment and reporting of public health events The U S was one of the first countries to step up for an assessment conducted in close collaboration by external evaluators and the CDC The CDC head at the time was Thomas Frieden praised by Obama as an expert in preparedness and response to health emergencies but arrested in 2018 on charges of sexual abuse The evaluators gave the U S top scores for measles vaccine coverage and national vaccine access and delivery while awarding lower scores for dynamic listening and rumour management and communication engagement with affected communities Other international initiatives buttress the GHSA including the WHO coordinated International Health Regulations IHR established in 2005 a 196 nation accord to work together for global security and Target 3 8 of the UN s Sustainable Development Goals SDGs which promotes access to essential medicines

efforts With the fortuitous measles headwinds at their back there is little doubt that decision makers view mandated vaccination for school attendance as a winning strategy and that use of this strategy is growing No accident At the end of 2014 the EU made a point of declaring vaccination an important public health tool which the European public health community interpreted as a crucial step to strengthen EU action supporting Member States to implement effective immunization policies and programs With this groundwork laid Italy a G7 member volunteered to spearhead the GHSA s Immunization Action Package and also became one of the first countries to ramp up its own vaccine mandates With massive investments by GlaxoSmithKline in Italy where better to start than on the home front Although a change in government initially delayed implementation of the 2017 compulsory vaccination decree in early 2019 citing a surge in measles cases the government told Italian parents not to bother sending their youngest under age 6 children to school if unvaccinated and promised to impose fines of five hundred euros for older unvaccinated children attending school Likewise in France non vaccinated children cannot be admitted to any kind of collective institutions such as nurseries kindergarten schools or any social activity if they have not complied with the vaccine mandates With the fortuitous measles headwinds at their back there is little doubt that decision makers view mandated vaccination for school attendance as a winning strategy and that use of this strategy is growing The WHO has done its part to help the global effort by placing measles front and center in declaring vaccine hesitancy the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate one of the world s top ten health threats for 2019 Clearly it is game on for those seeking to override national idiosyncracies with a one size fits all global vaccination agenda Legislators who are contemplating new mandates but are still willing to exercise a modicum of independent judgment should recognize that we are in a situation with echoes of WMD there is no international emergency and policy is being hi jacked Here are a handful of critical questions that legislators also should consider First measles symptoms can arise from either wild type measles or vaccine strains and the laboratory testing that is necessary to tell the

unsubstantiated Emergency Use Authorizations EUA subjecting our younger and most vulnerable children to the unnecessary risks of COVID shots We must continue this effort with ongoing education and awareness to parents caregivers and healthcare practitioners who administer COVID shots On Tuesday and Wednesday June 14 and 15 the FDA s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee VRBPAC committee will likely make a catastrophic decision by voting to grant Emergency Use Authorizations EUA to allow infants and young children to receive Pfizer s and Moderna s COVID shots There is no COVID emergency for children They have essentially zero risk of dying from COVID 99 995 recovery rate and the vast majority have little to no symptoms mRNA shots offer little in the way of protection They do not prevent transmission or infection No statistically valid evidence shows that Pfizer and Moderna COVID injections can prevent severe disease or death in children Current mRNA injections were formulated based on the original Wuhan strain and were not tested for benefits against current variants in clinical trials This begs the questions What are they actually trying to accomplish by vaccinating small children What is their ultimate goal Injuries from COVID shots in children are catastrophic These shots have more vaccine injury reports in t he Vaccine Adverse Event

antennas and slow the military fueled Tech Tsunami that has proceeded with zero public input knowledge or consent By Kate Kheel In 1996 when cellphones were just becoming a thing a huge piece of legislation called the Telecommunications Act made its way through Congress Buried under Miscellaneous Provisions near the very end was a tiny clause that would trigger enormous downstream effects by enabling the rapid and largely unregulated proliferation of cell towers and antennas in the U S The clause read No State or local government or instrumentality thereof may regulate the placement construction and modification of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Commission s regulations concerning such emissions Clearly this clause is bad news for the birds bees flora and fauna another article in itself But on its face it doesn t appear particularly problematic for humans However due to the court s interpretation of environmental effects the provision became the lifeblood of the wireless industry and a silent threat that looms beneath nearly every hearing on cell tower approvals in local communities That s because for some reason environmental effects was interpreted in several court cases to include human health From then on if a municipality refused a permit application for a cell tower and cited health impacts from cell towers as the reason the wireless provider sued or threatened to sue the local government to the tune of tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars This despite the thousands of studies showing adverse health consequences for humans from wireless radiation including comprehensive studies from the U S government dating back decades Health effects include increased cancer risk cellular stress harmful free radicals DNA damage reduced fertility learning and memory deficits attention deficit

video streaming smart cities surveillance cameras and the Internet of Things 5G requires vastly more towers many of which are butting up to homes and schools Though dubbed small cells these antennas employ a wider range of frequencies and carry far more data making them arguably more bioactive than larger towers When people see these small cells moving into their neighborhoods they understandably set out to oppose them But they can t It is not allowed because Section 704 of the Telecommunications Act stripped state and local governments of their rights to do so So now nearly 30 years later

liberty and commerce Bill Gates announced on his blog that the world would only return to normal when almost every person on the planet has been vaccinated against coronavirus Though a safe and effective COVID 19 vaccine had not yet been developed Gates had already decided this theoretical technology was humanity s only hope During the year that followed the world s governments acted in lockstep to inject all of humanity with a new generation of experimental mRNA gene therapy shots Even after evidence emerged that these so called vaccines did not prevent infection governments continued to insist that everyone receive them The injection was portrayed as the savior and liberator of humanity Astute observers perceived that the vaccine and the global movement to get all of humanity to receive it resembled a proselytizing religion The gospel of this new religion was that the new shot offered salvation Those who rejected it were doomed to ostracism disease and death Why this book is unlike any other Vaccine propagandists often proclaim that they follow the science but most vaccine development has been a matter of guesses gambles and wild experimentation Its key figures have been biased by religious faith wishful thinking ideology and a desire for recognition and money Though some vaccines deserve credit for reducing infectious disease morbidity and mortality

convictions The Founders envisioned a nation where religious people and institutions are free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or hostility from the government To safeguard this principle the executive branch has committed to vigorously enforcing the robust protections for religious liberty enshrined in federal law However the policies of New York California Connecticut and Maine directly undermine this right by targeting conscience protections and denying parents the ability to direct the upbringing and education of their children in accordance with their faith While 46 states allow religious exemptions to childhood vaccination requirements for school attendance the four states at issue permit only medical exemptions and even then in name only directly discriminating against families of faith Education is compulsory in every state so parents face potential referrals to child protective agencies fines court proceedings or even criminal charges despite schools blocking their child s access over vaccination status This denial forces religious parents into three untenable options 1 vaccinate their children against their sincerely held religious beliefs with eternal consequences 2 homeschool which is impractical for most due to work financial or educational constraints or 3 relocate to a state that respects religious freedom a choice burdened by career financial and family obligations These oftenimpossible choices have led to profound consequences for children and families in these states Since 2015 in California 2019 in New York and Maine and 2021 in Connecticut significant numbers of children have faced substantial challenges due to restricted access to education These challenges have impacted their academic progress social development and emotional well being particularly during critical developmental years The long term consequences of disrupted educational opportunities are profound and in many cases irreversible These policies violate the U S Constitution and contradict the liberty our Founding Fathers fought to protect The urgency of addressing these violations is underscored by widespread religious objections to vaccination as evidenced by millions of evangelicals who as reported by the New York Times decline certain vaccinations due to deeply held spiritual convictions These beliefs shared by many within faith communities highlight the significance of this issue to the Commission s mandate Yet liberal courts in Democrat controlled states like New York and California dismiss such convictions For

immediate action to restore religious liberty Religious objections to vaccination are diverse individualized and deeply rooted in faith and they include but are in no way limited to Viewing the body as God s temple sacred and inviolable by foreign substances Trusting in divine protection over human medical intervention Ethical concerns about vaccines developed using aborted fetal cell lines which may suggest acceptance of abortion and supporting companies that use aborted fetal cell lines Beliefs that injecting DNA fragments from aborted fetuses is impure or unclean Objections to vaccines for sexually transmitted diseases which may imply condoning premarital sex The view that injecting disease to prevent disease is ungodly Adherence to halal dietary laws that conflict with vaccine

their families beliefs denying them access to education a fundamental right essential to their development and participation in a pluralistic democracy Some of the most severe violations of religious liberty have occurred in New York State where strict vaccination policies without religious exemptions have disproportionately affected conservative Jewish and Amish communities barring them from attending even their own faith based schools and deepening their marginalization This pattern of religious hostility extends beyond schools as doctors offices in these states and increasingly across

pledged to keep after Fauci Boyle said high risk pathogen research contravened the bioweapons act he authored and likely contributed to the COVID 19 pandemic Boyle argued that such labs should be shut down immediately and effectively and that otherwise there is going to be another leak In 2006 Boyle represented residents of a low income Boston neighborhood who opposed the construction of a high risk biological research laboratory in the area At that time we argued that the BSL 4 biosafety level 4 would engage in existentially dangerous biological warfare research and that was even before

function research which involves the genetic alteration of an organism to enhance its biological functions and which may have led to the development of the SARS CoV 2 virus should be banned All so called gain of function research both public and private should be terminated immediately and criminalized expressly by name Boyle told The Defender in September 2024 In January 2020 Boyle warned governments and public health authorities that COVID 19 was an engineered bioweapon My intention for doing this was to alert all governments in the world and public health authorities that what humanity was dealing with here was an existentially dangerous biological warfare weapon that must be treated as such and not some animal virus that had somehow miraculously jumped out of the Wuhan wet

pandemic treaty and amendments to the International Health Regulations IHR Boyle said these legal changes would threaten national sovereignty and health and medical freedom In May 2023 Boyle told The Defender the WHO s proposed instruments were an attempt to take over the United States of America by using the WHO as a front for that purpose Boyle argued that the proposals were meant to go beyond just the realm of international public health These proposals marked the first time that globalists spent an enormous amount of time effort money and brainpower to construct a worldwide totalitarian police state under the guise of protecting public health Boyle told The Defender in May 2024 Dr Meryl Nass founder of Door to Freedom said Boyle was instrumental in the defeat of the pandemic treaty last year and the watering down of the WHO s proposed IHR amendments She said Francis was the first person to blow the whistle on the WHO s Pandemic Treaty and IHR amendments revealing that the

California resident Lenka Kabilka noticed construction noise on the roof of her apartment complex she investigated Kabilka learned that a cell site base station was being installed right above her apartment by Starry Inc a new startup wireless company deploying its new millimeter wave 5G technology By Lenka Kabilka Back in late November of 2020 my life changed my health was taken away and my fight began It all started when I noticed construction noise on the roof of our apartment complex directly above my apartment I have enjoyed living in my rental apartment for the past 30 years with my two sons I generally do not pay much attention when construction within our apartment complex is going on However this time since we were in the middle of the COVID 19 lockdowns and my job restricted me to working from home the loud construction work was something I could not ignore I found out that a cell site base station was being installed right above my apartment by Starry Inc I had never heard of this company so I looked them up on the web and learned it was a new startup wireless company deploying its new millimeter wave 5G technology I did not think much of it until the site was activated and the horror started I could hear a nonstop high pitched electrical sound which was most noticeable at night not allowing me to get any sleep The sound was so torturous that I developed headaches and ringing in my ears which did not go away The term brain fog previously unknown to me was constant There was this unavoidable tension within my body when I was inside my apartment This tension was accompanied by unusual inner discomfort and pain signaling that something was very wrong I experienced vision issues of white light flashing and extreme dryness of my eyes I also developed sharp brain pains lasting for days I frequently experienced spontaneous facial muscle spasms even spasms in my legs and arms not due to any physical activity I also experienced heart palpitations and terrible joint pain started to interfere with my physical activities just walking became painful I often felt out of breath and was gasping for air for no apparent reason something I later learned was oxidative stress I could not work out or swim anymore Often I felt like I was going to have a heart attack I called an ambulance on several occasions and doctor visits became more frequent When my two

that my landlord would help soon as my symptoms were getting worse with each passing day My older son started to sleep in his car as there was no other option for him and I occasionally resorted to sleeping at my workplace on a sofa in a conference room and at times in my car Our family started to be torn apart we did not enjoy being at home and our occasional time together was filled with constant worries about where to sleep where to eat work and do homework I was desperate I approached my landlord from the very beginning and expressed my concern over this installation but was assured that everything is permitted and in accordance with the law and Federal Communications Commission FCC regulations I became helpless and scared of my rapidly deteriorating health Before this installation I was at the top of my health very active swimming daily hiking and exercising I rarely would see a doctor Now left with permanent eye damage hearing issues and electromagnetic sensitivity EMS or EHS now known as Electromagnetic Radiation Syndrome or EMR Syndrome Since my landlord did not come forward with a solution I contacted the city to see if they could help Upon further research it became clear that the cell site had no permits on the city s record and that our local zoning code strictly prohibits these wireless sites from being located in residential areas I became hopeful that this would be resolved in no time I urged the city to take charge and investigate this illegal installation It took over 10 months for the city to open its investigation I provided the city with evidence that the wireless company Starry operated with an FCC Experimental Radio License experimenting in high 37 40 gigahertz The company s transmitting equipment was not even authorized or licensed by the FCC It was a prototype and such a license prohibits commercial operation This unregulated site should never have been allowed to be installed and operating within any

of a court judgment to cancel the lease agreement at the site Some of the equipment was removed but some still remains on site still operating today and without permits Starry went through restructuring and is now back up and operating at the site The city just recently reopened its investigation We are approaching the fifth year of this illegal activity with the city s inability to act on its own laws The landlord s unlawful actions and the city s inaction and inability to enforce its own laws and regulations to stop such illegal operation and to protect the public from harm for the past five years is just despicable No one should go through this ordeal I am aware of other individuals and families who are going through a similar scenario It s appalling to realize that there is no legal justice to fall back on When foreign dignitaries experiencing Havana Syndrome during a visit to a foreign country are considered victims of a targeted attack the media pay attention to those affected and authorities immediately investigate Yet when the same thing is happening in our own country caused by known and identifiable sources causing victims to suffer the same health issues and worse we are left with no help or justice often ridiculed and ignored Something is terribly wrong I filed a lawsuit against my landlord and the city and am awaiting trial I hope that soon we ll get

Share Share Options Copy Link Email Facebook X Twitter Telegram LinkedIn Alaskans Join Forces With CHD to Fight Giant Cell Tower in Residential Area Sitka for Safe Tech a legal and advocacy group on the remote Alaska island of Sitka has teamed up with Children s Health Defense s Stop 5G initiative to prevent the installation of a proposed 120 foot wireless broadband tower in Sitka s residential zone By Sitka for Safe Tech Sitka Alaska is a remote island town of 8 500 nestled in Southeast Alaska s rugged rainforest along the shores of Baranof Island It has spectacular scenery wildlife and tight knit neighborhoods But its peaceful residential character is under threat Tidal Network a subsidiary of the Tlingit Haida Tribal Business Corporation has proposed installing six new wireless broadband towers across Sitka One of these would be a 120 foot cell tower in a residential R 1 zone where local law caps structure height at 35 feet The site is located in the Hillside Subdivision just feet from neighboring homes and a designated landslide zone that regularly gets hit with high winds and heavy rain Residents living within 500 feet of the tower received a letter from the City Borough of Sitka s Planning Department about the project only days before the Planning and Zoning Commission vote took place The letter informed the residents that Tidal Network had applied for a variance to waive the height restriction of 35 feet placed on cell towers in R 1 zones as specified by Sitka s municipal code Alarmed by the proposal the neighborhood mobilized immediately Residents formed Sitka for Safe Tech with legal and advocacy support from Children s Health Defense s Stop 5G initiative The team at Stop 5G have been invaluable in helping us navigate the complicated legal predicament we found ourselves in said Hal Spackman one of the founders of Sitka for Safe Tech as they work to keep their neighborhood healthy and free from unwanted and unnecessary communications structures They researched the risks wrote letters and testified at the meeting successfully convincing the commission to unanimously deny the variance despite the city staff s recommendation to approve it They are now fighting to prevent what would be one of the tallest structures in Sitka from going up in their backyard While Sitka s municipal code is currently lacking a protective wireless ordinance Sitka for Safe Tech is simultaneously pushing for permanent reform In response Tidal Network appealed the decision to Sitka s Assembly Four of six assembly members recused themselves due to

Appropriations Committee is scheduled to meet on Tuesday July 22 to vote on the Appropriations Bill which contains extremely troubling provisions quietly added into the proposed legislation These provisions are designed to shield the chemical industry from liability from harms to farmers and consumers while restricting the Environmental Protection Administration s EPA ability to protect citizens from harmful exposures Section 453 was added to the bill to block the government from taking action on health concerns if they differ in any way from the EPA s most recent health assessments however outdated and inadequate they may be The EPA and other agencies would be required to perform new assessments that could take four to 12 years even if new science shows harm and even if the original assessment was found to be based on fraud If passed Section 453 will strip farmers and consumers from their ability to seek damages against chemical manufacturers from injury and death when these companies fail to disclose potential harms occurring from exposure to their products Congresswoman Chellie Pingree has introduced an amendment to strike Section 453 from the bill This amendment

have options and filing a vaccine exemption is one of them by Reform Pharma Team As a new school year begins the mainstream media is putting parents on notice that their children need to be vaccinated to attend or remain in school Meanwhile the government is sinking millions of dollars into back to school vaccination campaigns as measles headlines create fear and prop up vaccination as the supposed solution to a benign childhood illness that hasn t seen triple digits since the 1990s Unless you live in states like Tennessee Montana or Iowa that have passed or are considering legislation to require schools to include information about exemptions in their communications to parents about immunizations you ve probably received a letter from the school that left you with the idea that your child could be excluded unless you sign on to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC untested vaccination schedule The CDC has an active back to school vaccination campaign complete with promotional materials such as graphics print resources and social media posts ironically targeting measles to increase vaccination rates and provides resources for schools to use to remind parents of the vaccination requirements for school entry without information about vaccine exemptions If parents didn t know better they might think they have no other option but to acquiesce to an out of

While hiring an attorney is an option filing your own vaccine exemption is straightforward and something you can easily do yourself with a little help Find out which vaccine exemptions are allowed in your state The first step in filing a vaccine exemption is to determine which exemptions are allowed in your state All 50 states offer medical vaccine exemptions although some have made it equally difficult to obtain them Religious exemptions are allowed in all states except New York West Virginia Maine Vermont Connecticut and California and roughly 16 states offer philosophical vaccine

exemptions are allowed in all states except New York West Virginia Maine Vermont Connecticut and California and roughly 16 states offer philosophical vaccine exemptions For a detailed overview of the exemptions available in each state refer to this visual by the National Vaccine Information Center NVIC There are three types of vaccine exemptions A philosophical vaccine exemption also known as a personal belief exemption allows individuals to opt out of vaccine requirements based on their personal moral or ethical beliefs This type of exemption is generally the easiest to obtain as it does not require adherence to any specific religious doctrine Instead it is based solely on personal convictions such as ethical considerations individual rights or a general opposition to vaccines A medical vaccine exemption is granted when an individual has a specific medical condition or contraindication that makes receiving a vaccine unsafe for their health These exemptions are based on guidelines from medical authorities and require documentation from a healthcare provider A religious vaccine exemption permits individuals to forgo vaccines due to sincerely held religious beliefs Unlike philosophical exemptions religious exemptions are grounded in specific religious doctrines or personal interpretations of religious teachings that oppose vaccination States that allow religious exemptions typically require a written statement or affidavit explaining the religious objections In some cases a signature from a spiritual leader may be necessary In other states parents may be required to have their religious exemption form signed by a healthcare provider Ask your child s school for their exemption policy Once you ve confirmed that your state offers religious exemptions ask the school if they have a policy or handbook with their immunization requirements If your school or state requires a vaccine exemption form make sure it simply acknowledges your right to request a religious exemption or recites the state s law for exemption requests A form should never require a parent to admit to being negligent for not vaccinating their child Public schools are generally required to comply with state laws including those that mandate the allowance of religious vaccine exemptions This means your child cannot be deprived of their right to a free education for not being vaccinated Therefore it s crucial to know your state s laws and include the legal authority in any exemption you file With public schools the challenge often lies not in filing the exemption but in navigating the school s process for evaluating exemption requests Schools may require documentation a formal statement of your religious beliefs or implement a review process that complicates obtaining the exemption Whether private schools must allow religious exemptions varies by state and institution Some states have legislated that their vaccine exemptions apply across the board to

resident Title 77 of the Illinois Administrative Code Chapter 1 Subchapter i Part 665 Section 665 510 gives me the legal right as a parent to object to my child s immunizations on religious grounds and applies to any public private or parochial school or a preschool program operated by an elementary or secondary school or institution of higher learning Here s an example of what this might look like for a Michigan resident According to the Michigan Compiled Laws Section 333 9215 a child is exempt from vaccination requirements if a guardian or person in loco parentis of the child presents a written statement to the administrator of the child s school or operator of the group program to the effect that the vaccination requirements cannot be met because of religious convictions or other objection to immunization Here s another example of what this might look like for a North Carolina resident According to G S 130A 157 if the bona fide religious beliefs of an adult or the parent guardian or person in loco parentis of a child are contrary to the immunization requirements the adult or the child shall be exempt from the requirements Upon submission of a written statement of the bona fide religious beliefs and opposition to the immunization requirements the person may attend the college university school or facility without presenting a certificate of immunization More simply

your explanation or argument Center your request around sincerely held religious beliefs A common mistake when writing a religious exemption is focusing on arguments unrelated to religion Under no circumstances should your religious exemption be centered around a vaccine injury story safety studies vaccine adverse events bodily autonomy vaccine ingredients or moral and ethical issues It is well known that during the COVID 19 pandemic federal employers especially and schools were encouraged to use religious exemption forms with a series of questions designed to trip up a requester so that their argument would center around moral or ethical arguments that would give the institution grounds for denial Some states explicitly note that general philosophical or moral reluctance to allow immunizations does not provide a sufficient basis for an exemption to vaccination requirements Your exemption request should entirely focus on your sincerely held religious beliefs or there s a high likelihood it will be denied In other words you must make a faith based argument At the same time avoid making denominational arguments that could weaken your case For instance don t attempt to argue that a particular denomination does not support vaccinations and base your sincerely held beliefs on that denomination Chances are there is authority showing that at least in some cases it does support vaccinations Over the years vaccine enthusiasts have worked very hard to get the endorsements of large denominations and then when someone identifies as that particular denomination the reviewer denies the exemption citing some sort of statement showing that the denomination that person identifies as supports vaccination However a religious objection doesn t have to be directed by the tenets of an established religious organization In other words denomination is irrelevant unless you make it relevant You have the right to a religious exemption and it should be based on your personal subjective religious convictions not the official stance of any religious organization Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Know your rights If your religious exemption

last two decades The most common examples include asthma ADHD and prediabetes which develops into full diabetes over time leading to an increased risk of heart disease nerve damage and kidney failure In the U S nearly 1 in 3 children lives with these chronic conditions If you think this issue only impacts their childhood think again children do not outgrow these health challenges but actually carry them into adulthood Chronic health conditions in kids are rising faster than you think A recent study published in Academic Pediatrics examined how chronic health conditions in children and young adults have changed in the U S from 1999 to 2018 Conducted by researchers from Harvard Medical School the study focused on conditions that begin in childhood and continue into adulthood Their goal was to show how big the problem has become which conditions are rising the fastest and how these health burdens affect both children and society at large Researchers studied a large diverse group

damage and improves outcomes Lauren Wisk assistant professor of medicine at UCLA and the study s lead author said Most youth with chronic conditions need to access health and social services for the rest of their lives but our health system is not set up to successfully move young people from pediatric to adult focused care and so many of these youth are at risk of disengaging with care and experiencing disease exacerbations We should invest in assisting these youth in engaging appropriately with healthcare across their lifespan in order to protect their health and well being and to facilitate their maximum participation in society with respect to education vocation social groups and community spaces What s triggering the rising autism and ADHD rates According to Autism Parenting

and lack of access to healthy habits from the start If you feel overwhelmed don t be There are strategies to help your child avoid becoming part of these statistics I ve put together five steps you use right now to reduce risk and support their long term health 1 Clean up your child s diet and remove inflammatory foods Eliminate processed foods seed oils and anything made with high amounts of processed sugar Start cooking simple meals at home with animal based proteins grass fed butter ghee root vegetables white rice and whole fruits If your child has gut issues or food sensitivities start with easily digestible carbs like white rice and whole fruits Avoid store bought sauces and packaged snacks that are filled with chemicals and hidden industrial fats If you are not sure what s safe use this rule If it comes in a box with marketing on the front don t buy it 2 Reduce exposure to environmental toxins If you live in a polluted city or near industrial areas filter your indoor air

Air pollution is another likely factor A systematic review of 801 studies revealed prenatal exposure to particulate matter 2 5 PM2 5 air pollution is linked to a heightened risk of ADHD PM2 5 air pollution refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 2 5 micrometers or smaller These fine particles are small enough to be inhaled deeply into your lungs The study also revealed a connection between ADHD and postnatal air pollution exposure underlining the potential neurodevelopmental harms from early exposure to these pollutants According to the study Research demonstrates that prenatal and early life exposure to pollutants can adversely affect brain volume and cognitive functions leading to increased behavioral problems Specifically exposure to PM2 5 during pregnancy is associated with reduced white matter in the brain s left hemisphere which may increase the risk of ADHD symptoms Despite the profound implications of air pollutant exposure on neurodevelopment potentially resulting in severe lifelong disabilities its recognition remains limited often referred to as a silent killer Phthalates linked to attention and behavioral disorders Ubiquitous exposure to phthalates found in everything from food packaging to personal care products is also putting children s brain development at risk according to Project TENDR Targeting Environmental Neuro Development Risks a collaboration of scientists health professionals and advocates for children and the environment The group was formed in 2015 due to concerns that toxic environmental chemicals were playing a role in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism attention deficits hyperactivity intellectual disability and learning disorders In their April briefing paper for delegates they call for policy reforms to protect the developing brains of children from the harmful effects of toxic chemicals in plastics including phthalates Regarding the chemicals the paper notes Phthalates are not chemically bound to the products that contain them and readily migrate into dust food and the environment The class of ortho phthalates has been clearly established as neurotoxic including di 2ethylhexyl phthalate DEHP

Electromagnetic fields EMFs are the cigarettes of the 21st century and most people are being exposed 24 hours a day Most of the radiation emits from cellphones cell towers computers smart meters and Wi Fi to name just a few of the culprits Exposure causes serious mitochondrial dysfunction due to free radical damage Among the most common consequences of chronic EMF exposure to your brain may be chronic conditions like ADHD Martin Pall Ph D also discovered a previously unknown mechanism of biological harm from microwaves emitted by cellphones and other wireless technologies via voltage gated calcium channels VGCCs embedded in your cell membranes VGCCs are found in high concentrations in the brain and research involving animals has shown that even low levels of microwave EMFs can have significant and varied effects on the brain Studies suggest that when these VGCCs are activated by EMFs it can lead to a range of neuropsychiatric effects At least 26 studies have linked EMFs to neuropsychiatric effects and five specific criteria have been used to demonstrate that this relationship is causal meaning EMFs can cause these effects An association between exposure to magnetic field MF nonionizing radiation during pregnancy and increased risk of ADHD has also been reported While it s nearly impossible to avoid EMF exposure completely there are practical ways to limit it Exposure to multiple vaccines in childhood may also be involved Dr Paul Thomas whose medical license was suspended due to his advocacy for informed consent regarding vaccinations along with James Lyons Weiler from the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge IPAK conducted a study comparing the health of vaccinated and unvaccinated children Their findings revealed that vaccinated children experienced significantly higher instances of various health issues including behavioral issues Notably among the 561 unvaccinated children none were diagnosed with ADHD whereas 0 063 of children who

key role in the development of neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD In a study published in the journal Cell researchers with the University of Florida study tracked a group of Swedish children from birth over a 20 year period to identify factors that might influence whether they develop a neurodevelopmental disorder They collected extensive data from early in the children s lives using detailed questionnaires about infections antibiotic use stress prenatal conditions and family health history They also analyzed biological markers such as metabolites in umbilical cord blood and stool types of body cell proteins and gut bacteria Notably the research connected changes in gut bacteria to neurodevelopmental disorders and identified early signs of mood and digestive problems Infants who went on to develop these conditions were deficient in many bacteria known to promote gut health including Akkermansia Bifidobacterium Ruminococcus and Faecalibacterium The study also revealed that children who had three or more ear infections treated with penicillin from the time they were born until age 5 were at increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to those in the control group

in 2021 that found fully vaccinated children were 20 8 times more likely to be diagnosed with ADD ADHD compared with their unvaccinated counterparts The study used a survey based instrument but all cases of ADD ADHD were verified using medical chart abstraction Hooker said Hooker told The Defender It is difficult to narrow down a single mechanism for the connection between ADHD and vaccine components although mercury and aluminum are both neurotoxins But the neuroinflammation that occurs especially from early childhood vaccines does create a condition where brain immune cells astrocytes and microglia are in a constant state of immune activation causing damage to neurons Wave of new studies link ADHD to toxic exposures In a paper published May 24 in the journal Surgical Neurology International Dr Russell Blaylock a retired neurosurgeon expanded on Hooker s thesis He showed that aluminum exposure from foods chemical exposures pharmaceuticals and vaccines induced immunoexcitoxicity in the brain and spinal cord resulting in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders This mechanism involves activation of the brain s innate immune system primarily the microglia astrocytes and macrophages with a release of neurotoxic concentrations of excitotoxins and proinflammatory cytokines chemokines and immune mediators Blaylock wrote A study published In March in the Journal of Xenobiotics found that parental exposure to toxic chemicals resulted in an increased risk of ADHD and autism in their children A study published in January in Frontiers in Public Health found that prenatal and early childhood exposure to pyrethroid insecticides were associated with increased risks of ADHD autism and endocrine disruption In April The U S Environmental

million kids not getting any form of treatment The study investigated the current state of ADHD treatment among U S children focusing on medication and behavioral interventions Despite the

children were taking ADHD medication a decrease from the 62 reported in the 2016 NSCH The study authors propose several reasons for this decline including potential disruptions in healthcare access during the COVID 19 pandemic and reported shortages of ADHD medications in 2022 Behavioral treatment rates remained relatively stable with 44 4 of children with current ADHD having received behavioral treatment in the past year compared to 46 7 in 2016 However when considering a broader definition that included any mental health treatment or counseling the percentage of children receiving

Martin Kulldorff of the CDC s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices takes a step by step look at how the National Institutes of Health failed during the COVID 19 pandemic and what can be done to ensure such mistakes don t happen again You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Martin Kulldorff Ph D Abstract Both scientists and the public are frustrated with the scientific enterprise Scientists spend considerable amounts of time writing grants that are not funded The publication process is tedious There is a lack of open scientific discourse leading to questionable medical and public health practices and an increasingly distrustful public Change is needed and this perspective presents a blueprint for the National Institutes of Health NIH reforms with the dual goal of ensuring scientific integrity and innovation which is needed to restore trust among the American public who generously fund NIH through their taxes Introduction The NIH failed us during the COVID 19 pandemic by advocating for unscientific school closures lockdowns masking and vaccine mandates and by stifling scientific debate NIH used to have broad support from the public across the political spectrum but that ended during the pandemic For the progress of science and the scientific community it is critical to restore that broad support The key is a return to innovative and evidence based medicine and for that eight things are needed i Allowing scientists to do what they view as their most innovative research concerning the most important health issues ii More large sample size reproducible research iii Efficient use of financial resources iv Efficient use of the precious time of scientists v Thorough peer review evaluation of funded research vi Open scientific discourse and the restoration of academic freedom vii Decentralization of science viii Elimination of both actual and perceived conflicts of interest To help achieve that here is a proposed 12 point program for major reforms at the NIH 1 Investigator initiated research grants The core NIH activity is the funding of investigator initiated extramural research at universities hospitals and other research institutes across the country with the Research Project R01 as the primary mechanism NIH funds many excellent and important research projects but it is an inefficient system with six major problems i Scientists must write between two and a dozen grant applications for every funded grant received Writing unfunded research proposals is a waste of effort That time is better spent on doing actual research ii Among the many grants submitted by a scientist it is not always what they view as their best grant applications that get funded This means that scientists spend a lot of time on what they themselves view as less innovative and important research iii With NIH funding the time between conceiving a research idea and", "chunk_id":

that get funded This means that scientists spend a lot of time on what they themselves view as less innovative and important research iii With NIH funding the time between conceiving a research idea and receiving funding to start the actual research is at least one year but usually more This slows down scientific progress iv Research grants are evaluated and funded based on what scientists promise to do in proposals submitted to NIH but it is more difficult to judge the quality of proposed research compared to research that has been completed and published v When writing grants scientists face a dilemma They must include enough data and results to convince the reviewers that the research is promising without already doing major parts of the work This forces scientists to conduct many small underpowered preliminary studies of limited value The need for existing evidence and promise is also detrimental to the most innovative and breakthrough research which tends to be riskier vi While scientists must send progress reports to NIH there is not sufficient and open evaluation to determine the quality of NIH funded research articles Proposal No 1 To give scientists the freedom to do the research they consider most innovative and promising grants should be awarded based on evaluation of their three best first authored articles published during the past five years rather than promises about proposed future work If scientists have done excellent research in the past they will continue to do excellent research and this system will allow scientists to quickly pursue interesting new ideas It also means less time spent on grant writing and more time spent on research To ensure funding for a wide range of research areas scientists would specify their area of research such as genetics diabetes treatment or cancer epidemiology and each area would have a defined amount of NIH research dollars to distribute to the scientists in that area To ensure research collaboration there should be a maximum amount of the grant that can be used for the principal investigator s salary NIH already has some funding opportunities along these lines which can easily be expanded If there are doubts about this new approach one option is to let universities choose between the old and this new system Dr Vinay Prasad has argued that different NIH grant award mechanisms should be put to the same rigorous scientific evaluation as science itself by randomizing scientists or universities to different grant systems With that philosophy universities could be randomized to

comparative evaluation of research results 2 Training grants for young scientists It is more important than ever that NIH provides K01 training grants for young scientists who do not yet have the credentials to compete for regular grants The current process is inefficient though After finishing their studies prospective young scientists must first apply for a junior position at an institution Once hired they often spend their first year writing a K award proposal which may or may not be funded after being evaluated by scientists at other universities Whether eventually funded or not their careers are delayed Proposal No 2 NIH should allocate a certain number of five year training grants to each medical dental and public health school in the U S trusting them with finding the best young scientists to recruit and letting them immediately start the research they want to pursue Each medical school would receive at least one new training grant every year while additional awards depend on the evaluation of research articles by recently supported trainees To avoid academic inbreeding and ensure competitiveness and excellence training awards should be used to recruit young scientists educated at other institutions 3 Scientific publications and peer review Scientific peer review is critically important but it is an inefficient and secretive process The scientific publication process is slow frustrating and time consuming for scientists Even good articles may have to be submitted and resubmitted to multiple journals before they are published Reviewers do their important work for free leading to a wide variety in peer review quality Most bad research is eventually published somewhere getting the stamp of approval as gold standard peer reviewed research but readers are unable to read any of the critical reviews Scientific publishing is also very expensive for taxpayers It has been estimated that roughly 1 5 billion of the annual 48 billion NIH budget goes to the scientific publishing industry rather than to scientists doing science both through indirect grant charges used by university libraries for expensive journal subscriptions and through journal publication fees Compared to preprint servers like medRxiv the only added value provided by these journals is peer review but neither NIH nor the public can read the peer reviews they are paying for

increasingly sophisticated public wants open access to medical research both for themselves and for their physicians so that they can make informed decisions about medical treatment and prevention The previous NIH director Dr Monica Bertagnolli ordered that all NIH funded research must be published using open access so that it can be freely read by anyone That is a great step forward but more is needed Proposal No 3 To enhance open evaluation of scientific research NIH should require all funded research to be published in open peer reviewed journals where signed reviews can be freely read by anyone at the same time as the article is published While NIH cannot force journals to pay reviewers NIH institutes can set up an open peer review journal where any of their funded research can be published in less than a month and where reviewers are paid 1 000 for each review For NIH funded research published in other journals NIH should organize pay for and publish independent peer reviews by a roster of methodologically astute scientists There are a few open peer review journals including the British Medical Journal and eLife but none that pay reviewers As proof of concept the newly launched Journal of the Academy of Public Health does both Open peer review is not only important for NIH to be able to evaluate the quality of the research it funds It also enhances open scientific discourse while giving reviewers public recognition and a citable reference for their important work Especially young scientists benefit from reading an open exchange between more senior scientists 4 Systematic reviews It is important for NIH to not only fund original research but also the consolidation of existing knowledge in systematic reviews What is the best prostate cancer treatment Do the benefits of tonsillectomy surgery outweigh the risks Should we use aluminum preservatives in vaccines Do face masks reduce or increase infections Can selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs

mantle from the faltering Cochrane collaboration NIH could fund rigorous evidence based Atlas Reviews on important clinical and public health topics Coordinated by NIH staff an external research team would first be funded to write an evidence based systematic review based on the available literature In a second step NIH convenes a meeting where the systematic review is presented and openly discussed by scientists with different perspectives To avoid conflicts of interest it is important that all participants are independent scientists without industry funding Funding scientists to engage in such open scientific discussions is just as important as paying them to do original research The result of these Atlas Reviews may be either a consensus statement or well articulated divergent views among the participants The latter is not necessarily a failure but would inform NIH of high priority research areas that need to be funded through its requests for proposals mechanism RFPs 5 Large long term research studies As scientists we conduct too many research studies with too small sample sizes that cannot give reliable effect estimates to determine if an intervention is working or not This is a major problem and a significant contributor to the reproducibility crisis in medical research Important and reliable discoveries are most likely to come from long term large sample size studies such as the Framingham Heart Study which started in 1948 and the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian PLCO Cancer Screening Trial Such large reliable studies are desperately needed for cancer cardiovascular disease auto immune diseases mental health children s chronic diseases and vaccines among other areas using both observational and randomized study designs Proposal No 5 NIH should fund more long term observational and randomized studies with large sample sizes Because of extensive investments and logistical challenges they cannot be confined or controlled by a single research group With one group responsible for study design data collection and data management the collected data should be available for any scientist to analyze and interpret When different scientists ask questions from the same data this set up can result in multiple research groups publishing similar study results around the same time While this is a departure from current practices it would be a good thing If different scientists come to similar conclusions using different analyses that strengthens the evidence If they come to different conclusions despite using the same data that sets the stage for an important scientific discussion", "chunk_id":

stage for an important scientific discussion and while that could be viewed as confusing it is better than having only one of those studies published To be confident in scientific results they must be reproducible and that includes reproducibility of different scientists coming to the same or similar conclusions when using the same data 6 Open data and public domain Publications by NIH scientists are automatically in the public domain but that is not true for other NIH products nor for NIH funded scientists outside NIH It is especially important to make all publicly funded research data public so that research can be scrutinized and reproduced by other scientists Proposal No 6 All data generated by NIH grants should be in the public domain and made available to other scientists For large projects described above access should be immediately available once the data has been collected and quality checked For regular investigator initiated projects the data should be made available at the time when the investigator publishes research using the data All other NIH funded products including scientific discoveries and software should also be in the public domain 7 Institutional Overhead In addition to its direct costs of personnel and equipment successful research also depends on institutional support such as a building to work in computing resources a good university library scientific discussions and administrative support To pay for such overhead institutions charge NIH indirect costs as a percentage on top of the direct grant money The percentage varies widely among different universities and research institutes For example the indirect rate negotiated by Harvard s Brigham and Women s Hospital in Boston is 79 while it is only 47 at the University of Maine If there are two equally meritorious grant applications American taxpayers get more value for the money if the one with the lower indirect percentage is funded Instead institutions that can show that their overhead costs are larger have been rewarded with a higher percentage and more money determined by a separate bureaucratic negotiation process with each institution Universities operating more efficiently have received less money Those efficient institutions should instead be rewarded by letting them use overhead funds for additional research projects of their own choice Many grants include investigators from multiple institutions For a portion of such a grant both the primary recipient institution and the subcontracting institutions are allowed to charge overhead at their standard rate

Institutions would report how much of it is used for buildings libraries departmental support services internally funded research projects scientific meetings discussions and university administration with a strict upper limit on the latter Overhead double dipping must end so that institutions only charge indirect costs on their own direct costs 8 Academic freedom and open scientific discourse During the pandemic former NIH Director Francis Collins denoted those who disagreed with him as fringe epidemiologists requesting a devastating published takedown rather than encouraging and organizing open scientific discourse about contentious scientific topics As a result the U S ended up with one of the highest excess mortality rates during the pandemic while Sweden which famously followed basic principles of public health had the lowest excess mortality rate among major Western countries Rather than orchestrating devastating takedowns NIH should actively promote open scientific discussions about important health topics Intense and passionate scientific debate should be encouraged The scientific community cannot control what the general public writes on social media but as scientists we should always listen to each other and engage in polite and respectful scientific discussions Science is universal and science needs the best talents whoever provides it Institutions that receive NIH research grants should promote academic freedom open discourse and not discriminate based on for example gender skin color ethnicity religion sexual preferences political beliefs disability or health preferences If an institution cannot uphold these basic academic values that are fundamental for the progress of science individual scientists should still be funded but institutional overhead should not be provided on NIH grants Proposal No 8 A small part of the institute s overhead on grants say 1 could be used to enhance open scientific discourse at universities and other grant receiving institutions Institutions that receive indirect overhead from taxpayer funded grants should be required to uphold academic freedom with no discrimination based on gender skin

pandemic should be rectified 9 Scientists at NIH There are important intramural research programs conducted by in house NIH scientists These research groups can quickly pursue important research as they do not have to write research grants and wait for approval by NIH review panels In other ways they are more restricted For example their research requires internal clearance before it can be submitted for publication Proposal No 9 Scientists at NIH should have academic freedom and be entrusted to freely publish their research without clearance by superiors A simple statement that their conclusions may not reflect official NIH views is sufficient It is good when scientists are free to have divergent perspectives on an issue and NIH leadership should not feel threatened by that NIH could also expand its post doc programs to allow more junior scientists to experience the dynamic NIH research environment for a couple of years 10 Decentralization During the COVID 19 pandemic much of the early important information did not come from the scientific powerhouses of the U S and Britain but from smaller peripheral countries with high quality science such as Iceland Sweden Finland Denmark Catalonia and Qatar For example they gave us some of the earliest information about COVID 19 transmission the effect of school closures natural infection acquired immunity mask efficacy and waning vaccine efficacy As the director of NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID Dr Anthony Fauci sat on the biggest pile of infectious disease research money in the world That made infectious disease scientists cautious about opposing his public health views about the pandemic even though Fauci is a lab scientist with limited public health expertise One can never guarantee that another Fauci won t rise to the top but with multiple independent infectious disease research institutes at least some of them will be functioning during the next pandemic even if one is led by a Dr Faust Even when all institute directors are excellent there is still an advantage with variety in ideas and emphasis Proposal No 10 For each specific disease area create four regional

decentralization could be combined with the merging of institutes for related areas such as the National Institute on Drug Abuse the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Institute of Mental Health 11 Research versus policy NIH is a research institute entrusted to fund and conduct medical and public health research It is not a medical or public health policy institute If NIH or its institutes argue for specific health policies it can be hard for NIH funded scientists to objectively present research that contradicts policies advocated by NIH leaders During the pandemic NIH should have focused on quickly launching the necessary research studies to understand transmission and natural infection acquired immunity developing and evaluating therapeutics evaluating vaccine efficacy and safety and studying potential preventive measures such as masking and social distancing It failed on many of those fronts Instead NIH made health policy decisions and recommendations without scientific evidence as both the NIH and NIAID directors became leading proponents on the misguided pandemic strategy with school closures and other lockdown measures Public health policy is the responsibility of state health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention not the NIH Proposal No 11 NIH should focus exclusively on its research mission To maintain credibility as an objective world class medical research institute NIH should avoid medical and public health policy with the sole exception of policies concerning its own research portfolio Research requires an open mind to consider multiple options and any results and it must embrace evidence based medicine no matter what the research results are 12 A national COVID commission The

systems interact with organic matter such as decaying leaves vegetation human or animal waste and other substances One or more of these chemicals chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform have been linked to various human health risks including cancers As a result the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA has set a maximum allowable annual average level of 80 parts per billion ppb for what the agency calls total trihalomethanes or TTHM The rule which applies to public water systems has been in place for more than two decades Texas water systems had the highest prevalence of water systems with unsafe levels of TTHM with more than 700 such systems serving over 8 6 million people reporting the contaminants above the EPA s 80 ppb according to the report by the Environmental Working Group EWG New York Oklahoma California and Illinois followed Texas with hundreds of water systems in each of those states showing higher than allowed levels of TTHM during the testing period the EWG report found More than 64 5 million people are served by 3 170 systems in the ten states that had the most violations Manure from factory farms is polluting our water supplies and when utilities try to make that water safe to drink they unintentionally create another public health hazard that increases the risk of cancer and birth defects Anne Schechinger EWG s Midwest director said in a statement accompanying the release of the report The EWG report draws a connection between the high levels of TTHM and large scale livestock operations sometimes called concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs Six of the 10 states that had systems where testing showed contamination at or above the EPA s maximum contaminant level MCL of 80 ppb at least once from 2019 2023

Department of Agriculture data Many community water systems rely on reservoirs and other surface water for drinking water supplies which are frequently contaminated with runoff from farm fields including pesticides and animal manure While the report focused on water systems with levels above the EPA s MCL scientific evidence in recent years has indicated that TTHM in drinking water at levels below the current regulatory limits still increases the risks of certain cancers People can also be put at risk via inhalation while showering according to research Several studies have linked TTHM exposure to bladder and colorectal cancers and some research has additionally found that problems during pregnancy including stillbirth can be linked to the consumption of water containing TTHM during pregnancy EWG s health guideline for TTHM in drinking water is 0 15 ppb representing a one in a million lifetime cancer risk as shown by EWG research There is no reason to think the unsafe levels have been mitigated since 2023 the end period for the testing covered in the EWG report Ongoing violations continue In February city officials in Battle Creek Michigan found excessively high TTHM levels in that city s water system In November 2024 the city of San Angelo Texas was notified that its water exceeded the EPA s allowable levels for TTHM And in December 2024 the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality notified the Goodfellow Air Force Base that the community s drinking water also exceeded the safe levels Some people who drink water containing trihalomethanes in excess of the

the global food industry including meat processing in the U S Cargill s business practices along with bigger is better policies enforced by their cronies at the U S Department of Agriculture USDA have led to the closures of many local abattoirs which forced farmers to depend on a few corporate mega slaughterhouses This leaves farmers waiting 14 months or longer for butchering slots for which they often must transport their animals hundreds of miles indeed farmers and ranchers must book processing dates up to a year before the animal is even born The high fees charged by Cargill s slaughterhouses contribute to the skyrocketing price of meat all while the farmers themselves are barely paid enough to cover the cost of raising the livestock The USDA meanwhile makes sure their

family may carry more blame than anyone else in history for turning agriculture away from independent family farms towards corporate conglomerates In 1947 Nelson Rockefeller founded the International Basic Economy Corporation IBEC to modernize and corporatize agriculture in South America particularly in Brazil and Venezuela IBEC transformed farming to depend on expensive machinery and inputs that priced subsistence peasant farmers out of viability The American International Association for Economic and Social Development or AIA a Rockefeller funded philanthropic organization helped build the market through which IBEC could enrich its owners While IBEC s promotional literature claimed that the company was generously assisting the Third World by providing necessary consumer products while turning a profit on closer examination it was simply a business enterprise built on the Rockefellers old Standard Oil model in which smaller competitors are forced out using monopolistic practices before prices are raised This tactic was taken to a whole new level with the so called Green Revolution first in Mexico in the 1940s then in the Philippines and India in the 1960s as well as in the U S Traditional farming practices such as the use of manure as fertilizer for heirloom native crops were replaced with a model of mechanized chemical farming using Rockefeller funded new seed varieties which had been developed to require petrochemical fertilizers and pesticides to produce significantly increased crop yields compared to the traditional crops grown by peasant farmers in these countries It is worth noting that the Rockefellers as oil oligarchs stood to profit handsomely from the petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides that this new method demanded The crops grown were almost all cereal crops like rice and replaced more nutrient dense traditional crops like millet India experienced an increase in food but a decrease in nutrition with more empty calories but fewer fruits vegetables and animal proteins micronutrients disappeared from the diet Anemia blindness fertility problems low birth weight and immune impairment increased While the Green Revolution was hailed as the solution to world hunger and poverty it also poisoned local water supplies depleted the soil and left farmers drowning in debt as they could no longer independently produce the

Change to CDC Recommendation Last week s change to the CDC COVID 19 vaccine recommendation for healthy children drew criticism from mainstream media But with only 12 8 of children up to date on COVID

dropped its recommendation that healthy children receive the COVID 19 vaccine The shot technically remains on the childhood schedule but it is no longer federally recommended Instead the vaccine is now classified under shared clinical decision making meaning families and their doctors make the decision together The government no longer takes a position for or against The media and medical establishment responded with outrage Headlines from outlets like The New York Times and CNN accused the CDC of defying its own advisory process and rebelling against U S Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr Much of the uproar centered on the timing the decision came just before a scheduled meeting of the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP According to an April 16 CNN report three quarters of ACIP members favored removing the recommendation However in a move signaling they were no longer willing to outsource public health decisions to an unelected advisory body Kennedy along with Dr Mehmet Oz Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services administrator and U S Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary acted before the committee could vote And yet the numbers tell a different story According to data slide 45 presented at the April 2025 ACIP meeting only 12 8 of children are currently up to date on COVID 19 shots The public had already moved on The CDC simply caught up albeit without the formal recommendation of the ACIP Who s still pushing COVID vaccines for children If only 13 of children are receiving the vaccine who s demanding its continued universal recommendation The answer the vaccine establishment The American Academy of Pediatrics AAP is a private trade group Most pediatric practices rely on revenue from well child visits a major component of which is vaccine administration In some cases insurers offer bonuses or rebates tied to compliance targets The financial incentives are real and rarely acknowledged The AAP also publishes the Red Book its definitive manual for pediatric infectious disease management The final section includes the AAP s own table of contraindications and precautions which closely parallels ACIP s but remains a separate proprietary standard In that context the AAP s continued promotion of the COVID 19 vaccine for all children may have as much or more to do with the financial

public health or the health of individual patients What RFK Jr actually did The change to the COVID 19 vaccine recommendation for children didn t come from nowhere On April 23 Kennedy publicly stated that his administration was considering withdrawing the CDC s recommendation for the COVID 19 shot for children Two days later I filed a lawsuit on behalf of Dr Samara Cardenas which argued that physicians should not be forced to order stock or promote a shot they did not believe in especially when the CDC s recommendation triggered mandates under the agency s Vaccines for Children Program and Medicaid But Kennedy has also repeatedly stated that he would not take vaccines away from families who want them The CDC s recent shift honors both of those commitments The shot remains technically on the schedule and as such it should still be covered by private insurance and government supply programs like the Vaccines for Children Program The CDC just no longer recommends it for healthy children That s not merely a symbolic change It changes the landscape Doctors no longer have to robotically offer the vaccine They can now exercise clinical judgment And more importantly it is a signal Why it matters The distinction between a CDC recommendation and a private group s advice matters deeply The CDC s stance largely determines what states mandate what schools require what insurers pay for and what government programs enforce Now the CDC has stepped back The AAP by contrast has doubled down revealing where the pressure is really coming from the trade group and the academic infectious disease mafia But as indicated families have already made their choice 12 8 and probably declining This is not the end of the fight But it is a milestone The CDC didn t contradict Kennedy it implemented his policies The shot remains available for those who want it But government programs no longer force providers to push it That s medical freedom in action The COVID 19 vaccine

the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA for simultaneously approving and authorizing Pfizer s COVID 19 vaccine in a classic bait and switch The FDA s action created mass confusion disorder and deception regarding the differences between the two Pfizer vaccines The FDA approval purportedly allowed the U S Military the Biden administration and other U S companies to exhort people to take

dupes unsuspecting military members as well as much of America into believing they are receiving a vaccine with certain legal protections that are not available to EUA vaccines said Mary Holland CHD president and general counsel Holland added The FDA s illegal approval of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine has helped the U S Department of Defense justify strict COVID 19 vaccine mandates that have resulted in U S military members being threatened with harsh consequences for refusing to receive the EUA Pfizer vaccine Holland said that in the memorandum filed Sept 18 to accompany the amended motion to stay Plaintiffs detail with striking clarity the impact the FDA s scheme has on our men and women in uniform This would not have existed without the FDA s unlawful actions The 16 exhibits to the memorandum include declarations from 14 military service members who are also members of CHD According to Holland the declarations are illustrative of the coercion men and women of different branches of the service face These 14 men and women ranging in rank from enlisted men and women to senior officers put their careers at risk to submit their declarations Holland said The declarations were selected from more than 100 submissions CHD received over a two day period The declarations detail each service member s documented concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of unlicensed

drugs focus on optimizing cellular energy production through dietary changes avoiding vegetable oils and supporting your gut and mitochondrial health By now most people around the world have heard of Ozempic and Wegovy which are GLP 1 receptor agonists These drugs originally made for treating Type 2 diabetes cause rapid weight loss thus attracting individuals who have been struggling to lose weight for a long time In fact the effectiveness of these drugs has led to a global shortage However as with many other drugs that promise immediate results there s a catch Ozempic hailed as a miracle drug but the downsides are sinister A report from The Epoch Times covered a study published in Nature Medicine showing the impact of certain GLP 1 receptor agonists sold under brand names such as Ozempic and Wegovy As noted by The Epoch Times The media patients and even some doctors have dubbed the medications miracle drugs because of their profound weight loss effects In addition to weight loss the study also noted that these drugs also lower the risk of seizures and addiction to substances such as alcohol cannabis stimulants and opioids It s believed that these drugs affect the brain s

the magnitude of associated benefits is modest about a 10 to 20 reduction for most outcomes A closer look at the research The Nature Medicine study analyzed 215 970 diabetics using GLP 1 receptor agonists and compared them to multiple control groups 159 465 taking sulfonylureas 117 989 using dipeptidyl peptidase 4 or DPP 4 inhibitors and 258 614 on SGLT2 inhibitors An additional control group of 536 068 used all three medications while a separate baseline group of 1 203 097 received only standard care They then produced a master list of health outcomes related to GLP 1 agonist receptor usage As noted by The Epoch Times while these drugs produced benefits there were also significant adverse health outcomes Compared to usual care GLP 1RA use was associated with a reduced risk of substance use and psychotic disorders seizures neurocognitive disorders including Alzheimer s disease and dementia coagulation disorders cardiometabolic disorders infectious illnesses and several respiratory conditions There was an increased risk of gastrointestinal disorders hypotension syncope arthritic disorders nephrolithiasis interstitial nephritis and drug induced pancreatitis associated

that we just talked about that are crushing our biology So this is not the public health solution Practical ways to address underlying metabolic challenges I believe the key to maintaining a healthy weight is optimizing your cellular energy production This requires a multifaceted approach that takes effort to implement but it leads to safer healthier results something GLP 1 receptor agonists don t offer With that in mind here are my recommendations 1 Avoid Ozempic and other GLP 1 agonist receptor drugs The most obvious strategy is avoiding GLP 1 agonist receptors in the first place If you re tempted to start you owe it to yourself to read the study to understand the dangers Pills and injections offer short term relief but they often mask deeper imbalances in how your cells produce and use energy Real improvement happens when you remove the factors that strain your metabolism rather than rely on a drug to force quick weight loss 2 Remove vegetable oils from your diet If you regularly consume ultraprocessed foods I recommend stopping right now and replacing them with real whole foods Processed foods contain linoleic acid rich vegetable oils that disrupt your metabolic pathways and alter how your body stores fat Instead cook your meals using tallow grass fed butter or coconut oil To protect your health from further damage limit your intake of linoleic acid to less than 5 grams per day from all sources I recommend using Cronometer an online food tracker so you don t go over this recommended range 3 Shift your carbohydrate sources gradually Avoid making sudden dietary changes that can shock your system If your gut is compromised start by introducing easily digestible carbohydrates like whole fruit or white rice before incorporating more complex carbs For severe gut issues sip dextrose water throughout the day as a temporary aid to support healing but limit its use to about two weeks The goal is to provide your cells with a steady source of easy to digest healthy carbohydrates for energy 4 Consider your protein and collagen intake I suggest aiming for 0 8 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass and balancing that amount so that about one third comes from collagen Doing this supports muscle maintenance tissue repair and hormone balance If you", "chunk_id":

body mass and balancing that amount so that about one third comes from collagen Doing this supports muscle maintenance tissue repair and hormone balance If you exercise frequently you would probably do well with a higher intake but take it slow and listen to how your body responds Stable protein intake is foundational for regulating cravings and stabilizing energy 5 Support your gut and mitochondrial health with other healthy habits I recommend getting daily sunlight exposure while being mindful of timing If your diet previously included vegetable oils avoid intense midday sun for at least six months to reduce the risk of sunburn and skin damage Additionally grounding in low EMF environments can be beneficial if available oceans particularly in North America tend to be the safest option In addition moderate intensity movement such as walking supports cellular energy production and aids in weight management Gradual consistent effort in these areas strengthens your metabolism and leads to lasting health improvements I believe this approach is far superior to relying on a so called magic drug like Ozempic Boost your GLP 1 naturally with Akkermansia The idea of a quick fix pill may be tempting but it comes at a long term cost to your health A better approach is to naturally boost your GLP 1 levels by supporting Akkermansia a beneficial gut probiotic that produces a GLP 1 inducing protein As noted in one study A muciniphila increases thermogenesis and glucagon like peptide 1 GLP 1 secretion in high fat diet HFD induced C57BL 6J mice by induction of uncoupling protein 1 in brown adipose tissue and systemic GLP 1 secretion Many people lack Akkermansia due to various reasons such as impaired mitochondrial function or an environment that is inhospitable to beneficial gut bacteria Ideally Akkermansia should comprise 3 to 5 of your total gut microbiome and it plays many different roles aside from promoting GLP 1 For example Akkermansia has the ability to produce mucin which is a thick gel like substance that protects the gut lining from harmful pathogens irritation from stomach acid and enzymes as well as mechanical damage Moreover mucin helps nourish the gut bacteria already existing in your gut To boost Akkermansia naturally eat plenty of berries and inulin rich foods such as garlic asparagus bananas and leeks Note however that if your gut health is

recommendations in this report include Reducing red and processed meats Replacing poultry meat and eggs with peas beans and lentils as sources of protein No limits on ultraprocessed foods or UPFs Continued caps on saturated fats to be replaced by vegetable seed oils Controversy over ultraprocessed foods The question of whether the expert committee should set limits on UPFs has sparked

frequently occurring conflicts were with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly makers of weight loss shots like Ozempic and Wegovy Still it s important to say that the committee s assessment of the evidence on UPF as limited is correct The USDA systematic review of these foods found only one small clinical trial testing the effects of these foods on health outcomes This trial conducted at the National Institutes of Health involved 20 adults for only 28 days 14 days on a UPF diet and 14 days on a whole food diet Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us The subjects were found to consume more calories while on the UPF diet but even so the test is too small and preliminary to generalize its conclusions to an entire nation As I ve written before we have many more and better studies on some of the components of ultraprocessed foods sugars and starches for instance and should act on these more precise and robust data first Marion Nestle acknowledged on her blog that the advisory committee must stick to evidence based recommendations while giving the strong impression that she wished it weren t so She s also quoted in a STAT article that headlines her comment about the impossible restrictions imposed on the guidelines by limiting recommendations to only those supported by strong evidence In my view we should not be arguing for guidelines based on lesser evidence The near complete lack of rigorous data for the original guidelines in 1980 set in motion a Titanic of misguided advice that has coincided with our astonishing epidemics in chronic diseases According to the best available government data Americans have largely followed the guidelines and despite this we have not only become sick but very sick Echoing this view is a congressionally mandated report

rigorous standards based on even weaker evidence seems to me misguided or possibly reckless Lower standards for reducing meat poultry and eggs Paradoxically the expert committee was not a stickler for rigorous evidence when it came to advising reductions in meat poultry and eggs Before getting into the evidence though I d like to revisit the likelihood as I wrote in an earlier post that these changes if adopted would exacerbate our disease epidemics This advice does not consider that plant based proteins are not as complete as those from animals and also not as bioavailable Plant sources like peas and beans also pack a hefty load of carbohydrates and calories for the same amount of protein making them a far less healthy option for people with metabolic conditions such as obesity and diabetes who need to be mindful of controlling their blood sugars The expert committee also found that reductions in meat eggs and poultry would lead to further shortfalls in fiber and vitamins D and E a significant fact given that the existing guidelines already fail to meet goals for vitamins D and E folate choline and iron Here are the committee s findings on nutrients announced at its final public meeting A lack of essential nutrients leads to a myriad of diseases and health conditions One has to wonder why the long standing nutritional deficiencies in the guidelines haven t been corrected and are getting worse Studies cited do not support expert report claims Most importantly the evidence used to support new and existing guidelines recommendations is insufficient and contradictory Three major systematic reviews on obesity Type 2 diabetes and heart disease list the randomized controlled clinical trials to support claims that the U S Dietary Guidelines can prevent these conditions in adults These reviews are also cited to support the new recommendation for reducing red processed meats Yet the clinical trials listed do not support these claims Here are the trials listed for heart disease As you can see one trial shows cardiovascular benefits from red meat Four trials show little to no benefit and three are not trials but observational follow up studies

The reviews on obesity and Type 2 diabetes are much the same For obesity the expert committee graded the following evidence as moderate with 24 trials as support Among these Nine are reported to have not statistically significant results on health outcomes for obesity One Crosby 2022 was conducted by the animal rights group the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and is therefore likely to be biased Three Alvarez Perez 2016 Casas 2022 Van Horn 2020 are incorrectly listed as clinical trials these are follow up observational studies to clinical trials published more than a decade ago Seven appear to show weight loss benefits for a diet more or less like the Dietary Guidelines Quite a few of these are hard to interpret since the intervention diet reduced both red meat and sweets so it s not clear which of these dietary elements or indeed the many others might be responsible for the weight loss observed Other trials did not appear to test a diet similar to the Dietary Guidelines For Type 2 diabetes the committee graded the evidence as strong and listed 13 trials Of these Ten are reported to have not statistically significant results on health outcomes for diabetes Two Howard 2018 and Prentice 2019 are incorrectly listed as clinical trials these are follow up observational studies on the Women s Health Initiative which had its results published in 2006 A single trial Pavic

study cited in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for a British Medical Journal cover story it triggered one of the largest retraction efforts in recent history though it was ultimately unsuccessful A key finding of my investigation was that the USDA HHS dietary patterns were supported by a minuscule quantity of rigorous evidence that only marginally supports claims that these diets can promote better health than alternatives This paper has been largely ignored Seven years later in 2022 I teamed with top nutritionists including former members of previous Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees to

Lab tests of two items the non organic apple and the pear fruit purees for babies revealed the presence of 21 pesticides including 12 classified as highly hazardous to human health or the environment Neonicotinoid pesticides were present in 100 of the baby food samples tested These chemicals have been linked to birth defects of the heart and brain learning disorders attention deficit hyperactivity disorder autism spectrum disorder damage to the nervous system and hormone disruption Neonicotinoids are also among the most ecologically disastrous pesticides since DDT U S agriculture has become nearly 48 times more toxic to insects including essential pollinators like bees since the introduction of neonicotinoids And they are a critical factor driving over 200 endangered species toward extinction according to the U S Environmental Protection Agency Organophosphate pesticide metabolites meaning the breakdown products of pesticides were also found in 100 of the baby food samples Scientists have called for a complete ban on organophosphates as they are known to be highly toxic to children s developing brains even at low levels of exposure They are associated with reduced IQ attention disorders delayed motor development and learning disabilities They have also been shown to harm bees birds and aquatic organisms like fish In addition 10 of the pesticides found in Target s

immune systems and more Babies are particularly vulnerable to the harms of pesticides Their brains and bodies are developing so rapidly that small exposures can result in lifelong impacts Children

not only why it s so important to stop vaccine passports but also 22 practical ways to do so put it Simply put the pandemic is to mandate an experimental gene therapy that the CDC likes to refer to as a vaccine That vaccine is for purposes of getting everyone onto a vaccine ID passport The passport is to force everyone into the new global social credit system That system is to bring the global

compared the vaccine ID passport system being rolled out to mandatory rabies vaccines for dogs It might seem like a stretch but there are many similarities between the rabies vaccine system and what could soon happen on a global scale but this time to people not dogs Lynn writes Let s put aside rabies for one moment and look at the system that billionaire funders of big pharma and policymakers quickly put into place They made the vaccine mandatory assigned an ID tag that dogs must wear stored the information and address of the dog and its owner in a database informed healthcare retail park services and businesses that they should not provide services to those without this ID If one doesn t abide by this law the owner can be fined dog quarantined and force vaccinated Your dog can t visit doggy daycares dog parks or grooming centers unless he s received the rabies shot Failure to comply leaves your dog ostracized and you as its owner vulnerable to fines Lynn argues that much like COVID 19 millions of pet owners have blindly gone along with the required rabies vaccines for their pets despite questions over its safety and necessity on an annual basis as studies suggest the shots may provide protection for more than six years They have tested this system on pet owners for years and half the U S population willingly went along with this without even questioning it Sound familiar

their Aug 29 statement the 26 governors all Republicans and the Republican Governors Association accused the WHO of attempting one world control over health policy by promoting a pandemic agreement or pandemic treaty Put simply they wrote Republican Governors will not comply Since 2021 the WHO has been drafting proposals for a pandemic agreement and amendments to its International Health Regulations During the organization s most recent World Health Assembly session which ended on June 1 WHO negotiators did not agree on a final draft of a pandemic agreement However they did make concrete commitments to completing negotiations on a global pandemic agreement within a year at the latest and possibly in 2024 the WHO stated Health freedom activist Dr Meryl Nass an internist and founder of Door to Freedom an organization that lobbied against the WHO pandemic treaty proposals told The Defender the governors statement is very necessary at this time because the United Nations U N which runs the WHO seeks to gain world control over emergencies such as cyber emergencies supply chain emergencies or outer space emergencies The jig is up Nass said It has become widely understood that the U N system is being used in an attempt to centralize its control and usurp national sovereignty The governors said they refuse to comply with a WHO pandemic agreement because it would consolidate power in the hands of the WHO thereby threatening national sovereignty states rights and U S Americans constitutionally guaranteed freedoms Nass said This was every Republican governor in the United States with the single exception of Vermont Republican governor Phil Scott He governs a state that is strongly Democrat and may have felt he could not expend the political capital required to go along and make this statement unanimous The 26 governors pointed to a May 22 letter to President Joe Biden in which 24 Republican governors voiced their concerns about the WHO s proposal

a federal authority Therefore we urged citizens to contact their attorneys general governors legislators and federal officials to demand they not turn over authority for health to the WHO In May in addition to 24 governors writing their letter of opposition 49 senators called on the Biden administration to reject the WHO agreement Additionally 22 attorneys general told Biden they would resist any attempt to enable the WHO to directly or indirectly set public policy for our citizens Numerous states including Utah Florida Louisiana and Oklahoma wrote legislation to prevent the WHO from

Bill Gates Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and 15 other defendants alleging they misled the public about the safety of the COVID 19 vaccines The lawsuit was filed last year by seven COVID 19 vaccine injury

several of the vaccine injury victims who filed the lawsuit and were at the hearing Dijkstra said none of the plaintiffs spoke during the hearing Last year attorneys for Gates sought dismissal of the

liability protection for vaccine manufacturers added By freeing them from liability for negligence the 1986 statute removed any incentive for these companies to make safe products If we want safe and

National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act to address the risks of vaccines which Congress and vaccine makers acknowledged had unavoidable side effects The act set up a no fault system whereby instead of suing the manufacturers people injured by vaccines can file a claim with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP which adjudicates the claims The VICP was meant to insulate vaccine makers from lawsuits that could bankrupt them while ensuring that injury victims had a straightforward non adversarial and fair path to compensation The program is funded by a 75 cent per dose tax paid by vaccine makers for every vaccine included in the program The U S Department of Health and Human Services administers the VICP also known as the vaccine court Court appointed special masters

getting compensation through the VICP has been notoriously difficult Critics say the program has devolved to protect government agencies and corporations rather than the health of vaccinated children CHD CEO Mary Holland said the 1986 Childhood Vaccine Injury Act effectively left parents and children injured by vaccines with no substantive way to get any compensation while giving vaccine makers a free pass For over 35 years parents of children injured and killed by government recommended vaccines have been left with no meaningful redress only a complex sham compensation program that pits grieving families against the government while Big Pharma enjoys no liability she said During that same time chronic health conditions in children autism ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder severe allergies asthma have skyrocketed Holland said In some cases people who are dissatisfied with the outcome of their case in the VICP or who don t get a timely decision can sue the manufacturer

Pharma s reign over government The corrupt public private partnership of the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act has suppressed science stacked the deck against families subverted the democratic marketplace of checks and balances and removed citizens rights to a trial by jury Americans deserve better The bill proposes to remove the requirement for vaccine injured people to pursue compensation in the vaccine court Under the law someone injured by a vaccine would be able to pursue civil action against a vaccine maker and to seek compensation through the VICP or both However once a person is awarded compensation in civil court they will no longer be eligible for compensation through the VICP The 1986 law also set a short statute of limitations for seeking injury compensation to two or three years of the death or injury respectively However it often takes longer than that for people to realize that a vaccine caused their injury or illness The proposed law would allow anyone injured since the program became effective in 1988 to file a lawsuit Finally the bill would end the protection from liability for the COVID 19 vaccines allowing people injured by the vaccine to sue the vaccine makers in court COVID 19 vaccines must be redefined as vaccines and not countermeasures so that the PREP Act s liability carveout can no longer apply according to a white paper that

Aluminum in vaccines is a good thing the headline said and vaccine scientists find it strange that people like Robert F Kennedy Jr raise questions about it because there is no indication in aluminum s nearly 100 years of use in vaccines that there are any problems President elect of the American Academy of Pediatrics Dr Andrew Racine who is not a vaccine scientist told the Times If there was something jumping out about a lack of safety we would most likely have seen it someplace and it just doesn t appear The article is one of several published recently by media outlets including the Daily Tribune The Conversation and FactCheck org defending the use of aluminum in drugs designed for infants The Defender spoke with several top researchers on aluminum toxicity and aluminum adjuvants They said aluminum adjuvants in vaccines are poorly understood by the pharmaceutical industry and have not been appropriately safety tested against a placebo They also said there is evidence that the toxic chemical can wreak havoc on the immune system The media s claims ignore decades of research and extensive evidence that aluminum ought to be completely eliminated as a vaccine ingredient they

prevent the inevitable moratorium on the continued use of aluminium adjuvants in vaccines Guillemette Crépeaux Ph D associate professor in physiology and pharmacology Alfort National Veterinary School France said All experts on aluminum and aluminum based adjuvants agree These compounds are not safe The scientific literature is very clear on this matter Many of the vaccine industry s claims about

at stake in the historic Merck trial that began last week for fraud negligence and concealing the likelihood and severity of adverse effects associated with its Gardasil HPV vaccine 4 things the Times didn t tell readers about aluminum in vaccines 1 Long term use of aluminum adjuvants doesn t mean they re safe The Times repeated a claim made by vaccine makers and government regulatory agencies that the long term use of aluminum adjuvants shows that they are safe However Exley author of Imagine You Are an Aluminum Atom Discussions with Mr Aluminum wrote on Substack that even though aluminum adjuvants have been used for a long time vaccine manufacturers still haven t shown any detailed understanding of how aluminum adjuvants work Instead they perpetuate a number of myths about the mechanism of action Exley wrote The Times explained how adjuvants work using terms like scientists believe but conceded that how adjuvants enhance the activity of immune cells is not fully understood Researchers have also reported that the mechanisms of adjuvant toxicity are even less well understood than the mechanisms by which adjuvants enhance vaccine immunogenicity Exley explained that adjuvants are used because antigens like vaccines and bacteria used in vaccines are often not sufficient to cause an immune response that would later protect someone from the target illness Adding aluminum to the antigen provides a cheap and easy way to provoke an immune response to a weakened form of a virus The adjuvant is added to provoke inflammation Crépeaux explained By definition the role of an adjuvant is to be toxic Epidemiologist and internal medical specialist Dr Rokuro Hama who heads the Japan Institute of Pharmacovigilance said the adjuvants work by damaging tissue to stimulate inflammation one of the reasons adjuvants are linked to autoimmune disorders As the stimulated white blood cells or macrophages try to fight the toxic aluminum they do what they know migrate throughout the body This means the aluminum can reach multiple organs and systems Hama said Multiple studies have shown that aluminum is toxic at the injection site and beyond Exley said And several studies link aluminum adjuvants to autoimmune conditions The Times said that some limited evidence from a questionable study shows a link between aluminum and asthma but there is no evidence for any other concerns Exley said the reference to asthma was a red herring used by pharma to create the perception that the industry is addressing the public s concerns about toxicity and to distract from the extensive data on toxicity Exley said he has spent 40 years at the bench studying aluminium and it is my unwavering opinion that aluminium adjuvants in vaccines are behind serious childhood

that each time a new vaccine using an aluminum adjuvant is developed it undergoes a lengthy clinical trial to evaluate its safety and side effects are continuously monitored after approval However the experts said that no infant vaccine containing an aluminum adjuvant has been safety tested against a true placebo such as saline Instead the vaccines are tested against placebos that also contain an aluminum adjuvant or against other vaccines that contain one This deception is the original dirty trick used by vaccine manufacturers to mask the toxicity of aluminium adjuvants in vaccines Exley wrote In an expert report written for the ongoing lawsuit against Merck for adverse effects from its Gardasil vaccine aluminum adjuvant expert Lucija Tomljenovic Ph D wrote that statements like Racine s claiming absence of evidence is evidence of absence is a logical fallacy Citing work by vaccine developer and immunology expert Dr Nikolai Petrovsky Tomljenovic said the absence is better explained by the fact that there are almost no high quality randomized controlled trials or epidemiological studies investigating aluminum adjuvant safety This is especially striking given that there are thousands of studies published on aluminum s potency and efficacy as an adjuvant the report noted Petrovsky also said that since aluminum was first introduced as an adjuvant in vaccines the regulatory bar has been raised significantly It is likely that if aluminum hadn t been in use all these years and presented to regulatory bodies for approval today it would be refused registration on the basis

comparison stupid First she said the compounds are different Adjuvants substances not found in food are especially toxic due to their particulate form Next the route by which aluminum enters the body matters Intramuscular injection allows the body to absorb 100 of the injected aluminum and babies are exposed repeatedly every month or so through vaccines Lluís Luján DVM Ph D said that ingested or inhaled aluminum follows different metabolic routes and is mostly excreted Injected aluminum remains in the tissue for months or years which can lead to lifelong inflammatory reactions in animals and humans who are injected It is a known neurotoxin he said noting that in many species aluminum causes an acute inflammatory response upon injection followed by a chronic one As more aluminum containing vaccines are injected into the same person the effects can be cumulative Twenty seven childhood vaccines approved in the U S include an aluminum adjuvant according to the Times The amount of aluminum infants are exposed to in a single dose of a vaccine let alone in all of those vaccines over many months is not small Because safety studies are lacking and efficacy studies are abundant the amount of aluminum adjuvant permitted in vaccines is selected based on efficacy not safety according to Tomljenovic and confirmed in publications by the U S Food and Drug Administration s FDA own scientists Additional research by Exley and colleagues has shown that the aluminum content of vaccines within batches varied significantly and bears little or no resemblance to the amount of aluminum listed on the drugs by the makers Regulators like the FDA and the European Medicines Agency admit that they don t independently verify the aluminum content of vaccines 4 Aluminum adjuvants make vaccines more

respiratory issues I started noticing she wasn t breathing as well but she was breathing very heavy on her chest and her fever was coming back And I was like that s weird We re over the measles now Why is this happening MaryAnn and Henry decided to take Lyla to a doctor On Feb 28 they drove Lyla to a clinic 30 minutes away just across the New Mexico state line The clinic staff tested her oxygen and it was at 85 MaryAnn said A normal blood oxygen level is between 95 100 for most people according to the Cleveland Clinic The clinic s nurse practitioner who assessed Lyla said she didn t feel

nearby hospital in New Mexico which they did Hospital staff deny request for food and water When they arrived at the hospital only Henry went inside with Lyla MaryAnn stayed in the car out of concern that her light measles rash might negatively affect the treatment they would receive Inside the hospital staff hooked Lyla up to oxygen and questioned Henry about her medical history and situation

indoor dust is a significant exposure pathway for most insecticides and fungicides while herbicides are mainly consumed through drinking water said the authors In addition the toxicity equivalent factor model incorporated with data retrieved from the ToxCast database indicated that imidacloprid poses the greatest health risk based on its high exposure levels and toxicity The authors also cite some additional findings of note below Thirty seven CUPs were detected in indoor dust samples Neonicotinoids and their breakdown products were the most abundant group of insecticides found in indoor dust contributing more than 70 to the total insecticide concentrations Overall the median total neonicotinoid concentration in indoor dust was 4 100 ng g nanograms approximately 3 orders of magnitude higher than that reported in urban settings The most abundant herbicide detected in indoor dust was 2 4 dichorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 D which constituted more than 85 of the total herbicide concentrations Considering that 2 4 D has a short half life of one and a half days the authors believe that this may indicate a recent application in the vicinity of the sampling area Azole strobilurin and amide fungicides were found in all indoor dust samples Thirty three CUPs were detected in drinking water samples Organophosphates were more frequently detected compared to neonicotinoids and found at higher concentrations Sixteen herbicides were found in drinking water samples Herbicides were the predominant group of CUPs in drinking water samples and contributed 55 to the CUP concentrations Atrazine and its breakdown products made up over 50 of the total herbicide concentrations accounted for in this study Seven fungicides were detected in water samples with

50 years that wireless radiation is linked to 23 chronic diseases but has failed to protect the public from chronic wireless radiation exposure according to the authors of a new report Richard Lear and Camilla Rees posted their report on Feb 6 as a preprint on ResearchGate Lear and Rees are business executives and long time health and environmental researchers The report which Rees called a discussion and commentary on published science related to wireless radiation s biological impacts is geared toward an everyday audience Lear and Rees posted the report on ResearchGate to make it accessible to the public On Feb 14 Rees shared the paper with attendees of the American Academy of Environmental Medicine s annual conference in San Antonio Texas according to a press release Miriam Eckenfels director of Children s Health Defense s CHD Electromagnetic Radiation EMR Wireless called the report an easy to understand distillation of pertinent scientific findings that gives the public a sense of how regulatory agencies ignored earlier science and why agencies need to take protective action now In the report Lear and Rees discuss how the U S Naval Medical Research Institute in 1971 issued a report that reviewed 2 311 scientific studies on the biological and health effects of electromagnetic radiation EMR Most of the studies examined by the Navy involved low intensity EMR signals in the 1 to 4 gigahertz GHz range said Lear and Rees These types of wireless exposures are virtually identical with those from modern devices and wireless sources such as cell phones WiFi Bluetooth smart meters GPS wearables and wireless infrastructure The Navy s review found 132 different biological effects symptoms and diseases linked to wireless exposures According to Lear and Rees 23 of those are among the fastest growing chronic diseases and conditions in the U S today including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD anxiety asthma autism chronic fatigue diabetes leukemia autoimmune disease and celiac disease In 2016 Lear examined the growth of chronic disease from 1990 to 2015 and the related economic costs of those diseases His research found that 36 chronic diseases

wireless technologies In doing so they imposed millions of unnecessary chronic exposure conditions on the American public Rees told The Defender she hopes U S regulators finally take action Pressure is needed from all directions to encourage federal regulatory agencies to do their jobs and to hold these agencies accountable The Federal Communications Commission FCC has not updated its exposure limits for wireless radiation since 1996 In 2021 CHD and other groups won a lawsuit challenging the FCC s exposure limits The groups filed 11 000 pages of evidence of harm from 5G and wireless technology which they alleged the FCC ignored when it decided to keep its 1996 guidelines The pages included evidence of widespread sickness due to wireless radiation exposure The FCC has yet to comply with a court ordered mandate to explain how the agency determined that its current guidelines adequately protect humans and the environment against the harmful effects of exposure to wireless radiation Lear and Rees plan to send hard copies of their report to all U S Congress members and at least 1 000 U S business leaders We want this information to get to people who are courageous enough

from 4G we ve been led to believe It introduces millimeter waves into mainstream telecommunications frequencies in the 30 300 gigahertz range that have never before been used on such a scale for consumer purposes You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Melissa Smith and Meleni Aldridge We live in an age of unprecedented tech connectivity From smartphones to smart homes the promise of 5G and the Internet of Things IoT is heavy on promises of instant communication and seamless automation But beneath the slick marketing of the so called Fourth Industrial Revolution lies a more sobering truth we are saturating our environment our bodies and all life on this beautiful planet with an invisible web of electromagnetic radiation the long term effects of which remain underexplored and underestimated In the race for hyperconnectivity and technological dominance we appear to be overlooking something essential that we are electrical beings finely tuned to nature s frequencies Not the artificial soup of signals now surrounding us and throwing the delicate balance that nature so exquisitely designed into chaos 5G Uncharted territory for human exposure The fifth generation of wireless technology 5G is not simply the upgrade from 4G we ve been led to believe Instead it introduces millimeter waves mmWaves into mainstream telecommunications frequencies in the 30 300 gigahertz GHz range that have never before been used on such a scale for consumer purposes Proponents argue these waves can carry vast amounts of data over short distances ideal for dense urban networks and smart cities As the implementation of mmWave technology picks up pace large events are being used to showcase the lightning quick speeds to seduce the public into embracing its adoption Yet long term scientific research particularly in real world conditions assessing the biological impacts of mmWave exposure on people and the planet is virtually non existent These waves which penetrate the top layers of our skin concentrate energy on the skin and eyes potentially causing localised heating or subtler non thermal effects Given that the skin is the body s largest organ and primary immunological interface such localized stress has systemic implications too The precautionary principle widely used in Europe is a cornerstone of responsible science and demands that we pause and investigate before blanketing communities flora and fauna with untested frequencies So why the rush Could it be because mmWaves can be deployed almost anywhere on Earth further expanding big tech

other military for non lethal crowd control through a technology known as the Active Denial System The Active Denial System is a directed energy weapon developed by the U S Department of Defense and works by emitting high frequency millimeter waves that penetrate the outer 0 4 mm of human skin and rapidly heat the surface tissue to create an intense burning sensation You literally feel as if you re on fire Big Tech s power grab In the U S lobbying efforts by telecom giants are reshaping the legislative landscape to facilitate the rapid deployment of 5G and mmWave antennas while bypassing community oversight Under the Federal Communications Commission FCC Order 18 133 and other related provisions companies are now allowed to install small cell 5G antennas on streetlamps schools and homes with little to no local planning oversight New proposed legislation seeks to codify this across states stripping communities of the right to object demand safety data or even be informed of installations In some areas antennas have appeared within meters of bedrooms a recent study published in Medinsk Access documents the harms to human health following the installation of a 5G mast on a block of flats with no obligation for consultation This raises profound ethical concerns about informed consent public health protections and the erosion of local democratic processes as profit is prioritized over people s health At federal level in the U S Section 40002 has been quietly slipped into HR 1 President Donald Trump s One Big Beautiful Bill Act which gives the Federal Communications Commission FCC new legal powers that unless amended or deleted will trigger provisions that allow telecoms to place an unlimited number of antennas on existing antenna structures without notice or approval The blatant lack of respect for those being harmed by technologies that have become an integral part of everyday life is starkly illustrated by tech companies warnings to their shareholders of the potential harms to human health and the significant risk of ensuing class actions But they don t communicate this to the public who are their end users Insurers rank the risks from 5G and

Italy s Ramazzini Institute found evidence of cancer eg gliomas and heart schwannomas in rodents exposed to EMFs Three recent critiques Frank et al Di Ciaula et al and Hardell Nilsson published by international experts show that a recent World Health Organization review of mobile phone radiation declaring mobile phones don t pose a health hazard is unsafe due to critical errors omissions and conflicts of interest Such findings raise major concerns about 5G which uses higher far less studied frequencies and we already know what mmWaves are capable of through their military use The absence of comprehensive 5G specific studies especially on mmWaves leaves us caught in the web of a dangerous experiment with not just human health as the guinea pig but that of the inhabitants of the environment around us from plants and insects to larger animals sea life dolphins whales and beyond Digital and technological progress regardless of risk A toxic wake up call It s not just about dose Toxicology s old adage the dose makes the poison is quite right but needs to take into account the totality of exposure not a single exposure at a time Modern exposures are chronic low level and multi

radiation causes typical symptoms indicative of microwave syndrome The study published in the journal Medicinsk Access also confirmed that non ionizing radiation well below levels allowed by authorities can cause health problems According to the study a 5G base station installed on the roof of an apartment building caused extremely high levels of non ionizing radiation in the apartment of the two persons living just below the station Within a few days of exposure the residents of the apartment developed symptoms of microwave syndrome After moving to a place with lower radiation the symptoms quickly decreased or disappeared Measurements before and after the installation of the 5G installation showed that switching to 5G led to an increase in radiation from 9 milliWatts m2 to a maximum of 1 690 milliWatts m2 high enough for both acute and long term health effects Measurements were taken both before 5G deployment and on several occasions afterward Before 5G was installed there were already base stations for 3G or 4G in the same location directly above the apartment So even though the radiation level before switching to 5G was high after switching on 5G the levels increased 188 times This shows that non ionizing radiation from a 5G base station placed on a roof close to a living space can be exceedingly high The highest radiation level was detected in the bedroom located just 5 meters below the base station prompting the authors of the study to call for further investigation into the effects on people exposed to 5G radiation levels It is shocking that this is the first study performed on 5G health effects three years after the roll out of this technology started and after having already exposed the population to 5G high intensity pulsed microwave radiation for several years Mona Nilsson managing director of the Swedish Radiation Protection Foundation and co author of the study told The Defender Nilsson added There are no studies that show that this technology and the increasing and common exposure to 5G and 4G base stations at levels allowed by the government is safe On the contrary studies have repeatedly and convincingly showed increased

of moving to the new apartment with low radiation levels Microwave syndrome a brief history Microwave syndrome was described in the 1970s by scientists in the former Soviet Union who were researching occupational risks due to exposure to non ionizing radiation The Soviet researchers described multiple symptoms of the syndrome including fatigue dizziness headaches difficulty sleeping concentration problems mood swings tinnitus heart palpitations and memory loss The researchers noted the symptoms subsided when exposure to non ionizing radiation ceased or decreased Subscribe to The Defender It s

meters The exposed person usually experiences symptoms in several bodily organs although most often the symptoms are related to the central nervous system and the heart The symptoms vary from person to person as sensitivity to microwave radiation is individual Several studies during the last 20 years have shown increased risk of microwave syndrome symptoms among people living near mobile phone

problems and high blood pressure Increased non ionizing radiation due to 5G The Swedish study not only showed that 5G causes microwave syndrome almost immediately but it also found the levels of non ionizing radiation increased massively The values measured in the home of the man and woman in the study maximum 1 690 milliWatts m2 are significantly lower than those deemed safe 10 000 milliWatts m2 as an average value over 6 minutes by the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority SSM Because microwave radiation tends to fluctuate wildly and SSM s reference is an average value this means the maximum value is allowed to be significantly higher than 10 000 milliWatts m2 and it does not protect against large fluctuations which are in fact more biologically active Furthermore SSM s reference value does not protect against long term harmful effects such as the microwave syndrome or cancer that come with prolonged exposure from base stations as is the case with exposure in homes offices or schools The reference value applies only to protection against immediate effects as a result of radiation so intense that it heats up tissues within 30 minutes This means the general public is completely unprotected against effects other than acute thermal damage despite the fact that such effects have been shown to cause nervous system harm oxidative stress and DNA damage Study shows need to revisit safe levels of non ionizing radiation Prior to their study the authors noted there were no scientific studies showing no risk of harmful health effects from chronic exposure to non ionizing radiation from base stations at levels corresponding to SSM s reference value or at the levels measured in this case study There are not even any studies of any long term risks of combining the non ionizing radiation from 4G and 5G Hardell and Nilsson concluded To claim that exposure to radiation does not entail risks because the exposure is lower than SSM s reference value thus has no scientific basis at all In 2016 a group of researchers and doctors recommended maximum exposure during the day should be 0 1 and at night 0 01 milliWatts m2 However despite extensive evidence of

for in depth investigations of persons complaining of microwave syndrome related problems who may be exposed to elevated levels of microwave radiation Careful patient history must be taken to investigate various sources of microwave radiation they wrote In addition the investigation should be supplemented with measurement of the radiation both in the home and at the workplace Such patients must be properly investigated and given a medical diagnosis with careful consideration taken to eliminate or reduce the disease causing factor that is reduce exposure to non ionizing radiation as being the most important This should be done as early as possible to reduce the risk of irreversible damage or chronic disease Furthermore it has to be emphasized that the measured values in the studied apartment after the installation of 5G make the home uninhabitable from a medical point of view regardless of the fact that the radiation is below the current reference values Nilsson said the telecommunications industry is trying its hardest to keep any information about the health hazards of this technology from the public with the help of their captured organizations the World Health Organization the International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection and other governmental agencies She added Major telecom companies know the radiation they force on the public is
