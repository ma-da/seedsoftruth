I hope DOGE will obliterate the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) from space. This law, which was written in 1980before computers were common in homes\"requires that every government form, and every change to every government form, must go through the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). This office has no expertise in user research or form design. Agencies self-report how many \"burden hours\" it takes to fill out their forms, and OIRA has no way to check this either. Some of the most talented people I've ever worked with have spent years of their own getting OIRA to agree to, and write down, such novel concepts as \"legal things are legal.\" I'm not kidding\"OIRA issued guidance last year that agencies are allowed to get feedback from the public, something which has always been legal. I wanted to have one form \"wizard\" that would allow a veteran to enter their information once, and automatically apply for all the benefits for which they were eligible. OIRA told me that to do this, I would first have to submit every possible permutation of this wizard for approval\"a request I would have found delicious to comply with, were there enough trucks on the planet to deliver that amount of paper. We worked within the system. The system blocked us from helping people. I shouldn't have had to waste two and a half years of my life on this, while millions of veterans went without health care and other benefits they had earned.

The Elon Musk-led project to curb waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government said that in light of the discovery, use of the TAS code is now mandatory. “As of Saturday, this is now a required field, increasing insight into where money is actually going,” DOGE said. “This is methodical and it is going to yield big savings,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. DOGE recently proposed “deleting paper checks” at Treasury, arguing that it would save taxpayers “at least $750 million per year.” The initiative noted that the Treasury Department must keep “a physical lockbox” to collect the more than 100 million checks it processes each year, which costs about $2.40 per check to maintain. In fiscal year 2023, some $25 billion in tax refunds were delayed or lost due to returned or expired checks.

USAID spends over a quarter of a billion dollars yearly training and funding a vast, sprawling network of more than 6,200 reporters at nearly 1,000 news outlets. Oksana Romanyuk, the Director of Ukraine’s Institute for Mass Information, revealed that almost 90% of the country’s media are bankrolled by USAID, including many that have no other source of funding. [Independent media is] defined as any media outlet, no matter how big an empire it is, that is not owned or funded by the state. Some USAID-backed journalists candidly admit that their funding dictates ... what stories they do and do not cover. Leila Bicakcic, CEO of Center for Investigative Reporting (a USAID-supported Bosnian organization), admitted , on camera, that “If you are funded by the U.S. government, there are certain topics that you would simply not go after, because the U.S. government has its interests that are above all others.” While the press may be lamenting the demise of USAID-backed media, many heads of state are not. “Take your money with you,” said Colombian President Gustavo Petro, “it’s poison.” Nayib Bukele, President of El Salvador, shared a rare moment of agreement with Petro. “Most governments don’t want USAID funds flowing into their countries because they understand where much of that money actually ends up,” he wrote , explaining that: \"At best, maybe 10% of the money reaches real projects that help people in need (there are such cases), but the rest is used to fuel dissent, finance protests, and undermine administrations that refuse to align with the globalist agenda.” Note: The New York Times reported in 2014 that USAID was used as a front for CIA regime change operations all over the world, and played a central role in overseeing the trillion-dollar failure of the war and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan.

The agency has been accused of kidnapping men from the street and forcing them to the front lines. In the middle of the interview, Stakhiv called the police to see if they would free Pleskach. Just then, with the police still on the line, a burly figure entered Vasyl’s frame, walked over to Pleskach, and struck him hard in the face. “They’re beating him right now,” Stakhiv told the police. “People are watching it live. Go to my YouTube channel and see it for yourself.” None of Ukraine’s media outlets covered the beating, but about a month later, a Ukrainian media outlet, Babel, ran an article about Stakhiv. Its headline? “Ostap Stakhiv\"a Failed Politician and Antivaxxer\"Created a Vast Anti-Conscription Network.” Other Ukrainian outlets ... chimed in with similar stories\"some even containing identical phrasing. Nine out of 10 media outlets in Ukraine “survive thanks to grants” from the West. The primary funder of these outlets is an NGO called Internews. And where does Internews get its money? Primarily from USAID, to the tune of $473 million since 2008. There’s no doubt that USAID’s media program in Ukraine has done some good. But critics charge that the money comes with strings. It is one thing for a country to pass laws that restrict speech in times of war. It is quite another when “independent” media outlets ... engage in that same censorship, and orchestrate smear campaigns against journalists who report on abuses. One of the most blatant abuses, which has been going on since 2023, is the military recruiter practice of snatching men from the streets, breaking into apartments, and even torturing men who have refused to join the military. Dozens of videos documenting these abuses have been widely shared on social media.

When government becomes corrupt, it erodes not only our personal liberties and financial security, but also fosters a culture of lawlessness in both the public and private sectors. The corruption has been institutionalized in the federal budget. It has been normalized as standard operating procedure. The waste of taxpayers’ money is ubiquitous trillions for wars, trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse. Trillions have been lost in an accounting jumble. This has been our government’s system of checks and balances: The Administration writes the checks, and Congress doesn’t know what the balance is. Most members do not know what is in the $7.3 Trillion spending bill, and those who do aren’t talking. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported more than $100 billion in improper Medicare and Medicaid payments in 2023. A Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan estimated the cost of waste, fraud, and abuse to be upwards of $60 BILLION, deriving from a lack of oversight, no internal controls in keeping track of who received the money, who spent it, and what it was spent for\"and if indeed its purpose was accomplished. This hypocrisy\"condemning endless wars while funding and escalating wars\"allowed the military-industrial complex to thrive.

Our politicians relentlessly accuse the other side of undermining democracy and endangering the vulnerable, while our legacy media, which no longer even pretends to be objective, consistently portrays its side’s enemies in the starkest of terms. A 2019 study by James Druckman and Matthew Levendusky in Public Opinion Quarterly found that individuals harbor more animus toward the other party’s elites than they do toward people who vote for the other party. I spent one year interviewing working-class Americans across the country from every political persuasion for my new book , and what I found was a remarkable consensus on the issues. The partisan claims of a polarized America ring especially false to working-class Americans . Two-thirds of Americans agree that abortion should be rare and also legal. This is becauseunlike the college-educated elites who run the country\"they don’t identify with the full list of policy proposals produced by either party. Working-class Americans across the country ... want higher wages. They want better healthcare\"or really, just affordable healthcare. They want stable jobs that reward their immense efforts with [what] top income brackets take for granted: a home. And yet, neither political party represents these positions that unify most Americans. They know that the way they vote reflects only a portion of their political views, and extremely little of their larger identities. There is no party that represents the American Dream, in which a life of hard work is rewarded by a home, retirement, the occasional vacation, and a better life for one’s kids. In other words, a life free from the precariousness that plagues the working class today. It’s led to a working-class electorate that feels alienated from both parties.

Instead of replacing other kinds of medicine, social prescriptions complement them, offering healing that pills and procedures can’t offer alone. Instead of just treating symptoms of sickness, social prescriptions reconnect us to our sources of wellness. And instead of just addressing “What’s the matter with you?”, social prescriptions address “What matters to you?” History is filled with examples of “social prescribing” from all around the globe. Indigenous groups have long linked an individual’s health to the health of their interconnected relationships both with their neighbors, and the natural world.

Instead of asking \"what's the matter with you\", link workers ask patients \"what matters to you\" and find suitable community activities that fit their answer. It was clear what mattered to Shaikh was really another chance to take care of someone. Gavin intuited this. And when she asked Shaikh what she thought might help her feel better, she honoured her answer: \"a job\". Gavin prescribed the perfect gig for Shaikh: a shift at the office of Lagan's Foundation, a non-profit providing caregiving to children with complex needs. After Gavin intervened, Shaikh says she started feeling more like herself. \"It was a way for Akeela to still be involved with the care inside, without the heavy lifting.\" The power of social prescribing \" helping patients to improve their health and wellbeing by connecting them to community resources and activities \" is increasingly backed by scientific studies .

But a specific class of antidepressant medications - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - actually might speed up brain decline among some dementia patients, a new Swedish study suggests. Heavier doses of certain SSRIs are tied to a higher risk for severe dementia, researchers reported in a new study ... in the journal BMC Medicine . The SSRI drug escitalopram was associated with the fastest cognitive decline, followed by citalopram and sertraline. For the study, researchers tracked the brain health of more than 18,700 patients enlisted in the Swedish Registry for Cognitive/Dementia Disorders between May 2007 and Oct. 2018. The patients’ average age was 78. During an average follow-up of more than four years, about 23% of patients received a new prescription for an antidepressant, researchers said. SSRIs were the most commonly prescribed antidepressant, amounting to 65% of all those prescriptions, the study says. “Higher dispensed doses of SSRIs were associated with higher risk for severe dementia, fractures, and all-cause mortality,” the researchers concluded . “These findings highlight the significance of careful and regular monitoring to assess the risks and benefits of different antidepressants use in patients with dementia.” Note: For more along these lines, read our concise summaries of news articles on Big Pharma corruption . \" </s><|im_end|>\\n", "chunk_id": "wtkcsv:13756:075383d250ed", "wtk_id": 13756.0}, {"doc_idx": 37875, "dataset": "wtk_pipe_csv_260223", "filename": "260223WTK.csv", "source_url": "https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-gen-zers-says-antidepressants-have-ruined-their-sex-lives-im-dead-inside", "publisher": "WTK Archive", "found_on": "WTK Archive", "title": "", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Gen Zers says antidepressants have ruined their sex lives: ‘I’m dead inside’ as reported by New York Post Nick was 19 when a psychiatrist offered him the antidepressant Trintellix to treat his moderate anxiety and depression after just a few short visits.

But, when Nick went off the medication after six years, he immediately noticed his genitals were losing sensation. Over the course of a couple weeks, he almost entirely lost feeling in the area and it never returned, nor did the high sex drive he once had.

SNOMED, the National Institute Of Health’s official source of medical terminology for US healthcare systems, recognizes PSSD as a legitimate disorder as of last year, defining it as “persistent sexual side effects” including genital numbness and loss of libido that “can last for weeks, months, or even years after stopping” antidepressants. The rate of prescriptions for those ages 12 to 25 jumped by about two-thirds from 2016 to 2022 . “The studies that were done for SSRIs to be approved by the FDA were not done on children, they were done on adults,” [clinical psychologist Meg Jay] said. “But now it’s much more common for tweens and teens to be prescribed medications than it used to be.\" In the past two years alone, [Psychopharmacologist and former professor of psychiatry David Healy] said he’s known more than a dozen people, many of them young, who were so distressed by PSSD that they committed suicide.

Laws have been introduced in at least eight states so far and drafts are circulating in more than 20 states, backed by a deluge of advertising supporting the measures. The fight is particularly fierce now in Iowa, where opponents call the pesticide-backed proposed law the “Cancer Gag Act”, due to high levels of cancer in Iowa that many fear are linked to the state’s large agricultural use of pesticides. Iowa has the second-highest rate of new cancer cases in the United States and the fastest growing rate. The bill would bar people from suing pesticide manufacturers for failing to warn them of health risks, as long as the product labels are approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Opponents say the legislation will rob farmers and others who use pesticides from holding companies accountable in court if their pesticide products cause disease or injury . “We’re very worried. Our farmers feel that if they have injuries or illnesses due to their use of a pesticide they should have access to the courts,” said [Iowa Farmers Union president] Aaron Lehman. The actions in the states come alongside a simultaneous push for changes in federal law that would in effect shield companies from lawsuits brought by people claiming they developed cancers or other diseases due to their use of pesticides.

To advance these policies, we need a clear system of labeling unhealthy junk foods in the food supply. The Food and Drug Administration is considering implementing this type of labeling system, but the food industry is trying to interfere. Warning labels signaling when foods are high in salt, added sugar and saturated fat can help consumers easily identify which foods they should limit. Ten countries already require such labels, and the National Academy of Medicine first recommended them in the U.S. more than 14 years ago. Food companies criticize the science supporting front-of-package labeling, delay public consultation periods, push for their own confusing label designs and emphasize the possible harms of a mandatory labeling policy . Food companies have deployed these tactics to avoid effective labeling policies around the globe for decades. In the public discourse, food companies are making distracting arguments about the possible harms of a clear front-of-package labeling policy, arguing that such labels may hurt the economy, raise food prices, scare consumers or lead to shame when selecting certain foods.

However, Shiva argued that the revolution's tactics were more harmful than helpful, increasing the use of toxic pesticides and polluting fertilizers while reducing indigenous seed biodiversity. Moreover, farmers became dependent on chemical solutions, which raised their operating costs. To combat this, the [Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology] founded seed banks across India in the 1990s as part of its Nine Seeds project, teaching farmers about sustainable agriculture, which incorporates practices that improve soil and ecosystem health, protect against erosion, and reduce the need for expensive chemicals.

If she’s serious about eliminating waste, she’ll take a hard look at the wasteful mandates and billions of U.S. tax dollars that go directly to agricultural corporations every year. Despite spending $20 billion a year of our tax dollars on farm subsidies, Americans never see most U.S. agriculture products. We only eat about 37 percent of major crops produced. Subsidies over-incentivize production of foods that are making us sick. Heavily subsidized corn often ends up as high-fructose corn syrup in heavily processed foods like sugary cereals and beverages . Through direct subsidies and import restrictions, we also prop up sugar cane and sugar beet production. The overconsumption of these unhealthy foods contributes to obesity, diabetes, heart disease and other diet-related illnesses that cost our health system more than $1 trillion a year . If Rollins really cares about making America healthy again, she should stop forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for foods that are making us ill. Consumers can still buy whatever they want without lining the pockets of corporations benefiting from over-producing unnecessary, unhealthy foods. Between 2017-2022, the U.S. agricultural industry lost more than 100,000 small and medium farms to consolidation.

The death toll of these operations are also unknown; U.S. claims denying civilian casualties are routinely disputed by people on the ground and the Somali government . A 2023 letter authored by 24 Somali and international rights organizations and addressed to the Secretary of Defense says: “Civilian victims, survivors, and their families have yet to receive answers, acknowledgement, and amends despite their sustained efforts to reach authorities over several years.” From Somalia to Afghanistan, Iraq to Libya, the American promise of safety arrives on the wings of drones, its humanitarianism indistinguishable from war.

We limited our search to ... allegations of violence perpetrated by U.S. service members or deaths in U.S. custody that happened in Iraq and Afghanistan after September 11, 2001. Of the seven hundred and eighty-one cases we found, at least sixty-five per cent had been dismissed by investigators who didn’t believe that a crime had even taken place. In a hundred and fifty-one cases, however, investigators did find probable cause to believe that a crime had occurred, that the rules of engagement had been violated, or that a use of force hadn’t been justified. These include the case of soldiers raping a fourteen-year-old girl and subsequently murdering her and her family; the alleged killing of a man by a Green Beret who cut off his victim’s ear and kept it; and cruelty toward detainees at Abu Ghraib prison and at the Bagram Air Base detention facility .

CNN portrayed him as a “blazer-wearing revolutionary.” In 2013, [CNN] labeled him one of “the world’s 10 most dangerous terrorists,” known for abducting, torturing and slaughtering racial and religious minorities. Western governments consider Jolani’s new organization, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), as one and the same as Al-Qaeda/Al-Nusra. Jolani whose real name is Ahmed Hussein al-Shar’a ... was captured by the U.S. military and spent over five years in prison, including a stint at the notorious Abu Ghraib torture center. While in Iraq, Jolani fought with ISIS and was even a deputy to its founder. Immediately upon release in 2011, ISIS sent him to Syria with a rumored $1 billion to found the Syrian wing of al-Qaeda. While both journalists and politicians in the U.S. are scrambling to change their opinions on Jolani and HTS, the reality is that, for much of its existence, Washington has enjoyed a very close relationship with al-Qaeda. The organization was born in Afghanistan in the 1980s, thanks in no small part to the CIA. Between 1979 and 1992, the CIA spent billions of dollars funding, arming, and training Afghan Mujahideen militiamen (like Osama bin Laden) in an attempt to bleed the Soviet occupation dry. The Bush administration would use [the 9/11] attacks as a pretext to invade both Afghanistan and Iraq, claiming that America could never be safe if al-Qaeda were not thoroughly destroyed. And yet, by the 2010s, even as the U.S. was ostensibly at war with al-Qaeda in Iraq and Afghanistan, it was secretly working with [al-Qaeda] in Syria on a plan to overthrow Assad. The CIA spent around $1 billion per year training and arming a wide network of rebel groups to this end. As National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a leaked 2012 email , “AQ [al-Qaeda] is on our side in Syria.” Note: As recently as 2016, Syrian militias armed by the Pentagon were fighting with Syrian militias armed by the CIA.

The PSK is a “throw-and-forget” drone, Balan says, referencing the “fire-and-forget” missile that, once locked on to a target, can seek it on its own. Instead of depending on remote controls, the PSK will be operated by AI. Soldiers should be able to grab it, switch it on, and throw it\"just like a football.

The grenades could be high-explosive dual purpose, designed to penetrate armor while also creating an explosive fragmentation effect against personnel. These grenades can also “airburst”\"programmed to explode in the air above a target for maximum effect. Infantry, special operations, and counterterrorism units can easily store PSK drones in a field backpack and tote them around, taking one out to throw at any given time. They can also be packed by the dozen in cargo airplanes, which can fly over an area and drop swarms of them. Balan says that one Defense Department official told him “This is the most American munition I have ever seen.” The nonlethal version of the PSK [replaces] its warhead with a supply container so that it’s able to “deliver food, medical kits, or ammunition to frontline troops” (though given the 1.7-pound payload capacity, such packages would obviously be small).

The breathtaking scope of this provision becomes more clear once we see how the terms are defined. “Material support” includes the provision of “service,” “expert advice or assistance,” “communications equipment,” or “personnel” (including yourself). And the Supreme Court has confirmed that the support does not actually have to go toward any particular violent act that might be considered terrorism, only to a group that is designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) by the U.S. government, even if that support is otherwise lawful.

Cladosporium sphaerospermum belongs to a group of fungi known as radiotrophic fungi. Radiotrophic organisms can capture and utilize ionizing radiation to drive metabolic processes. In radioactive sites like Chernobyl, where conventional cleanup methods are challenging and hazardous, radiotrophic fungi can provide a safer, natural alternative , according to an April 2008 article published in FEMS Microbiology Letters .

He now oversees the F.D.A.

In 2023 alone, $3.9 trillion was redistributed from the bottom 90 percent to the top 1 percent \" enough to give every worker a raise of $32,000 per year. In 1975, RAND found in its most recent report, the bottom 90 percent of Americans received about a third of all taxable income in the U.S. That share dropped to 47 percent by 2019, with over half of income going instead to the top 10 percent. If rates of income growth had remained equitable from the rates prior to the 1970s, the median household income today would be double what it is now, the analysis found . According to a recent analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, President Donald Trump’s tax proposals ... would provide $36,320 yearly in tax savings to the richest 1 percent, or people with incomes of over $914,900 a year. Meanwhile, the bottom 95 percent of Americans would see a tax increase. Note: Two-thirds of all new wealth created since the pandemic has been captured by the 1% .

How is money created? Who creates it? Why are we locked into perpetual debt? Government borrowing, spiraling national debt, and the accompanying tax burden on the American people are not the result of overspending on public services. Rather, they stem from the privatization of the money supply, a system enshrined by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which handed the power of money creation to private banks, ensuring their profits through the simultaneous creation of the federal income tax . The U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 5, granted Congress the power to create money, yet that power was appropriated. With the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, the constitutional power to coin money was appropriated by private banks. The creation of the federal income tax, through the 16th Amendment to the Constitution ... guaranteed the money borrowed from them by the government would be repaid through the imposition of the federal income tax. This reduced to people of the United States to being collateral for the debt which the country owed to the banks. The Federal Reserve expands the money supply by creating more debt. It has created trillions of dollars of money out of thin air, for the benefit of banks. Inflation ensues. Inflation is a hidden tax which erodes consumers purchasing power, causing people to take on more debt.

The First Amendment provides protections for the press because an informed electorate is essential for robust debate and a strong democracy. But what happens when you find yourself dragged into a lawsuit, ordered to divulge your sources, and held in contempt when you refuse? It is relatively uncommon for a court or the government to try to force a reporter to divulge sources. But it does happen , and when it does, it has a chilling effect on sources, reporters, and journalism itself. Sources wonder if they can trust a journalist who promises confidentiality, while journalists become less willing to offer that promise. It damages the ability of the press to root out wrongdoing. There is some good news, though. Congress appears poised to make it far more difficult for journalists to be compelled to divulge their sources. In January, in a rare display of bipartisanship, the House unanimously passed the Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying Act, or the PRESS Act . The bill, which is now awaiting action in the Senate, would mandate the disclosure of sources only in a limited number of cases. It would also bar the government from surveilling journalists.

Many public health officials and prominent scientists dismissed the idea as a conspiracy theory, insisting that the virus had emerged from animals in a seafood market in Wuhan, China. Officials and scientists hid or understated crucial facts, misled at least one reporter , orchestrated campaigns of supposedly independent voices and even compared notes about how to hide their communications in order to keep the public from hearing the whole story . A March 2020 paper in the journal Nature Medicine , which was written by five prominent scientists and declared that no “laboratory-based scenario” for the pandemic virus was plausible. But we later learned through congressional subpoenas of their Slack conversations that while the scientists publicly said the scenario was implausible, privately many of its authors considered the scenario to be not just plausible but likely . One of the authors of that paper, the evolutionary biologist Kristian Andersen, wrote in the Slack messages, “The lab escape version of this is so friggin’ likely to have happened because they were already doing this type of work and the molecular data is fully consistent with that scenario.” Note: Watch our Mindful News Brief on the origins of COVID .

The technique is so cleverly designed that the standard wish list of progressive tax reforms would leave it completely intact. The ... wealth [of the superrich] consists almost entirely of stock in the companies they’ve built or invested in. Instead of selling their assets to make major purchases, the superrich can use them as collateral to secure loans, which, because they must eventually be repaid, are also not considered taxable income. You might think this couldn’t possibly go on forever. Eventually, the rich will need to sell off some of their assets to pay back the loan. That brings us to step three: die. According to a provision of the tax code known as “stepped-up basis”\"or, more evocatively, the “angel of death” loophole\"when an individual dies, the value that their assets gained during their lifetime becomes immune to taxation. Those assets can then be sold by the billionaire’s heirs to pay off any outstanding loans without them having to worry about taxes. All of this is completely, perfectly legal. The strategy has basically killed the entire concept of an income tax for the wealthiest individuals. The result is a two-tiered tax system: one for the many, who earn their income through wages and pay taxes, and another for the few, who accumulate wealth through paper assets and largely do not pay taxes . Note: Average individuals also pay more in taxes than major corporations.

BACA is an organization, or corporation, not to be confused with a motorcycle club, whose impact statement reads, “No child deserves to live in fear!” BACA is much more than a group that gets together to ride motorcycles. BACA members’ sole purpose is to do all they can to create a safer environment for abused children, according to Tyson “The Kidd” Hamilton, BACA’s Utah State President. BACA members are ready at any time and any place to support children who have been abused. Members work with local law enforcement and other officials to protect children from further abuse. They consider children to be a part of their organization. They form friendships with the children to let them know they have someone in their corner, even if it’s just a few bikers. The children they empower get to choose their own road name when they receive a vest with a kids’ patch on the back that states “empowered.” Members of BACA will attend court, visit families where they feel safe, and respond to the child’s needs when they are in fear. Although BACA members don’t condone violence or physical force, they are always prepared to protect abused children from further abuse . “We go to court with children, because when they are testifying, they’re scared,” Hamilton explained. “We give kids support at their homes 365 days a year, 24/7. If they call us at 2 a.m. and they’re scared, we are going to respond.

PIE operated legally in the UK for a decade from 1974 until the mid-1980s, lobbying publicly for a change in the age of consent proposing in 1977 that there shouldn’t be one at all. PIE members received a magazine, Magpie, which included news, non-nude photographs of children and a “contact page”. PIE was disbanded in 1984 after several prosecutions relating to child pornography and conspiracy to promote indecent acts via the contact page. There were more than 300 names on the member list that Renton now had in his possession, a number of which he already knew. The police had the list from the late 1970s , Renton says. He and his team were able to find further information for around 45 per cent of the names on the list and discovered that half of these had convictions or cautions, or had been charged and died before trial, for sexual offences against children. And 65 members, Renton notes, “worked in what we now call regulated professions, which are child facing. “We’ve got about 30 teachers, as well as social workers, clergy, doctors .

Wyden is calling on the Department of Justice, the Treasury and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to “lift the veil” on financial support for Epstein. Wyden sent a letter to the federal agencies, providing the new findings from the committee’s investigation, which is looking into payments of at least $158 million from Black to Epstein for “purported tax and estate planning advice.” Wyden says the investigation led to new evidence through federal government records that show funds from Black to Epstein were used to finance Epstein’s sex trafficking operations . The Finance Committee also obtained a 2023 settlement agreement between Black and the Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Under the $62 million settlement, Black gained immunity from criminal prosecution in the USVI for financially supporting Epstein, according to Wyden, noting the settlement acknowledges “Jeffrey Epstein used the money Black paid him to partially fund his operations.” A major U.S. bank waited seven years to report Black’s payments to Epstein to the Treasury Department.

Lena Cohen, a technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that data brokers like Publicis collect “as much information as they can” about web users. “The data broker industry is under-regulated, opaque, and dangerous, because as you saw in the video, brokers have detailed information on billions of people, but we know relatively little about them,” Cohen said. “ You don’t know what information a data broker has on you, who they’re selling it to, and what the people who buy your data are doing with it. There’s a real power/knowledge asymmetry .” Even when state-level privacy regulations are passed (such as the California Consumer Privacy Law ), those cases are often not given enough focus or resources for the laws to be enforced effectively. “Most government agencies don’t have the resources to enforce privacy laws at the scale that they’re being broken,” Cohen said. Cohen added that she felt online behavioral advertisingthat is, advertising that is based on an individual web user’s specific browsing activity\"should be illegal.

Local currencies were common until the 19th century, when the newly emerging nation states transitioned to a centralized system of government-issued money as a way of consolidating their power and stabilizing the economy. Far from being a neutral system of exchange, a currency is a tool to achieve certain goals. Inequality and unsustainability are baked into our monetary system, which is based on debt and interest with practically all the money ... being created by private banks when issuing loans. Well-designed community currencies eliminate two main sources of financial inequality: money’s perceived inherent value and the interest rates, which both incentivize people to hoard their money . Like the pipes that bring water to your house, money is the conduit that gives you access to goods and services. The value of money is created in the transaction. In 2015 it was estimated that almost 400 of them are active in Spain alone , and across Africa blockchain-backed systems, like the Sarafu in Kenya, help underserved communities do business without conventional money.

The order bans federal officials from any conduct that would “unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen.” It also prohibits taxpayer resources from being used to curtail free speech and instructs the Department of Justice and other agencies to investigate the actions the Biden administration took and to propose “remedial actions.” Limiting communication and coordination between Big Tech companies and the federal government could jeopardize public safety in natural disasters and health emergencies, some observers warned. Multiple lawsuits have accused the Biden administration of leaning on social media platforms to take down lawful speech about the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently backed up those claims, alleging senior administration officials pressured his employees to inappropriately take down or throttle content during the pandemic.

Jacobs told ABC News that officials at Guantanamo Bay said it cost $16 million to stand up the migrant camp, noting that each tent allegedly cost $3.1 million to construct, despite not being up to DHS standards.

Mike Faulk, a spokesperson for the Washington state attorney general’s office, said testimony in the minimum-wage issue highlights the problem with housing detainees in private prisons: profit motive. Not only did GEO pay $1 a day for cleaning in Tacoma, it budgeted less than $1 per meal that each detainee ate, one kitchen worker testified. “So the grade of food is abysmal,” Faulk said of the detainee’s testimony. “He routinely picked out grasshoppers/insects from the food.” Conditions in Tacoma are worsening as the number of detainees rises.

Both tribunals ... found the Trump and Biden administrations complicit in heavily funding state-sponsored killings in the Philippines. The killings targeted not only drug users, but also dissidents and activists as well . Duterte established, and Marcos beefed up and continued, the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict, or NTF-ELCAC, which immediately weaponized the Philippines civilian bureaucracy to go after government critics and activists on the grounds that they were fronts for the Communist Party of the Philippines. With no due process, activists under Duterte and Marcos continued to be systematically killed, illegally arrested, and targeted by state forces, even going as far as to be subjected to abduction, torture, and forced to sign affidavits claiming to be captured guerrillas.

From 2016-2022, Duterte’s government carried out a campaign of mass killings of suspected drug users. It’s estimated that 27,000 people , most of them poor and indigent, were executed without trial by police officers and vigilantes at his behest. Children were also routinely killed during Duterte’s drug raids- both as collateral victims and as targets. While this happened, the United States provided tens of millions of dollars annually to both the Philippine military and the Philippine National Police. Many of the killings examined by [Human Rights Watch] followed a pattern: a group of plainclothes gunmen would enter the home of a suspected drug user, kill them without ever issuing an arrest, and plant drugs or weapons next to the body . Sometimes the gunmen would self-identify as police officers, and other times they would not. Police would also detain suspected drug users without charges and torture them for bribes. Less than a month after Duterte took office, then- Secretary of State John Kerry announced a $32 million weapons and training package specifically to support the Philippine National Police. Obama’s administration authorized $90 million in military aid to the Philippines in 2016 and roughly $1 billion during the 8 years he was in office.

Joshua Caleb Sutter firmly fits into this framework. A longtime occultist and neo-Nazi, Sutter became an FBI informant roughly 20 years ago. Since then, he’s earned at least $140,000 infiltrating a range of far-right organizations, most notoriously the Atomwaffen Division (AWD) starting in 2017. WIRED found evidence of Sutter’s extensive influence on and promotion of an international child abuse network that goes alternatively by “com” or “764.” 764, as WIRED reported in March along with The Washington Post ... is the target of an international law enforcement investigation, with more than a dozen members arrested in the United States, Europe, and Brazil. Participants in 764 and its affiliated splinter groups like CLVT, 7997, H3ll, and Harm Nation extort minors into sexually exploiting or harming themselves. They find minors via Instagram, Roblox, Minecraft, and other popular games and social media apps where children congregate online. “The informant market is run on this tacit, uncomfortable understanding that the cure sometimes might be worse than the disease,” [Harvard Law School professor Alexandra] Natapoff tells WIRED. By utilizing people with criminal or extremist histories to infiltrate hard-to-penetrate milieus like gangs, organized crime, or terrorist groups ... the US government rewards such people for continuing to swim in the same waters. “Baked into that arrangement is the well-understood, avoidable phenomenon that these individuals are going to commit criminal acts,” Natapoff says. According to a New York University Law School study, 41 percent of all federal terrorism cases after 9/11 involve the use of a confidential source. Note: US agencies used at least 1,000 ex-Nazis as spies and informants during the Cold War. Nazi doctors were also used to teach mind control methods to the CIA . For more along these lines, a Human Rights Watch report found that the nearly all of the highest-profile domestic terrorism plots in the US since 9/11 featured the direct involvement of government agents or informants.

This week, Mexico’s leaders voted to enshrine that concept in the Constitution, declaring native corn “an element of national identity” and banning the planting of genetically modified seeds . The measure, which aims to protect Mexico’s thousands of varieties of heirloom corn from engineered versions sold by American companies, has become a nationalist rallying cry. “Corn is Mexico,” President Claudia Sheinbaum said recently, describing the reform as a way to secure Mexico’s sovereignty. “We have to protect it for biodiversity but also culturally, because corn is what intrinsically links us to our origins, to the resistance of Indigenous peoples.” The amendment to the Constitution comes after the defeat in December of a related effort that sought to phase out all imports of genetically modified corn. Then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador issued a presidential decree in 2023 banning the use of genetically engineered corn in dough and tortillas and for animal feed and industrial use, but a trade dispute panel ruled that it violated the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Mexico agreed to abide by the panel’s ruling, and this week’s action targets seeds, not all products. “There’s a disturbing level of contamination of native maize with genetically modified traits,” said Timothy Wise, a researcher at the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University.

The number of young people behind bars increased steadily in the 1970s and 1980s and then rose more sharply in the 1990s. In the last two years for which we have data, 2021 and 2022, the number of incarcerated juveniles rose 10 percent. But even factoring in that increase, the country locked up 75 percent fewer juveniles in 2022 than it did in 2000. With fewer juveniles behind bars, many states have shuttered youth facilities. Today America has 58 percent fewer of them than it did in 2000. Beginning in 2008, New York State closed 26 juvenile jails; over the next 12 years, juvenile crime in the state declined 86 percent. [Susan Burke, director of Utah’s juvenile justice system from 2011 to 2018] sees it similarly: “ When judges worried that crime would go up if we closed the assessment centers, I could show them data that it was already dropping. Then I could go back and show them data a year later that it was still declining. At that point, what could they say?” Exposé after exposé piled up to prove to the public what many insiders already knew: The biggest recidivists in the system were the institutions. In early 2004, a series of expert reports documented rampant violence and cruelty. Custom-built individual cages where youth deemed violent received their school lessons. Video footage from a facility in Stockton showed counselors kneeling on the backs and necks of prisoners, beating and kicking the motionless young people. Six months later, The San Jose Mercury News published a multipart exposé revealing that youth were regularly tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed and forced into solitary confinement.

Of the 505 abuse claims, only 20% met the prison system’s onerous criteria for sexual assault or “improper sexual activity with a person in custody.” On the outside, fewer than half of sexual violence cases are reported to police. Given the power dynamics of prison, underreporting is likely more severe here. Guards use a variety of methods to retaliate against women who complain about their abuse.

The commercial satellite industry saw global revenue rise to $285 billion in 2023, driven largely by the growth of SpaceX’s Starlink constellation. While the democratization of space is a positive development, it has introduced ... an ethical quandary that I call the “double dual-use dilemma.” The double dual-use dilemma refers to how private space companies themselves\"not just their technologies\"can become militarized and integrated into national security while operating commercially. Space companies fluidly shift between civilian and military roles. Their expertise in launch systems, satellites, and surveillance infrastructure allows them to serve both markets, often without clear regulatory oversight. Companies like Walchandnagar Industries in India, SpaceX in the United States, and the private Chinese firms that operate under a national strategy of the Chinese Communist Party called Military-Civil Fusion exemplify this trend, maintaining commercial identities while actively supporting defense programs . This blurring of roles, including the possibility that private space companies may develop their own weapons, raises concerns over unchecked militarization and calls for stronger oversight.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the CIA acquired a 250-page KGB report recounting the events that transpired after a platoon fired at a flying saucer over Ukraine. The report included eyewitness accounts and pictures of the aftermath. The report claims Soviets conducting a training exercise in Ukraine spotted a “low-flying spaceship in the shape of a saucer” soaring above their heads. During the encounter, one of the Soviets fired a surface-to-air missile, which struck the UFO and sent it crashing to the ground. “It fell to Earth not far away, and five short humanoids with ‘large heads and large black eyes’ emerged from it,” the report claims. After escaping the debris of their ruined ship, the beings huddled together and “merged into a single object that acquired a spherical shape,” the surviving soldiers recalled . “In a few seconds, the spheres grew much bigger and exploded by flaring up with an extremely bright light. At that very instant, 23 soldiers who had watched the phenomenon turned into ... stone poles,” the report states. “Only two soldiers who stood in the shade and were less exposed to the luminous explosion survived,” it added. The KGB allegedly took custody of the “petrified soldiers” and the ruined spacecraft, which were transported to a secret base near Moscow.

In the years that followed, a flurry of other research illuminated further deleterious effects of loneliness. There is no singular driver of collective loneliness globally. But one practice designed to relieve us from the ills of the world \" self-care, in its current form \" has pulled us away from one another, encouraging solitude over connection . America’s loneliness epidemic is multifaceted, but the rise of consumerist self-care that immediately preceded it seems to have played a crucial role in kicking the crisis into high gear \" and now, in perpetuating it. You see, the me-first approach that is a hallmark of today’s faux self-care doesn’t just contribute to loneliness, it may also be a product of it. Research shows self-centeredness is a symptom of loneliness.

Barnes is a former lobbyist for Syngenta, the Chinese state-owned giant that manufactures and sells a number of controversial pesticide products. Syngenta's atrazine-based herbicides, for instance, is banned in much of the world yet is widely used in American agriculture. It is linked to birth defects , low sperm quality , irregular menstrual cycles , and other fertility problems. The leadership of USDA is filled with personnel with similar backgrounds. Scott Hutchins, the undersecretary for research, is a former Dow Chemical executive at the firm’s pesticide division. Kailee Tkacz Buller, Rollins’s chief of staff, previously worked as the president of the National Oilseed Processors Association and Edible Oil Producers Association, groups that lobby for corn and other seed oil subsidies. Critics have long warned that industry influence at the USDA creates inherent conflicts of interest, undermining the agency's regulatory mission and public health mandates . The revolving door hires also highlight renewed tension with the “Make America Healthy Again” agenda promised by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. The 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans may serve as a test of whether establishment industry influence at the agencies will undermine MAHA promises.

Chauchat’s work takes place in dance studios, in exhibition spaces, on stages ... and increasingly dance gatherings in public spaces in Copenhagen, Barcelona, and of course Berlin, sprawled across the neighborhoods around where she lives. Strangers invite each other to dance as a practice of being with oneself and being with one another “without thinking about dance as self-expression, but instead thinking of dancing as relating.” I ask Chauchat what dancing means to her. “Dancing is a space where we can practice life. Because dancing is observing and being active at the same time. You perceive a situation, and you take part of it. I chose to see dancing as a form of relating. So for me it is never just dancing but always dancing with.” She sees dance as a way to offer something to someone, as a form of productive confusion, as a structure of unexamined trust. The dance gatherings, she says, give people a frame and therefore a safe space and opportunity to experience what dance can do: “You are not exposed to being a great dancer or a bad dancer.

The FBI’s forensic analysts quickly determined the laptop belonged to Hunter, had not been tampered with or altered in any way, and was suitable to be used in court. Yet the chat logs show that senior FBI officials instructed agents to say “No comment” when asked about the laptop during regular meetings with social media companies before the 2020 election. The FBI had spent weeks warning Facebook and Twitter about election interference in the form of Russian disinformation and had told Twitter to be on guard for a “hack and leak” operation “likely” involving Hunter Biden. In other words, the FBI “prebunked” The Post’s story so that the social media companies immediately censored it . The FBI knew The Post had received a hard-drive copy of the laptop from Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani because it had a covert surveillance warrant on the former mayor’s iCloud.

Originally collected to facilitate health care, eligibility for services and the administration of public services, this information is now shared across government agencies and with private companies, reshaping the infrastructure of public services into a mechanism of control . Once confined to separate bureaucracies, data now flows freely through a network of interagency agreements, outsourcing contracts and commercial partnerships built up in recent decades. Key to this data repurposing are public-private partnerships. The DHS and other agencies have turned to third-party contractors and data brokers to bypass direct restrictions. These intermediaries also consolidate data from social media, utility companies, supermarkets and many other sources , enabling enforcement agencies to construct detailed digital profiles of people without explicit consent or judicial oversight. Palantir, a private data firm and prominent federal contractor, supplies investigative platforms to agencies. These platforms aggregate data from various sources \" driver’s license photos , social services , financial information , educational data \" and present it in centralized dashboards designed for predictive policing and algorithmic profiling. Data collected under the banner of care could be mined for evidence to justify placing someone under surveillance.

Magazine In 2016, a coalition of media, tech, and community organizations launched the Equitable Internet Initiative, a project that will result in the construction of wireless broadband internet networks across three underserved Detroit neighborhoods. Leading the initiative is the Detroit Community Technology Project, a digital justice project sponsored by Allied Media Projects . “During the economic and housing crisis, communities had to fend for themselves,” [executive director of DCTP Diana] Nucera says. That’s why, she explains, “we developed this approach called community technology.” The coalition raised just under $1 million from local and national foundations. Funds were used to hire employees, buy equipment, and internet bandwidth. They purchased three discounted wholesale gigabit connections from Rocket Fiber, a Detroit-based high-speed internet service provider. Their contract with Rocket Fiber allows the coalition to share its connection with the communitya provision not allowed by other companies. Each neighborhood is represented by a partnering organization, whose locale is used as the central connection hub for service. The community members are responsible for installation. DCTP trains a representative of the partnering organization, who then trains five to seven neighbors to install the equipment. “Being a digital steward was completely out of the range of what I usually do,” [neighbor and digital steward Roston] says. “I was so used to using the internet ... but I didn’t know how internet networks work.” So far, he’s helped with getting 19 of the 50 designated households in the Islandview neighborhood online. The bottom-up approach ... strengthens community relationships, increases civic engagement, and redistributes political and economic power to otherwise marginalized neighborhoods. “If the community has ownership of the infrastructure, then they’re more likely to participate in its maintenance, evolution, and innovation,” [Nucera] explains. “That’s what we believe leads to sustainability.” Note: More than 750 American communities have built their own internet networks.

The research , published in the Journal of Management, Spirituality & Religion , found that after brushing against death, employees frequently reprioritize their professional lives. Many shift away from pursuing money, status, and career advancement toward seeking meaningful work and authentic relationships with colleagues and clients. Near-death experiences (NDEs) are deeply personal experiences that some people report after almost losing their lives. These experiences can include sensations such as floating above one’s body, reviewing moments from one’s life, encountering spiritual beings, and feeling a profound sense of unity and love. Many participants reported that traditional career achievements and financial success plummeted in importance following their close call with death . The researchers identified six major themes: insights and new realizations, personal transformations, reprioritization of work, job changes, motivation, and changed relationships. Most participants reported profound spiritual insights following their NDEs. These weren’t just abstract philosophical ideas but deeply felt revelations that reshaped their identities. Common realizations included beliefs that consciousness continues after death, that there exists a “collective oneness” among all people, and that life has an underlying purpose.

O’Brien, a registered nurse, had an impulse to move into hospice care over two decades ago and has since worked as an oncology nurse and a death doula, supporting those at the end of life. O’Brien’s recent book, The Good Death , aims to normalize the realities of death and the need to plan for the end. At the end of life, many people share what they didn’t do but knew they always wanted to do, O’Brien says.“We all are here for a purpose, and we all have gifts, and when we don’t share them and act upon those, that’s where the huge regret comes,” O’Brien says. Not “dipping into the unknown” or trying something new is a factor of having an abundance mindset, she says. When we consider our time sacred and limited, we are less afraid to take action on something that may excite us. “One of the things we don’t know is how many days we have,” she says. “When you get that feeling, or you have something that you want to do, don’t let your ego, the fear part of you, shut it down.” Many people at the end of life regret not being vulnerable enough to let themselves be loved and give love. They often share that they could not reach a level of forgiveness with someone else or themselves, O’Brien says. It’s essential to extend ourselves grace, know when to take ownership, and release guilt, she says. O’Brien encourages patients to envision the time they’re struggling to let go of and ask themselves if they did what they could in the moment with the information and resources they had.

People outside the Pentagon are warning about the potential risks of this plan, including Heidy Khlaaf ... at the AI Now Institute. She says this rush to incorporate generative AI into military decision-making ignores more foundational flaws of the technology : “We’re already aware of how LLMs are highly inaccurate, especially in the context of safety-critical applications that require precision.” Khlaaf adds that even if humans are “double-checking” the work of AI, there's little reason to think they're capable of catching every mistake. “‘Human-in-the-loop’ is not always a meaningful mitigation,” she says.

In court, Mr. Baluchi is charged as Ali Abdul Aziz Ali. He is the nephew of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the man accused of masterminding the plot. The judge, Col. Matthew N. McCall, wrote that it was easy to focus on the torture because it was “so absurdly far outside the norms of what is expected of U.S. custody preceding law enforcement questioning.” “However,” he added, “the three and a half years of uncharged, incommunicado detention and essentially solitary confinement all while being continually questioned and conditioned \" is just as egregious” as the physical torture .

The invoice also reminded LaVia that he owed another $2,751.46 in fees from previous jail stints there, which brought his total debt to just over $17,000. LaVia had only two months to pay off the debt, the invoice warned, until it would be turned over to a collection agency. In September, Dauphin County’s commissioners voted to forgive the nearly $66 million in pay-to-stay debt looming over formerly incarcerated people and their families . The move, championed by a commissioner who won in 2023 after running on jail reform, followed a 2022 decision by the commission that ended pay-to-stay fees but had not erased people’s previous debts for jail stays. LaVia Jones said the decision to finally forgive the outstanding jail debt will help her son move on with his life, calling it “a huge relief.” “The longer you sat in jail, the more debt you incurred, the more debt your family incurred. People sit there pretrial for one year, two years. It’s so wrong,” she said. “So this really helps him to move on with his life.” Local groups ... argued for years that the pay-to-stay scheme worked against efforts at successful re-entry for people released from jail, who are typically poor and who are almost always more concerned with basic survival and staying free than with settling debts.

At the helm of this transformation is Njambi Njoroge, Operations Director at Grassroots Economics. Grassroots Economics is built on a concept called commitment pooling,\" inspired by indigenous economic systems. Traditionally, in Kenyan villages, neighbours would come together to build houses, farm land, or provide childcare, repaying each other in labor rather than money. These informal debts balanced themselves over time, ensuring that no one was left behind . \"We're not inventing anything new,\" Njoroge says. \"We're automating what has always existed.\" Using blockchain, Grassroots Economics formalizes these commitments into digital vouchers\"secure, trackable tokens that represent labor, goods, or services. The blockchain-powered system functions as a local exchange, where people contribute their skills and pull from a shared pool of community resources. The technology ensures that every commitment has a unique digital signature, preventing fraud and allowing real-time tracking of transactions. \"On our platform, Sarafu.network , you can see all the transactions happening in a village\"how many houses were built, how many farms were tilled, how much labor was exchanged,\" Njoroge explains. With blockchain, communities can see tangible data showing how much work they've accomplished together.

At the heart of the case is a deeply controversial and, according to experts, unprecedented policy implemented at Women’s Huron Valley Correctional Facility, the only women’s prison in Michigan. Under the Michigan Department of Corrections policy directive, prison guards were instructed to wear activated body cameras while conducting routine strip searches, capturing video of women in states of complete undress. The suit, brought by the firm Flood Law, alleges a range of abuses, including lewd comments from prison guards during recorded searches, and long-term psychological trauma inflicted on women, many of whom are survivors of sexual violence. Attorneys for the 20 Jane Does listed on the suit and hundreds of others on retainer argued that this practice not only deprived women of their dignity, but also violated widely accepted detention standards . No other state in the country permits such recordings; many have explicit prohibitions against filming individuals during unclothed searches, recognizing the inherent risk of abuse and the acute vulnerability of the people being searched.

Then came the CIA’s psychic army. as reported by San Francisco Chronicle (San Francisco's Leading Newspaper) In April of 1972, Russell Targ, a Columbia-trained physicist with an unusual interest in the paranormal, met with the Office of Scientific Intelligence , a secretive branch of the CIA that monitored biological warfare, nuclear weapons and guided missiles during the Cold War. Their Soviet enemies, who had likely been experimenting with drugs, hypnotism, yoga and black magic, were now reportedly moving inanimate objects with their minds. From a military standpoint, the implications were horrifying. So the U.S. government brokered a deal: For an initial investment of $874, or just under $7,000 in today’s dollars, Targ and his colleague, fellow physicist Harold Puthoff, would test the feasibility of using psychic spies at their Menlo Park lab. The operation, called Stargate , would go on to explore whether ordinary civilians could locate clandestine military facilities across the world using their hidden third eye. According to archived news reports, in total, officials spent $20 million on the secret program. Almost immediately, “curious” data started to emerge: Subjects began describing secret locations thousands of miles away with frightening accuracy. Others reportedly levitated small weights with their minds, while some allegedly controlled temperatures and read information inside sealed envelopes . One man, Patrick Price, who later became known as the SRI’s “ psychic treasure ,” was especially prolific. “We want to make it clear,” [Targ] told reporters in 1976, “that the functioning is ordinary, rather than extraordinary.

At the time, Reyes was struggling with depression, post-traumatic stress and substance abuse. “I had a really hard drug habit after all these intense combat tours,” he admits, but diving in the Caymans, surrounded by vibrant marine life, reignited a sense of wonder . “It brought me back to life. It inspired the same kind of protective spirit and willingness to go fight in the battlefield that I used in the Marine Corps, but now I wanted to use that passion to fight for ocean conservation.” In 2016, Reyes, Ritterhoff and Keith Sahm co-founded Force Blue , a nonprofit that recruits veterans \" especially Navy SEALs and Special Operations divers with military dive training \" to channel their skills into marine conservation. “We’re learning to transfer combat diving expertise into protecting and providing refuge for this incredible aquatic environment,” Reyes explains.

An AI safety researcher and one of the top minds in the field, he served for years as the chief scientist of OpenAI. There he had the explicit goal of creating deep learning neural networks so advanced they would one day be able to think and reason just as well as, if not better than, any human. Artificial general intelligence, or simply AGI, is the official term for that goal. According to excerpts published by The Atlantic ... part of those plans included a doomsday shelter for OpenAI researchers. “We’re definitely going to build a bunker before we release AGI,” Sutskever told his team in 2023. Sutskever reasoned his fellow scientists would require protection at that point, since the technology was too powerful for it not to become an object of intense desire for governments globally. “Of course, it’s going to be optional whether you want to get into the bunker,” he assured fellow OpenAI scientists. Sutskever knows better than most what the awesome capabilities of AI are. He was part of an elite trio behind the 2012 creation of AlexNet , often dubbed by experts as the Big Bang of AI. Recruited by Elon Musk personally to join OpenAI three years later, he would go on to lead its efforts to develop AGI. But the launch of its ChatGPT bot accidentally derailed his plans by unleashing a funding gold rush the safety-minded Sutskever could no longer control.

The other has the obvious response: “He doesn’t want to know how much C.P. we have ignored for the past five years?” C.P. is short for child pornography. One private memo acknowledged that videos with apparent child sexual abuse had been viewed 684 million times before being removed. Pornhub produced these documents during discovery in a civil suit by an Alabama woman who beginning at age 16 was filmed engaging in sex acts, including at least once when she was drugged and then raped . These videos of her were posted on Pornhub and amassed thousands of views. One discovery memo showed that there were 155,447 videos on Pornhub with the keyword “12yo.” Other categories that the company tracked were “11yo,” “degraded teen,” “under 10” and “extreme choking.” (It has since removed these searches.)

With the rapid turnover of electronic gadgets, e-waste has become the fastest-growing waste stream globally, reaching 62 million tonnes in 2022, and only 22.3 percent of this was formally collected and recycled, leaving vast amounts of valuable materials unused. Professor Raffaele Mezzenga and scientist Mohammad Peydayesh led the ETH Zurich team in developing a method that utilizes “whey”, the liquid byproduct of cheese-making. By processing whey proteins into amyloid fibrils, they created a sponge-like aerogel capable of selectively absorbing gold ions from acidic solutions derived from e-waste.

The sponge drew out gold that was about 90.8 percent pure, yielding a 22-carat nugget weighing approximately 450 milligrams. The research team is also exploring the use of other food industry byproducts, like pea protein and fish collagen, to diversify the sources of the aerogel.

Many of these diseases are metabolic: obesity, diabetes, and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. Others involve the immune system, such as asthma, allergies, and autoimmune disorders. Still others are psychiatric, such as depression and anxiety. Perhaps the most baffling development is the massive spike in autism spectrum disorder. This once-rare condition reportedly affects one in 31 American children.

Few users start with fentanyl. Experts date the start of the opioid epidemic to within three years of the approval of OxyContin in 1995. Reports from emergency departments across the US showed Purdue’s pills were being crushed and injected or snorted as early as 1997. “My eyes popped open,” recalls one FDA medical officer of seeing the reports. “Nobody wanted to see it for what it was. You would’ve had to have your head in the sand not to know that there was something wrong.” By 2000, Purdue was selling $1.1 billion annually in OxyContin. Higher doses led to higher profit. Sales reps were coached accordingly. In five years, oxycodone prescribing had surged 402%, and hospital emergency room mentions of oxycodone were up 346%. By 2012, OxyContin sales were almost $3 billion annually. And many other companies were cashing in. In the preceding six years, 76 billion opioid pills had been produced and shipped across the US, as the FDA faced a national crisis of epic proportions. In the 2010s, the US, with less than 5% of the global population, was consuming 80% of the world’s oxycodone.

There’s a good chance much of the windfall will not go to any of the roughly 200 victims whom the disgraced financier abused when they were teenagers or young women . Those victims have already received monetary settlements from the estate, which required them to sign broad releases that gave up the right to bring future claims against it or individuals associated with it. The money is more likely to be distributed to one of Mr. Epstein’s former girlfriends and two of his long-term advisers, who have been named the beneficiaries of his estate. Just one major federal civil lawsuit remains pending against the executors of the estate, a potential class action filed on behalf victims who haven’t yet settled with the estate. In the past, victims have received settlements ranging from $500,000 to $2 million.

In March 2019, the Department of Justice served a 100-page lawsuit against Mallinckrodt, alleging illegal marketing of Acthar, bribing doctors to boost sales and defrauding government health care programs.

The paper was viewed millions of times within days and made the authors go-to experts in the media on the novel coronavirus. It wasn’t until Freedom of Information Act requests and lawsuits revealed Fauci’s emails that the public became aware of his involvement with the conception of that paper. “It is indeed striking that this virus is so closely related to SARS yet is behaving so differently.

Last year the annual number of papers retracted by research journals topped 10,000 for the first time. Most analysts believe the figure is only the tip of an iceberg of scientific fraud . The startling rise in the publication of sham science papers has its roots in China, where young doctors and scientists seeking promotion were required to have published scientific papers. Shadow organisations \" known as “paper mills” \" began to supply fabricated work for publication in journals there. The practice has since spread to India, Iran, Russia, former Soviet Union states and eastern Europe, with paper mills supplying fabricated studies to more and more journals as increasing numbers of young scientists try to boost their careers by claiming false research experience. In some cases, journal editors have been bribed to accept articles, while paper mills have managed to establish their own agents as guest editors who then allow reams of falsified work to be published. One study , by Nature, revealed that in 2013 there were just over 1,000 retractions. In 2022, the figure topped 4,000 before jumping to more than 10,000 last year.

For example, in 2017, the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a public records request seeking documents regarding the NYPD’s monitoring of protesters’ social media activity. The NYPD initially responded with a blanket statement that it could “neither confirm nor deny” whether such records existed, saying that even revealing the existence of records could harm national security. A New York court rejected this argument.

Michael Langley, the head of AFRICOM, offered a grim assessment of security on the African continent during a recent press conference. The West African Sahel, he said last Friday, was now the “epicenter of terrorism” and the gravest terrorist threats to the U.S. homeland were “unfortunately right here on the African continent.” Throughout all of Africa, the State Department counted 23 deaths from terrorist violence in 2002 and 2003 , the first years of U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the Sahel and Somalia. By 2010, two years after AFRICOM began operations, fatalities from attacks by militant Islamists had already spiked to 2,674 . There were an estimated 18,900 fatalities linked to militant Islamist violence in Africa last year , with 79 percent of those coming from the Sahel and Somalia. This constitutes a jump of more than 82,000 percent since the U.S. launched its post-9/11 counterterrorism efforts on the continent. As violence spiraled in the region over the past decades, at least 15 officers who benefited from U.S. security assistance were key leaders in 12 coups in West Africa and the greater Sahel during the war on terror. At least five leaders of the 2023 coup d’état in [Niger] received American assistance. Note: Learn more about the US military's shadow wars in Africa .

Experiments against a control group showed that plastics were mostly trapped on the outside of the water hyacinth's root systems. The few that get inside the plant are quickly separated before nutrients get to the leaves. Typically, plants exposed to microplastics suffer ill effects. Water hyacinths are native to South America.

Not long ago, Arkansas had to issue a statement on the threat water hyacinths posed to agriculture. On the flip side, microplastics are a scourge. They'll often end up in the fish we catch, and once eaten by humans, they can cause problems with the endocrine, immune, and reproductive systems. Despite their rapid proliferation, it may still be worth strategically deploying water hyacinths. Other studies have shown that water hyacinths can also absorb heavy metals and agricultural runoff .

Each of Hiro Technologies' MycoDigestible Diapers comes with a packet of fungi to be added to the dirty diaper before it is thrown in the trash. After a week or two, the fungi are activated by moisture from feces, urine and the environment to begin the process of biodegradation . An estimated 4 million tons of diapers were disposed of in the United States in 2018, with no significant recycling or composting. Diapers take hundreds of years to naturally break down. That means the very first disposable diaper ever used is still in a landfill somewhere. To tackle this, Hiro Technologies turned to fungi. These organisms - which include mushrooms, molds, yeasts and mildew - derive nutrients from decomposing organic matter. In 2011, Yale University researchers discovered a type of fungus in Ecuador that can feed on polyurethane, a common polymer in plastic products. They figured the fungus, Pestalotiopsis microspora, would be capable of surviving on plastic in environments lacking oxygen, like landfills.

The increase in so-called megafarms across Europe comes as the number of small farms has reduced dramatically , and the income gap between large and small farms has increased.

Earlier this year, the FDA denied the petition to ban the drug. While 26 countries have approved ractopamine use in livestock, more than 165 have banned or restricted it, and many have set restrictions on or have altogether prohibited the import of pork and beef from ractopamine-fed animals.

The new policies could threaten a key source of revenue to advertising and media companies, as well as the US pharmaceutical industry. Companies spent $10.8 billion in 2024 on direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising in total. Before the loosening of advertising regulations by the Food and Drug Administration in 1997, US pharma companies had to list all possible side effects for a medication if they wanted to mention which condition the drug being advertised was intended to treat. Reading out a list of side effects took so long it drove up the cost for air time and meant there wasn’t as much broadcast advertising as there is today.

Poring through the data, Blumke landed on some startling statistics: 68% of all veterans seen at least one time for care at the VA in 2019 had been prescribed psychotropic drugs, and 28% were issued prescriptions for antidepressants. “It should be zero shock that veterans have the suicide rates we do,” Blumke said. “Veteran suicide rates are two to two and a half times that of the civilian population. Prescription rates of antidepressants and psychiatric drugs are of the same multiples, which are both the highest in the world.” Antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs have huge risk profiles, but doctors and counselors aren’t even being trained about these issues.

But there is shockingly little science behind the diagnosis of psychopathy, according to a new book by Rasmus Rosenberg Larsen. In “Psychopathy Unmasked: The Rise and Fall of a Dangerous Diagnosis,” Larsen argues that the widespread use of this personality disorder in legal settings has had massive and largely negative consequences in courts and prisons across the world. Hundreds of thousands of people suspected or convicted of crimes have been assessed with some version of the “Psychopathy Checklist” since its publication in 1991. Larsen ... found that incarcerated people with high scores were not significantly more likely to commit more crimes after release . Larsen suggests the diagnosis itself may be little more than a way to make some sentences harsher while scaring and titillating the wider public. Judges, parole boards and others in the justice system came to see people with the psychopathy diagnosis as chronic offenders, and could justify keeping them in prison for longer. They could withhold therapy because the emerging theory was that it’s a waste of time.

Take New Orleans, where, for the past two years, police officers have quietly received real-time alerts from a private network of AI-equipped cameras , flagging the whereabouts of people on wanted lists. In 2022, City Council members attempted to put guardrails on the use of facial recognition. But those guidelines assume it's the police doing the searching. New Orleans police have hundreds of cameras, but the alerts in question came from a separate system: a network of 200 cameras equipped with facial recognition and installed by residents and businesses on private property, feeding video to a nonprofit called Project NOLA. Police officers who downloaded the group's app then received notifications when someone on a wanted list was detected on the camera network, along with a location. That has civil liberties groups and defense attorneys in Louisiana frustrated. “ When you make this a private entity, all those guardrails that are supposed to be in place for law enforcement and prosecution are no longer there, and we don’t have the tools to ... hold people accountable ,” Danny Engelberg, New Orleans’ chief public defender, [said].

Blockchain experts call this “decentralization.” Decentralization offers the promise of nearly friction-free cooperation between members of complex networks that can add value to each other by enabling collaboration without central authorities and middle men. In a world without middle men, things get more efficient in unexpected ways . A 1% transaction fee may not seem like much, but down a 15-step supply chain, it adds up. These kinds of little frictions add just enough drag on the global economy that we’re forced to stick with short supply chains and deals done by the container load, because it’s simply too inefficient to have more links in the supply chain and to work with smaller transactions.

In a recent poll from Demand Progress, 81.6 percent of voters surveyed said they want leaders who break up monopolies, compared to just 47.3 percent who prioritize cutting government red tape. This poll suggests that the public supports a populist approach that confronts corporate power more than an abundance agenda that sidesteps it. It reflects a growing recognition: while bureaucratic inefficiencies certainly exist, corporations are blocking our abundance because scarcity is profitable. The scarcity that so many Americans feel in their daily lives is not by accident, it’s by design. Companies block abundance by strategically reducing output and access to goods and services. Artificial scarcity is a business strategy . One that prioritizes profit maximization over widespread availability, ensuring that demand consistently outstrips supply. This deliberate restriction allows companies to command higher prices. Concentration makes it easier to manufacture scarcity. When a few large players dominate the market, they can manipulate the fundamental dynamics of supply and demand and charge high economic rents . This is made possible by an economic and political system that corporations have spent decades reshaping to suit their needs.

The calculations revealed a statistically significant connection between unequal distribution of income and the outbreak of civil wars. The results can be verified using historical events: for example, land was extremely unequally distributed in Russia before the October revolution of 1917\"and this critically contributed to the outbreak of revolution and civil war, a marker that was also identified by the new benchmark with a correspondingly high probability. The new benchmark also makes it possible to predict the risk of civil war today: \"In the U.S. the inequality in income distribution has risen sharply in the past 30 years. Accordingly, the risk of a civil war in the U.S. has risen drastically from 10% to 21%,\" says Baten .

Most of that business had been conducted at one institution: TD Bank.

There was the group from Manhattan’s Diamond District using bogus gold sales to launder money. The Colombian drug traffickers using TD debit cards to bring their US profits back home. And the human trafficking ring that claimed to be an HVAC company when it opened an account. The more investigators looked at TD, the more money laundering they found. Last year, TD’s American subsidiary became the first US bank ever to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering.

And I remember what it feels like to be on the brink the death, begging to God for a second chance. I learned about the verse in the Holy Koran chapter 5, verse 32 where it says that saving a life is like saving the entire mankind and taking a life is like taking the life of entire mankind. I was extremely convinced I needed to go the extra mile to save the life of the man. When we launched our global campaign to save the life of my attacker he heard from his lawyer that’s one of his victims was running a campaign to save his life. And he told his lawyer, I do not believe it, I never said sorry, I never apologized and destroyed their lives, especially his life, and now he forgave me and is running a campaign to save my life, he was released to tears, he said I don’t deserve that, I’m someone unforgivable. He wrote a letter to me from death row and in one paragraph this is what he said, that my stepfather taught me some lessons that I should have never learned. So when he learned about our campaign he went to tremendous transformation and talked about world peace, mercy, justice, peace, hate crimes and how he was wrong, what went wrong in his life, and how he ended up killing people. He was in peace before he was executed .\" Note: Watch Bhuiyan's powerful 17-min PBS interview .

The hippocampus plays a critical role in memory, learning, and emotional regulation. In 2013 , Jonas Frisén and his team at Karolinska Institutet made headlines when they demonstrated that new neurons could form in this region during adulthood. Despite this earlier discovery, questions remained. In particular, scientists lacked direct evidence that the cells responsible for generating new neurons, known as neural progenitor cells, are present and actively dividing in adult human brains. “We have now been able to identify these cells of origin, which confirms that there is an ongoing formation of neurons in the hippocampus of the adult brain,” says Jonas Frisén ... who led the research. The newly formed cells were located in a specific area of the hippocampus. This area is important for memory formation, learning, and cognitive flexibility. “This gives us an important piece of the puzzle in understanding how the human brain works,” explains Jonas Frisén. “Our research may also have implications for the development of regenerative treatments that stimulate neurogenesis in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.” Note: Explore more positive stories like this on healing our bodies . \" </s><|im_end|>\\n", "chunk_id": "wtkcsv:14016:6c353da29274", "wtk_id": 14016.0}, {"doc_idx": 38113, "dataset": "wtk_pipe_csv_260223", "filename": "260223WTK.csv", "source_url": "https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-pentagon-provided-24tn-private-arms-firms-fund-war-weapons-report-finds", "publisher": "WTK Archive", "found_on": "WTK Archive", "title": "", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Pentagon provided $2.4tn to private arms firms to ‘fund war and weapons’, report finds as reported by The Guardian (One of the UK's Leading Newspapers) A new study of defense department spending previewed exclusively to the Guardian shows that most of the Pentagon’s discretionary spending from 2020 to 2024 has gone to outside military contractors, providing a $2.4tn boon in public funds to private firms in what was described as a “continuing and massive transfer of wealth from taxpayers to fund war and weapons manufacturing”.

This trust, however, could be affected by the presence of conflicts of interest (CoIs), situations where a specific interest of the researcher could compromise the researcher’s impartiality. Academic research in fields such as economics, medicine, and many others is becoming more costly and often depends on funding or access to databases controlled by private parties . To what extent do these relationships undermine trust in research? In our new NBER working paper , we address this ... by examining how different types of CoIs shape perceptions of the trustworthiness of economic research. Trust in the results declined across all groups (on average by 30%) following the disclosure of a CoI, despite the research being peer-reviewed and published in a prestigious academic journal . This decline was moderated by expertise, with average Americans experiencing greater declines in trust than “elite” economists (who publish in the top journals). Nonetheless, even elite economists experienced a drop in trust. Financial incentives (such as funding) were not the sole or the most significant factor influencing trust. Instead, privileged access to data had the most pronounced effect. When research utilized private data aligned with the interests of the data provider, trust in the results decreased by over 20%. Trust dropped by approximately 50% if the data provider retained review rights over the research outcomes.

Echoing language that [Robert F.] Kennedy campaigned on, the report argued that “the American diet has shifted dramatically toward ultra-processed foods” and that “nearly 70% of children’s calories now come from UPFs, contributing to obesity, diabetes, and other chronic conditions”. “The greatest step the United States can take to reverse childhood chronic disease is to put whole foods produced by American farmers and ranchers at the center of healthcare,” the report found. It went on to describe the dismal state of nutrition research in the United States: “Government funding for nutrition research through the NIH is only 4-5% of its total budget and in some cases is subject to influence by food industry-aligned researchers.” Kennedy has ordered the FDA to explore how to eliminate a policy that allows food companies to decide themselves whether food additives are safe, called the Generally Recognized as Safe (Gras) loophole. “That’s a really, really big deal,” says Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. “Ninety-nine per cent of compounds in food were added through this loophole.” Several states are also pursuing policies that would limit spending from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) on “junk food”.

The FDA has begun making drug decision letters public and is publishing past decision letters retroactively. The historical lack of transparency about FDA decision-making has allowed companies to spin the information to investors and shareholders . For example, if an FDA rejection letter explains that the applicant did not meet agency standards and tells the company to perform a new clinical trial to be reconsidered for approval, the firm might mislead shareholders by saying that the FDA had just asked for a few minor things. A 2015 analysis by the FDA found that drug companies avoided mentioning 85 percent of the agency’s concerns about safety and efficacy when announcing publicly that their application had not been approved. In addition, when the FDA calls for a new clinical trial for safety or efficacy, that critical information is not disclosed about 40 percent of the time. As a result, capital can be wasted on futile therapies or companies misrepresenting their regulatory guidance. It is important to point out that when making decision letters public, the FDA will redact any trade secrets and confidential commercial information. At the same time, the deliberations of agency scientists are not the property of the drug’s sponsor. The FDA does not belong to the industry; it belongs to the American people.

There’s no good evidence that Elmiron works. When the government approved Elmiron in 1996, the manufacturer provided close to zero data that the drug effectively treated interstitial cystitis. Elmiron is just one of hundreds of drugs that have been approved by the FDA over the last several decades on the basis of flimsy or nonexistent evidence. Drug companies have been allowed to market hundreds of prescription drugs to doctors and sell them to unsuspecting patients despite glaringly inadequate evidence that they offer any benefit and in many cases amid clear signs that they pose a risk of serious, often irreparable harm .

Because that’s the foundation of industrial agriculture: all it cares about is how many tons of food it produces, with no regard for soil health , biodiversity or the wellbeing of farmers. Regenerative agriculture , on the other hand, shows us the opposite. It means collaborating with nature and recognizing that we are all living organisms on a living Earth. That is what farming should be about: regenerating the potential of the living soil, the living seeds, the living water, the living insects, and the entire web of life. By embracing this potential, we can also transform the way we relate to nature. Because regeneration writes its own poetry \" it brings the Earth back to life again in our minds and, in doing so, our relationship with the Earth is being regenerated as well.

Environmental groups sued the EPA over dicamba in 2020 because of its potential drift away from the intended target, especially during warmer temperatures, and harm neighboring crops, nearby ecosystems and rural communities. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled against the EPA and said the agency “understated the amount of dicamba damage.” The court determined that dicamba “caused substantial and undisputed damage” that tore the “social fabric of the farming communities.” After the court vacated the herbicide’s registration, the EPA re-registered it months later , and was again challenged by environmental groups.

What if these two technologies, each revolutionary in its own right, could solve each other’s greatest weaknesses? Imagine a future where blockchain networks are seamlessly efficient and scalable, thanks to AI’s problem-solving prowess, and where AI applications operate with full transparency and accountability by leveraging blockchain’s immutable record-keeping. This vision is taking shape today through a new wave of decentralized AI projects. Leading the charge, platforms like SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol, and Fetch.ai are showing how a convergence of AI and blockchain could not only solve each other’s biggest challenges but also redefine transparency, user control, and trust in the digital age. While AI’s potential is revolutionary, its centralized nature and opacity create significant concerns. Blockchain’s decentralized, immutable structure can address these issues, offering a pathway for AI to become more ethical, transparent, and accountable . Today, AI models rely on vast amounts of data, often gathered without full user consent. Blockchain introduces a decentralized model, allowing users to retain control over their data while securely sharing it with AI applications. This setup empowers individuals to manage their data’s use and fosters a safer, more ethical digital environment. Note: Watch our 13 minute video on the promise of blockchain technology .

SMUD analysts deemed one home suspicious because it was “4k [kWh], Asian,” and another suspicious because “multiple Asians have reported there.” Sacramento police sent accusatory letters in English and Chinese, but no other language, to residents who used above-average amounts of electricity.

Public radio news had devolved into a doctrinaire source of what I called “one story after another about instances of supposed racism, transphobia, signs of the climate apocalypse, Israel doing something bad, and the dire threat of Republican policies.” In 2020 alone, we dismissed the very possibility of a Covid lab leak in China, and our then\"managing editor refused even to cover Hunter Biden’s laptop, calling it “ not really ” a story.

When Raleigh resident Neal Shah had a claim denied for his wife’s chemotherapy drugs, he thought it was rare, that he was the only one, that it was just bad luck. Litigating his case on phone calls that lasted for hours changed the husband and father, and he set about creating a sophisticated app that uses artificial intelligence to compare claims denial forms against health insurance contracts, before automatically drafting an appeal letter. “For a doctor to write this, it’s not rocket science, but it still takes hours,” Shah told ABC News 11, adding that a well-written appeal letter, sent in immediately, can sometimes get denials reversed within days or weeks, but most people either don’t know they can appeal, or don’t know on what grounds they can appeal. In fact, according to Shah’s research, 850 million claims denials occur every year, and less than 1% are ever appealed. That’s where Counterforce Health comes in, a startup that’s created a free-to-use app for claims denials . For Counterforce Health, Shah brought onboard Riyaa Jadhav, a Jill of all trades who has helped grow and expand the undertaking.

Crossing Borders reaches over 10,000 people in person and online each year and organized 27 free concerts in 2024. “And when we hear audience members say our music defied their expectations or broadened their worldview, or that they felt their culture was affirmed and uplifted, we know we’re fulfilling our mission,” Clowes says.

Croat forces rampaged UN-protected areas of the self-declared Serb Republic of Krajina, looting, burning, raping and murdering their way across the province. Up to 350,000 locals fled, many on foot, never to return. Meanwhile, thousands were summarily executed. As these hideous scenes unfolded, UN peacekeepers charged with protecting Krajina watched without intervening. Meanwhile, US officials strenuously denied the horrifying massacres and mass displacement amounted to ethnic cleansing, let alone war crimes. Operation Storm was for all intents and purposes a NATO attack, carried out by soldiers armed and trained by the US and directly coordinated with other Western powers . Despite publicly endorsing a negotiated peace, Washington privately encouraged Zagreb to employ maximum belligerence, even as their ultranationalist Croat proxies plotted to strike with such ferocity that the country’s entire Serb population would “to all practical purposes disappear.” High-ranking Croat officials privately discussed methods to justify their coming blitzkrieg, including false flag attacks. In preparing for the offensive, Croatian soldiers were trained at Fort Irwin in California and the Pentagon aided in planning the operation.

Yet it’s partly funded by the U.S. government , and the BBC and Facebook both have Tor-only versions to allow users in authoritarian countries to reach them. At its simplest, Tor is a distributed digital infrastructure that makes you anonymous online. It is a network of servers spread around the world, accessed using a browser called the Tor Browser, which you can download for free from the Tor Project website. When you use the Tor Browser, your signals are encrypted and bounced around the world before they reach the service you’re trying to access. This makes it difficult for governments to trace your activity or block access, as the network just routes you through a country where that access isn’t restricted. But, because you can’t protect yourself from digital crime without also protecting yourself from mass surveillance by the state, these technologies are the site of constant battles between security and law enforcement interests . The state’s claim to protect the vulnerable often masks efforts to exert control.

In 2024, Fox covered Democrats 60% of the time, with MSNBC showing the reverse. Garcia speculates that cable networks began to test different kinds of content when social media became widespread in the mid-2010s, and discovered that outrage boosts viewership. “I think Fox was the first one to figure this out, and they started pushing this negative rhetoric in their news,” he said. “They’re actually now the No. 1 cable news channel in the U.S. by far.” Fox News now commands over 60% of the cable news audience\"a dramatic jump from a more evenly split landscape a decade ago.

This creates one more obstacle for consumers who want to delete their data. Data brokers nationwide must register in California under the state’s Consumer Privacy Act, which allows Californians to request that their information be removed, that it not be sold, or that they get access to it.

While those companies might be fulfilling the letter of the law by providing a page consumers can use to delete their data, it means little if those consumers can’t find the page , according to Matthew Schwartz, a policy analyst. “This sounds to me like a clever work-around to make it as hard as possible for consumers to find it,” Schwartz said. Some companies that hid their privacy instructions from search engines included a small link at the bottom of their homepage. Accessing it often required scrolling multiple screens, dismissing pop-ups for cookie permissions and newsletter sign-ups, then finding a link that was a fraction the size of other text on the page.

In January 2021, a few Facebook employees posted an article on the company’s engineering blog purporting to explain the news feed algorithm that determines which of the countless posts available each user will see and the order in which they will see them. Eight months later ... a Facebook product manager turned whistleblower snuck over ten thousand pages of documents and internal messages out of Facebook headquarters. She leaked these to a handful of media outlets. Internal studies documented Instagram’s harmful impact on the mental health of vulnerable teen girls. A secret whitelist program exempted VIP users from the moderation system the rest of us face . It turns out Facebook engineers have assigned a point value to each type of engagement users can perform on a post (liking, commenting, resharing, etc.). For each post you could be shown, these point values are multiplied by the probability that the algorithm thinks you’ll perform that form of engagement. These multiplied pairs of numbers are added up, and the total is the post’s personalized score for you. Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter all run on essentially the same simple math formula.

Researchers analyzed data from over one million people between 2000 and 2020, measuring various aspects of uniqueness, including willingness to defend beliefs, adherence to rules, and concern over others’ reactions. Results revealed declines across all three areas. The new study was motivated by evidence suggesting that people are increasingly concerned about the social consequences of expressing opinions, particularly in online spaces where scrutiny is often harsh and widespread. Polling data and past research suggested that fear of isolation or criticism might make people more cautious about sharing beliefs or acting in ways that draw attention. At the same time, rising social anxiety and sensitivity to judgment could make people more hesitant to express uniqueness. Given these shifts, the researchers wanted to track whether and how people’s desire for uniqueness had changed over a 20-year period. The largest decline, at 6.52%, was in people’s willingness to publicly defend their beliefs. The study also found a decline, albeit less steep, in people’s willingness to break rules, indicating that people are less inclined to challenge norms or social expectations than two decades ago. Over time, people have become more reserved in behavior, choosing to conform to social norms rather than push boundaries. Note: Over half of Americans are self-censoring out of fear of being cancelled or alienated from their community. From gender medicine research , the psychology field , social justice movements , to Middle East politics , a Cato Institute poll found that 71% of Americans believe that political correctness has silenced important societal discussions, and 58% of Americans reported that the current political climate prevents them from sharing their political beliefs.

Enter The Offline Club , (who ironically have 530,000 followers on Instagram) a Dutch social movement looking to create screen-free public spaces and events in cafes to revive the time before phones, when board games, social interaction, and reading were the activities observed in public. They also host digital detox retreats, where participants unplug from not only their smartphones, but computers too, and experience a life before the internet. BSI’s research showed that out of 1,290 individuals aged 16-21, 47% would prefer to be young in a world without the internet, with 50% also saying a social media curfew would improve their lives. The Offline Club is taking advantage of this rising cross-cultural awareness and helps its followers replace “screen time with real time.” Their founders envision a world where time spent in public is present and offline .

When I talk to him on the phone, his voice is softer, and before we hang up, he says, \"I love you.\" Witnessing my father become more open has reminded me that I still have room to grow. I believe that my father and I both learned something that day.

A DOE special investigative panel concluded in 1999 that the department is “a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself.” More recently, the DOE signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Department of Defense to confirm and enhance the “the longstanding partnership between DOE and DOD on space-related research and technology development.” The MOU establishes joint working groups and promotes scientific exchange between the two departments in emerging and disruptive research fields such as advanced power and propulsion, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, next-generation communications, and autonomous or remotely piloted vehicles.

Since Trump called up the troops on June 7, they have carried out exactly one temporary detainment. The deployments are expected to cost the public hundreds of millions of dollars. Troops were sent to LA over the objections of local officials and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. In addition to guarding federal buildings, troops have also recently participated in raids alongside camouflage-clad ICE agents. “ To have armored vehicles deployed on the streets of our city, to federalize the National Guard, to have the U.S. Marines who are trained to kill abroad, deployed to our city all of this is outrageous and it is un-American ,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass [said].

ICE detained more than 200 people, including U.S. citizens, during the joint operations. One man, Jaime Alanís Garcia, died. Experts say that the introduction of military troops into civilian law enforcement support further strains civil-military relations and risks violation of the Posse Comitatus Act.

Ramona, an operating room assistant at Waterbury Hospital cited in the report, explained how Prospect went to extreme lengths to avoid spending money. She explained to Murphy that Prospect at one point stopped paying vendors, which resulted in supplies eventually growing \"so scarce patients were sometimes left on the operating table while staff scrambled\" to find the necessary equipment . Staff members eventually started buying supplies themselves, with some even going so far as to buy food for their patients to ensure that they did not go hungry. Prospect didn't just skimp on buying supplies for the hospitals but also on maintaining the buildings themselves. A unit secretary at Waterbury Hospital named Carmen told Murphy's staff of two instances where the ceiling at the building literally fell down due to years of neglect. Murphy's report also emphasized that the story of private equity stripping hospitals for parts is not unique to his state. \"The story of these three Connecticut hospitals is playing out in healthcare systems all over the country,\" it said.

As the lines between private and public data are blurred in modern society, many won’t realize that their private lives are becoming data points used to make decisions about them. What AI does is make this a surveillance ratchet, a device that only goes in one direction, which goes something like this: To make the inferences I want to make to learn more about you, I must collect more data on you. For my AI tools to run, I need data about a lot of you. And once I’ve collected this data, I can monetize it by selling it to others who want to use AI to make other inferences about you. AI creates a demand for data but also becomes the result of collecting data. What makes AI prediction both powerful and lucrative is being able to control what happens next.

The plan, which was revealed in 2017 when the National Archives declassified 2,800 documents from the JFK era, was a collaborative effort that included the CIA, the State Department, the Department of Defense, and other federal agencies that sought to brainstorm strategies to topple Castro and sow unrest within Cuba. One of those plans included Operation Northwoods, submitted to the CIA by General Lyman Lemnitzer on behalf of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One of the official CIA documents shows officials musing about staging a terror campaign (“real or simulated”) and blaming it on Cuban refugees . In the summer of 2014, the CIA’s inspector general concluded that the CIA had “improperly” spied on US Senate staffers who were researching the agency’s black history of torture.

In the wake of 9/11, the FBI has, on numerous occasions , targeted unstable and mentally ill individuals, sending informants to bait them into committing terror attacks.

These farms are no longer part of the climate, soil, biodiversity, water and health crises, but actively contribute to solutions. Because whilst they sow, grow and harvest, they ensure that their landscapes, communities and local economies become increasingly healthy and resilient . However new or revolutionary this seems, it is not. In fact, regenerative farming goes back to the basics and places indigenous principles \" such as the idea that all life is interconnected \" at the heart of food production. And just like indigenous communities, regenerative farmers look beyond the short-term and desire to pass on their land in a better state than they found it. In nature, different plants, flowers, herbs, nuts and fruits grow side by side in the same ecosystem. Whilst they grow, they add and remove different nutrients from the soil, thus keeping it balanced. At the same time, a wide variety of insects and other animals are attracted by the biodiversity, keeping each other in check and making sure that no species can ever become a pest. This ensures that all life can flourish. Many regenerative farms sell their produce directly to consumers, therefore cutting out the middleman , or even opt for a membership model where people can become members of the farm for the duration of a harvest season, called Community Supported Agriculture .

The HPSCI report revealed that Brennan created a special Fusion Cell, excluded independent reviewers, and used a tightly controlled team of hand-picked CIA analysts to reverse what the underlying intelligence actually said. According to a CIA whistleblower who co-authored the ICA, Brennan put the team “under duress” to reach a conclusion that Putin supported Trump. The evidence did not show that the Russians favored Trump.

The radar returns looked offphantom blips moving with unfathomable speed and precision. The objects on one occasion finally came into view. Graves reported seeing a dark gray or black cube inside a clear sphere, between five and 15 feet in diameter, coming within 50 feet of their jets. Over the next year, Graves’s squadron recorded sightings of unidentified objects almost daily . Sometimes the objects flew in loose formations. Other times they traveled alone. They had no exhaust, no visible propulsion, no wings. Some of these craft\"now classified as UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena)\"appeared to be capable of transmedium travel, meaning they are able to move from air to sea without slowing, splashing, or emitting heat. They challenged every assumption held by aerospace engineers and radar operators. Since at least the 1950s, military sources have reported strange objects plunging into the ocean\"what they call USOs (unidentified submerged objects). Today Graves is one of the most vocal advocates for UAP transparency. He’s the founder of Americans for Safe Aerospace, the largest UAP-focused pilot safety initiative in the world. He doesn’t claim that these craft are alien, but he’s certain that they aren’t using known human tech. Note: Watch a new video by Amber Yang on recent exciting developments in UFO/UAP disclosure.

He experimented and eventually came up with a simple food spray, “a mixture of food ingredients, yeast and sugar-based, diluted in water and applied to crops. It emits an odour which is picked up by beneficial predatory insects and attracts them to the fields where they kill pests.” It was the beginning of an international grassroots campaign, in which Mensah has worked with various charities to teach people about this sustainable farming method. Ever since the dangerous side effects of pesticides became widely known, alternatives have been sought. This approach to farming, which reduces our reliance on pesticides, is called integrated pest management. In 2005, Mensah took food sprays to Benin, where the Pesticide Action Network (PAN UK) was helping farmers transition to organic farming. There, the misuse of chemical pesticides was seriously damaging people’s health. The food sprays cheap, safe and effective \" caught on with farmers in Benin where thousands now use the technique .

There are over 1,000 types of these chemicals, according to some estimates , and we are exposed to them daily: They can be found everywhere from your nonstick pan and canned foods to your shampoo and hair dye. The endocrine system consists of glands that secrete hormones, like estrogen, testosterone and cortisol, that then interact with targets (receptors) in the body to regulate our growth, development, reproduction, metabolism, energy balance and body weight. Chemicals that interfere with this complex communication system are called endocrine disruptors. These chemicals work in a variety of ways, including overstimulating receptors, blocking receptors so that normal hormones can’t interact with them and altering hormone production or availability . Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. It belongs to the larger class of chemicals called bisphenols. The primary exposure for most people is through their diet: BPAs can leach into food or drinks from the protective, internal epoxy resin coatings of canned foods and from consumer products such as polycarbonate tableware, food storage containers and water bottles.

A large study of older adults [found] that persistent loneliness predicted declines in extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness\"traits associated with sociability, kindness, and self-discipline. At the same time, higher levels of neuroticism predicted greater loneliness in the future, suggesting a self-reinforcing cycle. Although social media promises connection, a large-scale study published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin suggests that it may actually fuel feelings of loneliness over time. Researchers found that both passive (scrolling) and active (posting and commenting) forms of social media use predicted increases in loneliness. Surprisingly, even active engagement\"often believed to foster interaction\"was associated with growing disconnection. Even more concerning was the feedback loop uncovered in the data: loneliness also predicted increased social media use over time, suggesting that people may turn to these platforms for relief, only to find themselves feeling even more isolated . Lonely individuals also showed greater activation in areas tied to negative emotions, such as the insula and amygdala. This pattern suggests that lonely people may be more sensitive to social threat or negativity, which could contribute to feeling misunderstood or excluded.

Figures in Epstein’s network of billionaires, politicians, celebrities, royalty and intellectuals were assembled into schemes of influence. The spheres of influence Epstein created, emails showed, relied simultaneously on access and gifts Between his collection of lavish homes in New York, Palm Beach and Paris, two private Caribbean islands, two jets and helicopter, Epstein held nearly $380m in cash and investments, according to his estate. That wealth arrived suddenly. Until the end of the 90s, Epstein was living in a two-bedroom apartment on Manhattan’s Upper East Side close to the river. It was only when Maxwell arrived from London that his lifestyle was dramatically elevated. Epstein moved to a townhouse on 68th Street and later to a 28,000-sq-ft mansion on 71st Street, later transferred to him by Wexner in 2011. Steven Hoffenberg, a former business partner of Epstein convicted of running a Ponzi scheme, claimed that Maxwell’s father, the disgraced press baron Robert Maxwell, introduced his daughter to Epstein in the late 1980s. A 2022 Miami Herald exposé showed complex Maxwell family transactions passing through companies in Jersey, the British Virgin Islands and Panama that it called “a decades-long modus operandi of financial deception”.

Gates has donated $870 million to AGRA, a Nairobi-based group attempting to introduce genetically modified seeds, chemical fertilizers, and large-scale agriculture throughout Africa. In Kenya it is possible to see the results of his now-accelerating project, which comprises three distinct efforts: the introduction of a new vaccine against malaria, a far-reaching agricultural reform program, and a divisive campaign to vaccinate cattle. Gates has no democratic accountability to anyone in the U.S., Kenya, or any other country. The Gates Foundation ... exists outside of nations and constitutions and laws, and its money is so widely distributed and so embedded in so many different private and public entities that it practically disappears into the larger architecture of the global system. One thing that unites NPR, the Guardian, and the Chinese government is that they are, in some form or another, Gates-funded institutions. Note: Gates has given over $250 million to major outlets including BBC, Guardian, NPR, and Al Jazeera.

Now, new research from the University of California in Davis shows that having a sense of purpose in life may have another benefit as people age: reducing the risk of dementia. The new study ... found that people who reported a higher sense of purpose in life were about 28% less likely to develop cognitive impairment\"including mild cognitive impairment and dementia . The protective effect of having a purpose was seen across racial and ethnic groups. It also remained significant even after accounting for education, depression, and the APOE4 gene, which is a known risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. “Our findings show that having a sense of purpose helps the brain stay resilient with age,” said Aliza Wingo, senior author. “Even for people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, sense of purpose was linked to a later onset and lower likelihood of developing dementia.” The findings support the idea that psychological well-being plays a key role in healthy aging, said Thomas Wingo, a co-author of the study. Wingo hopes future studies will explore whether purpose-building interventions can help prevent dementia. “What’s exciting about this study is that people may be able to ‘think’ themselves into better health.

This supports previous research linking chlorpyrifos with impaired cognitive function and brain development, but these findings are the first evidence of widespread and long-lasting molecular, cellular, and metabolic effects in the brain. Subjects in this urban cohort were likely exposed to chlorpyrifos at home, since many were born before or shortly after the US Environmental Protection Agency banned residential use of chlorpyrifos in 2001.

He thinks phasing out animal testing and using the new methods will help figure out what’s causing chronic disease . Last week, the National Institutes of Health announced it would spend $87 million on a new center researching alternatives to animal testing and permit agency-supported researchers to use grant funding to find homes for retired lab animals. Kennedy signed off because he thinks the new methods will enable scientists to more quickly and inexpensively draw conclusions about how chemicals and drugs work. He expects that’ll confirm his belief that chemicals in the environment and in food are making Americans sick and also speed cures for chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease and diabetes. The new center will attempt to develop a standardized alternative to animal testing that relies on tiny, lab-grown 3D tissue models, enlisting help from across the NIH and the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates pharmaceuticals. Harnessing science and technology to protect animals isn’t an obvious Trump agenda item.

Long before scientists tracked brain waves or measured neurotransmitters, dancers had an intuitive understanding of the power of moving together. Now, the research is starting to catch up. A 2024 meta-analysis published in The BMJ reviewed 218 clinical trials and found that dance reduced symptoms of depression more than walking, yoga, strength training, and even standard antidepressants . While only 15 of the studies focused specifically on dance, the results were enough to grab the attention of researchers. Our brains are wired for rhythm\"and dancing engages our entire nervous system. Some neuroscientists describe this full-body stimulation as a neurochemical symphony. Anticipating a melody can trigger the release of dopamine. Physical movement boosts endorphins. Dancing with others increases oxytocin.

Fear of political retribution is not the only reason U.S. think tanks may be reluctant to share financial information. Even before these new threats against left-leaning groups, a Quincy Institute report found that over a third of the major foreign policy think tanks do not disclose any donor information, oftentimes because of their heavy reliance on special interests . The top 50 American think tanks received at least $110 million from foreign governments and $35 million from defense contractors in the past 5 years alone. Despite their positioning as objective and independent institutions, reliance on special interests can lead to self-censorship and perspective filtering. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that he would be canceling 83% of USAID’s programs. The decision impacted think tanks all around the world. The Trump administration also cut funding for the Wilson Center and U.S. Institute for Peace, two congressionally-established think tanks.

The result would be not only to restore Fed profits to the Treasury but to lower federal borrowing costs. The Fed says it needs IOR as a tool to control short-term interest rates. By paying substantial interest on reserves, the Fed ensures that banks don’t flood markets with cash by over-lending. But the Fed managed rates through open market operations before 2008 without IOR, showing it is not essential; and it is a very costly tool. In 2021, Fed remittances to the Treasury totaled $79 billion. In 2023, high IOR costs led to Fed losses of $114.3 billion. This not only halted remittances to the Treasury entirely, it created a net deficit to the Fed.

The Georgian government expects the EU to change radically to accommodate Georgia. What brought matters to a head between Georgia and the EU was the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The Georgian government condemned the invasion, sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine and imposed certain sanctions on Russia. However, it tried to block Georgian volunteers going to Ukraine to fight and rejected Western pressure to send military aid and to impose the full range of EU sanctions, leading to fresh accusations of being “pro-Russian.” On this, President Kavelashvili pushed back very strongly. He accused the West of trying to provoke a new war with Russia that would be catastrophic for Georgia . Georgia has a government that represents the interests of our people…the same media outlets that accuse us of being under Russian influence tell the same lie about President Trump,” [he said]. President Kavelashvili accused the U.S. “deep state” and organizations like USAID, the National Endowment for Democracy, and the European Parliament of mobilizing the Georgian opposition to this end; “but despite all this pressure, we stood and continue to stand as guardians of Georgian national interest and of Georgian economic growth” the latter comment a veiled reference to the very important economic links between Georgia and Russia.

The U.S. government spends more on international “counternarcotics” activities than it does on education, water supply, sanitation, and women’s rights in low- and middle-income countries : Almost $13 billion of U.S. taxpayer money has been allocated to “counternarcotics” activities internationally since 2015. This amount is more than the U.S. government spent over that decade on primary education or water supply and sanitation in low- and middle-income countries.

A growing amount of this “counternarcotics cash” has even come from the same U.S. official development assistance budgets that are supposed to help end global poverty.

President Donald Trump has taken this tactic to new extremes, boasting about lethal strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and declaring the U.S. is in a “ non-international armed conflict ” with narcotics traffickers. Trump appears to be merging the war on terror with the war on drugs. This comes as he’s simultaneously ramping up the use of troops to police inside American cities. The modern drug war began during President Richard Nixon’s administration. In 1994, the journalist Dan Baum tracked down Nixon aide John Ehrlichman and interviewed him . He said, “Look. The Nixon campaign in ’68 and the Nixon White House had two enemies: Black people and the antiwar left. [V]ilify them night after night on the evening news, and we thought if we can associate heroin with Black people in the public mind and marijuana with the hippies this would be perfect.” And [Ehrlichman] said, “Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.” This line of thinking drove policies designed to “unleash” law enforcement. The Nixon administration tried to relax wiretapping laws, roll back Miranda rights, and erode Fourth Amendment protections against unconstitutional searches and seizures. And now we’re seeing the Trump administration push even harder to roll back constitutional protections. Note: Though President Richard Nixon launched the War on Drugs by declaring drugs “public enemy No. 1,” secretly he admitted in a 1973 Oval Office meeting that marijuana was “not particularly dangerous.” The War on Drugs is a trillion dollar failure that has been made worse by every presidential administration since Nixon.

In 2020, when Linda Appel Lipsius became executive director of the decades-old Denver Urban Gardens (DUG) network, which oversees more than 200 community vegetable gardens throughout six metro Denver counties, she wanted to continue increasing community access to fresh food\"a longtime goal of the garden program. But she had another aim, too: increasing the city’s tree coverage. Appel Lipsius decided to build a system of food forests throughout the Denver area. These dense, layered plantings incorporate fruit-bearing trees with other perennials to mimic natural forests. Now, DUG oversees 26 food forests , with 600 or so fruit and nut trees and 600 berry bushes . While urban trees are recognized for their multiple benefits, including cooling and carbon drawdown, “there are not a lot of players in Denver, or even in most cities around the country, who are focused on food trees,” Appel Lipsius said. “We were able to step into this space to help build and bolster the canopy while adding food-producing perennials.” Neighbors are welcome to enter and harvest a wide assortment of fruits, nuts, and berries. Beyond providing fresh food in neighborhoods that need it most, these agroforests reduce the urban heat island effect , create pollinator habitat, and combat pollution and climate change by absorbing and filtering harmful gases.

Cecilia Stenfors ... at Stockholm University, said her research shows that those who frequently visit green spaces, whether a forest or a koloniträdgård, “have better health outcomes, in terms of fewer depressive symptoms, less anxiety, better sleep and fewer feelings of loneliness and social isolation.” These positive effects can be particularly pronounced in older people and can help combat symptoms of age-related mental and physical decline.

By 2022, four years after the European Union banned neonicotinoid use in fields, researchers observed that France’s population of insect-eating birds had increased by 2%-3%. These included blackbirds, blackcaps and chaffinches , which feed on insects as adults and as chicks. The results could be mirrored across the EU, where the neonicotinoid ban came into effect in late 2018, but research has not yet been done elsewhere.

Our results clearly point to neonicotinoid bans as an effective conservation measure for insectivorous birds.” Like the EU, the UK banned neonicotinoids for outdoor general use in 2018, although they can be used in exceptional circumstances. They are still widely used in the US, which has lost almost 3 billion insectivorous birds since the 1970s.

The long-secret transcripts of Gottlieb’s testimony to the staff of the United States Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (“Church Committee”) were published today by the National Security Archive , 50 years after the historic intelligence oversight hearings, along with a selection of declassified CIA memos and other records concerning MKULTRA. The Church Committee transcripts are among the highlights of the Digital National Security Archive collection, CIA and the Behavioral Sciences: Mind Control, Drug Experiments and MKULTRA . Gottlieb was a key bureaucratic player who signed off on hundreds of MKULTRA subprojects and who developed clandestine relationships with universities, prisons, hospitals, private laboratories, and private foundations that made it difficult to trace the programs back to the Agency. The Church Committee faced considerable obstacles in reconstructing the story, especially since Gottlieb and CIA director Richard Helms destroyed most of the original project records in 1973. Note: According to Gottlieb's testimony, the CIA covertly dosed an unwitting individual with a massive amount of LSD to deliberately induce psychosis, causing him to experience violent paranoia and leading an unsuspecting psychiatrist to declare him mentally ill.

The CIA’s drug network, wrote [journalist Gary] Webb, “opened the first pipeline between Colombia’s cocaine cartels and the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles, a city now known as the ‘crack’ capital of the world.” Black gangs used their profits to buy automatic weapons, sometimes from one of the CIA-linked drug dealers .

But that claim is false. This does not mean that climate change isn’t happening. It is. It simply means that it has not caused the sea level to rise. Top scientists know this fact and have deliberately misrepresented it for years, deceiving the public. In September, I reported on one of the first global studies of sea level rise that used tide-gauge data, which is the only real-world data that goes back long enough, to the mid-19th Century, that would allow one to detect whether sea level rise had accelerated, decelerated, or remained steady. The only reliable long-term real-world data is tide gauge data, and they do not show acceleration. Since then, I exchanged over 50 emails with one of the world’s leading sea level rise scientists, Robert Kopp from Rutgers University, and heard back from IPCC, NASA, and NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. What I learned shocked me. For years, the world’s top scientists have known that they cannot prove there has been an acceleration of sea level rise, and yet they have told the public that they can. We’ve known since 2018 that 89% of the atoll islands that scientists and the media claimed would be destroyed by sea level rise had instead grown or stayed the same size . Sea level rise is not “observably accelerating” over time horizons that would show a trend. The only scientific basis for claiming it is accelerating is through modeling. The observable tide-gauge data do not show this.

It didn’t go well. as reported by Christian Science Monitor Last year, a climate scientist named Patrick Brown, along with seven co-authors, published a study in the journal Nature about the connections between wildfires in California and global warming. Dr. Brown confessed in a Free Press article that he had framed his research not just to reflect the truth, but to fit within what he described as the climate alarmist storyline preferred by prestigious journals in the United States. He did this, he says, by intentionally focusing only on climate as a factor in wildfires, and not on the myriad other causes that contribute to the blazes consuming ever more land across the country. The formula for getting published, he wrote, “is more about shaping your research in specific ways to support pre-approved narratives than it is about generating useful knowledge for society.” And when it comes to climate science, he alleged, that preapproved narrative is that “climate change impacts are pervasive and catastrophic.” [Climate scientist] Dr. Pielke argues that many of the widely cited cost estimates connecting weather disasters to climate change are mistaken. (Climate advocates regularly assert that climate change is costing the U.S. billions of dollars every year.) His research, he says, shows that extreme weather appears costlier because properties are more valuable. In other words, wealth increase is the real story. He regularly takes issue with media portrayals of extreme weather. The reality is more complex, he says.

In a new report, experts argued solar radiation modification (SRM) could reduce global temperatures but “worsen rather than ease” climate change and make the sky look less blue . In May, the Government’s Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria) announced £56.8m for 21 “climate cooling” projects , which include injecting aerosols into the sky to reflect sunlight away from Earth. However, the report found there were “major uncertainties” and argued the plan may have devastating knock-on effects, particularly if deployed by rogue groups. Prof Jim Haywood, of atmospheric science at the University of Exeter, said: “What you do in one place can cause climate change in a different place. “Stratospheric aerosol injection deployment in the northern hemisphere could impact the position of the tropical monsoon and lead to droughts in sub-Saharan Africa. “Everyone there relies on subsistence farming, so it quickly devastates if there is a drought there. “In the southern hemisphere, it could lead to an increase in North Atlantic hurricane frequency and intensity, it could lead to winter droughts over the Mediterranean and the Iberian Peninsula.” A “termination effect” whereby sun dimming technology was suddenly stopped, could also lead to rapid warming of up to 2C in decades, and cause devastating effects for ecosystems.

The basic idea behind solar geoengineering, or what we now prefer to call sunlight reflection methods (SRM), is that humans might reduce climate change by making the Earth a bit more reflective, partially counteracting the warming caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases. Many people already distrust the idea of engineering the atmosphereat whichever scale\"to address climate change, fearing negative side effects, inequitable impacts on different parts of the world, or the prospect that a world expecting such solutions will feel less pressure to address the root causes of climate change. Notably, Stardust says on its website that it has developed novel particles that can be injected into the atmosphere to reflect away more sunlight, asserting that they’re “chemically inert in the stratosphere, and safe for humans and ecosystems.” But it’s nonsense for the company to claim they can make particles that are inert in the stratosphere. Even diamonds, which are extraordinarily nonreactive, would alter stratospheric chemistry . Any particle may become coated by background sulfuric acid in the stratosphere.

A 2024 study claims to challenge \"conventional views of memory and identity\" by suggesting organs carry memories and emotions and that the findings raise \"ethical and philosophical questions\" about transplantation . For decades, researchers have studied whether memories and emotions could linger in the heart, and histories of medicine and emotion show why the question is important. In 2010, I wrote Matters of the Heart: History, Medicine, and Emotion, a history of the emotional, physical and spiritual significance of the heart . My research shows that, before the emergence of scientific medicine, the heart was considered the centre of emotion and memory. Memory and emotions are not merely biological phenomena, but driven by environments, experiences and relationships. They, like beliefs about the heart, are informed by cultural contexts. In Thailand or Japan, for instance, there is more pronounced medical interest in the spiritual heart \" Japan wouldn't recognise brain death until 1985 for this reason. So, cross-cultural comparisons are needed to understand how far narratives of memory transfer in heart transplantation are universal.

Here's what quantum physics reveals about life, death, and consciousness as reported by MSN News Einstein once wrote about his friend Michele Besso, “Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us…know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.” Could death, as we understand it, be a construct of our consciousness rather than a universal truth? Proposed by Dr. Robert Lanza, a respected stem cell biologist and author, biocentrism is a revolutionary theory suggesting that life and consciousness are not byproducts of the universe, but the very forces that shape it. According to biocentrism: Space and time are not external, objective realities. They are tools of our perception, shaped by conscious observation. Reality does not exist without an observer. Biocentrism places consciousness at the center of the universe. In doing so, it opens the door to reevaluating what death really meansif the self is not simply the body, its “end” might not be defined by physical decay. In the [ two-slit experiment ]: When unobserved, particles act like waves and pass through both slits simultaneously. When observed, they behave like particles and choose one path. Quantum physics further supports the biocentric view by demonstrating that the universe behaves differently when observed. Quantum entanglement shows that particles can be instantly connected across vast distances\"what Einstein called \"spooky action at a distance.\" This challenges our understanding of time and space, and suggests that reality is not locally bound or strictly linear. Redefining death redefines life. If consciousness persists in ways we don't yet understand, every aspect of human society\"from science to ethics\"will evolve.

The bottom of page 24 reads “And, the eternal thought or concept of self which results from this self-consciousness serves the,” The report picks back up on page 26 and 3 sections later as if Wayne hadn’t just revealed the very secret of existence.

They deliver targets to operators by combining immense amounts of publicly and privately sourced data to detect patterns, and are particularly helpful in projects of mass surveillance, forced migration and urban warfare. Also known as “AI kill chains”, they pull us all into a web of invisible tracking mechanisms that we are just beginning to comprehend, yet are starting to experience viscerally in the US as Ice wields these systems near our homes, churches, parks and schools .

The johns were the unwitting subjects in a CIA experiment focused on how drugs and sex might be used to obtain secrets from foreign adversaries. Part of MKUltra, the agency’s broader and highly controversial mind control research program, Operation Midnight Climax began in 1953. The experiments involved luring men into a heavily surveilled bordello, dosing them with LSD, and filming their reactions to probing questions and subliminal messaging. The goal of Midnight Climax was to understand what roles, if any, sex and drugs could play in getting a target to reveal sensitive or classified information . To run the operation, Gottlieb hired George Hunter White, a federal narcotics agent, who got to work renovating the apartment. Microphones disguised as electrical wall outlets were hooked up to tape recorders, and a large two-way mirror allowed CIA agents to monitor, film, and photograph the encounters. Behind the mirror, a makeshift control room featured a portable toilet and a refrigerator full of adult beverages. Sex workers were given $100 for each man they lured to the bordello, and they would then dose their client with LSD-laced cocktails. Eventually these efforts revealed that a man became increasingly talkative if the sex worker asked him to stay awhileeven after the sexual transaction was complete. Note: Midnight Climax was supervised by George Hunter White , who wrote this in a letter about the program: \" Where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, kill, cheat, steal, rape, and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the All-Highest?\" Former CIA officer and Iran-Contra whistleblower Bruce Hemmings put it best: \" They do not give a damn about the law or the Constitution or the Congress or the Oversight committees except as something to be subverted and manipulated and lied to.

Now he is calling for the Scottish government to fund a radical new cow-with-calf development programme.

After overhauling their business plan and adopting a new approach, the couple found a way of making the system financially viable. David claims that among the benefits are happier cows and staff, healthier animals and an increase in life-expectancy. What we've found is we can carry 25% more cows on the farm, because the young stock are growing and maturing so much faster and the cows are yielding 25% more milk,\" he said. \"So even with the calves drinking a third of their mother's milk, the system is actually more efficient, more productive and more profitable.\" Rainton Farm is now the largest commercial cow-with-calf dairy farm in Europe.

And over the last several years, policymakers, environmental and farm groups, and private companies began hyping the idea that specific markets could be created to pay farmers for adopting practices that could reduce emissions and hold carbon in soil. Congress passed the Growing Climate Solutions Act on a bipartisan basis in an effort to jump-start the markets.

Farmers use herbicides to kill weeds that they could otherwise till under and to kill cover crops before planting a cash crop.

Researchers discovered hundreds of butterflies that had died or were dying in January 2024 near an overwintering site, where insects spend winter months. The butterflies were found twitching or dead in piles, which are common signs of neurotoxic pesticide poisoning, researchers wrote. Testing of 10 of the insects revealed an average of seven pesticides in each, and at levels that researchers suspect were lethal. As much as 90% of the monarch butterfly population in some US regions has been wiped out in recent decades, and evidence has pointed to pesticides, climate crisis and habitat loss as the drivers. The butterflies were found adjacent to the Pacific Grove Monarch Sanctuary, one of about 400 wintering sites along California’s coast that are crucial points in the monarchs’ migratory and reproductive cycles. Though an investigation by a state agricultural official did not determine a source of the die-off, pesticide ... run off in shallow water sources near where high numbers of butterflies collectively drink present a risk for the type of mass die-off at Pacific Grove.

The scientists were studying lake sediment to test if the presence of microplastics in geological layers would be a reliable indicator for the beginning of the Anthropocene Epoch, defined in the study as starting in 1950 and meant to delineate when humans started having a large impact on our environment. Scientists have long used layers of ash or ice to study past events on Earth, leading to the question of whether microplastics can serve as a reliable chronological marker for the Anthropocene. Clearly not, according to this new research, which found microplastics in every layer of sediment they dredged up, including one from 1733 . “We conclude that interpretation of microplastics distribution in the studied sediment profiles is ambiguous and does not strictly indicate the beginning of the Anthropocene Epoch,” the scientists wrote.

That conclusion was false. The manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), knew from its own data that the drug failed to outperform placebo and carried a serious risk of suicidal behaviour. Instead of telling the truth, GSK hired a public-relations firm to ghostwrite the paper, enlisted academic co-authors who never saw the raw data, and used the publication to promote Paxil to doctors treating children .

This discovery challenges existing beliefs about polarization and suggests that reducing these misperceptions could ease political tensions. Previous research has suggested that Democrats and Republicans consistently overestimate how radical the other party is, always believing that the other party is much more radical than it actually is. However, this study suggests that the greater error in Democrats' and Republicans’ perceptions is how diverse they perceive the parties to be. The researchers also measured how participants felt toward the other party and how comfortable they were socializing with them. The more a participant perceived the other side to hold diverse attitudes, the more participants liked the other party and felt comfortable socializing with them . Perceiving the other party as having more diverse attitudes was also associated with lesser concern that the party supports violating democratic norms. “Our research suggests that fostering awareness of the diversity within political parties could reduce partisan hostility and create space for more constructive dialogue,” says Lelkes, co-director of the Polarization Research Lab .

How did [180,000 vets] end up in a US prison population now numbering more than 1.2 million? Overall, about one-third of all veterans , who number nineteen million, report having been arrested and booked into jail at least once in their lives, as compared to less than one-fifth of the rest of the population . When they end up incarcerated, veterans receive longer sentences than nonveterans, despite the good work of a national network of Veterans Treatment Courts (VTCs). This “hybrid drug and mental health treatment system” offers access to counseling services, opportunities for housing, education and job employment, and disability benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). But the effectiveness of their “reparative justice” approach varies from state to state and is not available to vets charged with violent crimes, which disqualifies many defendants. More than 300,000 veterans, who served at home and abroad, since 9/11 also received less than “honorable” discharges. For the DOD, despite its ample $884 billion budget, getting rid of soldiers whose performance is adversely affected by PTSD, traumatic brain injuries (TBI), military sexual trauma (MST), drug or alcohol abuse is easier, quicker, and cheaper than treating them.

Residents work four hours each morning. They tend to vegetable plots, lead goats from the barn to the field, or cook meals shared in the common room. All inmates at the farm are able to pursue classes and training programs. Some are even run on-site by volunteers, like lessons for the driver’s license written exam. Nicolas, who has never had his driver’s licence, attends these every week, hoping it will help him secure a job.

The paper, published in the prestigious multidisciplinary journal PLOS One , is a follow up to another study O’Neil conducted on the pesticide known as cis-chlordane, which is banned but persists in the environment. “The goal of the study was to try to figure out why cis-chlordane is able to kill motor neurons,” which are the nerve cells that die in ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), she said. “It turns out that [the pesticides] are affecting the mitochondria, which are the powerhouse of the cell,” said O’Neil. Without mitochondria, the motor neurons weaken and die . This insight points to potential for more effective treatments for a disease when current therapies extend life by only a few months. “The implications of that finding helps us determine what kind of drugs people need,” said O’Neil. Since there is clearly an environmental component in most cases of ALS, said Clackson, the research can help pinpoint what is contributing to the disease and potentially change disease trajectory. “If we see these early biomarkers, say pesticides in the blood, then we can perhaps treat them earlier and have a completely different outcome,” he said.

These organic circuits can store information, process signals, and maybe even help future computers behave more like organic brains, all while being low-cost, biodegradable, and probably compostable when you’re done with them . The team grew nine batches of shiitake mycelium in petri dishes. They let them sprawl and stretch into mildly disturbing, gross, tangled networks of roots. Then, they dried them out in the sunlight until they were ready to handle electricity. Once wired up to a circuit, the fungal fibers responded to voltage like living synapses. They were firing off signals at about 5,850 hertz with 90 percent accuracy. The researchers found they could boost power by wiring more mushrooms together, creating an even larger fungal network that improved circuit stability and speed.

This surge in Southeast Asia’s narcotics trade was also achieved with at least some input from America’s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) . Keen to prevent Mao’s Communist message from spreading into Burma, and from there mainland Southeast Asia, the CIA offered support to ... exiled Chinese nationalists, including transportation assistance through Civil Air Transport \" the CIA-owned airline that would later become the notorious Air America, which transported U.S. supplies and forces into Vietnam, and the secret war in Laos. Burmese military intelligence reports at the time also noted that the nationalist troops were sporting brand-new American arms in the form of machine guns, bazookas, mortars, and anti-aircraft artillery. A declassified CIA cable from the era said the troops who settled in Mae Salong became the “dominant opium traffickers in the region”, and that the move to the hilltop village had proven a “boon” for their activities, by allowing them to develop networks in Thailand. A series of brutal campaigns throughout the 1970s brought the Communist threat in the area to an end, and Mae Salong’s residents shifted from producing opium to tea and mushrooms.

But there's a lesser-known part of this history: A quest by Nazi Germany to use psychedelics as a truth serum, with the CIA picking up where the Third Reich left off. LSD, in a way, had a really bad start, because first it was the SS and then the CIA,\" German author Norman Ohler [ said ]. In 1938, chemist Albert Hofmann was working at the Swiss pharmaceutical company Sandoz, where he first synthesised lysergic acid diethylamide or LSD. Ohler dug around the Sandoz company archives. He says that the then-CEO Arthur Stoll, a \"chemist maverick\", had notable correspondences with a German man named Richard Kuhn. \"[Kuhn was] a Nobel Prize winner for chemistry, but unfortunately, he was also Hitler's leading biochemist,\" Ohler says. At the time, the Nazis were increasingly paranoid about opponents within the regime. And they were finding that old-fashioned techniques like physical torture were not all that effective for extracting truth, so were looking at other means, including psychedelics. \"These [LSD] samples were used by the Nazis for their experiments ... with [other] psychedelics in order to find new interrogation techniques,\" Ohler says. The Nazis \"were looking for what they called the 'truth drug'\". The Americans \"basically continued the Nazi experiments in America on unwitting American citizens\", Ohler says .

About 20 of those 35 U.S.-backed regime changes were in Central and South America or the Caribbean. In some of those countries, the United States removed and replaced leaders again and again, with the concentration of someone kicking a vending machine to get the right candy bar to drop. In 1954 alone, for example, Washington ousted three Guatemalan leaders in succession. Globally, a third of all forced regime changes by all countries led to civil wars in the targeted nation within 10 years.

The news that Trump is going to pardon Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras who was sentenced to 45 years in U.S. prison just last year came as a shocker. The White House has said repeatedly that drug traffickers are narcoterrorists who are waging war on America, justifying their killing the boats every time. Yet Hernandez was convicted of conspiring to import 500,000 kilos of cocaine into the United States. While president, Hernández received millions of dollars from trafficking organizations in Honduras, Mexico, and from notorious drug lords like Joaquín Guzmán Loera, a.k.a. El Chapo, who was the former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel and is responsible for the murder of some 34,000 people. In return, according to prosecutors, President Hernández allowed vast amounts of cocaine to pass through Honduras on its way to the United States. Hernandez was tolerated if not preferred by previous U.S. administrations from Obama through the first Trump White House, because he and his National Party were business friendly, anti-communist, and supported by the neoconservatives now gunning against Maduro. Note: Beginning with the backing of an illegal and brutal military coup that egregiously violated human rights in 2009 , the US government\"under both Democratic and Republican administrations\"supported Hernández for years, funneling aid to his military and police forces while turning a blind eye to his deep involvement in drug trafficking, election fraud, and human rights abuses.

Data brokers , including one owned jointly by several airline companies, are actively selling data to ICE and other federal agencies. One of the most troubling recent developments in police data is that it captures information about all people. This “dragnet” approach to data collection is designed to give law enforcement maximum access to the entire population, transforming all personal information into potential evidence . Increasingly, law enforcement agencies are opting to purchase this data rather than collect it themselves, exploiting a loophole in Fourth Amendment legal protections.

They called it, aptly, the Ostbelgien Model . “Its main objectives are providing citizens not only a permanent voice in the process of decision making but also a systematic monitoring system to ensure they are heard,” the International Observatory on Participatory Democracy writes . “Ultimately, the project seeks to increase accountability and reinvigorate the agenda-setting power of common citizens.” Now, about six years into the experiment, which was created with the express purpose of increasing trust in government, participants say it’s working. Once a year, about 1,500 letters are sent to randomly chosen residents in Ostbelgien. Recipients indicate their interest. Of those who express interest, about 30 are chosen to become members of the citizens’ assembly. The newly formed assembly meets once a week for about two months, with each participant receiving a stipend of 155 euros (or $133) per day. They are assigned a topic of concern and have in-depth discussions about how the government should proceed, with an appointed moderator present to help move things along. Their recommendations to the parliament are not binding, but lawmakers are required to consider them.

The limited details available suggest an investigation that leaned heavily on a paid informant and at least one undercover FBI agent [who] were involved in nearly every stage of the case, including discussions of operational security and transporting members of the group to the site in the Mojave Desert where federal agents ultimately made the arrests. It is still unclear how the FBI first identified the group or how long the informant had been embedded before the bomb plot emerged a period defense attorneys say is central to any serious examination of entrapment , whereby defendants are coerced into crimes they would not otherwise commit, a frequent criticism of stings involving paid informants and undercover agents . Despite comments from Attorney General Pam Bondi, Patel, and others characterizing the Turtle Island Liberation Front as a coherent group ... there’s little evidence that any group by that name exists beyond a small digital footprint and a handful of attempts at organizing community events, including a self-defense workshop and a punk rock benefit show. A previous sting operation [involved] the so-called Newburgh Four , in which an aggressive and prolific FBI informant steered four poor Black men into a scheme to bomb synagogues and attack an Air Force base.

Spanberger’s CIA background raises concern that she will appoint people who will advance the CIA’s interests and ... enable greater CIA penetration of higher education. The latter is already a big problem , with the CIA planting professors, setting up journals and carrying out recruitment on many campuses, and even running covert operations through them. She also voted for massive military aid appropriations to Ukraine; pushed to have Russia designated as a state sponsor of terrorism; supported the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites; supported sanctions against Russia, Syria, Venezuela and other countries that took a devastating humanitarian toll; and expressed vocal support for Israel as it was carrying out genocide in Gaza and bombed Syria, Iran and Lebanon. While the CIA may not have directly assisted her campaign, which would be illegal, her election can still be considered a violation of constitutional principles mandating a separation of powers given her presumed loyalty to an Executive Branch agencythe CIA . John Kiriakou, a CIA whistleblower who lives in Virginia, stated that “Spanberger’s election as governor of Virginia is a real positive for the CIA, in that the CIA has countless facilities across the state and will be assured of continued cooperation with the Governor’s Office.

Using state-of-the-art brain scanners, his team pinpoints the neural changes that occur across a variety of deep meditative practices. Beyond mindfulness-related stress reduction, advanced practitioners report experiences of ecstatic bliss, deep insights into their own minds, radical compassionate states and prosocial ways of being, and even shifts in their fundamental sense of self . Advanced meditators sometimes report states of consciousness that are described as deeply peaceful, mentally clear or subjectively non-dual meaning there is no perceived distinction between self and other.

The Department of Defense has built a gilded fortress of people and processes that is slow, wasteful and married to the past. Of all the obstacles to fielding the military that America needs, the Pentagon’s bureaucracy may be the hardest to overcome. The byzantine system for buying and testing weapons isolates the military from the innovative parts of the American economy. Congress underwrites the dysfunction with appropriations that are designed to deliver wins for its members rather than for America’s national security. As the House and Senate work toward the country’s first trillion-dollar defense budget, over $52 billion is for things members of Congress added, unbidden, to the Pentagon’s wish list, according to the independent budget watchdog Taxpayers for Common Sense . No one can keep track of where all the money goes. The Defense Department is the only major federal agency never to get a clean bill of health from outside accountants, and has failed its last seven audits in as many years. When the bean counters can follow the money, they often find it has been wasted . The system feeds on itself.

Lobbyists succeeded in killing part of the National Defense Authorization Act that would have given service members the right to fix their equipment in the field without having to worry about military suppliers’ intellectual property. The decision to kill the popular proposal was made public Sunday after a closed-door conference of top congressional officials, including defense committee chairs.

Once companies sell hardware and software to the Pentagon, they can keep making money by forcing the government to hire them for repairs. Defense lobbyists pushed back hard against the proposal when it arose in the military budgeting process.

The nonprofit believes that it’s actually far more challenging for juvenile offenders to look their victims in the eye and explain why they behaved antisocially than it is to simply serve a suspension from school, where they’re distanced from friends and mentors, and often fall behind in their education. The Center for Restorative Youth Justice (CRYJ), is not a new organization, but their influence in Montana is growing. CRYJ receives referrals from Youth Court probation officers, school administrators, or school resource officers made on behalf of a juvenile offender who’s broken the law. CRYJ then has a conference with the youth and their parent or guardian, and creates a tailormade program of restorative justice. This can involve peer group discussion, victim-offender meetings, and other situations where the youth is given the forum to reestablish a relationship with the community, rather than something like a school suspension . CRYJ believes that by limiting the overuse of exclusionary discipline and emphasizing a community-driven approach, it can help at-risk youth avoid falling behind in school. We spend a lot of time separating people after there’s been harm, but often the deepest healing and learning and moving forward can happen ... when we can actually come together and talk about what happened and how to make things right.

Kasriel [said], “In my mediating, I witnessed how transformative it can be when people who see each other as enemies have the experience of being genuinely heard by the ‘other side.’ In these settings, I refined techniques for creating safety and holding space during difficult conversations-skills that directly informed several of the eight steps in my methodology.” Given her extensive experience, Kasriel realized that listening is not a passive act but a deliberate practice.

At least 139 undercover officers in deployments typically lasting four years were sent to infiltrate mainly leftwing and progressive groups. Undercover officers regularly deceived women into long-term sexual relationships. At least four of the undercover officers are known or alleged to have fathered children with women they met during their deployments . So far, between the mid-1970s and 2010 at least 20 police spies are known to have formed sexual relationships with women without disclosing their true identities. Many of these undercover officers were unmasked by the women themselves after long investigations. The undercover officers joined political groups and pretended to be activists. However, their real job was to collect information about the campaigners and their protests and send secret reports back to their bosses. Another issue under the microscope is how activists were allegedly unjustly convicted for offences connected to protests because key evidence gathered by the undercover officers was concealed. Are undercover police still infiltrating political groups? It is difficult to know. Mitting told police he wanted to know if undercover officers were currently been used to spy on political groups. No answer has been given in public so far. Note: Read more about the spycops scandal and the dozens of activists tricked into having romantic relationships with undercover police.

Birkenfeld would make clients more money by investing, often in weapons manufacturers. Then when the clients needed their money, UBS would lend it back at a reasonable interest rate. Birkenfeld wrote in Lucifer’s Banker that “UBS was making a fee for holding the guy’s cash in the first place, then making another fee for loaning him his own damn money! And guess what? That guy’s happy! He’s getting his deal done, and he’s still doing it with tax-free cash! I couldn’t believe it, and you know what?

The conditions in those facilities are often substandard, with Amnesty International criticizing the dehumanizing practice of holding prisoners in prolonged solitary confinement. Assistant professor of history [Benjamin] Weber writes of an “unspoken doctrine of prison imperialism” by which U.S. policy makers sought to “govern the globe through the codification and regulation of crime.” Weber adds that, “as prison imperialism expanded outwards, it always returned home producing new forms of social control over the growing number of people ensnared in prison in the United States. The forms of policing and record keeping that gave rise to the surveillance state between World War II and the Cold War were pioneered through overseas colonialism, covert operations and military interventions.” When the U.S. colonized the Philippines at the turn of the 20th century, mass incarceration became a linchpin of counterinsurgency strategy. It was designed to suppress the nationalist rebellion and messianic peasant leaders like Felipe Salvador, a leader of the anti-Spanish resistance.

Mainstream Media Is Eating It Up. as reported by The Intercept The 2018 legalization of sports betting gave rise to a host of apps making it ever easier to gamble on games. Kalshi and Polymarket offer that service, but also much more. They’ll take your bets, for instance, on the presidential and midterm elections, the next Israeli bombing campaign, or whether Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg will get divorced. Tarek Mansour, the CEO of Kalshi, laid it out simply at a conference held by Citadel Securities in October. “The long-term vision,” Mansour said, “is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion.” It’s as dystopian as it sounds . Betting apps have at times delivered better accuracy than polling results. For example, while pollsters clocked last year’s presidential race as deadlocked in the days before the election, Polymarket gave Trump an edge at 58 percent. But whether they are consistently better is a whole other story. Consider the 2022 midterm elections: Up until election night, the major prediction markets “failed spectacularly” and “projected outcomes for key races that turned out to be completely wrong,” according to one expert analysis . Prediction markets are also more prone to manipulation than they’d have you believe. And this can give deep-pocketed political actors another vessel for information warfare.

Mr. Farkas, 65, is the founder of Island Capital, a merchant bank, and has also been a powerful political benefactor, especially to former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, to whom he has donated millions and whom he employed in a lucrative role when Mr. Cuomo was out of office. He is also friendly with President Trump and has invested in projects of Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. But a 127-slip marina he owned in the U.S. Virgin Islands has put the billionaire real estate investor in a new and troubling spotlight. His co-owner was Jeffrey Epstein, whose private island served as the grim center of a sex-trafficking operation that was just a few miles south of the marina. Mr. Farkas’s name appears in Mr. Epstein’s personal emails. Mr. Epstein and Mr. Farkas had regular phone calls. Sometimes they met in person for breakfast in New York. And on one occasion, Mr. Epstein even offered the use of Mr. Farkas’s plane to visitors in need. Mr. Epstein’s stake in the marina was essentially unknown until 2018, when Jennifer Doelling, the chief financial officer of Island Global Yachting, revealed it during a deposition for a tax audit lawsuit. Mr. Epstein was first charged, on a single count of prostitution, in 2006, one year before the marina deal became final, although allegations had been swirling for years. The victim in the charge had been as young as 14 years old.

When Mark heard news about Jeffrey’s death, he boarded a plane and was the one who identified his body. At first, he thought that his brother had committed suicide, as the FBI and other government agencies claimed. “I had no reason to doubt it [the suicide claim]. He was facing a long time in jail,” Mark said. When he hired the renowned forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden, he expected Baden to confirm that his brother had committed suicide. However, he said that Dr. Baden instead said he couldn’t call it a suicide because it “looked too much like a homicide.” Fractures found in the autopsy photos under Jeffrey’s neck and jaw were inconsistent with a suicide hanging. Baden said: “Going over a thousand jail hangings, suicides in the New York City state prisons over the past 40-50 years, no one had three fractures [as Epstein did].” Dr. Kristin Roman, the New York City pathologist charged with doing the autopsy, came out of the autopsy, like Dr. Baden, saying that Jeffrey’s death looked more like a homicide than a suicide. The initial death certificate said, as cause of death, “pending further study.” Dr. Baden and Dr. Roman’s assessments did not appear in a June 2023 Department of Justice (DOJ) report .

The Justice Department carried out a National Inmate Survey in 177 federal prisons. The annual survey is required by the 2003 Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). The survey of 27,541 state and federal inmates found that some 4.1 percent of adult prison inmates reported being sexually victimized in state and federal prisons during the prior 12 months . Furthermore, 2.3 percent of inmates reported sexual victimization by another inmate while 2.2 percent reported sexual victimization by facility staff. Meanwhile, 17 prisons had rates defined as high compared to other facilities. The data pertains to prisons that participated in the survey so the data may not accurately capture those with the highest sexual victimization in America. The prison with the highest proportion of prison inmates reporting sexual victimization was Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a female prison in New York where 18.6 percent of inmates reported sexual victimization. Pontiac Correctional Center, a men's prison in Illinois was second, with 15.9 percent of inmates reporting sexual victimization.

A central theme of Trump’s anti-Somali rancor is that they come from a war-torn country without an effective centralized state, which in Trump’s reasoning speaks to their quality as a people, and therefore, their ability to contribute to American society. It is worth reminding ourselves, however, that Somalia’s state collapse and political instability is as much a result of imperial interventions, including from the U.S., as anything else . Cold War geopolitical machinations partly created the contextual background to the 1977-78 Somalia-Ethiopia war. Somalia’s defeat in this war set the stage for the disintegration of the state in 1991. This threw the country into a prolonged state of conflict, resulting in mass displacement and migration. U.S. drone strikes in Somalia have continued over the past two decades with varying degrees of intensity at different times. Since Trump returned to office, his administration has dramatically increased the drone campaign, while the transparency of the decision-making process and consequences of these strikes have become more opaque. Recent scholarship has noted the link between U.S. militarism in Somalia and the policing and surveillance of Somali immigrants in the U.S. Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric ... conveniently omits the U.S role in fomenting instability.

What may have made sense in ecological contexts defined by pasture, seasonality, and low chemical inputs no longer maps onto an industrial system dependent on genetically engineered feed, pervasive herbicide use, and routine pharmaceutical intervention. The newly released Dietary Guidelines for Americans double down on that disconnect. Rather than grappling with how food is actually produced in the United States today, they reinforce dietary advice that assumes a food system that no longer exists . The guidelines promote increased consumption of meat and dairy while remaining almost entirely silent on how those foods are produced, what they contain, and whether our land, water, animals, and bodies can bear the cost. In the United States today, the overwhelming majority of meat, eggs, and dairy come from highly intensive industrial systems. These systems rely on confinement, routine drug use, chemically saturated feed, and enormous waste burdens. Animals are routinely administered antibiotics, hormones, beta agonists, coccidiostats, and other pharmaceutical agents, many of which accumulate in animal tissues and enter the human food supply. Health policy that ignores these realities is not reform. It is avoidance.

Unlike factories, most factory farms aren’t legally responsible for their pollution . Unlike human poop, animal poop isn’t legally required to be treated before it is released into the environment. America’s concentrated animal feeding operations, the industrial livestock farms known as C.A.F.O.s, produce twice as much waste as America’s toilets, but nobody is tracking where or how it gets flushed. C.A.F.O.s keep getting bigger, even though they are wildly unpopular. Polls from the A.S.P.C.A. suggest that 89 percent of Americans are concerned about factory farms and 74 percent want to ban new ones. The critics now include right-wing natural-food advocates as well as left-wing environmentalists and animal rights activists. Like it or not, 99 percent of U.S. meat now comes from factory farms. The solution to pollution from big C.A.F.O.s is not to ban them or even to restrict their size. It’s to regulate them like any other industrial polluter. States enforce the Clean Water Act, and some are more vigilant than others about preventing farmers from applying their manure in ways that tend to wash it into waterways. But a lot still ends up there. A feedlot cow can unload 100 pounds of manure a day, and unlike fracking water, nuclear waste and municipal sewage, nobody’s really responsible for making sure it doesn’t contaminate nature.

Now, after volunteering in an experiment to count how many such substances people are subjected to, Wesselius and his wife are one step closer to understanding the consequences of living among chemical-sprayed fields of seed potato, sugar beet, wheat, rye and onion. “We were shocked,” said Wesselius ... who had exposure to eight different pesticides through his skin, with even more chemicals found through tests of his blood, urine and stool. “I was contaminated by 11 sorts of pesticides. My wife, who is more strict in her organic nourishment, had seven sorts of pesticides.” Regulators closely monitor dietary intake of pesticides when deciding whether they are safe enough for the market, but little attention has been paid to the effects of breathing them in or absorbing them through the skin. According to a new study , even people who live far from farms are exposed to several different types of pesticides from non-dietary sources. The researchers got 641 participants in 10 European countries to wear silicone wristbands continuously for one week to capture external exposure to 193 pesticides.

Bill Bullard, the CEO of the trade association R-CALF USA, explained to More Perfect Union that cattle ranchers are essentially at the bottom of the pyramid in the beef-producing process, while the top is occupied by “four meat packers controlling 80% of the market.” “It’s there that the meat packers are able to exert their market power in order to leverage down the price that the cattle feeder receives for the animals,” Bullard said. To illustrate the impact this has had on farmers, Bullard pointed out that cattle producers in 1980 received 63 cents for every dollar paid by consumers for beef, whereas four decades later they were receiving just 37 cents for every dollar . “That allocation has flipped on its head because the marketplace is fundamentally broken,” Bullard [said]. Angela Huffman, president of Farm Action, recently highlighted the role played by the four big meatpacking companies\"Tyson, Cargill, National Beef, and JBS\"in hurting US ranchers.

Though she’d had other birds before, when Taylor-O’Connor brought home her parrot Ellie, who is at the center of the documentary, she noticed that the bird was exhibiting anger and frustration. She found herself relating to Ellie and wondering how to help. “I didn't want her to experience what I had felt from my training center experiences, which is you just keep it all inside and then it bubbles out in harder ways. I wanted her to always have a voice,” she says. “So, that's how it began to spur me into ‘What does it look like for her to communicate? What does it look like for other animals to communicate?’” As a result, she started teaching Ellie tricks and saw her demeanor totally change as she developed a love of learning.

Seen around town with an injured kite perched on his head, it’s just one of dozens that Rodgers Oloo Magutha has nursed back to health. These have included pigeons, storks, owls, and other wild birds that fall a-fowl of Nairobi’s powerlines, cars, windows, or other hazards that industrialized areas pose to winged wildlife. Magutha himself is not from Nairobi, but grew up in poverty next to Kenya’s Lake Nakuru National Park. A haven for bird life, Magutha used to sneak into the park to watch birds, birthing a love of nature and wildlife in the young man that lasts to this day. These quiet moments were rare in his difficult, homeless existence. He grew up without a family home, but as often as it was possible, he’d take care of birds he found that were hurt, hungry, or diseased. Today, Magutha has reliable lodgings, and he’s used them to house birds which have in turn made him a local social media figure . His Instagram account has a distinctly African flavor ... but he also drops educational bombs for young fans, such as how flamingos get their pink coloration. His dream is to eventually open a proper avian rescue center; one that’s legal, safe, and equipped with the facilities needed to care for them. Until then, he carries on with the help of donations, feeding the birds he saves as much as he is able to, and releasing them when or if they’re able to return to the wild.

They had come to discuss a crucial element of a peace plan drafted by Kyiv and Washington: Ukraine’s postwar recovery. BlackRock had been enlisted to help build a strategy for what President Volodymyr Zelensky has called an $800 billion “prosperity plan.” The meeting, held at BlackRock’s headquarters, kick-started work on identifying funding sources and investment priorities. BlackRock’s role has generated more questions than answers, as the Trump administration steers plans for rebuilding Ukraine toward American business interests. Seven European and Ukrainian officials ... voiced doubts about BlackRock’s ability to attract the enormous investments envisioned. The involvement in the talks of a private firm whose main business is to maximize financial returns has reinforced concerns that the Trump administration views Ukraine’s reconstruction as a profit-making opportunity for the U.S. government and American companies , rather than as primarily a humanitarian or security matter. Last year, President Trump pushed for a deal granting the United States a stake in Ukraine’s mineral wealth. In peace talks with Kyiv, the president’s main negotiators have been real estate developers.

They watched in awe as multiple unknown objects flooded the skies, changed shapes and colors, appeared and then disappeared, traveled at high speeds, and stopped mid-air. A few officers made drawings of the different UFO formations seen over a wide area around and over the base. The most dramatic statement was from a senior communications officer who watched in horror as the launch control system for the missiles suddenly lit up and someone, somehow, entered the proper codes that would unleash hell . Nuclear missiles that could reach and obliterate New York City in a mere 25 minutes were ready to launch. And the Russians were powerless to stop it.

Details of extraterrestrial encounters on the Central Coast were discussed in government hearings and explored in the newly released documentary The Age of Disclosure (2025). The film features government insiders who claim the feds have spent 80 years trying to cover up the existence of non-human life. Based on what they claim to have seen, the former admirals, lieutenants, and colonels were convinced that UAPs are real and they are definitely not human. Witness testimonies recount highly unusual experiences at Vandenberg, such as a gigantic red, glowing square object that allegedly hovered over the base in 2003. In total, five incidents involving UAPs occurred at Vandenberg between 2003 and 2005, according to Jeffrey Nuccetelli, a former military police officer with 16 years of active service under his belt. He relays it all in detail: a red, glowing square the size of a football field, erratic lights dancing over the ocean or blinking in and out of the skyline, a huge sphere of light floating over his own home, and the intimidation of witnesses to keep their mouths shut . Vandenberg home to the National Missile Defense Project \" was “repeatedly visited by UAP,” back when personnel were completing “historic launches,” Nuccetelli said.

According to anonymous sources tied to Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), which is headquartered at Pax River, certain military programs at the base have been involved in analyzing and exploiting technology recovered from non-human craft for years. UFO whistleblower Luis Elizondo stated in written testimony to Congress that a specially built hangar was constructed at Pax River specifically for the transfer of extraterrestrial technology. Under oath, Elizondo described a plan where this hangar would help major defense contractor Lockheed Martin move non-human technology to another company called Bigelow Aerospace for further study and analysis. Last year, Dr Hal Puthoff, a physicist and electrical engineer who worked on the government's psychic spy and UFO research programs, revealed on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast that the US military has recovered more than 10 spacecraft since the infamous Roswell incident. Puthoff claimed that some of these craft were actually fully intact craft that had been 'gifted' to humans by extraterrestrials.

And he finds himself at the center of a furor over his links to the serial sex abuser, after the publication this week of a 2003 birthday book in which Mandelson penned a 10-page tribute calling Epstein his “best pal.” In one cryptic [email] exchange, Epstein referred to an upcoming meeting between his lawyer and somebody he called “mr. big,” and told Mandelson, “I need your guy to remind him one time before the meeting.. then we are done.” Mandelson replied, “I will get a message. He is travelling at moment.” Neither “mr. big” nor “your guy” are named. News accounts in the early 2000s describe how Mandelson helped persuade Queen Elizabeth to appoint Prince Andrew, her second son and the Duke of York, to an influential role as an international trade ambassador.

The document, issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and dated Friday, August 9, 2019, states that Epstein had already been found unresponsive and pronounced dead. But prison records and official accounts show Epstein was not discovered unresponsive until the morning of August 10, 2019. According to official accounts, Epstein was discovered unresponsive in his cell shortly after 6.30am on August 10 by a corrections officer. Medical personnel attempted to revive him, but he was pronounced dead soon afterward. Epstein’s death came amid a cascade of failures inside one of the federal government’s most secure detention facilities. Prison records show that guards assigned to monitor Epstein did not conduct required checks during the overnight hours before his body was discovered. Scheduled rounds at 3am and 5am were missed, according to official findings. Furthermore, cameras positioned outside Epstein’s cell were not functioning properly that night. Investigators later confirmed that at least two surveillance cameras had malfunctioned, leaving critical gaps in visual monitoring. Because of those failures, officials were unable to establish a definitive timeline of Epstein’s final moments. Note: Mark Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein's brother, believes that his death involved an official cover-up . An email thread between high-level federal investigators discusses what appears to be an unnamed individual attempting to extort Mark Epstein. The sender claims: \" with the coordination of the director of prison regulations, the cameras were tampered with and some the videos of the prison cameras were cut. At that time, prison guards [redacted] were paid $6,500 so that they would not visit prisoners at this time. Within 15 minutes, a man named [redacted] entered your brother's prison cell and strangled him. \" For more, internal US Bureau of Prison (BOP) documents suggest a possible cover-up, while a 60 Minutes 2020 investigation uncovered compelling evidence that challenges the official suicide ruling in Epstein's death\"including suspicious neck fractures, missing surveillance footage, and a series of unexplained security failures. \" </s><|im_end|>\\n", "chunk_id": "wtkcsv:14365:2df7177513d7", "wtk_id": 14365.0}, {"doc_idx": 38445, "dataset": "wtk_pipe_csv_260223", "filename": "260223WTK.csv", "source_url": "https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-why-epsteins-links-the-cia-so-important", "publisher": "WTK Archive", "found_on": "WTK Archive", "title": "", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Why Epstein’s Links to the CIA Are So Important as reported by The Nation On November 18, Donald Trump suffered a major political defeat when the House of Representatives passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act by a nearly unanimous vote: 4271. But the final version specified that the Department of Justice must make public “all unclassified” documents on Epstein. The word unclassified potentially gives Trump and the CIA wide latitude to hold back Epstein-related materials that they claim are too sensitive to release . People have linked Epstein to the spy world for years. In 2019, Vicky Ward, writing in The Daily Beast, reported that Trump’s then\"labor secretary, Alex Acosta\"who, as a federal prosecutor, had cut a notorious sweetheart plea deal with Epstein before his trial in 2008\"had made some startling comments about Epstein when he was being vetted for his role in the first Trump administration. As Ward noted, Acosta claimed that he had “cut the non-prosecution deal with one of Epstein’s attorneys because he had ‘been told’ to back off, that Epstein was above his pay grade. ‘I was told Epstein “ belonged to intelligence” and to leave it alone ,’ he told his interviewers in the Trump transition [team].” Just as much of the policing of the American empire is now done by private military companies (notably Constellis, formerly known as Academi and Blackwater), billionaires like Epstein have their own private foreign policy. Whatever work Epstein did with the CIA or the Mossad would have been as a peer rather than an employee . Note: Our latest 7-min video with Joe Martino of Collective Evolution explores compelling evidence that Epstein was heavily involved in both CIA and Mossad operations . Even after his conviction as a sex offender, Epstein was meeting with top officials at the CIA and the White House .
