exists to support claims that a highly pathogenic bird flu can be transmitted from raw milk to humans You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Sally Fallon Morell Story at a glance The campaign against raw milk began with a fabricated 1945 article in Coronet magazine claiming a deadly brucellosis outbreak in a nonexistent town leading to restrictive laws against raw milk starting in Michigan in 1948 A 2007 PowerPoint presentation by a U S Food and Drug Administration FDA official falsely maligned raw milk using flawed reports none of these reports proved pasteurization would have prevented alleged outbreaks The 2024 U S Department of Agriculture USDA announcement attributed symptoms in dairy cows to avian flu without a confirmed viral presence in milk relying on questionable PCR testing methods Despite claims there is no peer reviewed evidence supporting the transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza from raw milk to humans While pasteurization is promoted as making milk safe the actual diversion or destruction of milk from infected animals suggests that pasteurization may not guarantee safety Few of us were born when the forces for milk pasteurization launched the first major attack on Nature s perfect food In 1945 a magazine called Coronet published an article Raw Milk Can Kill You blaming raw milk for an outbreak of brucellosis in a town called Crossroads U S A killing one third of the inhabitants The Reader s Digest picked up the story and ran it a year later Just one problem with this piece of reporting There was no town called Crossroads and no outbreak of brucellosis The whole story was a fabrication otherwise known as a lie And lies about raw milk have continued ever since Unfortunately the fictitious Crossroads story paved the way for laws against selling raw milk starting with Michigan in 1948 Here s another example of lies against raw milk which I referenced in an earlier post but it is worth repeating In 2007 John F Sheehan the FDA the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and the Division of Dairy and Egg Safety prepared a PowerPoint maligning raw milk It was presented to the 2005 National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments by Cindy Leonard As shown in the table below all of the 15 reports associating outbreaks of foodborne illness with raw milk that Sheehan cites are seriously flawed For example in two of the 15 the study authors presented no evidence that anyone consumed raw milk products and in one of them the outbreak did not even exist Not one of the studies

25 the USDA FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC as well as state veterinary and public health officials announced the investigation of an illness among primarily older dairy cows in Texas Kansas and New Mexico that is causing decreased lactation low appetite and other symptoms The agencies claim that samples of unpasteurized milk from sick cattle in Kansas and Texas have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza HPAI Officials blame the outbreak on contact with wild migratory birds and possibly from transmission between cattle The press release specifically warns against the consumption of raw milk a warning repeated in numerous publications and Internet postings According to the press release national laboratories have confirmed the presence of HPAI through testing but it does not reveal the type of test used to detect this so called viral illness Lie No 1 Researchers have found HPAI virus in the milk of sick cows Officials have NOT found any viruses in the milk or any other secretions of the sick cows The CDC has yet to reply to repeated requests for proof of finding the isolated HPAI virus in any fluid of any sick chicken or other animal Nor have health and agriculture agencies in Canada Japan the United Kingdom and Europe provided any proof of an isolated avian influenza virus As for all the studies you can find in a PubMed search claiming isolation of a virus not one of them shows the true isolation of a virus any virus from the fluids phlegm blood urine lung fluids etc of any animal bird or human The truth is that viruses serve as the whipping boy for environmental toxins and in the confinement animal system there are lots of them hydrogen sulfide carbon dioxide methane and ammonia from excrement for example Then there are toxins in the feed such as arsenic added to chicken feed and mycotoxins tropane and β carboline alkaloids in soybean meal By blaming nonexistent viruses agriculture officials can avoid stepping on any big

confirmed the presence of HPAI through testing They don t say anything about the kind of test they used but it is almost certainly the PCR polymerase chain reaction test The PCR test detects genetic material from a pathogen or abnormal cell sample and allows researchers to make many copies of a small section of DNA or RNA The test was not designed to determine or diagnose disease it was designed to amplify or increase a certain piece of genetic material Each amplification is a doubling of the material If you amplify 30 times you will get a negative amplify 36 times or more and you will get a positive At 60 amplifications everyone will test positive for whatever bit of genetic material you believe can cause disease If you want to show that you have a pandemic brewing just amplify amplify amplify Folks this is not a valid test not good science by any stretch of the imagination especially as there was no virus to begin with How many times did our health officials amplify the samples they obtained from the milk of the sick cows Be sure to ask them when you email Aphispress usda gov for proof of the virus Lie No 3 The virus is highly pathogenic According to The Wall Street Journal one just one person working in the dairies got sick and tested positive for avian influenza after exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected with the H5N1 bird flu The person reported eye redness or conjunctivitis as his only symptom a symptom that can be explained by exposure to any of the many airborne toxins in confinement dairies How are they treating the illness With vitamin A and herbal eyedrops No the poor sod is getting treatment with a toxic antiviral drug According to the CDC the disease in humans ranges from mild infections which include upper respiratory and eye related symptoms to severe pneumonia If the virus is so highly pathogenic we d expect a lot of workers working around these sick cows to end up in the hospital but we ve heard of none so far Lie No 4 You can

Coleman Recent risk communications from CDC FDA and USDA regarding transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus or HPAI subtype H5N1 to humans via raw milk include no supporting evidence of viral transmission from raw milk to humans in the peer reviewed literature An extensive body of scientific evidence from the peer reviewed literature does not support the assumption by these US government agencies that nonexistent HPAI transmits to humans via milkborne or foodborne routes and causes disease Nor does the scientific evidence support the recommendation that consumers should avoid raw milk and raw milk products Coleman notes the suite of bioactive components in raw milk including bovine milk that destroy pathogens and strengthen the gut wall Many of these bioactive components of raw milk are sensitive to heat and may be absent inactive or present in lower concentrations in pasteurized milks Cross disciplinary evidence demonstrates that raw milk from healthy cows is not inherently dangerous consistent with the CDC evidence of trends for 2005 2020 and evidence of benefits and risks There is no scientific evidence that HPAI in raw milk causes human disease And while USDA FDA and CDC assure the public that pasteurization will make milk safe they note that milk from infected animals is being diverted or destroyed implying that pasteurization alone does not guarantee safety In any event sales of industrial pasteurized milk continue their relentless decline Fortunately raw milk drinkers are already skeptical of government pronouncements and are skilled at seeing through lies Both large and small raw milk dairy farms report that sales are booming The current bird flu fracas is just another Crossroads USA a bunch of lies fostered by a dishonest dairy

État puisse passer outre l ordre d une mère and de faire vacciner son enfant a demandé le commentateur médical John Campbell Ph D dans un épisode récent de son émission sur YouTube Campbell a évoqué la récente victoire juridique rapportée dans le Telegraph d une mère britannique dont le fils handicapé de 24 ans présentait une anomalie chromosomique qui selon les experts l exposait à un risque

qu il présentait pour une personne atteinte de cette maladie Pourtant les médecins et les travailleurs sociaux ont exigé qu il soit vacciné pour le plus grand bien de la société Après une bataille judiciaire de trois ans au cours de laquelle Sarah a dépensé toutes les économies de sa vie soit 25 000 livres plus 65 000 livres supplémentaires qu elle a collectées grâce au crowdfunding elle a obtenu gain de cause pour protéger son fils de la vaccination Selon John Campbell lorsque Sarah a décrit la saga comme un cauchemar kafkaïen elle avait raison car dans les romans de Franz Kafka les

Real IDs which many people don t know they have and replace them with regular ones She also noted that people can fly with passports if they want to resist getting a Real ID People can find out if they have a Real ID by visually inspecting their licenses Real IDs have a special symbol usually a star Also if a license isn t a Real ID it will typically say that the ID is not for federal

Vaccine Makers Rep Paul Gosar on Thursday reintroduced legislation in the U S House of Representatives that would allow people injured by vaccines to sue the vaccine manufacturer It would also expand the statute of limitations on vaccine injury and allow people injured by a vaccine to pursue both federal and civil compensation You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Rep Paul Gosar R Ariz on Tuesday reintroduced legislation to end the liability shield for vaccine manufacturers and allow people injured by a vaccine to sue the drug s manufacturer Children s Health Defense CHD is one of the bill s supporters The End the Vaccine Carveout Act targets two federal laws that give legal immunity to vaccine makers the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 NCVIA and the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2005 PREP Act The NCVIA s liability shield covers vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC for routine use in children or pregnant women The PREP Act protects manufacturers from liability for injuries or death caused by vaccines or other countermeasures implemented during a public health emergency Current immunity provisions unfairly shielding Big Pharma from the harms caused by their products prevent those injured by vaccines to pursue a civil lawsuit in state or federal court Gosar said in the press release Gosar s bill removes language in the NCVIA that requires people injured by vaccines to first seek compensation through the government run National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP Under the new legislation the vaccine injured could file lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers while also submitting a VICP claim In a press release Gosar s office said the VICP sets an unreasonably high bar for claimants to meet The plaintiff must prove that the vaccine manufacturer deliberately withheld information relating to the safety or efficacy of the vaccine engaged in criminal or illegal activity relating to the safety and effectiveness of vaccines or by clear and convincing evidence failed to exercise due care Satisfying these requirements is practically an impossibility The issue of holding vaccine makers legally accountable for injuries caused by their products came up last week during a U S Senate hearing on vaccine injuries Sen Richard Blumenthal D Conn a staunch vaccine supporter suggested it was time to revisit the liability issue as did Sen Bernie Moreno R Ohio who told witnesses that when it comes to the drug industry The government has decided that this particular industry gets a free pass Sen Moreno on blanket immunity for vaccine manufacturers What s interesting about this industry the government has decided that this particular industry gets a free pass that this

ChildrensHD July 18 2025 Liability shield has led to billions of dollars in profits for Big Pharma Gosar s bill would allow the vaccine injured to file a claim for any injury sustained since the NCVIA s inception in 1988 This would end the NCVIA s two year statute of limitations for deaths and three year statute of limitations for injuries It would also allow people injured by COVID 19 vaccines now protected under the PREP Act to sue the makers of those vaccines Last week Rep Thomas Massie R Ky introduced a separate piece of legislation that if passed would also repeal the sweeping liability shield that exempts COVID 19 vaccine manufacturers from responsibility for serious injuries or death caused by their products Massie is also a cosponsor of Gosar s bill The Biden administration declared the COVID 19 public health emergency over in May 2023 However in December 2024 President Joe Biden extended the liability shield for COVID 19 countermeasures under the PREP Act through the end of 2029 the 12th such extension since 2020 Gosar s bill also would allow people injured by a COVID 19 vaccine to file a claim with VICP instead of the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program CICP a government run program established under the PREP Act CICP has faced criticism for its slow pace in resolving claims and the limited compensation it offers As of June 1 of the 13 836 claims related to COVID 19 countermeasures filed with CICP to date 75 were found eligible for compensation and 39 of those have been compensated The overwhelming majority of claims were denied 4 338 or are pending review or in review 9 423 Gosar said the NCVIA and PREP Act liability shields have resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in profits for Big Pharma while leaving tens of thousands of people without the ability to seek legal justice and compensation for injuries caused by vaccines He said there is an unfortunate lack of science regarding the dangerous side effects of vaccines due

Regulations intended to bolster the global response to future pandemic threats WHO member states have until July 19 to reject last year s amendments before they become binding international law The

law The Pandemic Agreement calls for equitable and timely access to vaccines therapeutics and diagnostics requiring members to provide 20 of their supplies of these products to the WHO during a pandemic for distribution to poorer countries WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the agreement as a victory for public health science and multilateral action and said that the world is safer today following its passage Despite frequent criticism that the Pandemic Agreement threatens the national sovereignty of WHO member states the WHO stated that the agreement does not give the organization any authority to direct order alter or otherwise prescribe the national and or domestic law or policies of any Party Astin Gregory called the inclusion of this clause in the agreement a subtle victory and a reflection of the campaigning that has been done around the world Treaty is about locking down until vaccination under emergency rule The WHO stated that the Pandemic Agreement also does not give the WHO the ability to mandate or otherwise impose any requirements such as ban or accept travellers impose vaccination mandates or therapeutic or diagnostic measures or implement lockdowns Dr Meryl Nass founder of Door to Freedom said that compared to earlier drafts of the agreement all of the orders that WHO wanted to be able to give to member states were wiped out in the final draft But in a post on Substack epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher said the new agreement pressures national sovereignty lays groundwork for the future implementation of vaccine passports and digital surveillance tools and could facilitate fast track approvals of emergency use vaccines during pandemics National governments will be pressured to align their laws with global dictates Hulscher wrote Experimental products would be rapidly deployed without sufficient safety data Physician and activist Dr Maria Hubmer Mogg said the WHO s one size fits all approach to pandemic response interferes totally with sovereignty and the doctor patient relationship The U S is very fortunate for having broken from the WHO said Jeffrey Tucker president and founder of the Brownstone Institute He said the agreement locks in the model of pandemic response we experienced during the COVID 19 pandemic and is about locking down until vaccination under emergency rule Financing a potential Achilles heel for the pandemic agreement According to Reuters while passage of the Pandemic Agreement was touted as a victory for the WHO the agreement is significantly weakened following the withdrawal of the U S from the organization which is set to be finalized next year The U S which poured billions of dollars into vaccine development during the COVID pandemic would not be bound by the

debasing me in media circles has become a means of career advancement and that any demonstration of approval invites career suicide I ve therefore become very familiar with the obligatory journalistic

mortalities from infectious disease in the twentieth century from the Feb 23 article Kennedy proposed instead that other societal improvements like better sanitation were responsible for the disappearance of childhood diseases at that time not vaccines I have not seen convincing evidence supporting this Because Instagram has removed our interview do liberals even complain about censorship anymore I can t swear to the accuracy of my recollection but as I recall our conversation I cited in support of my assertion Children s Health Defense s exhaustive 2010 study Annual Summary of Vital Statistics Trends in the Health of Americans during the 20th Century Guyer et al December 2000 published in Pediatrics After extensively studying a century of recorded data the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Johns Hopkins researchers concluded Thus vaccinations does not account for the impressive declines in mortality from infectious diseases seen in the first half of the twentieth century Similarly in 1977 Boston University epidemiologists and husband and wife John and Sonja McKinlay published their seminal work in the Millbank Memorial Fund Quarterly on the role that vaccines and other medical interventions played in the massive 74 decline in mortality seen in the twentieth century The Questionable Contribution of Medical Measures to the Decline of Mortality in the United States in the Twentieth Century In this article which was formerly required reading in U S medical schools the McKinlays pointed out that 92 3 of the mortality rate decline happened between 1900 and 1950 before most vaccines existed and that all medical measures including antibiotics and surgeries appear to have contributed little to the overall decline in mortality in the United States since about 1900 having in many instances been introduced several decades after a marked decline had already set in and having no detectable influence in most instances The McKinlays study",

The McKinlays study concludes that vaccines and all other medical interventions including antibiotics and surgeries were responsible for at most somewhere between 1 and 3 5 of that decline Put differently at least 96 5 of the decline and likely more than that occurred for the reasons I cited in my discussion with you Finally The McKinlays presciently warned that profiteers among the medical establishments would try to assign credit for the mortality declines to vaccines and other interventions in order to justify government mandates for their medical interventions Seven years before the McKinlays publication Harvard Medical School Dr Dean Edward H Kass delivered a landmark speech to the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America Kass was a founding member and first president of the organization and founding editor of the Journal of Infectious Diseases On Oct 19 1970 Kass told his colleagues that the dramatic decline in infectious disease mortalities during the 20th century is merely the most important happening in the history of the health of man He cautioned that This decline in rates of certain disorders correlated roughly with socioeconomic circumstances Yet we have only the vaguest and most general notions about how it happened and by what mechanisms socioeconomic improvement and decreased rates of certain diseases run in parallel we had accepted some half truths and had stopped searching for the whole truths The principal half truths were that medical research had stamped out the great killers of the past tuberculosis diphtheria pneumonia puerperal sepsis etc and that medical research and our superior system of medical care were major factors extending life expectancy thus providing the American people with the highest level of health available in the world That these are half truths is known but is perhaps not as well known as it should be Daniel despite the popularity of your assumption I have not been able to find a published peer reviewed study that suggests it has any basis beyond pharmaceutical industry propaganda about which both Kass and the McKinlays so eloquently warned Giving credit to vaccination for the

events especially those that are relatively rare can be difficult to detect pre licensure COVID vaccine advocates argue that post licensing surveillance will remedy the deficiencies in the pre licensing clinical trial data collection system As you know this is not true The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS a voluntary reporting system co administered by FDA and CDC since 1990 is a well documented public failure You have said yourself that the vaccine injury reports received by FDA represent only a fraction of the serious adverse events that occur For twenty years thoughtful public health advocates including the United States Congress have reiterated your concerns A 2010 federal study commissioned by HHS and performed by Harvard consultants on behalf of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ found that fewer than 1 of vaccine adverse events are ever reported to VAERS Back in 1993 after recognizing that adverse event reports are essential to ensure the safety of drugs biologicals medical devices and other products regulated by the FDA once they are introduced into the US market and acknowledging that even large well designed clinical trials cannot uncover every problem that can come to light once a product is widely used you introduced an overhaul of the system for reporting problems with drugs and medical devices called MEDWatch However writing about the new system in the Journal of the American Medical Association JAMA you noted that MEDWatch would not affect VAERS nor attempt to remedy underreporting of adverse events associated with vaccines At the time even vaccine manufacturers were estimating confidentially a fifty fold underreporting of vaccine adverse events Since then critics have called the government s attention to the shortcomings of VAERS time and time again Although the reporting barriers that you outlined in 1993 addressed drugs and medical devices only those barriers apply as much or more to vaccines Obstacles include health professionals and vaccine recipients inability to recognize or even suspect a possible relationship between a given vaccine and the adverse outcomes the powerful disincentives for physicians to acknowledge or report vaccine injuries uncertainty surrounding which adverse events ought to be reported a medical culture that has not made adverse event reporting an ingrained

addition of a large number of vaccines to the childhood and adult vaccine schedules since 1986 following passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act HHS has made almost no revisions to the

Another important VAERS limitation is that the system does not routinely follow up on the reports it receives by contacting the reporting health professional six to 12 months later to determine if the individual fully recovered from the reaction or further deteriorated Without this longitudinal information neither the CDC nor doctors can have accurate or meaningful safety data on vaccines The Vaccine Injury Table again illustrates the fallout despite numerous published reports linking vaccines to a wide range of autoimmune conditions and despite latency periods for autoimmune reactions known to range from weeks to years the only autoimmune like conditions listed in the table are chronic arthritis in association with rubella containing vaccines thrombocytopenic purpura measles containing vaccines and Guillain Barré syndrome seasonal influenza vaccines 2 The Department of Health and Human Services has ignored numerous opportunities to strengthen VAERS The 2010 AHRQ study

detection and reporting using electronic health records EHRs prospectively monitoring the records for new diagnoses changes in laboratory values and new allergies for up to 6 weeks following vaccinations and sending messages to clinicians when the system flagged suggestive events The system also automatically reported high probability AEs following vaccination to VAERS even if the clinician chose to take no action Over eight months and almost 92 000 vaccinations the ESP VAERS system generated from zero to eight alerts per clinician per month mean 0 4 and captured adverse outcomes including seizures rashes and other allergic reactions Bell s palsy pleural effusion lymphocytopenia and hypothyroidism At the study s conclusion the researchers reported that The odds of a VAERS report submission during the pilot period were 30 2 times greater than the odds during the comparable pre pilot period A similar proof of concept study focusing on use of EHR based systems to automatically send electronic reports of adverse drug events to the FDA in real time carried out at Brigham and Women s Hospital in 2008 2009 and published in 2010 found that such systems are not only efficient and acceptable to clinicians but can provide detailed clinical information and have the potential to greatly increase the number and quality of spontaneous reports submitted to the FDA As an added bonus the researchers found that it took clinicians on average 53 seconds to complete and submit the requisite form In 1990 an FDA commissioned study in Rhode Island showed that even a simple

PRISM Post Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring launched a decade earlier as a demonstration project to monitor the safety of H1N1 influenza vaccines After the 2009 rollout FDA folded PRISM which draws on data from national health insurance plans and state and local immunization registries into its Mini Sentinel project with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care serving as the government s lead collaborator and then in 2016 into the Sentinel System now billed as the world s largest multisite distributed database dedicated to medical product safety In 2017 FDA also initiated the Biologics

could easily constrain researchers ability to detect outcomes of interest For example a 2018 study of the notoriously problematic quadrivalent human papillomavirus HPV vaccine looked at adverse events

symptoms Dressen heard about others with vaccine injuries In January 2021 the National Institutes of Health NIH set out to try to understand what Dressen and others were experiencing The NIH concluded the patients had temporal associations between vaccination and their symptoms but denied an etiological association Dressen told Kennedy The NIH stopped communicating with Dressen and other patients by late 2021 Dressen started looking for answers soon after she first reacted to the shot She and her husband discovered there were others who were injured by the AstraZeneca vaccine and like her removed from the trials Kennedy commented There were 180 people who disappeared from the study after the first dose As far as we know other people had reactions like yours and because they withdrew AstraZeneca simply pretended as if those reactions had not happened Dressen wondered why her story and the many other cases of vaccine injury were not being covered by the press Adding insult to

Kennedy applauded her heroism What you re doing for those people is you re talking about protocols that work that have worked for people in the group that they otherwise cannot learn about You re

for every major biosecurity agency the very ones behind so much of the dangerous research and secretive goings on that have created so many disasters On the face of it that seems like very bad news Tucker said However he also said there may be more at play Cleaning up the mess at the CDC requires more than a pundit influencer or outspoken critic of the status quo It will require expert management experience with the problem technical expertise and knowledge that comes only through long exposure to the world of classified information backed by training in infectious disease Monarez has all of that With RFK at the helm and serving as her boss she could be empowered to do exactly what is necessary to open up the information systems to the public and clean up the agency in the way that s needed In other words it takes a hacker to defeat the hackers She might be precisely the one to do what needs to be done We are waiting and hoping Monarez assumed the acting director position a few days after Trump took office on January 23 leaving her job as deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health ARPA H The agency which operates under the U S Department of

vaccines but little else is publicly known about her stance on other vaccines The CDC also confirmed earlier this month before Trump withdrew Weldon s nomination for CDC director that the agency was planning a large study into potential connections between the vaccines and autism The agency did not respond by deadline when asked to clarify Monarez s position on childhood vaccines or whether the vaccines and autism study will take place under her leadership The CDC is responsible for making vaccine recommendations for Americans It sets the increasingly controversial childhood immunization schedule which most physicians use to determine which vaccines a child needs and which schools use to set vaccine mandates Once a vaccine is on the childhood schedule the vaccine producer also receives broad protection from liability for injuries resulting from that vaccine The combination of school vaccine mandates and no liability guarantees a steady revenue stream for vaccine makers Currently the CDC recommends that by age 18 a child receive at least 76 doses of 18 different vaccines including the COVID 19 vaccine Kennedy has said he would investigate the childhood schedule He

announcement in the mainstream media framed Kennedy as a longtime vaccine critic who has put forward the discredited and debunked theory that there is a link between vaccines and autism In a conversation with Fox s Martha MacCallum who said studies have shown there is no connection between vaccines and autism Kennedy responded The studies that they did were very very narrow They did about 17 studies and the Institute of Medicine which is part of the National Academies of Sciences said that 14 of those studies are invalid And the biggest weakness of those studies is that they never studied vaccinated versus unvaccinated which is the only way that you can really make this determination But more importantly none of the vaccines that are given to children within the first six months of life were ever studied Kennedy said the autism study coordinated through the National Institutes of Health NIH is not focused exclusively on vaccines Everything is on the table our food system our water our air we will find out what s triggering this epidemic We know it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm Through research at NIH we will find an answer to this

connections between vaccines and autism mainstream media have repeated claims that the idea has been debunked and sought to discredit people investigating the link Last month The Washington Post citing anonymous sources reported that HHS had tapped researcher David Geier an expert on the connections between toxic exposures and autism to lead a study of possible links between vaccines and autism The Post and other media outlets used the opportunity to attack Geier and the need for such a study This week the Journal of the American Medical Association JAMA also published a hit piece on Geier saying experts were alarmed by his appointment to work on the study Commenting on the JAMA piece epidemiologist Nick Hulscher wrote on Substack The so called alarm is really panic from institutions that fear what a real independent investigation might uncover For the first time the vaccine safety narrative isn t being fully controlled by Big Pharma and vaccine ideologues they are nervous that their false religion of Vaccine Ideology is set to crumble Mary Holland Study is long overdue Kennedy s announcement comes during Autism Awareness Month Rates of autism in the U S have been rising for decades Approximately 1 in 36 children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ASD in 2020 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Autism prevalence in the 1990s which was 1 in 1 000 children already represented a tenfold increase over the condition s estimated prevalence in the 1970s Since the CDC started collecting the data prevalence estimates have skyrocketed from 1 in 150 in 2000 to 1 in 36 children in 2023 Kennedy said the CDC will release its latest report next week and the numbers will be even higher 1 in 31 children with some communities

caused by genetic and environmental factors which haven t been fully determined CNN said the only thing definitively known about autism is that it isn t caused by vaccines Research by autism experts including authors on the CDC s autism report have found claims that better diagnosis alone accounts for the skyrocketing rates are wrong The rates of children with severe autism are increasing and rates among minority children are growing disproportionately It seems reasonable to ask that public health officials stop downplaying the ongoing increase in U S ASD prevalence and start taking their

Since 1986 VICP has paid over 5 4 billion to 12 000 The VICP was established by Congress under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 which granted vaccine makers immunity from liability for injuries caused by their products The program funded by a 75 cent surcharge on vaccines covers injuries related to vaccines listed on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC childhood immunization schedule with the exception of COVID 19 vaccines which are covered under a separate program Since it was established the VICP has paid over 5 4 billion to 12 000 people who filed claims Kennedy said in his post However that number represents fewer than half of the claims that have been filed Countless other vaccine injured people who would benefit from compensation have never filed either because they don t know about the program or because their injuries weren t recognized within the two or three year statute of limitations The VICP routinely dismisses meritorious cases outright or drags them out for years Kennedy wrote He said the VICP denies petitioners access to data pits them against the bottomless pockets of the U S government represented by the U S Department

intent Instead the VICP has devolved into a morass of inefficiency favoritism and outright corruption as government lawyers and the Special Masters who serve as Vaccine Court judges prioritize the

judicial system beginning in the Vaccine Court Hazlehurst alleged the lawyers misrepresented and concealed evidence showing vaccines can cause autism which resulted in his son being denied compensation for his injury The ruling dealt a blow to the thousands of families who filed petitions with the VICP alleging vaccines caused their children to develop autism In 2002 the VICP consolidated 5 000 plus claims into the Omnibus Autism Proceeding OAP It later selected six test cases including that of Hazlehurst s son Yates as the basis for determining the outcome of all of the remaining claims The Vaccine Court ruled against all of the claimants thereby dismissing thousands of claims However in 2018 evidence emerged that the DOJ s star expert medical witness Dr Andrew Zimmerman informed DOJ attorneys during the ongoing omnibus proceedings that he had modified his original opinion and determined that in some cases vaccines can and do cause autism In what Hazlehurst alleges was a shocking cover up instead of allowing Zimmerman to share his revised opinion the DOJ attorneys relieved Zimmerman of his duties as a witness However they continued to use excerpts from his unamended written opinion to make their case that vaccines did not cause autism misrepresenting his position and committing fraud on the court he alleged If Hazlehurst s appeal is successful it could clear the path for those families to access compensation Rulings in VICP cases like a game of roulette Congress established the VICP after a crisis in the late 1970s and early 1980s when Wyeth s

Cuomo Kennedy also revealed that when he asked an HHS agency for patient data he was told he d have to purchase it You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS is creating a new sub agency under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC that will focus on vaccine injuries During an interview Thursday night with Chris Cuomo on NewsNation HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said We re incorporating an agency within CDC that is going to specialize in vaccine injuries These are priorities for the American people More and more people are suffering from these injuries and we are committed to having gold standard science to make sure that we can figure out what the treatments are and that we can deliver the best treatments possible to the American people Kennedy said the sub agency is part of a broader focus on conditions that include long COVID and Lyme disease He said the pathway to creating the sub agency wasn t easy elaborating on what he said Thursday when he announced a major restructuring of HHS and the agencies it oversees that when he requested data from the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS an HHS agency he was told HHS would have to purchase it Kennedy told Cuomo I tried to get the CMS patient information which belongs to the American people and belongs to HHS and the sub agencies said we have to buy it from them and it doesn t make any sense This is depersonalized data and we need it to Make America Healthy Again In February shortly after being confirmed to run HHS Kennedy promised that under his watch HHS and CDC would establish a better system for tracking vaccine injuries On March 10 Reuters reported that unnamed sources within the CDC leaked that the agency was planning to do a study on the possible link between vaccines and autism The story triggered an avalanche of negative mainstream news reports claiming the study isn t needed On March 13 President Donald Trump pulled the nomination of Dr David Weldon an outspoken advocate for studying the link between autism and vaccines after it became clear Weldon couldn t snag the necessary number of votes Just this week The

sharing both within the HHS as well as with independent scientists Hooker said If we are ever going to get to the bottom of the causes of the chronic disease epidemic independent researchers will need all of the relevant information that our tax dollars have paid for over so many years Research scientist and author James Lyons Weiler Ph D called the announcement a historic and long overdue shift in public health accountability He added For decades families of the vaccine injured have been subjected to silence stonewalling and denial by the very institutions tasked with ensuring safety This new development is without question a step in the right direction Biologist Christina Parks Ph D who has studied vaccine injuries said the new sub agency will legitimize the suffering of millions of Americans and people around the world who have suffered the agonizing effects of vaccine injury on their health or the health of a child or loved one Once the reality of vaccine injury is accepted it will open the door to working with doctors to set a standard of care for acute vaccine injuries that has the potential to mitigate the damage caused by these events and speed recovery Parks said Nebraska chiropractor Ben Tapper whose public questioning of the COVID 19 vaccines led the Center for Countering Digital Hate to add him as well as figures like Kennedy to its Disinformation Dozen

medical organizations are suing Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and several other public health officials and agencies over recent changes to COVID 19 vaccine recommendations for children and pregnant women According to the 42 page lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Boston the new recommendations are baseless and uninformed and place pregnant women and children at grave and immediate risk The lawsuit alleges the changes will lead to decreased rates of vaccination increased rates of transmission long lasting illness and ultimately deaths among pregnant women unborn children and all children The complaint also claims Kennedy violated federal law when he issued an internal directive to change the recommendations instead of following the longstanding process for making changes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC immunization schedules Plaintiffs include the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP the American College of Physicians ACP the American Public Health Association the Infectious Diseases Society of America the Massachusetts Public Health Association the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine and a physician named in the complaint as Jane Doe who is 20 weeks pregnant and allegedly faces barriers to access to the vaccine The plaintiffs seek an injunction against the directive request the restoration of the COVID 19 vaccines to the list of recommended immunizations for pregnant women and healthy children and a court order compelling Kennedy to announce on X that those immunizations are now reinstated to the CDC immunization schedules Other defendants named in the complaint include the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS the CDC and its acting director Matthew Buzzelli Director of the National Institutes of Health Jay Bhattacharya and Marty Makary commissioner of the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA Pharma has tremendous financial incentive to preserve the status quo Attorney Richard Hughes IV a professorial

American College of Physicians and the Infectious Diseases Society of America received millions of dollars from the CDC to promote COVID 19 injections People who make a lot of money pushing COVID vaccines want to force a recommendation for more COVID vaccines Jablonowski said The AAP for instance lists pharma giants Merck Sanofi and COVID 19 vaccine manufacturer Moderna among its donors The organization also closely collaborates with corporations such as Coca Cola Last month two of the plaintiffs the AAP and the ACP signed on to the Vaccine Integrity Project a new initiative seeking to bypass public health authorities through the creation of a nongovernmental vaccine system for vaccine recommendations and purchasing The group is funded by iAlumbra a nonprofit founded by Walmart heiress and billionaire philanthropist Christy Walton known for her anti Trump advocacy Dr Jane Orient executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons suggested that the organizations suing Kennedy may be concerned that evidence will come to light questioning the safety and efficacy of vaccines Orient said These organizations evidently consider themselves to be the ultimate authorities on all vaccines and seem to feel threatened by the possibility that a government advisory committee might not agree with their position that all approved or recommended vaccines are safe and effective and necessary Mack Rosenberg said the liability shield that vaccine manufacturers enjoy allows them to exercise incredible hubris adding that they desperately fear loss of this extraordinary protection She added The irony of the changes to COVID 19 jabs recommendations is that they actually empower physicians to do their jobs and provide individualized medical care to their patients One has to ask why these entities fear that Directive arbitrary and capricious lawsuit alleges The complaint extensively references a May 27 video Kennedy posted on X in which Kennedy

people and opposing vaccine mandates the lawsuit claims But according to Orient throughout history epidemics were controlled by natural immunity and measures such as vector control Locking down everybody was the unprecedented action she said The lawsuit also claims that the COVID 19 vaccines are FDA approved and that a wealth of data and peer reviewed studies demonstrate their safety and

authorization Novavax s Nuvaxovid vaccine is fully approved only for people 65 and older and those between 12 and 64 who have a health condition placing them at increased risk of COVID 19 infection Plaintiffs criticize new CDC vaccine advisory committee Last month Kennedy dismissed the 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP the CDC s vaccine advisory committee He subsequently named eight new members to the committee During the new members first meeting some members questioned CDC claims about the safety of COVID 19 shots and the virus s threat to children The committee also said it plans to examine the cumulative effect of the childhood vaccine schedule The lawsuit questions the qualifications of seven of ACIP s new members claiming they do not possess the required scientific and medical expertise to serve on ACIP The complaint also questions Kennedy s claims that the 17 former members of ACIP had conflicts of interest None of these accusations are remotely true according to the complaint Orient disagreed It was the ACIP that Kennedy fired that was likely unlawful she said ACIP also voted last month to no longer recommend flu vaccines that contain thimerosal a mercury based preservative linked to neurodevelopmental disorders The lawsuit cites a statement by the Infectious Diseases Society of America that said the vote was politically motivated and not based on science The complaint differentiates thimerosal which breaks down into ethylmercury from harmful forms of mercury like methylmercury But according to Brian Hooker Ph D chief

judge denied a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Robert F Kennedy Jr against Daily Kos writer David Vickrey accused of knowingly publishing lies about Kennedy and intending to harm his reputation You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A Superior Court judge late last week denied a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Robert F Kennedy Jr against Daily Kos writer David Vickrey The suit alleges Vickrey made false statements about Kennedy that damaged Kennedy s reputation Vickrey claimed that Kennedy helped cause the deadly Samoa measles outbreak and that he joined neo Nazis and various anti Semitic conspiracy groups when he spoke at a 2020 event in Berlin For years Vickrey repeated the claims on social media including Daily Kos and Twitter X despite being informed that the claims were false Kennedy founder and former chairman of Children s Health Defense CHD is suing for damages Kennedy is on track to become the next secretary of the U S Department of Health and Human Services In December 2024 Robert Barnes and Terry Mitrenga two of Kennedy s attorneys filed a memo urging the court to deny Vickrey s motion to dismiss Barnes called the court s ruling a big win He told The Defender The court found that repeating lies about Robert F Kennedy Jr that have been proven false by prior lawsuits is clear evidence of actual malice toward Kennedy This means anyone who repeats those lies can now also be sued CHD CEO Mary Holland said While this long running case is not over the Maine Superior Court delivered a remarkable win for plaintiff Robert F Kennedy Jr Holland added Apparently Vickrey believed he was immune from liability as he defamed Kennedy for years Although the standard for proving defamation against a public figure is very high this decision strongly suggests that Kennedy has more than met it In his decision Maine Superior Court Justice Thomas R McKeon noted that Vickrey s motion to dismiss failed both as a standard motion to dismiss and as a motion to dismiss under Maine s anti SLAPP law The anti SLAPP statute is intended to prevent lawsuits that affect a defendant s First Amendment rights said CHD General Counsel Kim Mack Rosenberg The court found that Vickrey s activities in publishing his statements about Kennedy failed to fall within the limited scope of the anti SLAPP law according to Mack Rosenberg Under Maine s anti SLAPP

exception when a motion to dismiss is based on an anti SLAPP claim Mitrenga said Vickrey s lawyers didn t immediately respond when asked by The Defender if they plan to appeal Lawsuit has dragged on

Government technocrats billionaire oligarchs Big Pharma Big Data Big Media the high finance robber barons and the military industrial intelligence apparatus love pandemics for the same reasons they love wars and terrorist attacks Catastrophic crises create opportunities of convenience to increase both power and wealth In her seminal book The Shock Doctrine The Rise of Disaster Capitalism Naomi Klein chronicles how authoritarian demagogues large corporations and wealthy plutocrats use mass disruptions to shift wealth upwards obliterate the middle classes abolish civil rights privatize the commons and expand authoritarian controls A consummate insider the former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emmanuel is known for his admonition that vested power structures should never let a serious crisis go to waste But this treadworn strategy to use crisis to inflame the public terror that paves the road to dictatorial power has served as the central strategy of totalitarian systems for millennia The methodology is in fact formulaic as Hitler s Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring explained during the Nazi war crimes trials at Nuremberg It is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship Voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders That is easy All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to greater danger It works the same in any country The Nazis pointed to the threats from Jews and Gypsies to justify the homicidal authoritarianism in the Third Reich The dictatorial demagogue Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Unamerican Activities Committee warned against communist infiltration of the U S State Department and film industry to rationalize loyalty oaths and the Blacklist Dick Cheney used the 911 attack to launch his long war against amorphous

wealth and power of the oligarchy is seldom a potent vessel for populism Citizens accustomed to voting for their governments are unlikely to support policies that make the rich richer increase political and social control by corporations diminish democracy and reduce their civil rights So demagogues must weaponize fear to justify their demands for blind obedience and to win public acquiescence for the demolition of civil and economic rights Of course the first casualty must always be freedom of speech After stoking sufficient panic against the hobgoblin du jour robber barons need to silence protest against their wealth and power grabs In including free speech in the First Amendment of the U S Constitution James Madison argued that all our other liberties depend on this right Any government that can hide its mischief has license to commit atrocities As soon as they get hold of the levers of authority tyrants impose Orwellian censorship and begin gaslighting dissenters But ultimately they seek to abolish all forms of creative thinking and self expression They burn books destroy art kill writers poets and intellectuals outlaw gatherings and at their worst force oppressed minorities to wear masks that atomize any sense of community or solidarity and prevent the subtle eloquent nonverbal communication for which God and evolution have equipped humans with 42 facial muscles The most savage Middle Eastern theocracies mandate masks for women whose legal status not coincidentally is as chattels The free flow of information and self expression are oxygen and sunlight for representative democracy which functions best with policies annealed in the boiling cauldron of public debate It is axiomatic that without free speech democracy withers The most

Vaccine Recommendations CDC Was Likely to Make the Change Anyway After HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr announced the CDC will stop recommending COVID 19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women the media and medical associations attacked the decision as out of line with current thinking However the CDC s vaccine advisory committee was poised to make a similar recommendation next month You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Tuesday s announcement that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC will no longer recommend COVID 19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women ignited a firestorm of criticism from many mainstream public health officials organizations and doctors The new recommendations don t preclude pregnant women and children from getting the vaccines the CDC just isn t recommending them any longer for those groups The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG said in a statement that the organization is concerned about and extremely disappointed by the new recommendations announced yesterday by U S Secretary of Health and Human Services HHS Robert F Kennedy Jr As ob gyns who treat patients every day we have seen firsthand how dangerous COVID 19 infection can be during pregnancy and for newborns who depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection said Dr Steven J Fleischman ACOG president It is very clear that COVID 19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability and it can cause devastating consequences for families The COVID 19 vaccine is safe during pregnancy and vaccination can protect our patients and their infants after birth he added ACOG didn t cite any evidence for its claims The American Academy of Pediatrics said the removal of the vaccines from the schedule ignores independent medical experts and leaves children at risk The organization which typically aligns its recommendations with those of the CDC told MedPage Today that it may have to rethink how we harmonize with the federal government The New York Times conceded there isn t scientific evidence to support vaccination among healthy children However the Times still called the move Kennedy s latest salvo in dismantling decades of vaccine safety policies especially those intended for children Others criticized the process behind the decision making MedPage Today cited a retired pediatrician who said it was unusual for the HHS secretary to bypass typical agency processes STAT News said it was unprecedented for the secretary to announce such a change and cited a law professor who said it might open the decision up to being challenged Another expert quoted by MedPage Today Dr Tina Tan said the decision would make it harder to access vaccines because insurers

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP recommends them after which the CDC director approves them At least one other vaccine has been taken off the schedule When Rotashield Wyeth s now Pfizer rotavirus vaccine caused intussusception in infants one to two weeks following vaccination the vaccine was suspended pending ACIP review ACIP then recommended removing it and the CDC took it off the schedule in 1999 However experts who spoke with The Defender said ACIP is only an advisory committee and the CDC director and HHS more generally aren t bound by ACIP s recommendations They can and sometimes do make independent decisions For example in September 2021 former CDC Director Rochelle Walensky overruled ACIP when she decided to recommend COVID 19 boosters for everyone age 16 and older ACIP recommended against the boosters citing the lack of safety and efficacy data on the vaccine for 16 and 17 year olds Several news outlets highlighted the absence of a CDC representative when Kennedy announced the news Tuesday flanked by the directors of the National Institutes of Health and the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA The acting director of the CDC Susan Monarez Ph D stepped

three potential recommendations keeping the universal recommendation reducing it to only people at high risk or reducing it to high risk for everyone under age 64 In April a poll of ACIP members showed that 76 supported switching to a non universal recommendation The full committee is set to vote on that recommendation next month It will be up to the CDC whether to accept the recommendation or make a different one Last week the FDA announced plans to limit approvals for updated COVID 19 vaccines to people over age 65 and people with one or more health conditions that put them at high

as safe and effective for pregnant women but without citing evidence to support the claim However risks to pregnant women have been known and ignored or hidden by public health agencies and

Disease epidemic and to Make America Great and Healthy Again Kennedy who promised to fight corruption and end the revolving door between industry and government thanked Trump for the nomination on social media He said he would free the agencies from the smothering cloud of corporate capture so they can pursue their mission to make Americans once again the healthiest people on Earth Kennedy is a longtime critic of how corporate interests have captured the public health agencies meant to regulate them and of the outsized and corrupt role that Big Pharma plays in American life If confirmed

inefficient surveillance system for vaccine injuries Genuine transparency robust science unbiased data gathering and analytics and a functional surveillance system are the only ways to end widespread vaccine hesitancy and to build public trust for the COVID 19 vaccine program The Warp Speed vaccine program allowed pharmaceutical companies to abbreviate clinical trials and rush experimental unlicensed EUA Emergency Use Authorization vaccines to Americans in what health officials acknowledge is a population wide experiment HHS regulators justified this shortcut by promising to implement a post licensing surveillance system that would detect vaccine injuries and allow public health authorities physicians and Americans to understand the risks and benefits for each of the various vaccines However HHS officials are instead adopting procedures designed to hide COVID vaccine injuries particularly deaths from the public and to obscure safety and risk profiles The sad reality is vaccines cause injuries and death In the two and one half months since the U S began our COVID vaccination program there have been 31 079 injuries and 1 524 deaths reported after COVID vaccine What is also undeniable is that the U S is not doing enough to find more about these injuries and deaths and why some people are more susceptible than others to injury In this age of individualized medicine a mass vaccination program that abdicates all responsibility to protect vulnerable subgroups is reckless and unethical Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS is useless for calculating an accurate risk benefit assessment For 30 years public health officials including your coronavirus vaccine czar David Kessler have complained that HHS s post marketing and vaccine injury surveillance system the

validation purposes and should be left unchanged Δ To compensate for VAERS well known deficiencies CDC therefore created the V safe system to supplement VAERS surveillance of COVID 19 inoculation injuries V safe allows recently vaccinated individuals to report injuries using a cell phone app This system also being voluntary is extremely pervious and isn t interconnected with the existing VAERS system thus creating two voluntary reporting systems with incomplete data Most importantly V safe is incapable of tabulating deaths following vaccination since nobody self reports their own death As inefficient as it is the Vaccine Adverse Reporting System is filled with reports of elderly deaths following COVID 19 vaccines About 73 of the reported 1 524 COVID deaths to date are over the age of 65 with average age of death 77 CDC Since VAERS captures fewer than 1 it is prudent to assume that the actual number of deaths of the elderly over 65 who died from the COVID vaccine could be as high as 111 200 Social media posts and news reports detailing waves of mortalities at senior care facilities and elsewhere following COVID vaccination support this higher figure Autopsy determining death from a vaccine adverse event is nearly impossible to achieve CDC s strategy for dealing with deaths following vaccination has been to publicly deny that the COVID vaccines caused any of those deaths and to work with the media and social media sites to remove and censor these reports This approach is rank chicanery CDC s pronouncement that all deaths after injection are unrelated is rank chicanery For almost all vaccine injuries there is no medical or scientific test even with full autopsies which are rare in the case of the elderly to determine if a specific death was vaccine related A heart

CDC pretend to know in such short order that the vaccine definitely was not involved The only way to determine the risk of death from the COVID vaccines is to tabulate EVERY death in the days following vaccination and then to compare those rates to historic daily death rates in each age category For example in 2018 according to the CDC the background daily death rates among Americans between age 75 and 84 is 12 per 100 000 per day Only by knowing exactly how many people in that same age cohort die each day in the days following vaccination can we compare to background rates and reliably judge whether there is an increased risk of death from the vaccine If for example we learn that the death rate immediately following the Moderna vaccine is 30 100 000 day while the Pfizer vaccine death rate is 12 100 000 day regulators can then advise seniors to take the safer vaccine Instead of scrupulously counting each death following vaccination as prudence and good public health policy requires the CDC systematically dismisses all deaths after vaccination as unrelated to vaccines Endeavoring to abolish vaccine injury by fiat is not science It is propaganda Many Americans naturally ask themselves Why is CDC trying to hide the injuries from the public Americans watching CDC s practice of attributing every reported case of death in the elderly following vaccination to coincidence are stunned by the agency s cynicism This practice contrasts sharply with CDC s strategy of counting every death associated with a viral presence as a COVID death CDC has admitted that only 6 of deaths attributed to COVID were unambiguously caused by COVID The remaining 94 had an average of 3 8 potentially lethal comorbidities Instead of transparently giving the public unbiased and reliable facts CDC is manipulating data by adopting a double standard of inferring causality to inflate COVID deaths and dismissing causality to underestimate vaccine deaths Unfortunately many

Congress members who attacked his stance on vaccines and the chronic disease epidemic suggesting today during his second U S Senate hearing to lead the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS that several members have accepted donations from Big Pharma One day after his first confirmation hearing in the Senate Finance Committee which included an exchange with Sen Bernie Sanders I Vt about onesies sold on the Children s Health Defense CHD website Kennedy testified before the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee for which Sanders is a ranking member During an exchange with Sanders Kennedy said Corruption is not just in the federal agencies it is in Congress too Almost all the members of this panel including yourself are accepting millions of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry This was one of several contentious moments during today s meeting which also focused on vaccine safety the chronic disease epidemic and conflicts of interest in scientific research Kennedy frequently questioned the effectiveness of U S public health agencies in addressing the chronic health epidemic which he said has come at a great cost both in terms of fatalities and the epidemic s economic burden The focus is on infectious disease and we almost altogether ignore chronic disease which causes 92 of the deaths in this country Kennedy said Noting that the U S had a disproportionate percentage of COVID 19 related deaths during the pandemic Kennedy said it is because we are the sickest people on earth Kennedy pledged to reverse this trend if confirmed as HHS secretary by emphasizing transparency and good science I m pro good science Unlike yesterday s hearing today s hearing focused extensively on Kennedy s views on vaccines and vaccine safety Kennedy responded to claims he is anti vaccine and anti industry I m neither I m pro safety I m pro good science Kennedy said We should always follow the evidence no matter what it says Kennedy said he wouldn

explosion that public health agencies have long overlooked Kennedy referred to a recent peer reviewed study of 47 000 9 year olds to respond to claims by members of the committee that the link between autism and vaccines has been definitively debunked The study found that autism rates were higher among vaccinated children and increased as the number of vaccinations grew Why don t we know what s causing this epidemic Kennedy asked Why hasn t CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention been looking at other hypotheses to determine the etiology of why we ve had this dramatic 1 000 increase in this disease that is destroying our kids Several members of the committee openly agreed with Kennedy s stance on autism 1 in 36 If that s not a pandemic then what is asked Sen Markwayne Mullin R Okla Can any of you guys with a straight face say that we shouldn t look at every aspect to what we re putting in our kids be it from the food to the vaccines I just want to follow the science where it leads without presupposition said Sen Rand Paul R Ky We need a trustworthy government Kennedy also addressed the COVID 19 vaccines stating that mandates and a lack of public trust in their safety have contributed to waning vaccination rates If we want uptake of vaccines we need a trustworthy government Kennedy said That s what I want to restore to the American people and the vaccine program I want people to know if the government says something it s true It s not manipulative Kennedy responded to claims by some committee members that the COVID 19 vaccines saved millions of lives pointing out that this statement can t be made definitively because public health agencies don t have a good surveillance system Kennedy cited a 2021 lawsuit he filed against the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA over its approval of the COVID 19 vaccines as an example of deficiencies in the safety testing by public health agencies I filed that lawsuit after CDC recommended the vaccine for 6

launched his presidential campaign In August of this year Kennedy suspended his presidential campaign and endorsed then candidate Donald J Trump for president promising to join forces with Trump to save millions of children On Nov 14 Trump nominated Kennedy for secretary of HHS On Sunday Trump told Meet the Press that Kennedy will investigate the potential link between vaccines and autism

public policy In September 2018 the World Mercury Project changed its name to Children s Health Defense and expanded its mission to include all toxic exposures that harm children s health CHD s strategy includes four major pillars science education litigation and advocacy It was a stroke of genius to broaden the appeal to all toxic exposures and to put the emphasis on children Holland said Kennedy led CHD s litigation efforts including those targeting the repeal of religious exemptions and preserving real medical exemptions During the COVID 19 pandemic he initiated a number of lawsuits targeting the censorship of medical information and doctors who publicly advocated for alternative treatments opposed by public health authorities During his tenure at CHD Kennedy wrote The Real

will use this platform to announce new members to populate ACIP None of these individuals will be ideological anti vaxxers They will be highly credentialed physicians and scientists who will make extremely consequential public health determinations by applying evidence based decision making with objectivity and common sense I will also be tweeting examples of the historical corruption at ACIP to help the public understand why this clean sweep was necessary The most outrageous example of ACIP s malevolent malpractice has been its stubborn unwillingness to demand adequate safety trials before recommending new vaccines for our children Today a compliant American child receives between 69 and 92 routine vaccines depending on brand dictated dosage from conception to 18 years of age This is up from 11 shots in 1986 ACIP has recommended each of these additional jabs without requiring placebo controlled trials for any of them This means that no one can scientifically ascertain whether these products are averting more problems than they are causing Many vaccine promoters have challenged this assertion They are always wrong Last week CNN which has devolved into a shameless propagandist for Big Pharma triumphantly announced that it had proof that my pronouncement that there have been no placebo controlled safety trials for any routine vaccines was false CNN gleefully

would ask CHD to stop selling the onesies I have no power over that organization I m not part of it I resigned from the board Kennedy said adding that while he supports vaccines he also wants good science Mainstream media ran wild with the onesies with headlines like RFK Jr and the case of the onesies The exchange between Kennedy and Sanders was characteristic of the often contentious nature of the nearly four hour hearing during which Kennedy was also asked to discuss his views on the chronic disease epidemic support for scientific research abortion and other public health issues Kennedy

chronically ill calling this a human tragedy that is writing off an entire generation of kids According to Kennedy a factor responsible for the increase in chronic diseases is the switch to highly chemical intensive processed foods and the preoccupation of public health agencies with infectious disease at the expense of chronic disease According to Kennedy this is the case even though chronic disease is responsible for 92 of deaths in the U S and is the result of a deliberate choice not to study the things that are truly making us sick Kennedy cited processed foods as an example noting that while over 10 000 ingredients are permitted in products in the U S today only 400 ingredients are permitted in Europe Kennedy pledged his support for healthy foods and the removal of harmful

post HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr cited peer reviewed studies and the actual labels on vaccines to counter The Guardian s pharma financed claims that thimerosal is safe and has been removed from

Guardian on the use of thimerosal an adjuvant containing mercury in flu vaccines Below is the full unaltered text of Kennedy s post In conformance with the pharma financed mainstream media s mantric ritual of dutifully parroting the propaganda tropes spoon fed them by vaccine makers and their captive regulators guardian on Friday pronounced thimerosal the ethylmercury based vaccine preservative safe Opining under the headline CDC vaccine panel to review ingredient RFK Jr has targeted for removal The Guardian authoritatively assures The preservative has been deemed safe The Guardian did not bother to cite any peer reviewed study Journalists don t seem to read those anymore Instead it referenced a fact check website operated by the Pharma funded American Academy of Pediatrics AmerAcadPeds likewise cites no peer reviewed study to support this claim or its equally terse assertion that Thimerosal has been removed from all routine childhood vaccines This is another treadworn lie of the vaccine industry There are high bolus doses of mercury in flu shots which CDC recommends to pregnant women in any trimester of pregnancy and as a routine vaccine for children at six months and in every year of life Between conception and age 18 a compliant American child today could get a cumulative load of as much as 500 mcg of ethylmercury from multidose flu shots nearly double of what they were once getting from all the childhood vaccines put together Now let s look at The Guardian claim that thimerosal is safe A quick search at the National Library of Medicine s PubMed and PubChem websites nets thousands of studies on search terms such as mercury neurotoxicity mercury and development and mercury and brain and hundreds that identify thimerosal as a potent neurotoxin carcinogen mutagen and endocrine disruptor There has never been a study that proves thimerosal safe In early 2001 Director of the FDA Office of Vaccine Research and Review the late William Egan admitted under oath before Congress that thimerosal s safety had never been studied in human beings Mr Burton When was that That was done in 1929 Let s follow up on that In 1929 they tested this on 27 people that

that I know of Can you think of any other Mr Egan No in people no Except for accidental exposures over time I leave it to the reader to speculate as to why CDC has not performed such studies in the intervening 24 years as it dosed hundreds of millions of American children and pregnant moms with mercury laden flu shots Furthermore CDC has no existing guidelines for safe exposure to ethylmercury But let s put all that peer reviewed science aside and just look at what the government and the vaccine industry say about thimerosal Thimerosal s label advises against its use during pregnancy pointing out that thimerosal has never been shown to be safe and that it causes mutations in mammals Thimerosal s material safety data sheet MSDS acknowledges that thimerosal is toxic has Nervous System and Reproductive Effects and is mutagenic in mammalian cells and that exposure to mercury in thimerosal in utero and in children can cause mild to severe mental retardation and mild to severe motor coordination impairment The MSDS lists a grim inventory of dozens of other devastating injuries from thimerosal exposure In 2001 the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences NIEHS revised its thimerosal toxicity statement warning that thimerosal is toxic by ingestion and inhalation The California EPA recognizes thimerosal as a reproductive toxicant in the clearest possible language Thimerosal dissociates in the body to ethyl mercury The evidence for its reproductive toxicity includes severe mental retardation or malformations in human offspring who were poisoned when their mothers were exposed to ethyl mercury or thimerosal while pregnant studies in animals demonstrating developmental toxicity after exposure to either ethyl mercury or thimerosal and data showing interconversion to other forms of mercury that also clearly cause reproductive toxicity The US EPA the authoritative body relied on when mercury and mercury compounds were listed under California s Proposition 65 currently identifies mercury and mercury compounds as causing reproductive toxicity The amount of ethylmercury in a flu shot is 25 000 times EPA s safety level for drinking water Federal and state laws provide that whenever expired thimerosal vaccines are disposed of they constitute a hazardous waste In 1998 FDA banned thimerosal in all over the counter products ending its use

division and migration of neuronal cells According to a National Toxicology Program PowerPoint presentation entitled Comparative Toxicity of Ethyl and Methyl Mercury Ethylmercury is a neurotoxin Infants may be more susceptible than adults Ethylmercury exposure from vaccines added to dietary exposures to methylmercury probably caused neurotoxic responses likely subtle in some children A 2005 NIH study commissioned by FDA s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research CBER and performed by the National Toxicity Program NTP obliterated the industry claim that the ethylmercury in vaccines is less toxic than the heavily regulated methylmercury in fish finding that the ethylmercury in thimerosal crosses the blood brain barrier lodges in the brain and metabolizes into the most toxic form of mercury at double the rate of methylmercury A subsequent study found that this highly toxic mercury remains in the brain for over 27 years A 2000 study in Neurotoxicology by Dr William Slikker Jr former head of the FDA s National Center for Toxicological Research directly foretold the results of a 2005 NIH funded study reporting that Thimerosal sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate crosses the blood brain and placental barriers and results in appreciable mercury content in tissues including brain A 2017 NIH CDC study links miscarriage to flu vaccines particularly in the first trimester Pregnant women vaccinated in the 2010 2011 and 2011 2012 flu seasons had two times greater odds of having a miscarriage within 28 days of receiving the vaccine In women who had received the H1N1 vaccine in the previous flu season the odds of having a miscarriage within 28 days were 7 7 times greater than in women who did not receive a flu shot during their pregnancy These results are all the

October 1 2001 the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences Immunization Safety Review Committee ISR issued a report concluding that the link between thimerosal and the rise of neurological injuries in children including autism is biologically plausible and recommended the termination of all thimerosal preserved vaccines An entire bibliography of pharmacokinetic studies by independent scientists prestigious universities and prominent research institutes published in high gravitas journals attest to thimerosal s powerful neurotoxicity and show that mercury tends to accumulate and remain for considerable periods of time years to decades in the brains of primates and other animals after injection of thimerosal containing vaccines It s worth noting just one of these a well known Russian study from 1977 led by Dr N D Mukhtarova found that the majority of adults exposed to much lower concentrations of ethylmercury than those currently given to American children in vaccines were still suffering neurological injury and neuropathology several years after the exposure These symptoms included decreased vision hearing memory vertigo and pain and numbness

U S Secretary of Health and Human Services HHS Robert F Kennedy Jr key members of the Trump administration and health freedom activists from the MAHA movement Today s children are the sickest generation in American history in terms of chronic disease and these preventable trends continue to worsen each year posing a threat to our nation s health economy and military readiness the report states noting that over 40 of U S children have at least one chronic health condition According to the report 1 in 31 children are diagnosed with autism by age 8 childhood cancer rates have increased by 40 since 1975 and more than 1 in 5 children over age 6 are obese Today s children are likely to have shorter lifespans than their parents despite the U S spending more than other wealthy nations on healthcare Trump cited several of these figures during his Oval Office speech today There s something wrong and we will not stop until we defeat the chronic disease epidemic in America Trump said We re going to get it done for the first time ever Kennedy thanked Trump for his support We ve been waiting for a president who would stand up and speak on behalf of the health of the American people and say there is no difference between good economic policy good environmental policy good public health policy and good industrial policy Kennedy said We can have all of them Kennedy told Reuters the

MAHA Commission will follow that assessment today s report with a strategy for fighting the chronic disease epidemic which is expected to be released in August Kennedy said during a press call earlier today that the report is really a diagnosis the prescription comes in 100 days Speaking at the White House Kennedy called the report a call to action for common sense Trump applauded the MAHA movement for its role in raising awareness of the chronic disease epidemic We ve built an unstoppable coalition of moms and dads doctors and young people and citizens of all backgrounds who have come together to protect our children Trump said In an interview today on The Ross Kaminsky Show Holland also credited the MAHA movement s efforts It s really not a partisan movement Holland said It s really about

about vaccines role in chronic disease epidemic The report highlights the childhood immunization schedule in the U S as a possible contributor to chronic illness noting that the number of vaccines U S children are recommended to receive is higher than in most European countries Many parents have concerns about the appropriate use of vaccines and their possible role in the growing childhood chronic disease crisis the report states The report calls for further research into the childhood vaccination schedule including placebo controlled studies of the vaccines to determine potential connections between the vaccines chronic diseases and other adverse events In recent weeks U S public health agencies announced they will study a possible link between vaccines and autism using data from public and private databases and that a sub agency focused on vaccine injuries will be established at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Last week The Wall Street Journal reported that HHS plans to stop recommending COVID 19 vaccines for pregnant women children and teens Last month HHS announced that all new vaccines will have to be tested against a placebo before they can be approved We were not waiting for this report to come out to begin researching the crises including the autism crisis Kennedy said during today s press call Report addresses ultraprocessed foods artificial dyes additives in infant formula Another focus of the report was ultraprocessed food According to the report U S children consume excessive amounts of ultraprocessed grains sugars and fats which contribute to childhood obesity higher diabetes rates non alcoholic fatty liver disease and other chronic illnesses The report also says that other ingredients including artificial dyes preservatives and artificial sweeteners are likely contributing to the chronic disease epidemic Last month HHS announced it would phase out all petroleum based synthetic dyes from U S foods and medications while earlier this month the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA announced it would tighten its review process for chemical additives in food The report also cites infant formula as a notable example of

it s not working American children are highly medicated and it s not working the report stated citing the overprescription of pharmaceutical products as an example of misaligned incentives in the U S healthcare system The report cited data showing that the number of prescriptions issued to children has sharply increased in recent years including a 250 increase in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD prescriptions between 2006 and 2016 and a 1 400 increase in antidepressant prescriptions between 1987 and 2014 despite evidence that such increases did not improve outcomes long term These time trends significantly outpace more moderate increases seen in other developed countries the report stated The report also highlighted the role of environmental toxins including per and polyfluoroalkyl substances also known as PFAS or forever chemicals in exacerbating the epidemic of chronic illness PFAS builds up in the human body over time posing a risk of cancer and other serious illnesses The report also named fluoride as another toxin contributing to the epidemic noting a statistically significant association between exposure to fluoride above recommended levels and reduced IQ levels in children Utah and Florida recently banned the use of fluoride in their public water supplies Earlier this month the FDA said it is initiating action to remove children s concentrated ingestible fluoride prescription drug products from the market According to the report the U S Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing data on fluoride that may lead to revisions to the federal drinking water standard Other factors contributing to worsening health outcomes in children cited by the report include reduced physical activity and excessive screentime including their adverse impacts on mental health The report also addressed the negative impacts of lobbying advertising and corporate capture of the media and scientific journals by the food chemical and pharmaceutical

bestseller by Robert F Kennedy Jr chairman and chief legal counsel for Children s Health Defense What I have described in the preceding chapters can seem overwhelming and dispiriting The forced vaccine campaign and other cruel actions by Dr Fauci and his acolytes might seem too big to fail But that is up to the citizens of our country We can bow down and comply take the jabs wear the face coverings show our digital passports on demand submit to the tests and salute our minders in the bio surveillance state Or we can say no We have a choice and it is not too late COVID 19 is not the problem it is a problem one largely solvable with early treatments that are safe effective and inexpensive The problem is endemic corruption in the medical industrial complex currently supported at every turn by mass media companies This cartel s coup d etat has already siphoned billions from taxpayers already vacuumed up trillions from the global middle class and created the excuse for massive propaganda censorship and control worldwide Along with its captured regulators this cartel has ushered in the global war on freedom and democracy Playwright and essayist C J Hopkins describes the moment all too well There is nothing subtle about this process Decommissioning one reality and replacing it with another is a brutal business Societies grow accustomed to their realities We do not surrender them willingly or easily Normally what s required to get us to do so is a crisis a war a state of emergency or you know a deadly global pandemic During the changeover from the old reality to the new reality the society is torn apart The old reality is being disassembled and the new one has not yet taken its place It feels like madness and in a way it is For a time the society is split in two as the two realities battle it out for dominance Reality being what it is i e monolithic this is a fight to the death In the end only one reality can prevail This is the crucial period for the

cattle You scare them enough to get them moving then you steer them wherever you want them to go The cattle do not know or understand where they are going They are simply reacting to a physical stimulus Facts and reason have nothing to do with it As we consider the unprecedented bludgeoning of our Constitution over the past two years it s worth pausing to remember the smallpox epidemic that stalled Washington s army during the Revolution and the malaria contagion that culled the Army of Virginia Though both alerted the framers to the deadly and disruptive potential of infectious disease epidemics the framers nevertheless opted to include no pandemic exception to the U S Constitution Yet today the pandemic is being used to create a string of new exceptions to our Constitution We are given just one rationale to explain everything that is happening COVID For just a brief moment let s look away from the ostensible reason things are happening and focus instead on what is happening Those controlling the levers of power vilify dissenters and punish every attempt at questioning skepticism and debate Like all tyrants in history they ban books silence artists condemn writers poets and intellectuals who question the new ortho doxies They have outlawed gatherings and forced citizens to wear masks that instill fear and divide communities and atomized any sense of solidarity by preventing the most subtle and eloquent nonverbal communication for which God and evolution gave humans forty two facial muscles Predictably the pandemic became a pretense for expanded tyranny across the globe making changes that have nothing to do with a virus Hungary clamped down on free speech and banned public depictions of homosexuality China shuttered Hong Kong s last pro democracy newspaper

Australia was more liberal allowing citizens to venture up to 5 kilometers from home but then again Australia also built new detention centers Britain banned its citizens from traveling abroad Many similar things happened in the U S including New York s Senate passing a law to allow for the forcible and indefinite detention of residents deemed to be a threat to public health But for America freedom of speech has been the biggest casualty of the emerging tyranny The now popular term misinformation has come to mean any expression that departs from official orthodoxies Social media and news media companies serve as stenographer and defender of any position pronounced by government The intentional failure of journalistic inquiry curiosity and investigation the failure to probe to ask tough questions or any questions of those in power has enabled the madness and the sadness of 2020 and 2021 There is a web of motives at work but I ll cite a simple one Big pharmaceutical companies are the biggest advertisers on news and television outlets Their 9 6 billion annual advertising budget buys more than commercials it buys obeisance In 2014 network president Roger Ailes told me he would fire any of his news show hosts who allowed me to talk about vaccine safety on air Our news division he explained gets up to 70 of ad revenues from pharma in non election years I know the role of the news media is not news to you so I ll cite just one example Vaccine mandates are ostensibly based upon the idea that vaccines will prevent transmission of COVID 19 If they don t prevent transmission if both the vaccinated and unvaccinated can spread the virus then there is no relevant difference between the two groups other than that one group is not complying with government commands Forcing an entire population to accept an arbitrary and risky medical intervention is the most intrusive and demeaning action ever imposed by the U S government and perhaps any government And

S Food and Drug Administration Advisory Panel she left no doubt about the vaccines inability to stop transmission of the virus or stop sickness or stop death Describing Israel s situation as of Sept 17 she said Sixty percent of the people in severe and critical condition were um were immunized doubly immunized fully vaccinated Forty five percent of the people who died in this fourth wave were doubly vaccinated Even so three weeks later on Oct 7 just days before this book went to press the president of the U S announced that he was ensuring healthcare workers are vaccinated because if you seek care at a healthcare facility you should have the certainty that the people providing that care are protected from COVID and cannot spread it to you The president just told Americans that being vaccinated provides certainty that vaccinated people are protected from COVID and cannot pass it to you Not one question was posed to the president about this stunning disconnect about the obvious untruth and that speech gives us a stark example of what s going on A televised image of an unchallenged leader mouthing untrue pronouncements to mislead and control the population that is the world of George Orwell s sadly prophetic novel 1984 It is a hopeful sign that halfway into 2021 Orwell s 70 year old book suddenly became a top 20 bestseller in the U S Apparently more people are aware of what s going on than the powerful give them credit for That awareness that basic common sense reminds us that democracies can reassert legislative control over rogue dictators whether mayors governors

issue Kennedy said including animal models observational studies bench studies and epidemiological studies But what we re going to do now he said is we re going to do all the kinds of studies that the Institute of Medicine originally recommended The National Institutes of Health NIH in April announced a new research program to study what causes autism and why autism diagnoses are on the rise NIH

added Big Pharma ads fail to benefit patients and doctors Sens Bernie Sanders I Vt and Angus King I Maine last month introduced federal legislation to end direct to consumer prescription drug advertising Kennedy didn t reference the bill or say he supported a ban on such ads However he outlined several reasons why pharmaceutical marketing on mainstream media is bad for public health Many ads are misleading he told Carlson Even the music and the video the photos that they show it s sending a message that if you take this drug you re going to be riding jet skis and playing volleyball and water skiing and have a great looking spouse Meanwhile the ads feature the most expensive version of the drug rather than the generic version They re not going to advertise the generics because they re not making any money Kennedy said So they re advertising the ones that are the highest profit margins for them Plus the U S taxpayer bears the brunt of the cost while the drug company profits Kennedy explained Normally if you see an advertisement on TV like for Coca Cola you then have a choice to go get that and you re paying out of your pocket for it When somebody buys a pharmaceutical drug it s Medicaid and Medicare that are paying for it it s the taxpayer And we re paying for the ads because they re tax deductible When a patient sees the ad and asks a doctor for the drug the doctor who is told by a corporate bean counter to limit time with a patient to only 11 minutes has to choose whether to use the time trying to talk the patient out of the drug Kennedy said But if the doctor does that the patient likely goes away unsatisfied Or the doctor could just say All right you want this prescription I ll write it for you Then the patient will be satisfied and come back Kennedy said The doctors hate it And nobody thinks that this is good for public health It is hurting us Kennedy said the censorship of vaccine related information on social media is also a problem The U S Supreme Court yesterday denied Children s Health Defense s CHD petition to hear its censorship case against Meta the parent company of Facebook CHD sued Meta in August 2020 and filed an amended complaint in November 2020 alleging that government actors partnered with Facebook to censor CHD s speech particularly speech related to vaccines and COVID 19 that should have been protected under the

makers and created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program also made it difficult for anyone injured by a vaccine to obtain compensation We just brought a guy in this week who is going to be revolutionizing the National Vaccine Injury Compensation program Kennedy said We re looking at ways to enlarge the program so that COVID vaccine injured people can be compensated we re looking at ways to enlarge the statute of limitations Kennedy told Carlson It s currently limited to three years A lot of people don t discover their injuries till after that Kennedy said The program has other flaws including that it has no discovery process no rules of evidence and historically had corrupt leadership We re going to change all that Kennedy said I ve brought in a team this week that is starting to work on that Kennedy also said HHS will use AI artificial intelligence to track vaccine injuries more effectively The agency plans to use AI in other ways too such as speeding up drug approval processes and detecting fraud Why CDC vaccine advisory committee needed a clean sweep Kennedy defended his recent move to fire all members of the CDC s vaccine advisory panel saying the board had

removing all 17 of the previous ACIP members This was a long time coming Tucker Kennedy said He gave an example to illustrate the kind of financial conflict of interest that had plagued the board for years Years ago the committee approved adding a rotavirus vaccine to the childhood immunization schedule he said Four of the five committee members had direct financial interest in the rotavirus vaccine Kennedy said They were working for the companies that made the vaccine or they were receiving grants to do clinical trials on that vaccine Within a year that specific rotavirus vaccine was

tried to avoid speculation That s why in his book The Real Anthony Fauci he reports only what Fauci did not Fauci s possible motivations he said Carlson said It sounds like Fauci is beyond the reach of the law at this point Kennedy responded Yeah I think generally unless there was a truth commission you know which they did in South Africa They did it in Central America after the 1980s wars there and they were very very helpful to those societies I think we should probably do something like that now Kennedy explained how a truth commission works You have a commission that hears testimony on what exactly happened Anybody who comes and volunteers to testify truthfully is then given immunity from prosecution But so that at least the public knows who did what People who are called and don t

Kennedy s statement that every American should be wearing a wearable within four years arguing that critics engaged in hysterical reactions and cancel culture But Eisenstein s critique misses the deeper issues at stake and reveals a dangerous dynamic in the MAHA movement You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Charles Eisenstein Robert F Kennedy Jr s former chief speechwriter published a defense of Kennedy s statement that every American should be wearing a wearable within four years arguing that critics engaged in hysterical reactions and cancel culture toward Kennedy s verbal misstep While I agree that immediately throwing Bobby under the bus is counterproductive Eisenstein s dismissal of substantive infrastructure concerns misses the deeper issues at stake and reveals a dangerous dynamic in the Make America Healthy Again MAHA movement This isn t about Kennedy s character or political purity I ve been a great supporter of his work for many years his impact on my own awakening and the world has been significant and enormously positive But the fear of creating a counterpoint to RFK Jr s critics has given rise to hero worship just as dangerous as the cancel culture Eisenstein warns about Hero worship is antithetical to the very sovereignty MAHA claims to represent We must recognize our own role in the system and acknowledge that if the system is as corrupt as we say it is waiting for one man to fix it is magical thinking We need to engage critically not passively If the MAHA movement is real it has to be from the ground up everyone needs to take control of their own actions and their own discernment Of course it s great to have people on the inside but waiting for the cavalry to come will be our doom While Kennedy has obviously been a sparkplug and has done extraordinary advocacy and legal work over many years MAHA isn t RFK Jr or his appointees it s millions of people reclaiming their biological sovereignty The movement s power comes from individual awakening and local action not from political personalities It s preposterous to think anyone is above criticism whether their intentions are sinister or just misguided True cognitive sovereignty means understanding our own minds rather than defaulting to personality based thinking whether that s parroting The New York Times attacks on Kennedy or worshiping at the altar of Bobby even those of us who believe him to be a good man and trusting the plan Kennedy is one person inside a vast system and I understand that creates constraints and pitfalls When he clearly knows

decisions the invisible hand at play We need to focus less on individual players and more on the entire system steering in a particular direction an apparatus so complex that not everyone can possibly keep track of all its moving parts This systemic approach is what drove my recent analysis of the wearables infrastructure documenting concerns that Eisenstein s piece doesn t address instead focusing on dismissing critics as engaging in hysteria I was compelled to write this response because even though Charles may not know of me or my writing I took strong exception to his argument This isn t about personality politics or ideological purity It s about recognizing that we re being systematically transformed into commoditized data streams potentially hooked up to what can only be described as the Borg I know that sounds like a sci fi movie but alas here we are Imagine telling someone about the Internet of Bodies 25 years ago The wearables infrastructure isn t just about health optimization it s about biometric colonization which I ve explored in depth in Node Without Consent and The Invisible Leash and the financial control mechanisms that I ve been documenting for the last few years The evidence for this biometric colonization comes directly from the architects themselves The real infrastructure The World Economic Forum s own materials show wearables as components in comprehensive digital identity systems connecting health data to financial services government access and social platforms This isn t conspiracy theory it s their documented strategy Economic coercion When insurance rates employment opportunities and basic services become tied to wearable compliance choice becomes meaningless The progression is systematic wearable detects irregularity triggers automated medication reminders insurance adjusts premiums employers flag productivity concerns economic survival becomes dependent on biometric compliance The temporary aid fallacy Kennedy s

paternalistic assumption that Americans are too lazy to manage their own health without technological intervention the exact mindset that enables surveillance infrastructure Privacy protection illusion Eisenstein suggests data will be subject to health privacy laws but this misses the integration point entirely When wearables feed into digital identity systems connected to banking employment and social platforms traditional health privacy frameworks become irrelevant The data isn t just medical it s behavioral emotional and predictive Evergreen surveillance Your biometric data reveals patterns about behavior reproductive cycles and psychological states that you might not even know yourself Platforms processing this data conceptualize it as continuous emotional telemetry designed to anticipate behavior even protest before action occurs The bigger picture As Catherine Austin Fitts warns wearables represent components of the control grid systems integrating health surveillance with digital currencies When combined with central bank digital currencies this creates a digital gulag where biological compliance becomes the price of economic participation The political compromise trap Eisenstein frames this as a necessary political compromise but some infrastructure can t be compromised on Building surveillance systems hoping to control their use later is like constructing a prison and assuming you ll never be the inmate The infrastructure itself becomes the weapon The most dangerous moment for any movement is when legitimate criticism gets reframed as disloyalty to a leader This pattern of defending leaders over principles is exactly how other movements got co opted Unity doesn t mean acquiescence We can support MAHA s goals while questioning methods that undermine biological sovereignty That s not divisiveness it s staying true to virtue over tribe Eisenstein warns against excommunicating anyone who makes an ill considered remark comparing policy critics to cancel culture But there s a crucial distinction between personal attacks on Kennedy and systematic analysis of surveillance infrastructure Questioning a program isn t canceling a person In fact thoughtful policy critique is exactly what healthy movements require to avoid the groupthink that destroys them Kennedy s clarification that he wants wearables to be

for innocuous euphemisms to disguise sinister purpose Japan s biowarfare division adopted the Orwellian title Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department The more accurate description of Unit 731 s principal proficiencies were poisoning water and causing epidemics Unit 731 s diabolical Commander Ishii made himself Japan s version of Germany s Angel of Death Dr Josef Mengele and transformed occupied Manchuria into a nightmarish bioweapons hellhole during the Sino Japanese War Unit 731 operated 4 500 incubators in Manchuria for breeding plague infected fleas on rats and mice to disseminate various contagions Back on the home front Ishii s Unit recruited Japanese farmers soldiers and youth corps members across Japan to capture and breed rats and elderly men to ranch fleas on their bodies Detachment 731 researchers also used sick dogs to cultivate and spread cholera and ticks to spread hemorrhagic fever and poisoned wells with cholera Ishii field tested bacteriological weapons by aerial dousings of civilian populations in occupied Chinese cities and towns Ishii proved the efficacy of entomological weapons during highly successful plague attacks on Manchuria s port city of Ningbo in October 1940 Unit 731 dropped ceramic barrels filled with plague laden fleas Within days residents were dying in droves The physicians of Unit 731 moved in with stretchers pretending to offer treatment but instead removed the patients to field laboratories disguised as treatment centers and dissected them alive Buoyed by the successful massacre at Ningbo the Japanese dropped germ bombs carrying typhoid and cholera on over seventy Chinese communities including eleven major cities killing approximately five hundred thousand civilians Dr Friedrich Frischknecht professor of

volunteers for bioweapons experiments The recruiters bound these prisoners arms and hips and shipped them in boxcars to a walled city of 150 buildings housing thousands of test subjects on a six square kilometer proving ground in a remote village Pingfang in the Harbin district The compound included a camp for prisoners of war called the Zhongma Prison Camp The involuntary subjects according to Japanese sources were mostly Chinese prisoners some Russians and as one Japanese participant put it some miscellaneous half breeds After the war Moscow reported that Unit 731 also used American war prisoners as guinea pigs Eyewitnesses reported viewing the bodies of deceased American servicemen preserved in large pickle jars beside soldiers and civilians of diverse nationalities on display in the specimen room of Unit 731 s massive headquarters in Pingfang The Japanese biowarfare units took special care to keep their trial subjects able bodied and well fed since experiments sought to test efficacy of deadly germs on healthy populations Healthy subjects Nazi doctors also demanded healthy subjects for their experimentation On November 15 1943 for example German virus expert and vaccine creator Dr Eugen Haagen a key developer in the covert Nazi bioweapons program sent a scolding letter to a university administrator complaining that of the one hundred prisoners sent to his lab in a

vaccine development the same propaganda strategy that the American biosecurity cartel and its modern czar Anthony Fauci later adopted But Gold points out that it seems clear that there was nothing defensive about Unit 731 The only thing remotely defensive about it was the strident tone of the argument with which Ishii justified its existence Academics also conspired with the leading Japanese medical journals to mask their scholarly papers under pretense of vaccine development epidemic prevention and defensive biowarfare Japanese academies used the term monkeys without a species designation in their published scientific papers as a euphemism for human subjects who were sacrificed during the experiment Professor Tsuneishi Keiichi explained this ruse Failure to identify the species of an animal in an experiment lowers the value of the paper reporting its results Where monkeys were actually used it was common practice to identify the type Thus it was an open secret that the simple and unscientific use of the term monkey by itself was a code which meant that the subjects were human The medical community knew this The journal knew this The readiness with which Lieutenant General Kitano Masaji publicized this transparent sham and its acceptance by Japan s medical community at large is a sad testament to the lack of conflict between the ethical standards of the medical world in Japan and those of Unit 731 Every medical school regulatory agency medical bureaucracy medical journal and virtually every research physician in Japan became complicit in the

Although the experiments were conducted by fewer than two hundred murderous quacks albeit some of them held eminent posts in the medical world their criminal work was known to thousands of leading

Germany s Surgeon General Walter Schreiber who supervised the Reich s vaccine research Deputy Surgeon General Dr Kurt Blome who directed bioweapons development and Dr Eugen Haagen a key developer of

doctors stop practicing medicine and become agents of state policy it s inevitable that the government will quickly make them instruments of social control Doctors who pursue the lure invariably betray their deeply held values and often become the enemies of their own patients and humanity at large Ishii Schreiber and the others demonstrated how the rubric of national security can override even the most sacred moral precepts upon which a society rests including the moral prohibitions against human experimentation and the wholesale murder of noncombatants innocent civilians and vulnerable minorities for the greater good In every nation that devoted resources to the field the bioweapons enterprise has caused the wholesale subversion of traditional ethics across the medical profession One of the most striking and consistent features of biosecurity is its tendency to divert national medical establishments from their ethical credo and to transform competent medical doctors and regulators who have previously committed their lives to healing disease and saving lives into dark necromancers mass murderers and diabolical enthusiasts for ghoulish human experimentation Like Ishii and Schreiber Dr Fauci rose to run an all powerful bureaucracy and to enjoy vast political power and a deified national reputation As did Schreiber and Ishii the NIAID chief has given overriding priority to industry profits and the military applications of infectious disease research in ways that inevitably subverted his agency s public health program Like Ishii and Schreiber Dr Fauci masks his bioweapons research behind the veil of vaccine development and the smokescreen of national security Like them he has mastered the mechanisms for controlling the medical journals and the mainstream press co opting the leading academics and medical associations and made the nation s most prominent scientists doctors and medical schools complicit in serious wrongdoing He has advanced national

December 2020 when Kennedy filed and dodging the subpoena for a fortnight Earlier this month Daily Kos security guards at the company s San Francisco headquarters twice blocked Kennedy s process

statements claiming immunity under Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act which provides a legal shield to internet platforms against lawsuits redressing defamatory statements by its guest writers Daily Kos took the position that Kennedy s beef was with its pseudonymous author and that Kennedy s only remedy was to sue Downeast Dem But then the Daily Kos refused to disclose Downeast Dem s true name or address Accordingly Kennedy filed a petition with the Supreme Court of Westchester County to order Daily Kos to disclose Downeast Dem s identity and contact information Justice Mary H

confusion doctrinal bankruptcy and intellectual dishonesty among our leading liberal institutions in the wake of the COVID crisis Kennedy s speech in Berlin was a part of his crusade against Pharma s growing power over government agencies and public policy Kennedy says that the industry s claims about COVID vaccines merit heightened scrutiny during their rollouts Unlike other drugs he argued vaccines are given to healthy individuals We therefore should be far less tolerant of risk When asked about Public Citizen s decision to take Pharma s side in the lawsuit Kennedy remarked Public

the supposed right of an anonymous individual to make misleading and false claims about Kennedy that are clearly defamatory It s elemental fairness an American tradition that Kennedy should be able to face his accuser observed Holland It seems both cowardly and unfair that Downeast Dem is going to great lengths to remain faceless Holland said that Public Citizen s position does not appear to arise from any coherent ideological conviction but simply because Downeast Dem is attacking an enemy of Big Pharma which is now thoroughly aligned with Democratic party leadership That s tribalism said

debating Kennedy s questions and prevailing in the marketplace of ideas the liberal intelligentsia has responded with censorship and name calling As a lifelong liberal I find it mind blowing that Pharma s biggest critics have suddenly become its strongest defenders I also find it troubling that liberals once the champions of free speech are now advocating censorship The fundamental essence of

organized by the German group Querdenken 711 or Critical Thinking 711 That post remarked Holland is the opposite of true The Querdenken movement is a broad based peaceful citizens movement for freedom justice and human rights It strongly opposes Nazism anti Semitism and all forces of extremism As usual Querdenken took great pains to exclude extremists from the Berlin event Those efforts were spectacularly successful Among the speakers who followed Kennedy on the podium were politicians from Germany s Green Party Labor Leaders human rights activists doctors lawyers clergy of many religions soldiers police officers parents children world famous athletes and leaders of politically progressive nonprofit organizations The event s Master of Ceremonies was a Black African born in Ghana The musical performance included an Indian Hare Krishna monk The principal stage ornament was a giant mural of Mahatma Gandhi who is hardly a Nazi hero The banners were rainbows peace signs and the flags of every European nation The crowd looked like Woodstock said Holland The speakers and audience were racially and religiously diverse This complete absence of extremist influence or right wing

freedom free speech and due process Liberals were sworn enemies of censorship and the control of the government by corporate multinationals including pharmaceutical corporations Why do we now fear to have conversations about science Why are we retreating instead into appeals to authority Kennedy was referring to the persistent liberal mantra that people should trust the experts rather than research government claims cultivate scientific curiosity and engage in critical thinking Putting faith in experts is a logical fallacy Kennedy said It is a feature of religion not science He continued That notion is anathema to both science or democracy which begin with skepticism with curiosity with relentless questioning and with critical thinking Furthermore the particular group of experts that they are instructing us to trust are mainly badly conflicted government and industry stooges They are aggressively censoring the armies of highly credentialed independent experts who challenge the official orthodoxies Why have some in the liberal establishment folded their tents on the field of logic reason and scientific literacy and retreated from dialogue asked feminist icon Dr

che i comunicatori che desiderano contrastare la disinformazione sulla salute dovrebbero cercare di fare appello a quelle persone e a quelle piattaforme che hanno maggiori probabilità di svolgere una

disinformazione medica retorica no vax e teorie complottiste generalmente sotto la bandiera della Scelta riguardo i vaccini e del Movimento per la libertà terapeutica ha detto O Meara Per darvi un esempio della portata di questo uno studio del 2020 a 2020 study ha scoperto che circa il 54 della pubblicità no vax trovata su Facebook proveniva proprio da questa organizzazione ha aggiunto O Meara ha fatto notare che CHD e RFK Jr apparivano nella Disinformation Dozen Dozzina della disinformazione un elenco stilato dal Center for Countering Digital Hate dei 12 super diffusori di disinformazione COVID 19 Le prove scoperte nelle cause sul Primo Emendamento contro l amministrazione Biden e nell ambito dei Twitter Files hanno rivelato che l elenco della Disinformation Dozen è stato utilizzato dal governo federale per censurare le persone citate nell elenco stesso CHD è stata rimossa da Facebook e Instagram nell agosto del 2022 per aver ripetutamente violato i loro termini di servizio e per aver diffuso disinformazione e teorie complottiste sulla COVID 19 ed altri argomenti sanitari ha dichiarato O Meara Ha notato che Kennedy nel frattempo è stato riammesso in quanto candidato indipendente alla presidenza degli Stati Uniti Secondo O Meara il modo in cui Facebook sta affrontando alcune di quelle tensioni tra il fatto che Kennedy sia un personaggio pubblico le cui idee devono o dovrebbero essere accessibili al pubblico in modo che possano essere comprese e una persona profondamente coinvolta nella diffusione di disinformazione the che è piuttosto pericolosa è interessante O Meara ha affermato che è impegnativo per le piattaforme dei social media identificare e delineare la cosiddetta disinformazione medica perché a differenza di altre cose such as la retorica violenta eccetera gli effetti o l imminente danno fisico alle persone è molto più tardivo Per questo motivo può essere difficile per le piattaforme identificarla e definirla pericolosa CHD accusata di

CHD e come lo status marginale di questa organizzazione is sia articolato e reso operativo Abbiamo condotto un analisi tematica per identificare i punti chiave di discussione ed è all incirca qui che abbiamo identificato la censura dei social media e Big Tech come una specie di punto di discussione internamente significativo per questo particolare account ha detto O Meara riferendosi al canale Telegram di CHD È su questo che si basa il resto dello studio O Meara ha detto che la sua analisi ha portato all identificazione di cinque temi chiave che CHD avrebbe diffuso nelle comunicazioni tramite il suo canale Telegram uno dei quali è che la censura subita da CHD viene usata come credenziale dall organizzazione La rimozione dalle piattaforme e la censura are sono intese come un motivo per ascoltare to CHD un distintivo d onore una dichiarazione di credibilità si legge nella presentazione di O Meara Il deplatforming di CHD è inteso in senso più ampio come un motivo per cui i membri del pubblico devono ascoltare ciò che CHD ha da dire In questo spazio la censura viene in un certo senso brandita come una credenziale che conferisce all organizzazione legittimità o autorità ha detto O Meara O Meara ha anche identificato un tema che ha definito politica della crisi da lei descritto come un senso di urgenza coltivato da CHD in cui la democrazia e i diritti fondamentali sono perduti o in pericolo Il modo in cui lo vedo è una coltivazione dell idea che ci sia una minaccia imminente alla democrazia alla libertà di parola e ai valori fondamentali e che il deplatforming di questa organizzazione ne sia la prova ha detto O Meara Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Il loro essere censurati o moderati o rimossi dalla piattaforma is viene posizionato verso le affermazioni che CHD fa in modo più ampio that it del fatto che questo è la prova del declino della democrazia dell eliminazione dei diritti fondamentali delle persone Il terzo tema individuato da O

individuato da O Meara si concentra meno sulla censura da parte di Big Tech e più su un insistenza ripetitiva sulle minacce generali delle aziende Big Tech all autonomia personale alla privacy e a questo genere di cose tra cui la sorveglianza l acquisizione di dati e i danni dei social media alla salute dei bambini O Meara ha anche parlato di quelle che ha definito espressioni di un sentimento comunitario e inviti all azione O Meara ha detto che le minacce contro CHD sono mobilitate dall organizzazione come inviti all azione da parte dei sostenitori e del pubblico Secondo O Meara la messaggistica di CHD su questi cinque temi si basa spesso su citazioni piccoli frammenti di dialogo tratti da discorsi post o contenuti di una grande varietà di persone in ruoli diversi in contesti diversi o con poche informazioni sul contesto Molti dei loro articoli citano persone che ricoprono ruoli di prestigio positions e posizioni di potere E l effetto complessivo di tutto ciò è quello di costruire questa immagine del Popolo con CHD come sua voce ha detto O Meara CHD sta coinvolgendo e coltivando un movimento populista reazionario sulla salute in cui la cancellazione dalle piattaforme e la censura di questa organizzazione sono diventate un espediente narrativo chiave che viene utilizzato per accrescere le proprie autorità e legittimità ma anche per elevare l importanza del lavoro che svolge ha continuato O Meara O Meara ha aggiunto che questo ha conseguenze interessanti per capire come combattere problemi come la disinformazione medica Rispondendo a una domanda del pubblico ha detto che non è così facile dire che tutte le informazioni diffuse da CHD sono disinformazione ma che è proprio questo che rende l organizzazione molto pericolosa Rispondendo a un altra domanda O Meara ha riconosciuto che la moderazione dei contenuti dei social media è uno strumento imperfetto che è sempre inserito socialmente e culturalmente in un modo che può essere variabile Tuttavia si

Una presentazione My First Thought was Africa Gates Foundation as a Floating Signifier in Global COVID 19 Philanthropy Discussions on Twitter Il mio primo pensiero è stato per l Africa la Fondazione Gates come significante fluttuante nelle discussioni filantropiche globali sulla COVID 19 su Twitter si è concentrata su Gates e la Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation come proverbiali bersagli sia dei sostenitori che degli oppositori dei vaccini anti COVID 19 su internet Kateryna Kasianenko dottoranda presso la Queensland University of Technology in Australia ha dichiarato nella presentazione Figure molto visibili come Gates sono bersaglio di falsità disinformazione cospirazioni aggiungendo che queste tendenze si sono intensificate dopo la COVID 19 Secondo Kasianenko le falsità riguardanti queste figure sono un sintomo della mancanza di fissità di significato che sta dietro la loro filantropia nei discorsi globali online Questa mancanza di fissità è stata caratterizzata come un significante fluttuante in cui una figura come quella di Gates può rappresentare significati diversi per comunità diverse che questo studio ha cercato di esaminare attraverso l analisi di migliaia di tweet del 2020 e del 2021 che facevano riferimento alle attività svolte in Africa da Gates e dalla sua fondazione Citando la prof Claire Wardle un accademica messa in rilievo nei Twitter Files per il suo ruolo di consulenza all amministrazione Biden su come censurare le contro narrazioni COVID 19 Kasianenko ha affermato che mettere in discussione le definizioni di mis dis mal informazione è atomistico dove le comunità di destra no vax are sono arrabbiate contro coloro che sono associati ai filantropi come Gates Queste comunità si appropriano anche di un linguaggio post coloniale quando

affermato Kwon sostenendo che essa può portare a rischi per la salute pubblica come l aumento dell esitazione vaccinale o il rifiuto del consenso scientifico Kwon ha presentato i risultati di un analisi di migliaia di tweet del 2020 concentrando l attenzione su Gates come bersaglio dei super diffusori di teorie complottiste L analisi ha rilevato che i tweet complottisti che fanno riferimento a Gates hanno raggiunto un picco in diverse occasioni come l avvertimento del Dr Anthony Fauci contro le riaperture l accordo della Pfizer con il Dipartimento di Difesa DOD Department of Defense e il Dipartimento della salute e dei servizi umani HHS Department of Health and Human Services la sperimentazione di fase 3 dei vaccini anti COVID 19 Pfizer e JJ Johnson Johnson e il lancio delle campagne di vaccinazione anti COVID 19 nel dicembre 2020 L analisi di Kwon ha rilevato che il 59 degli account dei cosiddetti super diffusori tra cui tre dei sei principali super diffusori sono stati sospesi da Twitter mentre un ulteriore 8 non esiste più Tra gli argomenti più importanti che sono stati oggetto di tweet da parte dei cosiddetti super diffusori vi erano post che collegavano Gates all

former Texas Department of Health and Human Services advisory council member joined The Defender In Depth this week to discuss the latest media and government reports about bird flu following the detection of the H5N1 avian influenza virus also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza HPAI A H5N1 and related strains have been identified in birds poultry cattle mammals including cats and dolphins and humans in Texas and Vietnam The New York Times reported there is a risk the virus could mutate and become transmissible between humans and the Daily Mail claimed a new bird flu outbreak could be 100 times worse than Covid Dr Mandy Cohen director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC said her agency is taking the situation very seriously Suresh Kuchipudi Ph D chair of the Infectious Diseases and Microbiology department at the University of Pittsburgh said We are getting dangerously close to a bird flu pandemic According to Bartlett the latest bird flu outbreak follows patterns similar to those seen during the COVID 19 pandemic Bartlett said bird flu vaccines are already in existence and more are under development He also suggested that gain of function research on bird flu viruses may be responsible for the outbreak and or could cause a future pandemic Gain of function research may lead to development of lethal bird flu strain As an emergency room doctor Bartlett said he is seeing some patterns We ve also had some telegraphing of what s coming He cited a prediction former CDC Director Robert Redfield made in 2022 that the next pandemic will be caused by a bird flu with a 10 15 lethality rate I have that in the back of my mind as I m watching the narrative that s being spun right now in the mainstream media that there s a bird flu that was first detected in Antarctica Bartlett said There happens to be a biolab in the neighborhood of where that bird flu was detected implying that the virus may have originated from or escaped from that

narrative being created of a natural origin of bird flu that s going to be a pandemic Bartlett said Bartlett noted that contrary to media hype the person infected with bird flu in Texas merely had mild conjunctivitis or pink eye But Bartlett questioned how such a diagnosis was determined in the first place A lot of questions come to mind Bartlett said Where did they get this test Is the test accurate One of the things we learned with COVID was there were a lot of false positives with the testing that they were doing This added to the overall case count and contributed to fear I m concerned with the evidence that there s gain of function research in labs with bird flu that we might see something else that actually comes from a lab later And we re going to be told possibly that it came from nature and then find out later it came from a lab Bartlett said The U S Department of Agriculture USDA has since 2021 collaborated with Chinese scientists in gain of function research on H5N1 avian flu virus Bartlett said many of the same people involved with gain of function research on coronaviruses in the U S and China are also doing gain of function research with bird flu strains We keep hearing certain names pop up over and over again with this gain of function research and the funding of it like the EcoHealth Alliance like Peter Daszak he said After everything we just experienced and all the loss of life and bankruptcy and damage to the economy families destroyed with COVID why would you continue gain of function research Bartlett asked I think after what happened with COVID you would think we would have learned our lesson Bird flu vaccines ready for mass production Bartlett suggested the hype surrounding the current bird flu outbreak may be intended to nudge the population into later accepting mass bird flu vaccination in a campaign akin to mass COVID 19 vaccination during the pandemic One of the things we saw with COVID was we were supposed to be afraid

again Bartlett said vaccines already exist that could be used during a bird flu outbreak The U S Food and Drug Administration FDA approved an experimental bird flu vaccine in 2013 which it has since stockpiled Peter Marks M D Ph D director of the FDA s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research recently told Politico the stockpiled vaccines would be reasonably good matches for the current bird flu strain How convenient that they would already have it in the can and ready for mass production Bartlett said There also are other bird flu vaccines being created For instance the USDA is developing a H5N1 vaccine We have no long term safety data on any of these bird flu vaccines that have been created he said Some of the bird flu vaccines under development used mRNA technology which he called modified RNA technology Bartlett connected efforts to develop new bird flu vaccines with recent warnings by the World Health Organization WHO of a so called Disease X a yet unknown pathogen that could cause a new pandemic Bartlett said Disease X is one of nine potential pathogens the WHO lists as priority diseases that could cause a pandemic and for which vaccines are being developed I don t think they re going to do all that research and development without getting a payout on their investment eventually Bartlett said The Bill Melinda Gates Foundation is one of the main funders of the WHO There s a whole lot of financial strings tied to the WHO Bartlett said the WHO defines Disease X as a zoonotic infection and that the organization is using this threat to encourage passage of the pandemic treaty and amendments to the International Health Regulations 2005 at next month s World Health Assembly Big Pharma clamoring for government funding to create bird flu vaccines In

so that money has already been set aside Can you hear the pitter patter of pharmaceutical companies feet going through Capitol Hill looking to get their piece of that pie to develop a vaccine Bartlett also addressed Executive Order 13887 on Modernizing Influenza Vaccines in the United States To Promote National Security and Public Health signed by then President Donald Trump in September 2019 That s concerning because that executive order did not apply to COVID but it would apply to a bird flu pandemic and bird flu vaccines Bartlett said Don t cut in line and get a gene therapy shot for bird flu Bartlett advised the public to resist attempts to generate fear adding that there are already non vaccine treatments that could successfully address symptoms caused by a potential bird flu outbreak There are some common sense preventions that can be done and I m sure we won t hear about those from the CDC Bartlett said There are things we can do to prevent a bird flu even if it comes from a lab Bartlett cited budesonide an inexpensive and widely available inhalable steroid which he expects will be a very valuable tool if we deal with a bird flu pandemic The antiviral Xofluza may also act as an effective treatment while mouthwash and iodine nose spray may help prevent or suppress viral infections he added Now that they have funded a zoonotic influenza pandemic you can be assured that some people want this to happen Bartlett said Don t roll up your sleeve don t cut in line and get a gene therapy shot that has no long term safety data Watch The Defender In Depth here

article Sign Up I ve been fighting government overreach in medicine for decades I ve seen bad policies rigged processes and regulatory witch hunts But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC still in effect 2022 recommendation that all children ages 6 months and up receive the COVID 19 shots and boosters is a perfect storm of bureaucratic coercion scientific neglect and institutional groupthink that sacrifices the individual on the altar of Public Health So I sued the CDC on behalf of Dr Samara Cardenas to stop it But why now As you may know the CDC s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP held a meeting a few weeks ago It was reported that some members were considering voting to remove the COVID 19 shot for children from the official recommendation list It was also reported that U S Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr was weighing the same question and that U S Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary would back Kennedy if he chose to pull the trigger So why sue now Let me give you a layered answer starting with the simplest explanation then moving deeper As of April 25 2025 the day we filed our lawsuit against the CDC physicians who treat patients enrolled in Medicaid are still required to order and administer the COVID 19 shot to children 6 months and older That s the policy Even though the shot has never been shown to have any clinical benefit to healthy children And even though the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System or VAERS which most likely undercounts adverse events has logged reported and temporarily associated with more serious injuries and deaths following the COVID 19 shot than for all other childhood vaccines combined over the last three decades That includes all age groups even though COVID 19 vaccines have been in use in the U S only since Dec 14 2020 I don t know what you d call this continued policy in light of these facts but I call it outrageous I don t see the point in waiting for ACIP to continue its handwringing over something it never should have done in the first place The bigger thing ACIP made the recommendation and that decision revealed something much deeper the systemic devaluation of individual health in favor of population based policy These public health edicts disregard patient specific circumstances And the risk benefit analysis they supposedly rely on It s hollow The risk part has been deliberately under analyzed", "chunk_id":

failure in the way our public health authorities operate That failure needs to be surfaced The dominant view needs to be challenged And solutions need to be considered by people who haven t been captured by the system they re supposed to oversee Medical science is an all too human endeavor I ve been doing this for a long time Back in 2008 I wrote Medical science is necessarily infused with an inherent disorder messiness bias animus and a lack of objectivity The philosophers of science have it wrong to the extent they believe that psychology sociology prejudice and even sociopathology play no role in the growth of medical knowledge or the lack thereof Galileo s Lawyer Courtroom Battles in Alternative Health Complementary Medicine and Experimental Treatments page 261 We see this dysfunction on full display in the CDC s childhood vaccine schedule Twenty one or 22 different vaccines Seventy plus injections Starting on day one of life with hepatitis B All backed by the same flawed machinery ACIP committees industry friendly advisory boards and agencies that treat dissent as disinformation To me the entire vaccine program lays bare the core flaw in the way science policy politics and profit intersect and distort one another If you re looking for the broader frame here it is This lawsuit is just a small step in calling out the public health policy complex for what it is an insulated machine that equates control with care and treats medical independence as a threat And yet another layer On another level this case has personal resonance I ve worked on many of the California medical board disciplinary cases where doctors were sanctioned for writing Senate Bill 277 medical exemptions from all childhood vaccines throughout childhood which is a concept unrecognized by ACIP and which does not conform to ACIP s narrow list of contraindications and precautions It was a difficult experience for me but more so for some of my clients sadly The infectious

board member told The Defender In Depth that the federal government and the medical dental establishment are the biggest promoters of water fluoridation If it comes out that they are wrong their reputations are going to take a major hit You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up For years even as he worked in nonprofit organizations like the American Cancer Society and Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility Rick North didn t suspect water fluoridation was hazardous to human health I always thought fluoridation was fine North said All I d ever heard was It s safe and effective But when North received a phone call 12 years ago from a friend who asked him to review the science on water fluoridation specifically a 2006 report by the National Academy of Sciences what he ended up reading was unbelievable he said Right away I could see this science was a direct contradiction to the statements from fluoridation promoters North said So based on this I changed my mind Using his knowledge and advocacy experience gained from working in the nonprofit sector North began working pretty much full time as a volunteer opposing fluoridation Today North is a board member of the Fluoride Action Network one of several groups that sued the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA after the agency denied a petition to end water fluoridation under the Toxic Substances Control Act On Sept 24 a federal court decided the case ruling that water fluoridation at current levels poses an unreasonable risk of reduced IQ in children and that the EPA must take regulatory action in response North joined The Defender In Depth this week to discuss the ruling and how it already has prompted some cities and counties across the U S to stop or pause the fluoridation of their water supply Fluoridation a hot potato within the federal government North said that various organizations and individuals petitioned the EPA to stop water fluoridation But despite basing their petition on a tremendous amount of animal and human studies the EPA rejected it This is a hot potato within the federal government North said Everybody knows how controversial this is I mean it s basically a sacred cow According to North the next step was to file a lawsuit which several plaintiffs including the Fluoride Action Network Moms Against Fluoridation Food Water Watch and individual parents and children filed in 2017 The lawsuit however was beset with delays it took seven years for the court to finally issue last week s ruling which followed two sets of hearings one in 2020 and one in

cited the publication of a key report by the National Toxicology Program NTP which concluded that fluoride is associated with reduced IQ in children at exposure levels at or above 1 5 milligrams per liter and potentially at lower doses According to North the NTP report was ready for publication in May 2022 However the U S Department of Health and Human Services exerted pressure to block its release They knew it was full of pretty bombshell kinds of information North said North said U S District Judge Edward Chen who was interested in learning about all the science had said throughout the lawsuit that he wanted to see what the NTP concluded When the final report was released in August it may very well have been the deciding factor in issuing his decision shortly afterward North said the NTP report confirmed what anti fluoride activists have been arguing for decades a consistent connection consistent link between fluoride and lower IQ If you are a pregnant woman if you are the parent of an infant this is where the damage to the brain is this is where the science is showing it s happening by women consuming fluoride mainly through water fluoridation North said It gets into the fetus and this is where brain damage can be happening irreversible brain damage loss of IQ Then if the baby is ingesting water mixed with infant formula this is where significant damage also seems to be taking place North added North said the NTP examined 72 studies for its report with 64 of those questioning the practice of water fluoridation including 18 of the 19 highest rated studies It doesn t get much stronger than this North said and the judge agreed He finally decided water fluoridation is an unreasonable risk to humans based on the lowering of IQ in children North said This

appeal If it does the process could span one to two years However North said The important point is that nobody has to wait for the EPA They re not deciding whether a community fluoridates or not North said That doesn t come down from the federal government for any community Some states mandate water fluoridation for towns with populations of 10 000 or more but in other states it s up to local communities It s their decision to fluoridate or not so nobody has to wait for the EPA North said After last week s ruling Abilene Texas Yorktown and Somers New York and the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District in Utah said they would pause or end water fluoridation North said the U S is an outlier as only 24 other countries fluoridate their water The U S fluoridates as many people as the rest of the world put together he said North said commercial pressures to monetize fluoride which he described as a hazardous waste industrial byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer industry is one reason fluoridation is heavily promoted and practiced in the U S You ve got people whose salaries depend on promoting fluoridation North said However he added there is more than just a profit motive involved Mainly the promotion comes from the federal government and the medical dental establishment North said As a result professional reputations are at stake If it comes out that they are wrong

in Colorado and Pennsylvania suggest hazards from oil and natural gas wells are linked to childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia With almost 1 million oil and natural gas wells across the U S many in or near residential areas this puts millions of children at increased risk of exposure to cancer causing chemicals You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Lisa McKenzie and Nicole Deziel Acute lymphocytic leukemia is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in children although it is rare It begins in the bone marrow and rapidly progresses Long term survival rates exceed 90 but many survivors face lifelong health challenges Those include heart conditions mental health struggles and a greater chance of developing a second cancer Overall cancer rates in the U S have declined since 2002 but childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia rates continue to rise This trend underscores the need for prevention rather than focusing only on treatment for this disease A growing body of literature suggests that exposure to the types of chemicals emitted from oil and natural gas wells increases the risk of developing childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia We are environmental epidemiologists focused on understanding the health implications of living near oil and natural gas development operations in Colorado and Pennsylvania Both states experienced a rapid increase in oil and natural gas development in residential areas beginning in the early 21st century We ve studied this issue in these states using different datasets and some different approaches Two studies similar findings Both of our studies used a case control design This design compares children with cancer known as cases with children without cancer known as controls We used data from statewide birth and cancer registries We also used specialized mapping techniques to estimate exposure to oil and natural gas development during sensitive time windows such as pregnancy or early childhood The Colorado study looked at children born between 1992 and 2019 The study included 451 children diagnosed with leukemia and 2 706 children with no cancer diagnosis It considered how many oil and natural gas wells were near a child s home and how intense the activity was at each well Intensity of activity included the volume of oil and gas production and the phase of well production The Colorado study found that children ages 2 9 living in areas with the highest density and intensity of wells within eight miles 13 kilometers of their home were at least two times more likely to be diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia Children with wells within three miles five kilometers of their home bore the greatest risk The Pennsylvania study looked at 405 children diagnosed with leukemia between 2009 and 2017 and 2 080 children without any cancer diagnosis This study found that children living within", "chunk_id":

within 1 2 miles two kilometers of oil and natural gas wells at birth were two to three times more likely to be diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia between the ages of 2 and 7 than those who lived farther than 1 2 miles away The risk of developing leukemia was more pronounced in children who were exposed during their mother s pregnancy The results of our two studies are also supported by a previous study in Colorado published in 2017 That study found children diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia were four times more likely to live in areas with a high density of oil and natural gas wells than children diagnosed with other cancers Policy implications To extract oil and natural gas from underground reserves heavy drilling equipment injects water and chemicals into the earth under high pressure Petroleum and contaminated wastewater are returned to the surface It is well established that these activities can emit cancer causing chemicals Those include benzene as well as other pollutants in the air and water The U S is the world s largest producer of oil and natural gas There are almost 1 million producing wells across the country and many of these are located in or near residential areas This puts millions of children at increased risk of exposure to cancer causing chemicals In the U S oil and natural gas development is generally regulated at the state level Policies aimed at protecting public health include establishing minimum distances between a new well and existing homes known as a setback distance These policies also include requirements for emission control technologies on new and existing wells and restrictions on the construction of new wells Setbacks offer a powerful solution to reduce noise odors and other hazards experienced by communities near oil and gas wells However it is challenging to establish a universal setback that optimally addresses all hazards That s because noise air pollutants and water contaminants dissipate at different rates depending on location and other factors In addition setbacks focus exclusively on where to place oil and natural gas wells but do not impose any restrictions on releases of air pollutants or greenhouse gases Therefore they do not address regional air quality issues or mitigate climate change Furthermore current U S setback distances range from just 200 feet to 3 200 feet Our

largest setback of 3 200 feet one kilometer is not sufficient to protect children from an increased leukemia risk Our results support a more comprehensive policy approach that considers both larger setback distances and mandatory monitoring and control of hazardous emissions on both new and existing wells Future research More research is needed in other states such as Texas and California that have oil and natural gas development in residential areas as well as on other pediatric cancers One such cancer is acute myeloid leukemia This is another type of leukemia that starts in the bone marrow and rapidly progresses This cancer has exhibited a strong link to benzene exposure in adult workers in several industries including the petroleum industry Researchers have also documented a moderate cancer link for children exposed to vehicular benzene It remains unclear whether benzene is the culprit or if another agent or combination of hazards is an underlying cause of acute myeloid leukemia Even though questions remain we believe the existing evidence coupled with the seriousness of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia supports enacting further protective measures We also believe policymakers should consider the cumulative effects from wells other pollution sources and socioeconomic stressors on children and communities Originally published by The Conversation Lisa

potential bird flu pandemic could be 10 times worse than COVID 19 with a mortality rate of up to 25 However he also admitted the risk of the virus spreading to humans is still low In his testimony before the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Califf said the FDA needed to Be ready and do everything we can to limit the spread of the virus which has gone around the world multiple times now in many different species In preparation for the bird flu jumping to humans Califf emphasized the need for countermeasures such as testing antivirals and a vaccine ready to go The U S government s Strategic National Stockpile has three FDA approved H5N1 vaccines manufactured by Sanofi GSK and CSL Seqirus All contain mercury However some have raised concerns about the effectiveness of these vaccines as they were developed based on older strains of the H5N1 virus Pharmaceutical companies including Moderna are developing new bird flu vaccines that better match the currently circulating strains Califf s pronouncements were followed today by the U S Department of Agriculture offering farmers up to 28 000 each to enhance protective measures and testing for the bird flu virus in dairy cows according to STAT News Bird flu scare farcical Experts who spoke with The Defender questioned the urgency and extent of the bird flu threat Brian Hooker Ph D chief scientific officer for Children s Health Defense CHD said Califf s urgency seemed overblown given the lengthy period between the Spanish flu pandemic and the COVID 19 pandemic It appears Califf is joining the choir of public officials and former public officials eagerly predicting the next pandemic a mere four years after the last one started Hooker told The Defender Dr David Bell a public health physician and biotech consultant agreed with Hooker telling The Defender the bird flu scare was farcical We did not have a bad outbreak for over a century and there is every likelihood that we won t again Bell

the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Timing of bird flu claims beyond suspicious Hooker said the timing of Califf s pronouncements about the potential bird flu pandemic appeared suspect in light of the upcoming vote on the World Health Organization WHO pandemic treaty and amendments to the International Health Regulations scheduled for the end of May If passed these amendments would grant the WHO march in rights to any country if the secretary general of the WHO unilaterally declares a pandemic Hooker said So much for civil liberties and free speech On Monday s episode of CHD TV

Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA Director Rick Bright who are also warning about the risk of a severe bird flu pandemic Bright a BARDA whistleblower is now the CEO of Bright Global Health which focuses on responses to public health emergencies according to The New York Times The pressure to declare the next pandemic may also be a consequence of greater pushback against the WHO proposals after 49 U S senators last week called on President Joe Biden to withdraw his support for them Two U S states Utah and Florida passed laws that prevent any WHO agreement from

agencies indicate a reduction in the frequency of natural outbreaks arising from zoonoses diseases spreading to humans from animals over the past one to two decades they wrote They argued this contradicts the narrative promoted by international organizations of accelerating risk and suggests further analysis of risk and burden is required before diverting the planned tens of billions of

Hooker and Ray during their CHD TV presentation expressed concerns about the numerous U S government agencies and their academic associates involved in gain of function research on the H5N1 virus that is now infecting U S cattle They noted that at least three U S entities the CDC s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Influenza Division BARDA and the University of Wisconsin have been working on this type of research particularly on the same clade that is infecting cattle They also pointed out potential conflicts of interest among the researchers involved in these gain of

career during the early AIDS crisis by partnering with pharmaceutical companies to sabotage safe and effective off patent therapeutic treatments for AIDS Fauci orchestrated fraudulent studies and then pressured U S Food and Drug Administration FDA regulators into approving a deadly chemotherapy treatment he knew to be worthless against AIDS The FDA deemed AZT too toxic for human use Many researchers today argue AZT killed far more people than AIDS Thanks to Fauci s corrupt intervention AZT at 10 000 per patient per year became history s most expensive commercial drug one that made billions for GlaxoSmithKline Fauci repeatedly violated federal laws to allow his Pharma partners to use impoverished and dark skinned children as lab rats in deadly experiments with toxic AIDS and

private school in San Diego without parents knowledge or consent Parents whose kids attend the Rock Academy in San Diego said they re angry that school leaders didn t tell them about a deal the school signed with T Mobile to put nine hidden cell antennas on the side of the school s building The antennas are roughly 50 feet above the school s preschool playground with the closest antennas only about 20 feet above the playground The private school operated by the Rock Church one of the largest megachurches in the U S serves over 400 K 12 students and 100 preschoolers The school and church share a campus Rock Church leaders in April 2022 secretly signed a contract with T Mobile giving the telecom company permission to install the antennas according to Rock Academy parent Laura Buckley The problem is not just that the Rock failed to inform parents and staff before signing the contract Buckley whose kids are in third sixth and eighth grade told The Defender They were presumably never going to disclose the antennas at all During installation the school and T Mobile hid the antennas behind tarps Now they are hidden behind a facade that matches the building she said No one would ever

solely for T Mobile s benefit Buckley agreed The contract includes a series of renewal periods but only on the side of T Mobile The 31st year of the contract is the first year the Rock can get out she said The contract also gives T Mobile permission to change or increase the number and type of antenna without the Rock s approval Buckley said The antennas can become 5G at any time This is significant she added because according to the Rock s spokesperson on radiofrequency RF radiation Derek Falconer radiation from 5G antennas can travel around corners Leaders apologize propose

declined to respond other than to share an official statement released on May 20 from the Rock Church and Academy stating We realized that it was a mistake to sign the contract without first having a discussion with staff and parents and we sincerely apologized and apologize for the stress that this has caused In the statement the Rock Church and Academy said they proposed two alternative sites to T Mobile but the company refused The church and school also said they tried multiple times to negotiate an end to the contract and have the antennas removed but Fletcher said that was untrue Buckley agreed To the best of my knowledge she said the Rock still has never made a written settlement offer to T Mobile for 1 Too little too late Since T Mobile has the legal right to activate its antennas the Rock Church and Academy promised to implement a mitigation plan to prevent RF radiation from the antennas from impacting its campus The plan includes installing RF shielding materials such as

Act FOIA requests In a letter sent Tuesday to the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS U S Food and Drug Administration FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Johnson said the redactions make the documents nearly impossible to comprehend and obscure the public s understanding of issues like myocarditis and pericarditis linked to vaccines He also called out the agencies for not responding to his own requests for COVID 19 vaccine safety information He wrote The lack of transparency from your agencies during the Biden presidency has been appalling Your agencies refusal to provide complete and unredacted responses and documents to my numerous oversight letters on the development and safety of the COVID 19 vaccines has hindered Congressional oversight and has jeopardized the public s health Johnson an outspoken critic of the government s handling of COVID 19 related information sent over 60 public letters requesting more transparency on virus origins early

said comprised only a small fraction of the documents on myocarditis and pericarditis that the agencies continue to conceal Johnson gave the agencies until Dec 3 to respond warning that if the

Johnson cited responses to those FOIA requests as examples of how the agencies obstructed attempts by the public to hold them accountable For example heavily redacted documents indicate that then CDC Director Rochelle Walensky had received Pfizer documents regarding myocarditis and pericarditis by May 22 2021 However the Pfizer report provided via FOIA was completely redacted except for the cover page making it impossible to decipher what Walensky learned and when Johnson included the FOIA documents in his letter so the public could see the extent of the redactions The documents showed that after receiving the FOIA data Walensky and other CDC officials considered whether to issue a public warning about the risk of myocarditis from vaccination They drafted a Health Alert Network HAN for the website which is how they communicate urgent public health incidents with public information officers practitioners clinicians and local public health officials The draft alert sent to Walensky was redacted when the CDC produced documents in response to a FOIA request A partially unredacted email to either a Moderna or Pfizer employee indicated that the agency was debating the pros and cons of issuing a HAN but didn t want to appear alarmist The agency never issued the alert Instead the CDC said on its website that there were increased cases of myocarditis and pericarditis reported but the CDC continues to recommend the vaccine for everyone ages 12 and up Johnson requested all documents about the alert but the CDC has not provided them In Johnson s third example the Biden White House sent top public health officials 17 pages of talking points for a tough QA on COVID 19 In the FOIA documents all the topics are redacted making it impossible to know what the White House was communicating Ultimately despite your agencies awareness of the risks associated with the COVID 19 vaccines the main talking point from these and other public health officials was uniform and entirely

with the FDA CDC and National Institutes of Health seeking records connected with post authorization safety monitoring of COVID 19 shots We have found that obtaining these records is a challenge due to a mix of denials redactions and delays by the agencies she said When the agencies failed to respond to FOIA requests for records related to safety signals CHD filed multiple FOIA lawsuits seeking the requested documents In one case the FDA requested at least 18 months to fulfill the request after it had already delayed 14 months The agencies failure to respond to our requests in a timely and open fashion is particularly ironic in light of recent statements by Dr Peter Marks director of the FDA s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research calling for more transparency as a way of combating vaccine hesitancy Evans said The FDA also famously attempted to delay documents related to the licensing of Pfizer s Comirnaty COVID 19 vaccine for 75 years The U S House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic also investigated Dr David M Morens a 25 year veteran of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and adviser to Dr Anthony Fauci after it was revealed he used his personal email address to evade FOIA requests for communications related to the origins of COVID 19 Emails made public during that investigation also showed that Morens connected Fauci to Kaiser Health News reporter Arthur Allen through a secret back channel Jablonowski who was among the first to detail the deception around myocarditis told The Defender if the public health agencies aren t compelled to be transparent they can t be held accountable He said the FDA and the CDC are not transparent in matters of myocarditis resulting from the COVID 19 vaccines They are opaque hidden

hearing on the failure of public health officials to adequately warn about the risk of myocarditis associated with COVID 19 vaccines quickly morphed into a referendum on vaccine safety in general the

pitted Sen Richard Blumenthal D Conn subcommittee ranking member and Hawaii Gov Josh Green a doctor staunch supporters of the COVID 19 vaccine campaign and vaccines in general against Sen Ron Johnson R Wis subcommittee chair and a panel of witnesses who criticized the government s handling of COVID 19 I am satisfied that our Senate hearing delivered America the truth on the COVID 19 vaccine debacle Dr Peter McCullough one of the witnesses told The Defender Sadly an untold number of primarily young individuals suffered devastating vaccine heart damage Some lost their lives because of

witness Children s Health Defense CEO Mary Holland who attended the hearing said she was grateful to Johnson for shining a bright light on what happened during the COVID era The public has lost faith in the government because the government s policies were catastrophic Holland said Senator Johnson is leading the charge to get to the truth about what happened to our country during COVID and to ensure that nothing like it will ever happen again Holland added The hearing initiated a dialogue between those of differing views which is needed But it was disappointing that the majority of subcommittee members either didn t show up at all or showed up for cameo appearances Johnson warned at the close of the hearing that acknowledging and rectifying the problems of the COVID 19 era is

detailed how federal health officials in spring 2021 failed to swiftly warn the public of the risk of myocarditis and other cardiac related issues following COVID 19 and instead downplayed the risk Along with the report the subcommittee released over 2 400 pages of U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS documents including COVID 19 vaccine safety records and communications about the COVID 19 pandemic Johnson subpoenaed HHS for the documents in January Before the committee heard from witnesses Blumenthal pushed back against the claim that federal health officials had initially hidden data about myocarditis risk He also praised the COVID 19 vaccine saying the most important fact was that COVID 19 vaccines had saved millions and millions of lives Blumenthal s assistant placed posters behind him that echoed his claim Later in the hearing Siri called out Blumenthal on those claims saying they were sourced from a blog not from reliable data or sources Blumenthal also showed a poster that claimed three deaths in 2025 had been caused by measles Misinformation about the safety of vaccines has led to a deadly outbreak of a preventable disease he said We all know it measles He went on to make statements undermining the credibility of the witnesses including that some profited from selling disproven wellness treatments and suing vaccine companies The witnesses gave testimony

being promoted as a breakthrough in protecting babies from RSV However there are serious concerns about its safety that you should be aware of before consenting to this treatment for your child At least two infant deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS were likely caused by nirsevimab not the adult RSV vaccine as initially thought Both babies died on the same day they received the shots One 27 day old boy died immediately in the doctor s office while an infant girl was found unresponsive seven hours after injection These tragic events highlight the potential

for some children between 8 and 19 months old who are at high risk for severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season However the introduction of nirsevimab has exposed significant gaps in the adverse event reporting system for non vaccine shots Unlike conventional vaccines nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody which falls into a different category for safety monitoring A monoclonal antibody provides passive immunity by directly supplying antibodies to fight a specific pathogen In contrast a vaccine stimulates your body s immune system to produce its own antibodies creating active immunity that develops over time The CDC doesn t directly monitor injuries from medications that are not vaccines instead relying on the FDA s MedWatch system This discrepancy has led to confusion among healthcare providers and the public about where and how to report side effects Albert Benavides a data analyst and VAERS expert told The Defender This also presents a challenge to people who want to report nirsevimab injuries because VAERS does not have a category for the drug so people have submitted their claims as unknown vax type or selected one of the existing RSV vaccines which are different drugs This confusion could result in the underreporting of adverse events and make it more difficult to accurately assess the safety profile of nirsevimab Parents should be aware that this reporting inconsistency might mask risks associated with the drug Long term safety concerns and economic implications The rush to implement widespread nirsevimab use raises questions about long term safety and economic feasibility Dr Meryl Nass an internist and biological warfare epidemiologist points out that no monoclonal antibody product has ever been given on a mass scale to children before The safety profile of nirsevimab raises significant questions While the product label mentions only rashes and anaphylaxis as potential risks this appears to be a remarkably uninformative description Nass points out that monoclonal antibodies are associated with numerous side effects from changes in blood pressure and increased heart rate to cytokine release syndrome More alarmingly Nass says there was an imbalance in deaths between the treatment and placebo groups during clinical trials The FDA reportedly judged that these excess deaths were not due to the monoclonal

price of nirsevimab is also substantial Nass notes with the CDC paying 395 per dose for 0 to 8 month olds and other buyers paying 495 For older infants 8 19 months the price doubles Despite this high cost there are already concerns about its long term effectiveness RSV strains resistant to nirsevimab have been identified suggesting that widespread use could lead to ecological changes in RSV populations As resistant strains outcompete susceptible ones the product s efficacy may diminish rapidly This raises questions about the wisdom of implementing such an expensive intervention that may have a limited useful lifespan Regulatory classification and liability considerations Nirsevimab occupies a curious position between drug and vaccine classifications The CDC appears to be using these definitions interchangeably when convenient By calling it a vaccine manufacturers can obtain liability protection through inclusion in the childhood vaccine schedule However for reimbursement purposes it s coded as a drug This dual classification also affects adverse event reporting when used alone reports go to the FDA s drug system FDA Adverse Event Reporting System or FAERS but when administered with other vaccines reports are sent to VAERS This regulatory ambiguity only further complicates safety monitoring and accountability The hidden dangers of antibody dependent enhancement One of the most worrying risks of the RSV shot as noted in a preprint study by French scientist Hélène Banoun Ph D is antibody dependent enhancement ADE This phenomenon occurs when antibodies actually help a virus infect cells more easily instead of neutralizing it ADE has been observed with other respiratory viruses and vaccines and it s a theoretical risk with nirsevimab as well Banoun told The Defender that in France A significant increase in mortality among newborns between 2 and 6 days of age was observed from the start of the RSV shot campaign babies were injected before leaving the maternity ward The shot works by providing antibodies that target the RSV fusion protein These antibodies have been engineered to last longer in your baby s body with a half life of 80 to 120 days But this modification could potentially increase the risk of ADE as antibody levels gradually decline over time At low concentrations the antibodies might not be able to fully neutralize the virus instead

facilitating its entry into cells This could lead to more severe disease in some infants who receive the shot Studies have shown that ADE can occur with RSV antibodies particularly when they re present at sub neutralizing levels In laboratory experiments RSV antibodies have been shown to enhance infection of certain cell types including macrophages which are important immune cells in the lungs This raises concerns about whether nirsevimab could make RSV infections worse in some babies as the antibody levels wane over time Inadequate safety data and concerning trial results Banoun s study further points out that the clinical trials for nirsevimab have significant limitations that make it difficult to fully assess its safety Many of the trials were conducted during periods of low RSV circulation which means there weren t many cases of severe RSV to compare between the treatment and placebo groups This limits the ability to draw firm conclusions about the shot s effectiveness and more importantly its safety Some concerning trends emerged in the trials but they were often dismissed due to small numbers For example in one study babies who received nirsevimab and were still hospitalized for RSV stayed in the hospital longer than those who received a placebo This could potentially indicate more severe disease in some treated infants but it wasn t thoroughly investigated Even more worrying is the imbalance in deaths observed in some trials The FDA noted that there were 12 deaths among 3 710 infants who received nirsevimab 0 32 compared to four deaths among 1 797 infants in the control group 0 22 While the overall numbers are small this imbalance is concerning and deserves further scrutiny It s also worth noting that a significant number of participants were

under 6 months old who were admitted to intensive care for bronchiolitis during the 2023 2024 season 143 29 had received nirsevimab Out of these admissions 69 were due to RSV This doesn t necessarily mean the shot is ineffective as we don t know what the numbers would have been without it However it does show that the shot is far from a guarantee of protection against severe RSV disease More worryingly it suggests that some infants who receive the shot are still ending up with very serious respiratory infections There s also the question of how nirsevimab might interact with your baby s developing immune system The shot provides artificially high levels of antibodies against one specific part of the RSV virus We don t yet know if this could interfere with your child s natural development of immunity against RSV or other respiratory viruses Additionally the pharmacovigilance data from Europe shows that the majority of adverse event reports for Beyfortus are related to respiratory issues including bronchiolitis and RSV infections While this doesn t prove causation it s a signal that warrants careful monitoring and further investigation Given these risks and unknowns you might be wondering if the potential benefits of the RSV shot outweigh the risks for your baby While RSV can certainly be serious in some infants the majority of babies recover without complications According to Nass I previously revealed a published CDC paper from 2021 that showed only 25 babies up to one year of age die from RSV yearly in the entire US averaged over 12 years This

Without those 1 900 patients she was forced to close her practice In an interview with The Defender the California pediatrician said safety concerns drove her decision to withhold the COVID 19 vaccines from her young patients There was already a lot of information that the COVID shot had more problems than not Cardenas said It made me feel very uncomfortable to administer a vaccine that was more dangerous than the benefit it could provide She cited the high number of COVID 19 vaccine related injury reports submitted as early as 2021 to the government run Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS By 2022 VAERS data showed that the COVID 19 vaccines were associated with more injuries and deaths than all conventional vaccines combined in the previous three decades Cardenas said she

made me more sure that something was wrong with the vaccine Cardenas said Most states including California require pediatricians who treat Medicare patients to enroll in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC Vaccines for Children Program The program requires doctors to administer all vaccines on the childhood immunization schedule to their Medicaid patients regardless of the child s health status or their parents wishes In 2023 the Vaccines for Children Program removed Cardenas from the program after a review of her vaccine records showed she wasn t administering COVID 19

on Immunization Practices which makes vaccine related recommendations As of March 28 VAERS listed 72 924 reports of adverse events in people 18 and younger including 6 122 serious adverse events and 201 deaths However experts have said that the true number is likely higher as many VAERS reports of injuries in children officially list their age as unknown Many parents welcomed Cardenas decision

Vaccines for Children Program vaccines for Medicaid patients Medicaid compensates pediatricians for the costs associated with administering the vaccines Because she worked with low income households she could not sustain her medical practice on a cash basis so she closed it in October 2024 Cardenas said the Vaccines for Children Program was established to offset the high cost of vaccines for low income families But by requiring pediatricians to administer the full CDC childhood vaccine schedule the program discriminates against low income children as it deprives their families of vaccine choice and informed consent Patients that have private insurance can opt to not have the vaccines Cardenas said It is a totally different way of treating the poor population or the ones who can afford paid insurance And that should not be the case These allegations of discriminatory practices form one of the key arguments in Cardenas complaint I would like to see that pediatricians or doctors in general are allowed to make a decision if they feel that some treatment will do harm to their patients rather than having to follow guidelines that as I found after all this happened are sometimes

the pandemic when not a single major news outlet did any real critical reporting on COVID vaccines Instead they parroted pharma s safe and effective propaganda while ignoring the waves of injuries and deaths that followed the rollout of the shots Prescription drugs accounted for 30 7 of ad minutes across evening news programs on ABC CNN Fox News MSNBC and NBC last year through Dec 15 according to The Wall Street Journal WSJ Last year Big Pharma spent more than 5 billion on TV ads alone The content of the proposed bill echoes calls made by U S Health and Human Services HHS Secretary Robert F

limit drug ads failed New Zealand is the only other country that allows direct to consumer marketing of prescription drugs In the U S the practice has been ongoing for decades drawing criticism from advocates like Kennedy researchers the American Medical Association and other doctors associations and even mainstream health news outlets including STAT News In recent years Pharma has thwarted efforts to regulate drug ads claiming a ban would violate their First Amendment rights When the first Trump administration tried to require drugmakers to list drug prices in TV ads the industry took it to court A federal judge blocked the move ruling that HHS lacked congressional authority to compel drug companies to disclose drug pricing There have been other recent moves in Congress to limit drug ads Last year King also introduced a bill to prohibit pharmaceutical advertising to consumers in the first three years after a drug is first approved In May Sens Josh Hawley R Mo and Jeanne Shaheen D N H proposed a bill to strip pharmaceutical companies of the ability to deduct the costs of consumer drug advertising from their taxes as a business expense Drugmakers spend billions on ads each year Americans watch hours of ads Drug commercials are ubiquitous on U S television today The average television viewer watches as many as nine advertisements per day and about 16 hours of ads per year more time than people spend with their primary care physicians Between 2016 and 2018 drugmakers spent 17 8 billion on ads for 553 drugs Most of these drugs treat chronic medical conditions

including college basketball s March Madness the Super Bowl and the Oscars but they also advertise heavily on daily programs like network nightly news The U S Food and Drug Administration s FDA regulatory power over the ads first established in the 1960s was diminished in the 1980s and 90s After the drug thalidomide marketed to pregnant women to treat nausea caused serious birth defects in the 1950s and early 1960s Congress empowered the agency to regulate drug labeling and advertising The FDA mandated that ads be truthful present a balanced representation of risks and benefits and include information about all possible risks listed on the label However in the late 1990s the FDA relaxed the requirements about which risks Pharma had to share with consumers Spending on television ads exploded In 2004 the agency relaxed the requirements even further Spending on ads shot up 330 between 1996 and 2005 reaching 4 2 billion by 2004 and continued to grow after that As regulations were loosened the FDA took fewer enforcement actions What s wrong with direct to consumer advertising Drug companies argue that drug ads empower patients in their relationships with their providers by increasing their awareness about disease and treatment options A 2013 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggested that advertising can somewhat educate consumers and extend drug care to undertreated patients However the report said advertising also increases the number of patients who request an advertised medication and the likelihood their prescriber will give it to them whether they need it or not Studies have also shown that physicians will often prescribe the requested drugs despite their own reservations Research also demonstrates there is no evidence that drug ads improve patient care A 2023 paper published in JAMA Network Open found that drug ads led to more sales of drugs with lower clinical benefits suggesting that advertising drives demand for more marginally effective drugs As consumers look to these drugs the government can also end up footing the bill According to a report by the congressional watchdog Government Accountability Office 60 of

pregnant even as her agency promoted it as safe and effective for all pregnant women Dr Sara Brenner s explosive disclosure made on May 15 at the MAHA Institute Round Table in Washington D C is as revealing as it is troubling Brenner a preventive medicine physician has worked at the FDA since 2019 As the FDA s principal deputy commissioner and briefly its acting commissioner Brenner was at the center of decision making Prior to that she was chief medical officer for diagnostics and was detailed to the White House to support the Biden administration s COVID 19 response She didn t just participate in the pandemic response she helped shape it from within Knowing what I knew not only about nanotechnology about medicine about the medical countermeasures but also having a very strong and firm grounding in bioethics there were many things that were not right she told the audience That someone with her seniority and access to internal data privately rejected the vaccine while her agency promoted it to millions of pregnant women presents a profound ethical dilemma Brenner s concerns about mRNA safety Brenner explained that her decision was driven by a lack of safety data particularly around the biodistribution of the vaccine s lipid nanoparticles LNPs the tiny fat particles used to deliver the mRNA into cells It was unknown at the time what the biodistribution patterns of those products were That was my primary concern and that exposure I was very concerned about said Brenner She had reason to be cautious As a nanomedicine expert who built an M D Ph D program in the field Brenner had spent years researching the biodistribution excretion metabolism and toxicities associated with engineered nanoparticles Materials that don t exist in nature there s a lot of unknowns said Brenner She warned that unintended toxic effects especially in vulnerable populations like pregnant women could not be ignored Regardless of the medical product or the intervention there s always going to be the need to evaluate both the intended outcomes and the unintended consequences she cautioned Warnings ignored Brenner s concerns echoed those raised in 2021 by

accumulated in organs including the ovaries liver spleen and bone marrow At the time Bridle s warnings were aggressively dismissed His reputation took a hit and he faced institutional censure from the University of Guelph where he was a professor for speaking out against vaccine mandates Now Brenner s comments confirm that these concerns were not only valid they were quietly shared at the highest levels of the FDA During the event Brenner also revealed that her worries extended to breastfeeding and potential exposure to her child after birth A 2022 study published in JAMA Pediatrics detected vaccine derived mRNA in the breast milk of vaccinated mothers for at least 48 hours the very scenario Brenner had feared Yet the FDA made little effort to publicly investigate or address the findings dismissing them with the vague reassurance that there was no evidence of harm No mandate for Brenner It s unclear how Brenner managed to avoid the vaccine mandate that applied to all federal employees at the time She didn t say Perhaps she received a religious or medical exemption but she left that part out What she did reveal was that she had concerns deep enough not to take the vaccine during her pregnancy Yet she said nothing publicly while her agency told millions of other women it was safe For many that silence is hard to accept and it has left many asking why she didn t warn other women about a product with zero clinical safety data in pregnancy No one but Brenner knows the full story But the ethical contradiction is hard to ignore Silence inside the castle Brenner acknowledged the immense pressure inside the FDA to stick to the official narrative They don t let you get very far out of the castle at FDA with your talking points she admitted nervously She described the period as a dark night of the soul for many civil servants a time when even very obvious things took bravery to say She eventually found support through a group called Feds for Medical Freedom federal workers

vaccine injured or whose pregnancies were affected Her comments offer a rare glimpse into the internal dynamics of a government institution that issued sweeping public assurances while failing to acknowledge its own uncertainty There was no acknowledgement of what was unknown There were only statements and assertions that were really more like beliefs Brenner said of the FDA s messaging during the pandemic That may be her most important admission This is more than a story about one woman s personal decision It is a story about institutional culture regulatory failure and the consequences of silence Those who spoke up were punished Those who stayed silent kept their jobs and reputations And those who were forced to comply were often left to deal with the collateral damage When asked whether she believed she had made the right decision in refusing the COVID 19 vaccine Brenner replied simply I believe so Now that she has spoken the question remains who else knew and said nothing

those who of course advocated for informed medical choice as being sources of disinformation Ji said The report named GreenMedInfo Several other people and websites named in the UNICEF report were also included in the Disinformation Dozen list Ji said including Dr Joseph Mercola and Ohio physician Dr Sherri Tenpenny We had already been targeted as so called spreaders of misinformation by sharing inconvenient peer reviewed research that indicated there are unintended adverse effects of common pharmaceutical interventions That advocacy is really what made us targets Ji said Ji said CCDH initially entered the misinformation sphere as a cutout of the U K Labour Party that popped out of nowhere really as part of a Labour Party operation composed of intelligence associated individuals It

report in March 2021 Ji described the report as a great example of how NGOs nongovernmental organizations and think tanks launder influence and participate in illegal activities The Disinformation Dozen report claimed that those included on the list were responsible for nearly two thirds of all anti vaccine content on social media But Ji noted that in 2021 Facebook disputed those findings In an August 2021 report Facebook said there isn t any evidence to support CCDH s claims And yet that lie was promulgated around the world Ji said noting that the Biden administration used the report as the basis for targeting supposed misinformation and disinformation about COVID 19 and the COVID 19 shots Massive network of dark money flows funds organizations like CCDH Ji said a massive network of dark money flows underpins the operations of groups like CCDH acting as the hidden hand behind all these marionette cutouts He said his investigation found a network of U S and U K philanthropic organizations funding CCDH including one linked to investor George Soros Ji said We have once again U S and U K dark money flowing into an intelligence coordinated cutout that weaponized social media and government institutions against U S citizens in an extremely egregious manner that should never happen again This dark money network tracks back to the State Department through the Global

s revelations stemming from internal CCDH documents leaked by an insider last month He said the leak exposed CCDH s Orwellian agenda where you re projecting that you re concerned about the public

plausible deniability leveraging military sometimes paramilitary definitely intelligence assets to discredit defame disrupt perhaps use lawfare and demonetization strategies Ji said In some cases it even stretches into illegal activities which could include harming that individual Ji added This digital hit list CCDH published was to intimidate millions of others who might have spoken out or might have questioned some of these authoritarian mandates and made better choices for themselves Ji said that for organizations like CCDH the next step is legislation and that s to criminalize free speech A big part of what CCDH is attempting to do is to create the PR context for receptivity to legislative changes that are exactly identical to the U K online safety bill Ji said That s a really serious problem because we have about eight bills presently being considered that are modeled after what they re proposing According to Ji the recent leak of CCDH s internal documents may have derailed the organization s plans to pursue its censorship objectives leading the group and its CEO Imran Ahmed to delete their accounts on X formerly Twitter Noting that CCDH is already facing a congressional investigation and several lawsuits Ji said CCDH already had a sort of perfect storm forming to initiate their collapse even before the leak He said the group s exit from X indicates they re also trying to delete evidence that might surface to further implicate them For Ji these developments are cause for optimism We re in a different era right now as far as free speech he said Now we re

establish limits and work together with USDA s Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS to test and monitor contaminants in the food supply and environment including heavy metals The amount of pesticides detected in the testing mostly fell below the EPA s limits Spotlight on America said However that doesn t mean those quantities are safe especially for children s developing brains and

Why Do Health Agencies Ignore Them Federal public health agencies continue to ignore scientific advances made largely by prominent scientists working outside of the U S despite the scientists appeals to agencies to investigate the link and stop telling parents aluminum in vaccines is safe You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Five major scientific findings taken together explain how vaccines trigger autism author J B Handley wrote on his Substack The cause is rooted in the body s response to the aluminum adjuvant used in six vaccines on the childhood immunization schedule Federal public health agencies continue to ignore these scientific advances made largely by prominent scientists working outside of the U S in the last decade despite the scientists appeals to agencies to investigate the link and to stop telling the American public the aluminum in vaccines is safe The trigger for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders according to Handley is immune system activation that can alter the developing brain when the activation occurs either in a pregnant mother or a young child This happens because the neurotoxic aluminum in vaccines travels easily to the brain There it can cause inflammation in vulnerable people by triggering the production of a key cytokine interleukin 6 or IL 6 a protein that affects the immune system IL 6 has been linked to autism Handley author of the best selling book How to End the Autism Epidemic co founder of the Age of Autism website and father of a son with autism draws heavily on the Vaccine Papers website which collects and analyzes relevant science to outline the key scientific findings that make this case This important research largely happens outside of the U S because autism research that is even remotely controversial is impossible to get funded or approved he wrote The research Handley cites began to emerge in 2004 and much of it came out after 2009 after the Vaccine Court dismissed the autism vaccine hypothesis and denied compensation for their vaccine injuries to thousands of families Quoting Vaccine Papers Handley wrote that vaccines must be subjected to an objective risk benefit analysis and should be considered as a medical treatment only if they do more good than harm The problem with vaccines is that risks have been underestimated and the benefits overestimated In particular the risk of brain injury from vaccines is much higher than commonly believed Brain injury can be devastating to the life of a child and the child s family The personal and financial costs of vaccine injury are often enormous Therefore even a small risk of brain injury must be considered seriously And the science strongly suggests that the risk is not small Aluminum adjuvant the data

began the story with the discovery that he said ties together the research on vaccines and autism a 2018 paper by Christopher Exley Ph D and colleagues showing shockingly high levels of aluminum in 10 autism brain specimens According to Exley the location of the aluminum suggested it was entering the brain through pro inflammatory cells that had become loaded with the neurotoxin Exley s finding is similar to previous research showing what happens with monocytes a type of white blood cell at vaccine injection sites This is significant Handley wrote because it would become clear that macrophages a type of monocyte were moving aluminum from the injection site to the brain Exley s study provided the only data missing from an airtight explanation of what happened to the countless families whose children developed autism following vaccination according to Handley Aluminum adjuvant is an additive that serves to wake up the immune system so it recognizes the antigen for whatever the vaccine is meant to protect against he explained The amount of aluminum children are exposed to has skyrocketed since the 1990s according to a 2016 study because vaccination rates for all children rose substantially and more vaccines were added to the childhood schedule A child in the mid 1980s would have received 1 250 micrograms of aluminum from their vaccines by their 18 month birthday if they were fully vaccinated he wrote Today that number is 4 925 micrograms a near quadrupling of total aluminum Yet aluminum has never been tested for safety in vaccines for babies It is a demonstrated neurotoxin that carries a risk for autoimmunity according to Canadian scientists Chris Shaw Ph D and Lucija Tomljenovic Ph D Canadian scientists Aluminum is the most common vaccine adjuvant even though the mechanisms through which it works as an adjuvant remain unknown Despite the lack of data on its toxicology the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted Shaw and Tomljenovic wrote Even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and National Institutes of Health NIH have admitted they have no data to show repeated injections with an aluminum

volume of scientific literature shows that those repeated injections are unsafe The literature shows that five clear replicable and related discoveries explaining how autism is triggered have formed an undeniably clear picture of autism s causation Handley wrote Five key discoveries 1 There is a permanent immune system activation in the brains of people with autism Research by the late Caltech scientist Dr Paul Patterson author of Pregnancy Immunity Schizophrenia and Autism demonstrated that the immune system interacts with the brain in ways that can affect neurodevelopment Patterson and colleagues found that if a pregnant mother s immune system is subject to high activation for example from severe viral or bacterial infection during pregnancy it can affect her child s neurodevelopment leading to neurological problems later Patterson noted that the brains of people with autism show that such immune system activation occurred citing doctors at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who found neural inflammation in a postmortem examination of the brains of patients with autism That finding has since been replicated several times Handly wrote including by researchers in Japan Patterson and his colleagues hypothesized that chronic neural inflammation resulted from cytokines produced by white blood cells at higher rates when an infection is present that interact with the fetal brain Specifically one cytokine IL 6 has a particularly powerful effect they argued They triggered this neural inflammation in an experiment that involved injecting mice with IL 6 and saw changes in the neurology of the mice s offspring They later also linked maternal immune activation specifically to autism symptoms in mice and in monkeys Other scientists replicated their studies In 2006 Patterson connected maternal vaccination to possible immune activation He said current research begged the question Should we really be promoting universal maternal vaccination 2 Aluminum adjuvant is highly neurotoxic and causes immune activation The U S Food and Drug Administration and CDC base their recommendations for aluminum use in vaccines on a 2011 study that concluded aluminum accumulates in the skeletal system rather than soft tissue and is safe However Handley wrote that the guess work on aluminum is based on studies of dissolved aluminum not of the aluminum hydroxide used in vaccines More recent research has shown aluminum hydroxide is a nanoparticle that is absorbed by the body s macrophage which can easily transport it to the brain A 2007 paper by Shaw demonstrated a link between aluminum adjuvant and motor neuron death Shaw and colleagues published several papers showing that aluminum hydroxide is neurotoxic particularly in pediatric populations They called for an urgent reevaluation of the safety profile of vaccines containing aluminum adjuvant", "chunk_id":

of the safety profile of vaccines containing aluminum adjuvant Several studies in France also showed that the aluminum adjuvant injected into the body often ends up in the brain causing neurotoxicity A 2017 French study published in Toxicology found the adjuvant had long lasting biopersistence meaning the body couldn t get rid of it and was linked to several illnesses including chronic fatigue syndrome cognitive dysfunction myalgia dysautonomia and autoimmune inflammatory features The authors of the French study also found that low consistent doses were more neurotoxic than a single high dose and raised concerns that the massive development of vaccine based strategies worldwide requires a safety reevaluation of the adjuvant 3 The immune activation that triggers autism can happen in utero or after a child is born while its brain is still developing Researchers from the Middle East and Europe who used aluminum to induce Alzheimer s in live rats showed that aluminum caused a four fold increase in IL 6 and also increased other cytokines While researchers may accept that there is disorganization in the brains of people with autism there is disagreement about whether that disorganization happens in utero or after birth Many who refuse the autism vaccine hypothesis like Dr Peter Hotez deny that postnatal brain reorganization is possible However evidence for post natal triggers of autism is strong Handley wrote He quoted Vaccine Papers to explain that every immune activation event in a susceptible child renders the immune system more sensitive and reactive to immune stimuli This can happen both in utero and postnatally while a child s brain is in key developmental stages Studies have shown that mice injected with IL 6 after birth later display impaired cognitive abilities And case studies among children have shown autism onset following infection and inflammation of the brain 4 Hepatitis B vaccine induced IL 6 in postnatal rats Researchers in China tested the effects of vaccine induced immune activation on brain development in rats The hepatitis B vaccine which had an aluminum adjuvant increased IL 6 in the hippocampus Significantly the effects didn t appear until the rats were 8 weeks old when rats are almost fully adults Most vaccine safety studies look at shorter term outcomes According to Handley that could help explain the appearance of mental

aluminum adjuvants may also induce other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions including gastrointestinal issues experienced by many children with autism Also many families of children with autism saw their children regress after the MMR vaccine which doesn t contain an aluminum adjuvant More research is needed to fully explain why that could happen Handley wrote But research indicates that the effects of the MMR may be related to the fact that it is the first live vaccine children receive around age 12 18 months after they have had many vaccines that do contain aluminum adjuvants An immune system bathed in aluminum adjuvant and possibly already simmering with activation events might be pushed over the edge by encountering the live virus It may even trigger aluminum in the body to move

Charges A report released yesterday by the U S House of Representatives Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic raises questions over whether Peter Daszak and other scientists could face criminal charges stemming from the COVID 19 tragedy You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Emily Kopp A sprawling final report by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic provokes questions over whether some in the scientific community including EcoHealth Alliance the American nonprofit that collaborated on novel coronavirus discovery and engineering research with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and its president Peter Daszak could face criminal charges stemming from the COVID 19 tragedy The report s findings the culmination of two years of work by congressional investigators the review of more than one million documents and dozens of transcribed interviews and public hearings include evidence that Daszak misled the committee on questions central to the COVID 19 origins mystery Daszak exported gain of function coronavirus experiments to China shirked his duty to probe his Wuhan colleagues for lab notebooks viral samples and genomic data and helped to falsely persuade millions that the idea of a Wuhan lab leak was a conspiracy theory the committee s investigation shows Daszak did not immediately respond to a request for comment In May the committee s investigation helped spur the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS to initiate debarment proceedings against EcoHealth and Daszak The debarment process is not yet finished but could result in EcoHealth and Daszak being ineligible for federal funding for a period of years However the new revelations spur the possibility of criminal charges related to the COVID 19 pandemic as well namely making false statements or perjury Among the report s most striking revelations the U S Department of Justice DOJ empaneled a criminal grand jury to investigate potential federal crimes related to the origins of COVID 19 The status of this grand jury investigation is not public Though the DOJ dragnet ensnared EcoHealth neither the nonprofit nor Daszak are the target of the DOJ investigation EcoHealth s attorney told the committee A February 2023 email indicates that EcoHealth stayed mum on numerous non public investigations The only thought is whether to skip for the time being reference to our other government inquiries the email reads Especially on the Executive Branch front where the DOJ grand jury investigation seems so far to remain nonpublic I think it

misled the committee Daszak agreed to testify truthfully in a November 2023 transcribed interview and under oath at a May congressional hearing but made multiple misstatements the report shows Claim Daszak Well there was a little bit said about DARPA declining to fund this including people who have said that they declined it because of biosecurity concerns Absolutely not true Fact check An EcoHealth research grant proposal dubbed DEFUSE pitched generating novel severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS related viruses with a uniquely infectious feature called a furin cleavage site at a critical juncture on the spike protein called the S1 S2 boundary SARS CoV 2 the virus that causes COVID 19 is the only SARS related coronavirus with a furin cleavage site which is situated at the S1 S2 boundary generating questions about whether the intellectual property in the proposal laid the groundwork for the COVID 19 pandemic The sought after funder for DEFUSE the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA rejected the proposal in 2018 Daszak insisted for years that the project was rejected because of just a little miff around resource limitations and not because of the steep risks

However DARPA Program Manager Jim Gimlett who made the final call to deny funding for DEFUSE directly contradicted Daszak s claim Gimlet told the committee the rejection stemmed from a lack of due care for rules governing pandemic potential pathogens The research team didn t address or basically just denied that they had to address gain of function because it didn t fall under any of the regulatory requirements he said The EcoHealth led research team has denied that its coronavirus work qualified for more rigorous review under gain of function rules in part because it worked with bat coronaviruses related to SARS rather than SARS or other viruses known to infect humans Even if it s a bat virus it could have risks Gimlett said refuting that idea These concerns were formally communicated to Daszak in a letter which was leaked in 2021 and confirmed to be authentic by Gimlett The proposal is considered to potentially involve gain of function dual use research of concern research because they propose to synthesize spike glycoproteins which bind to human cell receptors and insert them into SARSr CoV backbones to assess whether they can cause SARS like disease the letter reads Claim Daszak We were locked out of the system Fact check Daszak submitted a progress report on the NIAID grant that underwrote his research collaboration on novel bat coronaviruses with the Wuhan Institute of Virology the report describing the period from June 2018 through May 2019 nearly two years late in August 2021 when an enormous incentive existed not to report experiments that could reflect poorly on EcoHealth or the WIV When pressed on the delay Daszak claimed it was due to technical difficulties We were locked out of the system Daszak said in a transcribed interview However an internal National Institutes of Health NIH forensic audit made public for the first time in the congressional report shows that Daszak accessed the eRA system used to submit reports 72 days

the House Select Subcommittee Fauci doubled down on his original claim Did the National Institutes of Health fund the potentially dangerous enhanced pandemic potential pathogen gain of function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology Rep Debbie Lesko R Ariz asked I m saying no because I ve said no multiple times Fauci responded tersely By contrast several experts confirmed to the committee that the coronavirus experiments under scrutiny met the definition of gain of function research Although the definition of gain of function research was removed from the NIAID website it was described as recently as 2021 as a type of research that modifies a biological agent so that it confers a new or enhanced activity to that agent Both the acting director of the NIH Lawrence Tabak and coronavirologist Ralph Baric the architect of many of the coronavirus experiments under dispute confirmed the work qualified as gain of function research Is it a gain of function phenotype Absolutely You can t argue with that Baric said Dr Fauci s testimony was at a minimum misleading the report reads Witness testimony and a plain reading of EcoHealth s research conducted at the WIV using U S

the NIH central headquarters which suspended EcoHealth s NIAID grant and asked Daszak to supply data that could exculpate the Wuhan lab from suspicions an accident caused the pandemic Daszak was aided by Fauci s former institute NIAID which surged new funding to EcoHealth amid the controversy weakening Daszak s incentive to turn over documents An email made available by the committee for the first time shows that Daszak in fact never asked Shi for critical data in compliance with the NIH s investigation Instead he simply forwarded a letter sent to EcoHealth from NIH Daszak has blamed his inaction on extremely strained communications with Wuhan colleagues due to Trump s posture towards Beijing and the U S government s decision to debar the lab But new emails show that he has maintained a friendly correspondence with Wuhan Institute of Virology Senior Scientist Zhengli Shi Paradoxically while flouting requests for information about the research in Wuhan from NIH Daszak allegedly stressed to his funders at NIAID that it was important for a suspended grant to be reinstated in order to obtain viral samples from Wuhan according to the report When push came to shove Daszak told congressional investigators that the samples were likely to remain in the Wuhan lab s freezers and denied ever promising the U S government access to them Far from pressing his Wuhan colleagues for

final authorizations were granted it was found that the COVID 19 injectable products were neither safe nor effective she added According to McCollough mRNA should never have been authorized for human use Lead author Mead told The Defender Our view is that any risk benefit analysis must consider how much the presumed benefit in terms of reduced COVID 19 related mortality is offset by the potential increase in vaccine induced mortality Here are six takeaways from the review 1 The COVID 19 vaccines are reclassified gene therapies that were rushed through the regulatory process in a historically unprecedented manner Before the seven month authorization process for the mRNA vaccines no vaccine had ever gone to market without undergoing testing of at least four years with typical timelines averaging 10 years To speed the process the companies skipped preclinical studies of potential toxicity from multiple doses and cut the typical 6 12 month observation period for identifying longer term adverse effects and the established 10 15 year period for monitoring for long term effects such as cancer and autoimmune disorders the authors wrote The trials prioritized documenting effective symptom reduction over SAE and mortality This was particularly concerning the authors argued because mRNA products are gene therapy products reclassified as vaccines and then given EUA for the first time ever for use against a viral disease However the gene therapies components have not been thoroughly evaluated for safety for use as vaccines There is an uninvestigated and major concern that the mRNA could transform body cells into viral protein factories with no off switch that produce the spike protein for a prolonged period causing chronic systemic inflammation and immune dysfunction The spike protein in the vaccine the authors said is associated with more severe immunopathology and other AEs than the spike protein in the virus itself The authors suggested that massive government investment in mRNA technology including hundreds of millions before the pandemic and tens of billions once it began meant U S federal agencies were strongly biased toward successful outcomes for the registrational trials The financial incentives along with political pressures to deliver a rapid solution likely influenced a series of flawed decisions that compromised the integrity of the trials

trials were designed to assess whether the mRNA vaccine reduced symptoms they did not measure whether the vaccines prevented severe disease and death Yet the vaccine makers repeatedly claimed that they do No large randomized double blind placebo controlled trials have ever demonstrated reductions in SARS CoV 2 transmission hospitalization or death the authors wrote Additionally the number of people who contracted clinical COVID 19 in both the placebo and intervention groups was too small to draw meaningful pragmatic or broad sweeping conclusions with regard to COVID 19 morbidity and mortality Pfizer s 95 efficacy claims were based on 162 of 22 000 placebo recipients contracting PCR confirmed COVID 19 compared to eight of 22 000 in the vaccine group None of the placebo recipients died from COVID 19 In the Moderna trials only one placebo death was attributed to COVID 19 There was also a much larger percentage of suspected COVID 19 cases in both groups with participants showing COVID 19 symptoms but a negative PCR test When factoring in those cases measures of vaccine efficacy drop to about 19 The trial subject pool was comprised of largely young and healthy individuals excluding key groups children pregnant women elderly and immunocompromised people which can also obscure the vaccine s actual efficacy and safety Findings from reanalyses of data from the Pfizer trials can be interpreted as showing the vaccines made no significant difference in reducing all cause mortality in the vaccinated versus unvaccinated groups at 20 weeks into the trial the authors wrote Even the six month post marketing data Pfizer presented to the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA showed no reduction in all cause mortality from the vaccine The authors reanalyzed that data

approximately 95 risk reduction figure as their efficacy figure the absolute risk reductions for Pfizer and Moderna s vaccines were 0 7 and 1 1 respectively A substantial number of individuals would need to be injected in order to prevent a single mild to moderate case of COVID 19 the authors wrote As an example using a conservative estimate that 119 people would need to be vaccinated to prevent infection and assuming that COVID 19 had a 0 23 infection fatality rate they wrote that approximately 52 000 vaccinations would be necessary to prevent a single COVID 19 related death However Given trial misconduct and data integrity problems the true benefit is likely to be much lower they wrote And they added one would need to assess that benefit along with harms which they estimate to be 27 deaths per 100 000 doses of Pfizer That means using the most conservative estimates for every life saved there were 14 times more deaths caused by the modified mRNA injections They also noted that post rollout evidence confirmed the efficacy claims were overstated For example two large cohort Cleveland clinic studies showed the vaccine could not confer protection against COVID 19 instead in those trials more vaccinated people were more likely to contract COVID 19 One study showed the risk of breakthrough infection was significantly higher among people who were boosted and that more vaccinations resulted in a greater risk of COVID 19 A second study showed adults who were not up to date with their shots had a 23 lower incidence of COVID 19 than their up to date colleagues 3 The trials underestimated the adverse events including death despite evidence in the data Harms were also underreported and underestimated for a number of reasons according to the authors a practice that

is only approximately 17 of the actual projected number due to missing data And after that the rate of deaths continued to increase Michaels et al found Pfizer failed to report a substantial increase in the number of deaths due to cardiovascular events They also found a consistent pattern of reporting delays on the date of the death on subjects case reports Overall the review authors reported that there were twice as many cardiac deaths proportionately among vaccinated compared to unvaccinated subjects in the Pfizer trials In their discussion the authors wrote Based on the extended Pfizer trial

SAEs in the trials and post rollout reporting are well documented despite claims to the contrary Both Pfizer and Moderna found about 125 SAEs per 100 000 vaccine recipients or one SAE for every 800 vaccines However because the trials excluded more vulnerable people the authors note even higher proportions of SAEs would be expected in the general population The Fraiman et al reanalysis of the Pfizer trial data found a significant 36 higher risk of SAEs which included deaths and many life threatening conditions in the vaccinated participants Official SAEs for other vaccines average around only 1 2 per million Fraiman et alestimated 1 250 SEAs per million vaccines exceeding that benchmark by at least 600 fold After the vaccine rollout analyses of two large drug safety reporting systems in the U S and Europe identified signals for myocardial infarction pulmonary embolism cardio respiratory arrest cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage associated with both mRNA vaccines along with ischemic stroke And millions of AEs have been reported to those systems Another study by Skidmore et al estimated the total number of fatalities from the vaccines in 2021 alone was 289 789

contamination linked to different rates of AEs Recent findings by McKernan et al that found Pfizers mRNA vaccines are contaminated with plasmid DNA that shouldn t be present and wasn t present in the vaccines used in the trials raising serious safety issues That s because Process 1 used in the trials to generate the vaccines involved in vitro transcription of synthetic DNA essentially a clean process However that process isn t viable for mass production so the manufacturers used Process 2 which involves using E coli bacteria to replicate the plasmids Removing plasmids E coli can result in residual plasmids in the vaccines and the effects of their presence is unknown McKernan s work also revealed the presence of DNA from simian virus 40 SV40 an oncogenic DNA virus originally isolated in 1960 from contaminated polio vaccines induces lymphomas brain tumors and other malignancies in laboratory animals raising other safety concerns Researchers from Cambridge published a paper in Nature in December 2023 where they found an inherent defect in the modified RNA instructions for the spike protein in COVID 19 immunizations that causes the machinery that translates the gene to the spike protein to slip about 10 of the time This process creates frameshifts that cause cells to produce off target proteins in addition to the spike These proteins which developers either failed to look for or did not report to regulators cause undesirable immune responses whose long term effects are unknown 6 There are many different possible biological mechanisms that cause AEs and vaccine ineffectiveness The review points readers to a series of papers that explain a number of different theories to explain the high number of AEs from the COVID 19 mRNA vaccines The mechanisms of

of the origin of COVID 19 doubles down on the theory with the authors claiming to have pinpointed the specific section of the Wuhan China market where they say the virus jumped from animals to humans Leading virologists and scholars have already criticized the paper which NPR described as controversial Twenty one researchers signed a letter to the editors of Cell asking them to issue an editorial expression of concern for the paper and launch an investigation that could lead to the paper s retraction The authors themselves in an interview with NPR conceded the paper doesn t prove by any means that there were infected animals at the market even if the authors believe it is the most likely hypothesis Published in the journal Cell the paper presents the results of what CNN called an in depth analysis of the genetic material from hundreds of swabs taken from the walls floors machines and drains inside the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan which the paper calls an early epicenter of COVID 19 s spread According to NPR the new study shows with unprecedented granularity down to the individual market stall that coronavirus susceptible wildlife and the SARS CoV 2 virus were mingling along with human beings in a very specific part of the Wuhan market CNN reported that while the study doesn t prove that the animals were infected by the virus their DNA was found very near the virus sometimes on the same swab That means it s a strong possibility the animals were infected at the market Animals known to be susceptible to Covid 19 infections such as raccoon dogs and rabbits were present at the market CNN reported The study claims the virus was present at the market between mid November and mid December 2019 at the same time as the virus from the larger pandemic Michael

paper early in the pandemic to support the zoonotic theory of COVID 19 s emergence However a congressional report released in July 2023 found that Dr Anthony Fauci then director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and Dr Francis Collins then director of the National Institutes of Health NIH exerted extensive influence on the paper its flawed analysis and its conclusions According to the report the Proximal Origin paper was used to downplay the lab leak hypothesis and label as conspiracy theorists anyone who suggested the virus may have leaked from a lab

Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 which established a government compensation program for people injured by vaccines while granting legal immunity to vaccine makers Since 1986 the only recourse parents have had if their child was injured is to file a claim through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP a bureaucratic labyrinth that rejects nearly half of all claims Blumenthal ranking

I am overjoyed by the confirmation of Robert F Kennedy Jr as our new secretary of Health and Human Services I am grateful to President Donald Trump for supporting him and for establishing a Make America Healthy Again MAHA commission to address the root causes of America s escalating health crisis The MAHA commission will focus initially on the rise in childhood chronic diseases including the dramatic increase in autism prevalence which has climbed from 1 in 10 000 during Trump and Kennedy s childhood to 1 in 36 today This latter statistic is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring ADDM network published in 2023 which reported on 8 year olds born in 2012 The rise in autism is not happening in a vacuum but rather in the context of increasing childhood rates of many other autoimmune and hyperreactive immune system disorders including asthma severe food allergies attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD diabetes and pre diabetes However more than any other condition autism has captured parents attention and it was the issue that drew Kennedy to his work on children s health in the early 2000s Despite my gratitude for the new federal commitment to addressing childhood chronic disease I can t help but wonder if the professed MAHA goal of seeing results within two years is feasible at least with respect to autism given that the median age of diagnosis is 4 years old I would like to suggest that U S Department of Education Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA data specifically for 3 to 5 year olds can provide a useful metric of progress in a relatively short time albeit more realistically in three to four years than in two years These data are published annually within one year

rise in autism The report presents devastating results yet manages to fill eight pages of text without ever addressing the key question Why is this happening A new CDC ADDM report is due out this spring on 8 year olds born in 2014 If the IDEA data are any guide the ADDM report will show an ongoing rise in autism with increasing disparities by race ethnicity With Kennedy now at the helm we can hope for a more meaningful analysis of why these trends are occurring A priority for this analysis should be to explain why autism prevalence among Black and Hispanic children has gone in a relatively short time from lagging white prevalence to substantially exceeding it Understanding that trend can help advance our understanding of the root causes of the neuroinflammation that leads to autism and offer valuable insight into how we can reduce children s risk going forward Note the IDEA data include 3 to 5 year old children in early education programs but exclude 5 year olds in kindergarten

Greatly Increases Risk of Apnea Hospitalized preterm infants had a 170 higher incidence of apnea within 48 hours of receiving their routine 2 month vaccinations compared to unvaccinated babies according to a new study The authors said the study supports current vaccine recommendations but some scientists disagreed and raised concerns about SIDS You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Hospitalized preterm infants had a 170 higher incidence of apnea within 48 hours of receiving their routine 2 month vaccinations compared to unvaccinated babies according to the data in a new study The study published Jan 6 in JAMA Pediatrics defined apnea as a respiration pause greater than 20 seconds or a respiration pause greater than 15 seconds with associated bradycardia or low heart rate of less than 80 beats per minute Noting that preterm infants receive their routine vaccinations at the same time as full term infants the study sought to determine whether routine 2 month vaccinations resulted in an increased risk of apnea The authors concluded The similar number and duration of apneic events and lack of serious adverse events suggest that current vaccination recommendations for hospitalized preterm infants are appropriate However Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist at Children s Health Defense said the authors arrived at their conclusion by ignoring the risks evident in their own data A premature infant experiencing apnea will likely have a longer neonatal intensive care unit stay further exposing them to hospital acquired infection Jablonowski said This is on top of the other risk factors for apnea like death respiratory failure long term lung problems and failure to thrive In a Substack post cardiologist Dr Peter McCullough suggested that it is conceivable that with seven vaccines at age 2 months and 16 vaccines at 12 15 months combination vaccination could be associated with significant unmonitored apneas febrile seizures or both resulting in sudden infant death syndrome SIDS at home Biologist Christina Parks Ph D an expert in how vaccines affect the immune system told The Defender the study confirms what previous studies on premature infants have shown that vaccination induces cardiorespiratory stress that manifests as the slowing of heart rate bradycardia and respiration as well as the cessation of breathing apnea for brief periods of time Parks said the fact that the known risks have not been implicated as potential causes of SIDS is inexcusable at this point Study suggests one size fits all approach to vaccination not appropriate for preterm infants Research scientist and author James Lyons Weiler Ph D told The Defender the study is a wake up call that highlights how routine vaccinations

approach to vaccination may not be appropriate for such a vulnerable population Lyons Weiler said It underscores the need to consider individual physiological differences especially in those with underdeveloped systems and tailor vaccination practices accordingly Lyons Weiler said the study s authors appear to prioritize the broader public health benefits of vaccination over the individual risks demonstrated in the study He said They assume that the short term apnea risks are outweighed by the long term protection against infectious diseases However this conclusion overlooks critical questions about long term outcomes for these infants particularly if apnea episodes have lingering neurological consequences They did not however really think this through What is a pre term infant s life worth Parks noted that the study did not present an analysis of what the potential causes of the increased incidence of apnea in vaccinated infants might be The complete lack of interest in the mechanisms by which vaccination is increasing cardiorespiratory distress in infants is also somewhat shocking Jablonowski noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s childhood immunization schedule has expanded since the study was conducted from 2018 to 2021 Had this study been performed today with the rapidly expanding CDC immunization schedule the infants would have

particularly in babies and young children Preterm infants already have underdeveloped immune and neurological systems and the cumulative aluminum burden from multiple vaccines could exacerbate risks like apnea he said This study suggests that combination vaccination in such populations needs to be carefully reevaluated He also noted that some vaccines routinely administered to infants contain aluminum He analyzed the potential risks of administering such vaccines to babies on his Substack Aluminum adjuvants are known to trigger immune activation and inflammation which could impact respiratory and neurological stability in preterm infants Lyons Weiler said Unfortunately the study did not explore specific mechanisms such as aluminum adjuvants that might explain the observed increase in apnea This is a significant oversight Aluminum salts are potent immune activators and could trigger systemic inflammation disrupting respiratory control Lyons Weiler said He said infant

human consumption in what The Guardian described as a move that paves the way for plates to become wrigglier leggier and more sustainable and as a sign of things to come In a July 8 announcement the Singapore Food Agency SFA approved the 16 insects which include silkworm pupa and mealworm With immediate effect These insects and insect products can be used for human consumption or as animal feed for food producing animals the SFA stated Countries and entities such as the United Kingdom U K Australia and the European Union EU have already approved some insects for human consumption However in the U S existing regulations contain few references specifically addressing insects This regulatory gap has enabled an ecosystem of alternative protein startups to enter the insect food market with the backing of figures such as Bill Gates and government agencies including the United Nations U N and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA and the National Science Foundation The United Nations Food And Agricultural Organisation FAO continues to promote insect consumption as an environmentally friendly way to get protein in your diet for both humans and their livestock The Guardian reported Proponents of insects as food for humans including the FAO argue this will help combat climate change as insects produce a smaller carbon footprint than traditional livestock But critics challenge this view The justification for insects is to produce protein using fewer inputs to save the planet by reducing climate change methane from cows less pollution internist Dr Meryl

The Defender While that is true malnutrition and disease were also endemic and life expectancies were dramatically lower than they are today The truth is that beef pork poultry and other animal based foods are the most efficient and healthy sources of protein These climate fanatics pushing insect based foods are scaring people into adopting less healthy diets Dutch journalist Elze van Hamelen told The Defender that using insect ingredients for pet food also poses a risk to public health citing a 2019 study that found parasites in 244 of 300 insect farms and pet stores that were investigated Feeding pets with parasite infested insects especially pets that do not have the physiology to digest bugs may not be such a good idea van Hamelen said Michael Rectenwald Ph D author of The Great Reset and the Struggle for Liberty Unraveling the Global Agenda told The Defender The insect craze is intimately connected to the U N s Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals SDGs Rectenwald cited two SDGs SDG 2 End hunger achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture and SDG 12 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Sustainability is code language for coerced reductions in consumption and forced behavioral modifications Rectenwald said Nass said the U N along with the World Economic Forum WEF promote the so called SDGs which can supposedly be met if we change our diet Yet We don t see the WEF or U N attendees eating insects at their meetings Nass suggested that one reason behind the shift to insects as food is to cause

On March 4 2020 the FDA required Singulair to carry a black box label the FDA s most serious warning for serious mental health side effects according to Drugwatch Black box warnings list important side effect information surrounded by a thick black border and bold lettering to warn of permanent serious or fatal side effects In the case of Singulair the label links the drug to suicide depression aggression agitation suicidal thoughts and sleep disturbances The black box label was at least two decades in coming according to Hazlehurst who said it took over a decade s worth of work by persistent parents armed with overwhelming evidence of the serious neuropsychiatric side effects urging the FDA to take action According to Drugwatch lawsuits now pending against Merck claim the

to Drugwatch lawsuits now pending against Merck claim the drugmaker knew or should have known before it started selling Singulair in 1998 that the drug could cause neuropsychiatric injuries during treatment and even after stopping Dr Liz Mumper a pediatrician said she has been aware of the potential neuropsychiatric side effects of montelukast for many years adding that her patients are instructed to stop the medicine if they notice a change in their mental health Over the years parents have reported personality changes in their children rapid changes in mood and irritability Mumper told The Defender Typically these symptoms resolve once off montelukast Since March 2020 when the FDA applied the black box warning to Singulair numerous lawsuits have been filed against Merck The lawsuits allege Merck designed a defective drug in addition to claiming negligence and failure to warn about the risk of mental problems according to Drugwatch A Reuters investigative report revealed the lawsuits also allege that the company s own early research indicated the drug could impact the brain but that Merck downplayed any risks in statements to regulators The Reuters investigation states that plaintiffs faced a legal hurdle commonly used by Big Pharma known as a preemption defense based on a legal argument that federal law and federal regulations supersede state laws including state product liability laws that traditionally served as the basis for lawsuits like those against Merck As a result companies increasingly argue that federally regulated products or services should be immune from lawsuits alleging state law violations and plaintiffs must often demonstrate that a company failed to disclose safety information to federal regulators and that the information could have spurred new government restrictions or warnings before the alleged harm occurred This has made it particularly difficult to sue manufacturers of generic versions of Singulair and other drugs because generic drugmakers simply follow the primary manufacturer s FDA approved labeling while the primary drugmaker can t be sued by claimants if they or their family members took the generic version Perro told The Defender that a combination of an abrogation on the part of federal regulators a lack of integrity on the part of drugmakers and complex legal maneuvering makes it difficult for doctors to prescribe safe treatments to their patients She said A medical practitioner now needs to understand their patient the illness any prescribed medications what Pharma reports about their drug

prescribed the medicine climbed from about 7 million annually to more than 9 million with up to half of recipients age 16 or younger At least 82 suicides connected to Singular before FDA added black box warning The Reuters investigation noted that in the case of Singulair s potentially deadly side effects the FDA waited years despite thousands of reported psychiatric problems to require its most serious warning on the drug s label During this time dozens of individuals taking Singulair committed suicide or faced other neuropsychiatric problems For instance in 2017 22 year old Nicholas England a Virginia resident shot himself in the head less than two weeks after starting a generic version of the medication He had no history of mental health problems and his family had no legal recourse against Merck due to the preemption defense In 2007 a 15 year old boy in New York committed suicide 17 days after first taking Singulair According to Reuters this incident led Merck to propose and the FDA to accept an amendment to the drug s label to add suicidal thinking and behavior to the product s listed adverse events However this adverse event appeared in the middle of a list of more than three dozen side effects the Reuters investigation found Parent advocates argue the new label was grossly inadequate to warn of such a grave risk Neuropsychiatric side effects are listed in the

withdrawn and sullen and started talking about death according to Reuters Gilpin initially did not suspect Singulair until she discovered online posts by parents stating that their children were exhibiting similar behavior while on this medication She pulled her son off Singular and soon noticed he began to skip and laugh while his obsessive thoughts about death disappeared after he quit the medicine Indeed reports of related neuropsychiatric episodes piled up on internet forums and in the FDA s early warning detection system starting in 1998 Reuters reported Yet by the time of England s suicide in 2017 the FDA was still reviewing this data According to Reuters in 2011 the FDA rejected a petition from Gilpin and other parents seeking a black box warning citing what it called insufficient evidence that the drug caused suicidal behavior Parents who argue Singulair endangered their children view the FDA s 2020 decision to add a black box warning as vindication but many still want to sue Merck for not acting sooner Reuters also reported In 2014 an FDA panel acknowledged that neuropsychiatric side effects among Singulair users were a known safety issue but cited this reason and feasibility concerns in its decision not to order new studies according to Reuters Yet as reports of suicides continued to be filed with 82 suicides linked to Singulair and its generic versions

Merck had claimed in documents it submitted to FDA for the drug s approval in 1998 that only a trace amount of the drug could be found in the brain and that its presence declined over time Merck s public marketing of the product later described side effects as generally mild and similar to a sugar pill However Marschallinger s team found that while Singulair s presence decreased almost everywhere in the body within 24 hours after administration the opposite was true in the brain where a substantial amount of the drug was identified In its 1996 patent application for Singulair Merck also claimed the drug could be used as a treatment for cerebral spasms indicating knowledge of the drug s potential brain impacts Lawyers for plaintiffs filing Singulair lawsuits against Merck have cited this argument as well as Marschallinger s study The FDA has confirmed the study s findings acknowledging that claims regarding the declining presence of Singulair in all tissues did not fully

The committee s new chair Martin Kulldorff Ph D said in his opening remarks The number of vaccines that our children and adolescents receive today exceeds what children in most other developed nations receive and what most of us in this room received when we were children In addition to studying and evaluating individual vaccines it is important to evaluate the cumulative effect of the recommended vaccine schedule This includes interaction effects between different vaccines the total number of vaccines cumulative amounts of vaccine ingredients and relative timing of different vaccines Kulldorff cited a 2013 National Academy of Medicine report that called for more research on this topic It is now time to evaluate that new research he said during the June 25 committee meeting The committee s announcement triggered a cascade of criticism from mainstream news organizations and groups like the American Academy of Family Physicians American Academy of Pediatrics American College of Physicians and the Infectious Diseases Society of America But according to CHD CEO Mary Holland the latest poll numbers show mainstream media are out of touch with the public s concerns about the schedule She

Sign Up By Natasha Gilbert Slaughterhouses and meat and poultry processing plants are among the nation s most polluting industries They butcher and prepare around 10 billion animals each year And use large volumes of water to clean carcasses machinery work surfaces and floors The wastewater contains blood and other body residues and is contaminated with the most phosphorus and the second highest levels of nitrogen of all industries found the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA By the end of August the EPA has plans to announce new limits on these and other pesky pollutants in wastewater from processing plants that can cause harmful algae blooms kill swaths of fish and expose local communities to bacteria that cause gastrointestinal illness It would be the first time the EPA has updated its wastewater pollution controls for processing facilities in around 20 years The move is a big win for environmental groups who sued the EPA for failing to update the pollution rules In May 2023 the agency and the environmental groups reached a legally binding agreement that obliges the agency to finalize new pollution standards by August 31 There is an enormous volume of waste going straight into waterways and contaminating drinking water It s desperately overdue for regulation says Delcianna Winders director of the Animal Law and Policy Institute at Vermont Law and Graduate School The EPA is currently considering comments from industry advocacy groups and others to help shape the rules Meat and poultry companies such as Tyson and Cargill and industry lobby groups are fighting the regulation In a public submission to the EPA the Meat and Poultry Coalition a lobby group that includes the National Pork Producers Council argues that the new rules will be too expensive to implement and will kill tens of thousands of jobs Industry s objections may find support in the new Trump administration which has fired hundreds of EPA employees and vowed to roll back environmental regulations echoing actions to weaken environmental regulations taken in President Donald Trump s first term legal experts warn Alexis Andiman a senior attorney at Earthjustice an

Also Congress may also move forward with legislation that makes it difficult for the EPA to act For example Congressmen Ron Estes R Kan and Eric Burlison R Mo introduced a bill into the House last month that seeks to stop the EPA from finalizing and implementing the meat and poultry plant pollution limits It s clear EPA has an obligation to revise the rules and publish pretreatment standards But It s hard to say what they will do says Andiman Huge volumes of nutrient pollution Today around 5 055 meat and poultry facilities are operating in the U S The new rules would likely apply to around 17 of these up from around 3 that are currently covered Most facilities send wastewater to publicly owned treatment works where it is filtered and cleaned to remove contaminants like oil and grease and solid floating particles depending on local rules But in an analysis the EPA found that around 171 facilities discharge wastewater directly into wetlands rivers and streams These include a plant owned by pork giant Smithfield Foods in Tarheel North Carolina and a facility owned by John Morrell and Company in Sioux Falls South Dakota These types of facilities must obtain permits under the Clean Water Act a federal law that regulates water pollution The permits restrict nutrients like nitrogen which cause algae blooms and are linked to certain cancers and other contaminants like oil and grease and solid floating particles Nonetheless most of the water bodies receiving wastewater from these facilities are not in good shape they are plagued with algal growth excess nutrients and depleted oxygen the EPA found Part of the problem is that some facilities release very high levels of pollution In an analysis of the worst offenders the Environmental Integrity Project found that John Morrell and Company s Sioux Falls plant released 866 874 pounds of nitrogen pollution between 2022 and 2023 the most out of all the facilities The Smithfield plant in Tarheel came in second with 773 553 pounds of nitrogen over the same time frame These volumes are over six times the average annual nitrogen released by meat and poultry facilities Chris Jones an expert in water quality and

author of The Swine Republic an exposé of the science and politics of agriculture and water pollution in the state of Iowa Pollution at these levels can devastate the environment and human health In 2015 a slaughterhouse in Beardstown Illinois owned at the time by Cargill Meat Solutions spilled 29 million gallons of hog waste into ditches and waterways The pollution ended up in the Muscooten Bay and other local waterways killing 64 000 fish The slaughterhouse now owned by JBS was charged 150 000 in fines for unpermitted discharges and agreed to pay an additional 34 000 to a local conservation

water used for drinking with harmful bacteria and unsafe levels of nitrates The contamination was linked to gastrointestinal illnesses suffered by residents New rules to limit pollution The new rules that the EPA expects to finalize later this year would tighten limits on nitrogen from large processing facilities that directly discharge into water bodies For example the new rules would require John Morrell s Sioux Falls plant to cut its nitrogen by 92 and Smithfield s Tarheel plant by 88 the Environmental Integrity Project calculated The new rules would also restrict phosphorus in wastewater for the first time Phosphorus is another nutrient that causes algae blooms In addition the EPA will set some restrictions on the thousands of meat and poultry facilities that discharge wastewater to publicly owned treatment plants These facilities are currently unchecked by any national restrictions on wastewater contaminants Although some are required to meet local limits set by the treatment works or local authorities The agency s new rules would require processing facilities to treat wastewater prior to feeding it to the treatment plants Facilities must meet water quality

pollutants coming from the meat and poultry facilities The EPA found that some processing facilities have directly caused issues for the treatment works including damaging their cleaning technologies

was ordered to pay 330 000 in penalties to settle a lawsuit with the EPA for repeatedly violating the Clean Water Act On numerous occasions between September 2008 and March 2012 the poultry plant discharged large volumes of contaminated wastewater into a local wastewater treatment plant damaging its filters and other cleaning equipment legal documents show The pollution also caused the treatment works to violate its state discharge permit on several occasions when it released contaminated water into a tributary of the Ramapo River The poultry plant wastewater sometimes contained

inaction it is not nearly enough to truly counter the massive scale of water pollution from these facilities nationwide she says But the Meat Institute which represents meat and poultry processing companies argues that the rules are unnecessary because the industry is already well regulated The Institute also disputes the EPA s claim that the industry s wastewater interferes with treatment

costs to the industry of complying with the rules It claims that 74 facilities could close and 80 000 people would lose jobs over four times the impact that the EPA estimated Complying with the new rules could cost hundreds of millions more than the 232 million per year estimated by the EPA it writes In addition the new standards would upset constructive relationships that meat and poultry

Medicines Agency The government may however choose not to cover the costs of the vaccines Dutch attorney Meike Terhorst who has been active in opposing the pandemic treaty and IHR amendments told The Defender that at this time it s hard to tell if the EU could start legal action against Slovakia However Kruse said They will certainly try Those behind the implementation of mRNA on a global scale are extremely powerful and perfectly organized Kruse said Of course they will use all means to stop anybody who wants to spoil their big mRNA business According to Plothe Slovakia has been criticized for this move from all sides in Europe Τhe likelihood of governments in the EU following Slovakia is not yet very plausible But it will depend on the public s reactions when learning more and more about what has been done to them Plothe said Australian council calls for ban on Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines While the Slovakian government is mulling whether to proceed with banning mRNA products the Port Hedland Council in Western Australia on Oct 11 passed a motion in a 5 2 vote calling for the immediate suspension of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines and for the Australian government to ban the products The Daily Mail reported that the council of Port Hedland a mining town approximately 1 000 miles north of Perth will now send letters demanding the Covid vaccines be withdrawn to the Prime Minister federal and state health ministers Councillor Adrian McRae introduced the motion He told The Daily Mail he hoped writing to all of Australia s 537 councils would have a domino effect The council heard testimony from a range of scientific experts including molecular virologist and epidemiologist David Speicher Ph D a senior research associate at the University of

that sells smart face masks for cows ZELP which stands for Zero Emissions Livestock Project claims its artificial intelligence AI mask technology for livestock will reduce methane emissions considered to be a main greenhouse gas and curb climate change Cows and other ruminant animals emit methane in the process of digesting their food The mask goes around the cow s head and captures the methane gas exhaled by the animal oxidizing it and then releasing it into the air as carbon dioxide and water vapor according to ZELP It also has sensors that continuously collect millions of data points on the animals that are processed by machine learning algorithms Our AI is trained to detect heat flag welfare conditions and identify the most efficient animals with a high level of accuracy ZELP said But critics including third generation farmer Howard Vlieger said the Gates funded venture is illogical and driven by greed Vlieger who advises crop and livestock farmers across the U S said This is what

Vlieger and others said Conventional livestock production which includes confining large numbers of animals in concentrated animal feeding operations more commonly known as factory farms manipulates pieces of the ecosystem in an effort to maximize production and profits thereby leading to the complication and expense of dealing with unintended consequences according to a 2015 report by the Savory

said Indeed researchers including W Richard Teague Ph D professor emeritus and grazing ecologist at Texas A M AgriLife Research Extension Center found that with appropriate regenerative crop and grazing management ruminant animals not only reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions but also provide essential ecosystem services that increase soil carbon sequestration and reduce environmental damage Teague and his colleagues said in a 2016 article published in the Journal of Soil and Water Conservation that to ensure long term sustainability and ecological resilience of agroecosystems agricultural production should be guided by policies and regenerative management protocols that include ruminant grazing Allowing cows to open graze under appropriate management results in more carbon

heavy handed in their tactics to meet quotas and hit govt net zero targets But who s actually better off when we install a smart meter You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Increasingly heavy handed and even aggressive tactics are being adopted by energy companies to coerce the public into agreeing to the installation of smart meters Last weekend United Kingdom U K energy provider Octopus Energy hit the headlines because it s resorted to warning consumers that their existing analog meters have outlived their best before date as if they were a food item They double down with fear tactics by implying that consumers are obligated under the law to replace a perfectly good meter But it just isn t so The Alliance for Natural Health International s executive coordinator Meleni Aldridge has been subject to such coercion from Octopus Deeply disappointing after years of providing excellent service and renewable energy but the response was simply to get a smart meter or find a new provider So much for rewarding customer loyalty Such tactics are clearly being driven by government imposed targets As a result the U K energy watchdog Ofgem is imposing punishing fines on companies not meeting installation targets In 2022 alone energy companies in the U K that didn t meet their targets agreed to pay Ofgem a total of 10 8 million pounds of customers money How smart are smart meters According to a 2022 analysis by the U S organization Mission data Coalition 97 of smart meters have failed to provide the customer savings originally promised in 2009 A recent paper published in Cell Reports Physical Science blames the lack of savings on poor quality not so smart data collected by smart meters In the U K for example many households are experiencing overcharges and other issues due to smart meter faults poor supplier management and connectivity issues Technical issues and mismanagement by energy suppliers have led to a significant number of these meters not functioning correctly leaving consumers unable to track their energy usage effectively and missing out on the potential savings and insights these devices are supposed to provide Added to this smart meters allow the energy companies to overcharge annually on top of what s been used High profile cases such as artist Grayson Perry s disputed bill increase from 300 to 39 000 pounds

depending on the time of usage the availability of so called green energy as well as the fluctuating cost of energy The big question is whether consumers will adapt and comply or continue in a manner that befits their needs and lifestyle despite incurring higher costs The global smart meter market is currently valued at 24 billion and is projected to grow to a massive 77 billion by 2032 But the truth is that early adopter countries are now facing significant bills to replace older technology that s lost compatibility with evolving systems Bills that are ultimately funded by us the taxpayers In June 2024 63 of all energy meters in the U K were smart or advanced meters Despite the coercion and huge marketing budgets directed at convincing consumers to install the devices installation rates dropped by 11 as people became more and more distrusting of the technology The U K Department of Energy Security and Net Zero admits that 4 million devices aren t working properly However independent

Commission they explain that smart meters and cell phones occupy similar frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum meaning that cell phone research can apply to smart meter radiofrequency radiation RFR Smart meter RFR consists of frequent very intense but very brief pulses throughout the day Because smart meter exposure over a 24 hour period can be very prolonged pulses can average 9 600 times a day and because there is building evidence that the sharp high intensity pulses are particularly harmful the cell phone study findings are applicable when discussing adverse health impacts

Alliance IMA on Tuesday launched the Smart Moms Ask campaign mobilizing mothers to demand that federal health agencies take the COVID 19 shots off the childhood immunization schedule IMA founded by a group of critical care specialists is asking mothers to sign a petition they will present to U S Secretary of Health and Human Services HHS Robert F Kennedy Jr and members of Congress Moms have been bullied into accepting mRNA shots with devastating risks said Dr Kat Lindley IMA Fellowship program director We re uniting our voices to demand transparency and safety for our kids Lindley told The Defender We ve seen that there is no statistical benefit for using this vaccine in healthy humans especially in children and pregnant women We are boldly asking the HHS not to consider it We want them to actually stop this especially in children and pregnant women because we re seeing a risk of severe COVID autoimmune diseases myocarditis and many many other things Pediatrician and CEO of GMO Science Dr Michelle Perro who is not affiliated with the campaign but signed the petition told The Defender It is incomprehensible that a campaign had to be initiated to do what s right for children and pregnant mothers This is a clear message from the MAHA Make America Healthy Again moms to Secretary Kennedy the FDA U S Food and Drug Administration and the CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that we will not tolerate giving COVID shots to our children any further Lindley said the campaign also aims to empower parents to ask questions about vaccines and about informed consent as it relates to everything that happens in the doctor s office The CDC added COVID 19 vaccination in February 2023 to its routine immunization schedule for children and adults after a unanimous recommendation from the agency s advisory committee The schedule is the basis for vaccine recommendations made by most physicians The CDC s immunization schedule also provides formal guidance for state and local public health officials who set the rules for which vaccines are required to attend school Children must typically receive all of the vaccines on the schedule to be considered up to

emergency use authorization EUA from the FDA but are not licensed Before a vaccine can be fully licensed the vaccine maker typically is required to conduct numerous clinical trials to demonstrate that the product is safe However the safety requirements for EUA vaccines are more flexible Perro said allowing the shots to be administered to children was outrageous especially considering that the incidence of severe illness was always near zero and that after the vaccines were rolled out there was evidence of large numbers of vaccine injuries including widespread reports of myocarditis and skyrocketing miscarriage rates I have received hundreds of requests for help from parents from COVID vaccine reactions for a broad range of conditions including cardiac immunologic and neurologic issues she said Many children are now experiencing a weakened immune system called VAIDS from the COVID jab How could the vaccine be taken off the schedule There are several avenues through which the vaccines could likely be removed from the childhood schedule according to several experts who spoke with The Defender For vaccines to get onto the schedule they are first recommended by the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP and then approved by the CDC director When Rotashield Wyeth s now Pfizer rotavirus vaccine caused intussusception in infants one to two weeks following vaccination it was was suspended pending ACIP review Then the committee recommended removing it and the CDC took it off the schedule in 1999 However experts pointed out that ACIP is only an advisory committee and the CDC director is not bound by ACIP s recommendations For example former CDC Director Rochelle Walensky decided to recommend COVID 19 boosters for everyone age 16 and older overruling ACIP which recommended against the boosters because there were no safety or effectiveness data for 16 and 17 year olds That means the CDC s current acting director Susan Monarez could make

Lindley said the FDA could also suspend the shots based on its own pharmacovigilance data showing the dangers of the COVID 19 shots The agency s mission is to protect people from adverse events from drugs Lindley said and essentially they failed at it Other experts said the FDA could also pull the COVID 19 vaccines for children on the basis that it is mislabeled because the label doesn t disclose the presence of DNA plasmids Others said there is a more direct way to end the shots for kids Because they are available only under EUA the EUA could be lifted either by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary or by Kennedy EUAs are granted only under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness PREP Act The act authorizes the HHS secretary to declare that a disease or other health condition or other

countermeasures such as drugs biological products medical devices and vaccines Under that emergency declaration the FDA can issue EUAs When the Biden administration ended the COVID 19 emergency in 2023 many people expected that the EUAs would also be terminated Instead the administration in January extended the PREP Act emergency declaration and therefore the EUAs through the end of 2029 Sasha Latypova a former pharmaceutical industry executive with 25 years of experience in pharmaceutical research and development told The Defender Latypova said If RFK Jr terminates the COVID emergency declaration as he is supposedly allowed to do by law that s the fastest method to remove COVID 19 shots from the market a point she made to him in an open letter By law she added the decision requires no justification other than his opinion on whether there is a real emergency lasting a full decade and whether the mRNA shots may be effective for infants If Kennedy were to take that action the PREP

Kids Calling it a privacy nightmare the Center for Digital Democracy issued a report on how the streaming TV industry has evolved into a vast data driven viewer surveillance apparatus transforming people s TVs into monitoring tracking and targeting devices You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The streaming television industry has morphed into a vast data driven viewer surveillance apparatus transforming people s TVs into tools for monitoring tracking and targeting according to a new report from the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy The 48 page report How TV Watches Us Commercial Surveillance in the Streaming Era charts the evolution from broadcast cable and satellite television to connected TV CTV a term that encompasses the wide range of content delivered through the internet to smart TVs CTV includes popular apps like YouTube TV Free Advertiser Supported TV FAST channels and streaming services like Disney Netflix and Amazon Prime It also includes Roku smart TVs and smart TV devices themselves The report documents how CTV whose surge in viewership is largely driven by young audiences harvests user data through a sophisticated and expansive commercial surveillance system that privacy advocates argue undermines existing consumer protections CTV has become a privacy nightmare for viewers said Jeff Chester report co author and executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy in a press release It is now a core asset for the vast system of digital surveillance that shapes most of our online experiences as it gathers and uses sensitive data about health children race and political interests Over the past five years CTV corporations have teamed up with data brokers like Experian and TransUnion to create new data mining tools that capture and aggregate everything an individual user does on their smart TV This information can be integrated with data captured from other devices and real world activities Existing privacy policies don t explain or protect people from these new forms of data capture the Center for Digital Democracy said so viewers should disregard any promises companies make about not collecting or sharing user information These new data capture practices form the foundation for a system with unprecedented capabilities for surveillance and manipulation the report warns As a consequence buying a smart TV set in today s connected television marketplace is akin to bringing a digital Trojan Horse into one s home The Center for Digital Democracy submitted the report along with letters to the Federal Trade Commission the Federal Communications Commission the California attorney general and the California Privacy Protection Agency calling for an investigation into the industry How does CTV

forced to stay in their homes found comfort and diversion in the vast number of channels offering a steady supply of movies television series sports and other programming The trend has continued with streaming services expanding their audiences by offering lower cost versions of their platforms that include advertising These versions with ads are more profitable and provide more opportunities for data collection and ad targeting Through CTV partnerships data brokers create extensive digital dossiers on each of hundreds of millions of individual viewers and TV owners based on their identity information viewing habits and both online and offline shopping and other behaviors One new data mining tool is a cookieless ID that tracks a person s digital activity without third party cookie

According to the Center for Digital Democracy report pharmaceutical marketers are leveraging extensive data on people including diagnostic and procedure codes medical claims and prescribing behaviors CTV has opened avenues for the industry to become even more powerful and intrusive combining existing health data with targeted pharmaceutical ads and then tracking its effectiveness to refine targeting methods even further Despite claims that health data for ad targeting is anonymized the report said the industry can use other identity tracking tools to target pharmaceutical ads to specific people on their smart TVs For example a company called DeepIntent partners with LG for exclusive access to its automated content recognition data The company can combine that data with other data points to target people for pharmaceutical ads relevant to their health concerns DeepIntent also partners with Roku to target Silver Streamers people 55 and older who are more likely to have a diagnosed condition The companies target patients caregivers and providers with sustained and repeated ads across multiple platforms Processed food companies use AI to target collect data from kids Food and beverage companies use CTV to target children and teens who are part of what they call Generation Stream Companies like General Mills work with Netflix Disney and Prime Video to integrate their products in shows that resonate with the target audience Big Food s interest in this type of integration has spawned companies like BenLabs whose sole purpose is integrating brands into TV film music and influencer content CTV also uses generative AI to show different ads to different audience segments watching the same show Startup companies are developing technology to place different

enacting such policies to curb bullying classroom distractions and to combat addiction to the devices Although procedures for the ban vary from school to school the policy typically entails having students lock their cellphones and other personal devices in an electronic pouch that only school staff can open with a special magnet or stow their phones in a locker upon arriving at school EdSource said Since early summer an increasing number of schools have opted to enforce such bans On June 18 the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD the second largest district in the U S voted to ban cellphones during the school day starting in January 2025 The vote came just one day after U S Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called for warning labels on social media platforms citing evidence that

efforts of school leaders and elected officials such as Hochul and Newsom who have pushed for cellphone bans at schools Aside from the well established dangers from excessive smartphone use she told The Defender the policy reduces children s exposure to radiofrequency RF radiation which is a step in the right direction Research shows that children with their smaller heads and more fluid in their brains absorb more RF radiation than adults Eckenfels Garcia said she hopes more schools and states will pass cellphone bans Some parents have pushed back against the policy saying they want to be able to hear from their kids in the case of an emergency EdSource reported Others said it s important that their kid can use a cellphone at school to monitor a required medicine or a health condition Sara Dingledy principal at Martha s Vineyard Regional High School said her school would make exceptions in medical situations She acknowledged that students who are used to using social media constantly on their phones may initially be frustrated by the new rule but they ll likely benefit We know that if you persist through it that the outcomes are really positive LAUSD board member Nick Melvoin who voted in favor of the ban told CNN banning cellphones is important because students have their heads in their hands walking down the hallways They re not talking to each other or playing

Marketing The study published in BMJ Global Health in February highlights how children and teens are inundated with digital marketing for ultraprocessed foods high in sugar salt and fat often without realizing they re being targeted You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Pamela Ferdinand In an era when digital devices increasingly dominate young people s lives the social media industry is promoting unhealthy food consumption and behavior and contributing to the global childhood obesity epidemic according to an international report The study published in BMJ Global Health in February highlights how children and teens are inundated with digital marketing for ultraprocessed foods high in sugar salt and fat often without realizing they re being targeted From cookies and cold cereal to sugary drinks and fast food the digital ads that young people worldwide encounter are frequent and persuasive the researchers say For example in one study that looked at 80 different reports involving nearly 20 000 children and teenagers food ads especially online ones were linked to eating more unhealthy food wanting those foods and asking parents to buy them pester behaviors Another found that influencer marketing of junk food significantly increased immediate food intake among 9 to 11 year olds while healthy food promotions had no such effect Unlike traditional media social platforms like TikTok YouTube and Instagram track user behavior to deliver personalized content And because ads can be embedded in videos polls games or quizzes particularly on platforms like TikTok YouTube and Instagram children often fail to recognize they re being marketed to The study found that digital marketing techniques have a near universal reach and effectively promote unhealthy food consumption which significantly influence children and adolescents consumption and food behavior the researchers say Social media is a commercial determinant of health like tobacco alcohol In the U S more than 95 of adolescents have a smartphone or access to one with more than 35 reporting using one of the top five most popular social media platforms almost constantly according to the Pew Research Center Similarly in the U K nine in 10 children own a mobile phone by age 11 Nearly a quarter of children ages 5 to 7 also have their own phone with more than one third on social media In Australia where legislators in November 2024 approved a ban on children under 16 from using social media roughly 1 million teens ages 14 to 17 91 and more than half 54 of children ages 10 to 13 own a mobile phone according to a 2023 survey One in seven 14 children ages 6 to 9 has their own social media account The review comes amid emerging evidence that the social media industry acts as a commercial

review comes amid emerging evidence that the social media industry acts as a commercial determinant of health that facilitates food marketing while reshaping public perceptions and advancing corporate goals Like other recognized commercial determinants of health like tobacco alcohol and fossil fuels the food industry uses similar tactics on social media to influence public health policy and sidestep regulation the researchers say This includes targeting vulnerable populations building alliances with health groups advocating for voluntary regulation and reframing public health debates in their favor Australian researchers for instance found that ultraprocessed food industry actors used Twitter to challenge public health policies and advocate for voluntary regulation while co opting health related language and distorting policy narratives This study is also the first to explore how the industry promotes ultraprocessed products to young audiences exacerbating health disparities and contributing to adverse health outcomes including childhood obesity Childhood obesity increases the risk of developing non communicable diseases including Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease The role of social media marketing in influencing high energy intake including bypassing cognitive awareness to shape the food environment for children and youth is consistent with the definition of an obesogenic environment driver the authors say Adolescents encounter dozens of unhealthy food ads online every day In this study researchers from the U K Canada and New Zealand analyzed 36 peer reviewed articles and editorials mostly from high income countries published between 2000 and May 2023 They found that exposure to unhealthy food marketing on social media varies by country age and gender In a self reported study of 4 827 parents of children under 18 for example those in Mexico and the U S reported greater exposure to marketing for fast food and sugary drinks while viewing digital media with their children compared with parents in Australia Canada and the U K Older children and those from some countries may also be more exposed than other groups As early adopters and near ubiquitous users with 95 using YouTube and at least 67 using TikTok teenagers may experience the most immediate and significant harms of the social media industry s influence on the

Australia teens were exposed to an average of 168 food promotions per week based on mobile device recordings the study shows Boys were more likely to encounter ads emphasizing athleticism or achievement while girls saw more interactive content like polls and quizzes In Canada 72 of youth ages 7 to 16 were exposed to food marketing within 10 minutes of using their favorite social media apps On that country s most used websites for children more than 93 of food ads promoted items high in fat sodium or sugar with the most frequently advertised categories including cakes cookies and ice cream Researchers also estimated that children and adolescents see food marketing 30 and 189 times on average per week on social media apps respectively Food marketers quickly adapt to changing conditions such as the COVID 19 pandemic using relevant themes to stay visible and influential In New Zealand 14 of the top 20 unhealthy food and drink brands posted COVID 19 themed content during the pandemic Instagram marketing tactics tended to appeal to a younger audience by using competitions and characters compared with Facebook advertisements that tended to include competitions based on user generated content interactive games and apps Social media platforms evading effective regulation The World Health Organization has long warned that food marketing is a public health threat that negatively affects children s food choices intended choices and their dietary intake In July 2023 it released a new guideline that recommends countries implement comprehensive mandatory policies to protect children of all ages from the marketing of foods and non alcoholic beverages that are high in saturated fatty acids trans fatty acids free sugars and or salt HFSS This review reinforces that warning and calls for urgent government led reforms to better protect youth online Research shows that voluntary regulations have failed to reduce children s exposure to unhealthy food marketing

have failed to reduce children s exposure to unhealthy food marketing particularly on rapidly evolving digital platforms An evaluation of celebrity endorsement policies and practices in promoting food

account for the complexity of modern marketing strategies or to distinguish between content targeted at children and content that merely reaches them the researchers say Additionally adolescents often excluded from policies focused on children fall through the cracks despite being heavy users of social media Also in the U S the First Amendment protects commercial speech such as marketing from government interference That includes public health restrictions on companies that advertise commodities linked to public health harms including food tobacco and alcohol Tech companies are currently seeking to overturn a state law in Florida that bans some social media accounts for teens younger than 16 or 14 and 15 year olds without a parent s permission But regulation to protect children is needed the researchers say Unhealthy food regulations for children and adolescents have not kept up with the changing digital marketing landscape particularly with the rise of social media and it is evident that the same regulations and regulatory approaches that were employed for traditional media sources will not be effective across the digital world they say Recommendations include Clear definitions of child targeted digital marketing International collaboration to close regulatory loopholes Mandatory restrictions on unhealthy food promotion to minors Media literacy education to build critical thinking in youth Stronger systems to track and monitor online ad exposure Parents too have a role to play by initiating conversations about how digital marketing works and encouraging media literacy However researchers caution that individual efforts are unlikely to be enough without systemic reforms Given the review s finding that self regulatory policies are ineffective parents and guardians should advocate for government regulations to better protect children from ultra processed and other unhealthy food marketing practices the authors conclude For children and adolescents

on Social Media Society in London during a session on misinformation During the presentation Deplatforming Children s Health Defense Fighting Health Misinformation or Building a Reactionary Health Populism Movement Victoria O Meara Ph D a lecturer on digital media at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom accused CHD of spreading dangerous information about vaccines and other public health topics The presentation research yet to be published provided background on CHD s organizational history and online content and focused on content posted on the CHD Telegram channel between 2021 and 2023 Co authors who were not present at the conference include Jaigris Hodson Ph D an associate professor of digital communication for the public interest at Royal Roads University Canada Anatoliy Gruzd Ph D professor of privacy preserving digital technologies at Toronto Metropolitan University Canada Philip Mai Ph D senior researcher and co director of the Social Media Lab at Toronto Metropolitan University Esteban Morales Ph D a postdoctoral fellow at Royal Roads University Joan Owen a Ph D student at Royal Roads University and a member of the Polarization Team at the Cascade Institute O Meara s Hodson s and Gruzd s research interests include the spread of misinformation while Morales research interests include online violence In 2022 Hodson and O Meara co authored an academic paper funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research examining COVID 19 health sharing practices on social media The 2022 paper concluded that misinformation researchers need to do more to educate the public about the inefficacy of debunking and the importance of being pre emptive in spreading credible information and that communicators who wish to counter health misinformation should try to appeal to those people and platforms that are more likely to serve a broadcast function within a larger community Other presentations during Wednesday s panel also focused on the spread of supposed misinformation and so called conspiracy theories and how Bill Gates has been a frequent target of such narratives Presentation claims CHD spreads health misinformation O Meara presented background information on CHD including that it was founded by Robert F Kennedy Jr currently CHD s chairman on leave She described the organization as one of the largest anti vaccine groups in the U S

Meara presented background information on CHD including that it was founded by Robert F Kennedy Jr currently CHD s chairman on leave She described the organization as one of the largest anti vaccine groups in the U S known for spreading health misinformation and conspiracy theories It s an organization that is known for propagating medical misinformation anti vaccine rhetoric and conspiracy theories generally all under the banner of Vaccine Choice and Health Freedom Movement O Meara said To give you sort of an example of the scale of this a 2020 study found that about 54 of the anti vaccine advertising that was found on Facebook came specifically from this organization she added O Meara noted that CHD and RFK Jr were named as part of The Disinformation Dozen a list produced by the Center for Countering Digital Hate of the 12 superspreaders of COVID 19 misinformation Evidence uncovered in First Amendment lawsuits against the Biden administration and as part of the Twitter Files revealed that the Disinformation Dozen list was used by the federal government to target the named individuals for censorship CHD was removed from Facebook and Instagram in August 2022 for repeatedly violating their terms of service and spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories related to COVID 19 and other health topics O Meara said She noted that Kennedy has since been reinstated because he is running as an independent for president of the U S According to O Meara the way that Facebook is navigating some of those tensions between being a public figure who the public has or should be able to access and understand their ideas and someone who is very deeply enmeshed in the spreading of misinformation that s quite dangerous is interesting O Meara said it is challenging for social media platforms to identify and delineate so called medical misinformation because unlike other things such as violent rhetoric et cetera the effects or the imminent bodily harm to people is much delayed And so it can be a difficult one for platforms to identify and delineate as dangerous CHD accused of fostering reactionary health populist movement Focusing on CHD s Telegram channel O Meara noted that it launched in March 2021 in the same month that this organization was named as part of the Disinformation Dozen and numbered over 63 000 subscribers at the time of her analysis The researchers analyzed 6 654 posts made between March 2021 and September 2023 O Meara sought to examine how the deplatforming of the CHD and the regulatory turn of social media is

censorship and Big Tech as sort of an internally significant topic point for this particular account O Meara said referring to CHD s Telegram channel That s what the rest of the study is borne out of O Meara said her analysis led to the identification of five key themes that CHD purportedly disseminates in communications via its Telegram channel one of those being that the censorship CHD has faced is used as a credential by the organization Deplatforming and censorship are understood as a reason to listen to CHD a badge of honor a statement of credibility O Meara s presentation read The deplatforming of CHD is sort of more broadly understood as a reason for audience members to listen to what they have to say In this space censorship is kind of brandished as a credential that lends the organization legitimacy or authority O Meara said O Meara also identified a theme she referred to as politics of crisis which she described as a sense of urgency cultivated by CHD where democracy and fundamental rights are lost or in peril I m thinking about this as cultivating this sort of idea that there is imminent threat to democracy and freedom of speech and fundamental values and that the deplatforming of this organization is evidence of that O Meara said Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Their censorship or their being moderated or removed from the platform is being centered towards the claims that they make more broadly that it is evidence of the decline of democracy the removal of fundamental rights for people The third theme O Meara identified was elite collusion and corruption which she said describes CHD s efforts to highlight links between government and technology companies and powerful actors serving elite interests and censoring truth O Meara said this theme comes up again and again in CHD s communications Another theme O Meara identified focused less on Big Tech censorship and more on a repetitive insistence on Big Tech s general threats to personal autonomy and privacy and those sorts of things including surveillance data capture and social media s harms to children s health O Meara also discussed what she described as expressions of a community sentiment and calls to action O Meara said threats against CHD are mobilized by the organization as calls to action", "chunk_id":

children s health O Meara also discussed what she described as expressions of a community sentiment and calls to action O Meara said threats against CHD are mobilized by the organization as calls to action from supporters and the public According to O Meara CHD messaging across these five themes relies frequently on quotes small snippets of dialogue from speeches posts or content from a wide variety of people in different roles from different contexts or with little information about the context A lot of their content kind of quotes people in reputable positions and positions of power And the overall effect of that is to construct this image of The People with CHD as its voice O Meara said CHD is engaging cultivating a reactionary health populist movement where the deplatforming and censorship of this organization has kind of become a key narrative device that is operationalized towards increasing their authority and legitimacy but also to elevating the importance of the work that they do O Meara continued O Meara said this has interesting consequences for understanding how we combat problems like medical misinformation Responding to an audience member s question she said it is not so easily black and white to say that all information CHD disseminates is misinformation but that it is precisely this that makes the organization quite dangerous Responding to another question O Meara acknowledged that social media content moderation is a blunt tool that is always embedded socially and culturally in a way that can be volatile However it is also a necessary tool that should be part of a broader toolbox that needs to involve policy that needs to involve educators she said I think moderation has a role to play but it gets very murky when we re no longer talking

Kateryna Kasianenko a Ph D candidate at Queensland University of Technology in Australia stated in the presentation Highly visible figures such as Gates are targets of falsehoods dis misinformation conspiracies adding that these tendencies intensified post COVID 19 According to Kasianenko falsehoods regarding these figures are a symptom of lack of fixity of meaning behind their philanthropy in global online discourses This lack of fixity was characterized as a floating signifier where a figure like Gates can represent different meanings to different communities which this study sought to examine via an analysis of thousands of tweets from 2020 and 2021 referencing Gates and his foundation s activities in Africa Citing academic Claire Wardle Ph D an academic highlighted in the Twitter Files for her role in advising the Biden administration on how to censor COVID 19 counternarratives Kasianenko said Questioning definitions of mis dis mal information is atomistic where right wing anti vax communities are angered by those associated with the philanthropists like Gates Such communities also appropriate post colonial language when referring to figures like Gates as colonialists

problematic information like fake news and misinformation has raised serious concerns and conspiracy theories have been ubiquitous throughout history due to their simplicity Ubiquity does not mean being harmless Kwon said arguing it can lead to public health hazards like increasing vaccine hesitancy or rejecting scientific consensus Focusing on Gates as a target of super spreaders of conspiracy theories Kwon presented the results of an analysis of thousands of tweets from 2020 The analysis found that conspiratorial tweets referencing Gates peaked on several occasions such as Dr Anthony Fauci

FTC report published on Thursday details how social media and streaming companies endanger children and teens who use their platforms and how the tech industry s monetization of personal data has

controversial bills aimed at protecting youth from Big Tech s dangerous and unacceptable business practices after the Federal Trade Commission FTC published a report on Sept 19 detailing how social media and streaming companies endanger children and teens who use their platforms The FTC staff report entitled A Look Behind the Screens Examining the Data Practices of Social Media and Video Streaming Services shows how the tech industry s monetization of personal data has created a market for commercial surveillance especially via social media and video streaming services with inadequate guardrails to protect consumers The agency staff examined the practices of Meta platforms which include Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp YouTube X formerly known as Twitter Snapchat Reddit Discord Amazon which owns the gaming site Twitch and ByteDance the owner of TikTok The report finds that these companies engaged in mass data collection of their users and in some cases nonusers Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Samuel Levine said in the paper It reveals that many companies failed to implement adequate safeguards against privacy risks It sheds light on how companies used our personal data from serving hypergranular targeted advertisements to powering algorithms that shape the content we see often with the goal of keeping us hooked on using the service The publication also finds that these practices pose unique risks to children and teens with the companies having done little to respond effectively to the documented concerns that policymakers psychologists and parents have expressed over young people s physical and mental well being FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement that the report lays out how social media and video streaming companies harvest an enormous amount of Americans personal data and monetize it to the tune of billions of dollars a year While lucrative for the companies these surveillance practices can endanger people s privacy threaten their

companies of willful blindness around child users by claiming that there are no children on their platforms because their sites do not allow them to create accounts This may constitute an attempt by the companies to avoid legal liability under the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act Rule COPPA In December 2023 Khan proposed sweeping changes to COPPA to address the issue Josh Golin executive

Christof Plothe Mitglied des Lenkungsausschusses des World Council for Health sagte gegenüber The Defender dass die Protokolle zeigen dass es nie die Wissenschaft war die eine unwirksame und schädliche Maskentragungspflicht ein traumatisierendes Abstandsgebot und Lockdowns initiiert hat oder die eine neuartige Gentherapie eingeführt hat die als Impfstoff bezeichnet wird Es waren Politiker die diese Maßnahmen gefordert haben Der deutsche Bundesgesundheitsminister Karl Lauterbach aus der Zeit der Pandemie spielt in den Dokumenten eine wichtige Rolle Plothe sagte Lauterbach habe nie mit

primates said Brian Hooker Ph D chief scientific officer of Children s Health Defense CHD Monkeys have and will most likely continue to be used in gain of function research in laboratories worldwide

Biological Weapons Convention of 1975 maybe it is time to say No more Nass said Latypova expressed skepticism that gain of function research can be performed successfully But what can be achieved can

Genesis founder and CEO Gregory Westergaard defended the lab s safety record He said the company is investigating the possibility that the monkey s escape was an intentional act by an employee Westergaard said the most likely reason for the escape was human error due to an employee failing to secure containment doors behind her According to ABC News Mace s letter says that Alpha Genesis has a history of problems dating back to at least 2014 including incidents where lab animals escaped or were found dead due to trauma and placement in incorrect enclosures In a Nov 18 letter Stop Animal Exploitation Now a federal watchdog group that opposes animal experimentation filed a federal complaint against Alpha Genesis citing several safety violations and incidents that compromised the health and safety of lab animals at the company s facilities in 2021 and 2022 Jablonowski noted that animals held at the Alpha Genesis facility have sometimes been found in an unhealthy state The aim is to have healthy animals so why do the company s own emails show they endure extreme weight loss are deprived of food or are fed moldy food Moldy food will introduce mycotoxins into the animal and the effects will percolate down to affect the science or therapies derived from these animals Jablonowski said According to Hooker The regulation of animal facilities in the U S is poor Most surveillance

who received a COVID 19 vaccine were significantly more likely to miscarry compared to women who didn t get a COVID 19 vaccine according to a new peer reviewed study However the authors said their findings reinforce the effectiveness and safety of COVID 19 vaccination in pregnant women The study by six Spanish researchers was published last week in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth a Springer journal The researchers retrospectively examined a sample of 156 pregnant women who tested positive for COVID 19 during pregnancy between 2020 and 2022 Of these 45 women had received at least one COVID 19 vaccine dose Among the vaccinated group six women 13 3 had miscarriages with five of the miscarriages occurring in women who were vaccinated in the first or second trimester of pregnancy Five miscarriages were recorded among the larger group 111 of unvaccinated women resulting in a miscarriage rate of 4 5 According to Trial Site News the higher miscarriage rate among vaccinated women in the first two trimesters is a concerning anomaly that raises the need for more robust trimester stratified safety analyses However the study s authors downplayed the miscarriage rates and instead focused on a subset of positive outcomes in the vaccinated group including significantly lower rates of pneumonia vomiting and headache than the unvaccinated cohort Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist for Children s Health Defense questioned the authors emphasis on positive vaccination outcomes while glossing over miscarriages If the authors are willing to stand by their work then they should have stated that a COVID 19 infection in the first two trimesters is 15 times more likely to result in a miscarriage if the mother was vaccinated the strongest statistical

Papers found over 42 000 serious adverse events in the first three months of availability of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine mostly in women The documents also showed that Pfizer knew early on that the shots were causing menstrual damage at scale The company reported to the FDA that 72 of the recorded adverse events were in women Of those about 16 involved reproductive disorders and functions Pfizer

referring to the spike protein in mRNA vaccines She said symptoms include heavy frequent bleeding completely missed periods recurrent cysts and increased miscarriages A study published in February in the peer reviewed journal Science Public Health Policy and the Law identified 37 safety signals for COVID 19 vaccines during pregnancy including miscarriage fetal malformations premature birth stillbirth newborn asphyxia and newborn death Epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher said the Spanish study s outcomes confirm the health harms of spike proteins and the findings of a preprint published last week examining pregnancy outcomes among vaccinated and unvaccinated women in the Czech Republic That study found that among approximately 1 3 million Czech women ages 18 39 those vaccinated against COVID 19 had approximately 33 fewer successful pregnancies compared to unvaccinated women Hulscher said These deleterious outcomes are likely due to persistent spike protein production and the presence of long lasting vaccine mRNA in reproductive organs According to TrialSite News public health agencies should take note of the study s findings Public health agencies promoting vaccination during pregnancy should acknowledge data gaps and transparently fund larger trimester specific safety surveillance programs As booster uptake slows and newer variants circulate longitudinal tracking of maternal fetal outcomes remains urgent For Wolf the study s results add to evidence supporting the withdrawal of COVID 19 vaccines for pregnant women and for everyone Hulscher suggested that current CDC guidelines recommending COVID 19 vaccination during pregnancy should be immediately revoked in light of these serious safety concerns Last month FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said public

conditions and reproductive issues in people who received COVID 19 vaccines clinical educator Dr Margaret Christensen co founder of the Carpathia Collaborative joined The Defender In Depth this week to discuss their causes and possible solutions Christensen said the reason behind many of these health conditions in the vaccinated boils down to hormonal disruptions caused by the ingredients of the COVID 19 vaccines including the spike proteins and lipid nanoparticles which can have wide ranging effects on multiple organs and systems within the human body Christensen addressed ways to help restore hormonal balance She also discussed an online summit Hormonal Havoc The COVID Fallout and How to Fix It she is co organizing The online summit will take place June 17 23 Hormonal imbalance has produced very bizarre conditions Christensen said that hormones estrogen progesterone testosterone cortisol insulin thyroid hormone and then we can also talk about our neurotransmitters as well help regulate our mood and focus Understanding that they re all related to one another and interact with one another is really critically important Christensen said Not only do they interact with one another hormonal balance is critically related to gut health and to our liver detoxification pathways and what we can do for those Christensen said the brain especially the hypothalamus and the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal HPA axis the part of our brain that regulates everything has to be working correctly too These systems depend on hormonal balance Christensen said noting that the things

neurodegenerative changes severe brain fog rapid onset dementia Spike protein creating massive amounts of dysregulation in the immune system For Christensen a prime cause of hormonal imbalance is the spike protein along with other ingredients in the COVID 19 shots We know that the spike protein is creating massive amounts of dysregulation in the immune system she said This can throw off hormones and cause immune system dysregulation suppressing the part of the immune system that goes after the bad guys she said What we re getting is this signal of constant inflammation constant fear and anxiety feeding into the brain that s trying to regulate our hormones This can have cascading effects throughout the body because everything is connected and we can t treat anything in isolation Christensen said These effects begin in the hypothalamus The hypothalamus is regulating all of the signals to your pituitary gland that goes down to your thyroid down to your adrenal glands down to your ovaries your testes all of that So if that is inflamed and disrupted that s problematic she said Christensen said the gut brain connection is a major driver in this process Everything that s going on in the gastrointestinal tract is fed through the vagus nerve this long nerve in our body that connects our brains our hearts our lungs and our gut But if you are having a dysregulated gastrointestinal tract bacteria and inflammation and bad diets and spike protein in there it s sending a signal up to your vagus nerve up to that HPA axis and the hypothalamus which is also part of something that s called the limbic system your reptile brain So again you re getting disrupted signals coming up from the vagus nerve This has contributed to increases in conditions that were less common before the introduction of the COVID 19 vaccines It wasn t until after the spike protein came out that we saw all the myocarditis and the pericarditis and again that inflammation She explained

inside the body s cells to trigger an immune response But what actually is occurring is persistent production of the spike protein over time leading to multiple types of chronic inflammation Inflammation is one of five mechanisms of damage that the spike protein causes Christensen said The others are persistent infections autoimmune dysregulation gut dysbiosis unhealthy bacteria and then mitochondrial dysfunction Christensen called mitochondria the powerhouse of the cell that generate energy She noted that the organs containing the most mitochondria are those that are on all the time

clinical trial according to a study published last week in the journal Science Advances However critics questioned the trial s design and limited sample size And some suggested that the sprayable vaccine CVXGA1 produced by CyanVac LLC could pose a risk to the public Investigative journalist Sonia Elijah noted that CVXGA1 which enters the mucus membranes and lungs through the nose has the potential for shedding viral particles through intranasal secretions which could expose unvaccinated individuals Elijah said the study didn t examine if shed materials can be spread to others This raises significant safety concerns about replication and shedding risks she said Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist for Children s Health Defense said the platform CVXGA1 uses as a vector is parainfluenza virus type 5 a communicable respiratory virus between humans and non human animals that is evading our immune system Jablonowski said this platform exacerbates the risk of shedding Since it is self spreading there is no informed consent or medical precautions as the vaccine may infect infants children pregnant women immunocompromised or medically frail Karina Acevedo Whitehouse Ph D professor of microbiology at the Autonomous University of Querétaro in Mexico agreed Citing studies involving similar vaccines Whitehouse said there are high chances this vaccine will result in persistent shedding Whitehouse cited a 2023 study of an intranasal RSV respiratory syncytial virus vaccine which detected virus shedding in 17 of participants CVXGA1 produces the SARS CoV 2 virus spike protein which was also contained in the mRNA COVID 19 vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna Medical experts and peer reviewed studies have suggested the spike protein poses potentially serious risks to human health Genetically modifying an infectious respiratory virus to express a spike protein is a familiar and really bad idea Jablonowski said The immune system will be antagonized by the presence of the spike protein Clinical trial flawed experts say According to the CVXGA1 Phase 1 study CVXGA1 is a potentially effective intranasal COVID 19 vaccine that produces an immune response with minimal adverse reactions The clinical trial included just 72 participants ages 12 53 split into two groups One group received a high dose of the vaccine the other received a smaller dose

of safety and effectiveness of this product According to Elijah the lack of a control group and the small sample size weakens the trial s ability to accurately assess safety and immunogenicity but these aren t the only flaws Elijah said The study lacks data on RNA detection levels and did not perform infectivity assays to confirm if shed materials can be spread to others The lack of specific safety and immunogenicity data for the adolescent group raises concerns about the vaccine s effects in younger individuals The open label design where both participants and researchers knew who received the vaccine introduces potential bias in reporting and assessing outcomes such as adverse events Whitehouse noted that the study s researchers claimed they didn t identify any serious adverse events However they tracked adverse events only during a limited time frame which reduces the chances of detecting serious events that may occur after this time period Researchers plan to enroll 10

Lake New Jersey residents told their town leaders during a Tuesday hearing that they don t want Verizon to install 5G towers along the town s beachfront near their homes Meanwhile Verizon is suing the town in a bid to force its towers to go up You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Spring Lake New Jersey residents held a city hall hearing on Tuesday to fill the public record with comments opposing Verizon s proposed installation of six 30 foot 5G towers along their town s beachfront We live in a very historic beautiful town with a ton of character Kelley Badishkanian a Spring Lake resident and grassroots organizer for Spring Lake Against 5G Towers told The Defender So to come in with giant 5G telecom towers really seems out of place The residents delivered their public record comments in hopes of equipping town leaders with ammunition for denying Verizon s permit application to install the towers along the town s Ocean Avenue Badishkanian said In January Verizon filed an application as part of its ongoing efforts to install 5G towers all along the New Jersey shore On Nov 8 the telecom giant sued Spring Lake in federal court in a bid to push its 5G tower plans through despite local resistance It s the third lawsuit Verizon has filed in Monmouth County in its quest to install 5G towers on the New Jersey shore Verizon first sued Belmar a town roughly three miles from Spring Lake on May 10 2021 in an attempt to install its towers on the town s boardwalk On Sept 21 2023 Verizon sued Monmouth County where Belmar and Spring Lake are located after realizing the land in question was under the county s jurisdiction and after county officials on Aug 8 2023 denied the company s project application Children s Health Defense s CHD Electromagnetic Radiation EMR Wireless team which provided legal support to the Belmar residents in their ensuing legal battle also is providing legal support to Spring Lake residents Verizon s suit against Spring Lake alleges the town unreasonably delayed and effectively denied its application Verizon filed the suit in the U S District Court for the District of New Jersey The telecom giant asked the court for injunctive relief so the town can t prevent the company from erecting its 5G towers in Spring Lake Badishkanian said she was taken aback by Verizon s lawsuit I think a lot of people in our group were she said It was a

complaint Although Verizon filed the suit on Nov 8 the town only found out about it on Nov 11 and was served paper on Nov 12 the same day as the hearing McCollough said Verizon and Spring Lake officials did not immediately respond to The Defender s request for comment about the suit 5G tower would be half a block from where my children sleep at night McCollough described Verizon s proposed towers as ugly industrial scale monstrosities that don t belong along Spring Lake s historic and peaceful oceanfront Spring Lake s leaders and residents have generally resisted Verizon s plans They want to keep Spring Lake s beachfront uncluttered Badishkanian said Its simplicity is why people love it CHD s EMR team including McCollough will continue assisting Spring Lake residents now that their fight against the 5G cell towers is at the federal court level Spring Lake residents will likely intervene in the lawsuit in support of the borough Badishkanian said It ll help the borough and give us a seat at the table So that s the next step Badishkanian a business owner with two sons ages 11 and 13 said one of the proposed towers would be just half a block from her home I wear a lot of different hats but my most important role is that I m a mom So to have something like that so close to our house where my children sleep at night this was just a red line for me I can t live that close to something like that knowing there might be potential health risks I love where we live and I don t want to have to move Residents who spoke at Tuesday s hearing cited other reasons for wanting to prevent the towers from going up including a possible decrease in property value Verizon contends that the towers are needed to address a gap in cell service coverage However the residents at the hearing presented evidence that the gap isn t as big as Verizon claims McCollough said We re not clear that there is a gap and to the extent that there is one it can solved other ways For

the beach Verizon lawsuit seeks to circumvent public opinion and process In its lawsuit Verizon contends that under the Federal Communication Commission s FCC shot clock rules Spring Lake officials failed to act in time to prevent Verizon from moving forward with its 5G tower plans The FCC s shot clock rules establish time frames within which State and local governments must complete their reviews In Spring Lake s situation Verizon claims the shot clock deadline was Oct 15 Because the town didn t deal with Verizon s permit application by then Verizon believes the court should now order the town to issue the permit McCollough pointed out that Verizon also claims that only evidence submitted before Oct 15 is valid which would effectively keep out all the public comments submitted during Tuesday s hearing Badishkanian said it was frustrating that Verizon didn t want the residents voices to be put on the record They just wanted to completely circumvent that which I don t think is right We live here Verizon also wants to circumvent the local process that was underway for deciding whether or not to approve the application If the town authorities now try to deny Verizon s application Verizon is effectively saying it s too late McCollough explained We of course have something to say about all of that he added This article was funded by critical thinkers like you The

were denied religious exemptions from the district s COVID 19 vaccine mandate in 2021 St Louis Today reported The 13 employees were among 43 plaintiffs who sued the district in June 2022 for allegedly violating their First Amendment rights their due process and equal protection rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Missouri Human Rights Act In late June jurors voted in

plaintiff in the lawsuit She said The main thing was to show the district that what they did was wrong to just totally ignore the religious exemption request We were treated as if religious beliefs don t hold any type of weight I m happy we were victorious in court and maybe the district or any other employers will learn that you can t just force people to participate in something that they don

district treated medical exemption requests differently from religious exemption requests She said They accepted medical but they discriminated against us and they chose to deny every single religious exemption that was submitted We were the only school district in Missouri that forced a mandate upon their employees All the other school districts if you weren t vaccinated you were allowed to test weekly Unvaccinated employees were allowed the option to submit weekly tests only if their medical or religious exemption requests were granted St Louis Today reported But since St Louis Public Schools denied all religious exemptions It was either get the vaccine or goodbye Brandon said District will likely appeal the ruling In 2022 most of the plaintiffs including Brandon were allowed to

despite the district s promises that all such requests would be reviewed After submitting requests Plaintiffs received substantially identical Religious Vaccine Exemption Response letters in September

course according to the ruling and granted most of the previously submitted religious exemption requests reinviting most of the employees who had previously been suspended or fired According to the ruling SLPS argued that it could not accommodate the religious exemption requests because unvaccinated employees who came into close contact with a person infected with COVID 19 would have to quarantine for 14 days But when the District suspended and or terminated over 100 employees en masse for refusing the vaccine the District may have imposed on itself a staff shortage of a worse nature

Rep James Grunberger disagreed saying I don t think we should back away from this because of the threat of a lawsuit If we have to be a test case on this we should be a test case During a November meeting Grunberger affirmed his position The federal government does not have guidelines for long term exposure so we need to protect our city ourselves and not succumb to legal threats Similarly Rep

ruling are still being worked out in the court system Sometimes you have to stand your ground and here s hoping Stamford does that They do have some arguments and those need to be raised and evaluated by a court in Connecticut McCollough pointed out that Stamford didn t issue an ordinance or even a regulation that blocks telecom providers so the telecom providers would be fools to sue now claiming an effective prohibition He said The board s decision was simply to reject a model contract or right of way agreement that spelled out the terms of access that telecom companies could use for putting their 5G equipment on city infrastructure All that it means is the city will now proceed to negotiate the terms and conditions for access rather than using this model contract that the Governor s

wireless radiation risks In addition to Davis the experts who presented to the board s land use committee included Dr Rob Brown an orthopedic radiology specialist B Blake Levitt a science journalist Theodora Scarato EHT s executive director Kent Chamberlin Ph D past chair and professor emeritus in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of New Hampshire and Joseph Sandri a telecom regulatory attorney and CEO of the tech lab Thought Delivery Systems Inc Here are four key points they made to Stamford s city representatives 1 Wireless radiation can cause cellular stress and DNA damage leading to disease Scientific studies have repeatedly shown that exposure to RF radiation can cause individual cells in the body to become stressed leading to DNA damage and disease according to Brown The longer a cell is stressed he said the greater the likelihood it may malfunction Brown said You might think that the term stress implies a manageable state and that it s not a big deal but let me clarify Stress weakens the body s tissues just as stress can cause a bridge to collapse stress can cause a bone to fracture and also to develop or an organ system to fail When cells undergo stress unfortunate things can happen Membranes which protect the cell and control the cell s internal environment can become damaged causing the cell to lose its ability to function and put ting the cell s life at risk Proteins in the stressed cell can become damaged he said adding that Alzheimer s disease Lewy body dementia and amyloidosis are all associated with protein denaturation And importantly he said when the cell is stressed its DNA can become damaged which can lead to mutations and possibly cancer Chamberlin who served on a year long Land Use Commission tasked by the state of New Hampshire to investigate the health risks of wireless radiation pointed this out as well Chamberlin said that prior to joining the commission he a wireless engineer did not

s routinely reinforced by the telecom industry However Chamberlin said my beliefs about the safety of wireless radiation soon changed as the commission identified hundreds of top tier publications that showed harm from low level wireless radiation exposure He said The primary mechanism by which exposure causes harm are oxidative changes which can lead to an increase in free radicals Those free radicals can lead to chronic inflammation and a host of adverse outcomes including Brown also said that some have claimed 5G won t have negative health impacts because it only penetrates a few millimeters into the skin but radiation doesn t need to go deep to cause damage he said adding The thyroid gland is often only a few millimeters deep to the skin surface and so are the testicles Interfering with the function of these glands can cause systemic endocrine dysfunction In addition many important cells including red blood cells and immune cells are just below the skin surface Your support helps fund this work and CHD s related advocacy education and scientific research Donate Now 2 FCC guidelines are a complete failure for protecting kids Davis pointed out research showing children are especially vulnerable to RF radiation Children s unique physiology including smaller heads and more fluid in their brains results in proportionately greater absorption of RF radiation than adults Research shows children can absorb up to 30 times more the amount of RF radiation in their hippocampus and 10 times more in the bone marrow of their skull The FCC has refused to take this research into consideration when setting its wireless radiation exposure guidelines she said EHT and other organizations including CHD successfully sued the FCC by arguing that the agency s guidelines which have not been updated since 1996 were inadequate to protect human health and did not take recent science into account Davis said The U S Court of Appeals the District of Columbia determined that we were correct and ruled that the FCC s policies on standards for testing phones and other devices were arbitrary and capricious and that the testing procedures particularly as they relate to children and long term exposures were a complete failure The court found the FCC had failed to provide evidence of properly examining long term exposure children s vulnerability the testimony of people injured by radiation sickness and impacts to the developing brain and reproductive system The FCC still has not complied with the court s mandate to review recent science and give a better explanation for how its current standards are adequate for protecting health", "chunk_id":

to set lower wireless exposure limits India China Russia Italy and Switzerland all have limits that are a mere fraction of the FCC s exposure limit she said And in some of those countries there are scientists that are studying this issue ongoing she said However in the United States we don t have that No U S regulatory agency with health expertise has reviewed the scientific evidence of biological effects from RF radiation she said Not the EPA U S Environmental Protection Agency not the CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention not the National Cancer Institute the FDA U S Food and Drug Administration or the Department of Labor she added 4 Pollinators may be impacted by 5G Levitt who has researched the biological effects of RF radiation since the late 1970s shared research on RF radiation s negative impact on the environment and non human species She said neither the FCC nor the state of Connecticut had ever conducted a NEPA National Environmental Policy Act review for 5G Under NEPA law federal agencies must assess whether projects they have authorized will cause harm Meanwhile research indicates that rolling out 5G may especially hurt insects as they are very inefficient thermo regulators and particularly vulnerable to temperature changes Levitt said adding that What impacts insects impacts us all Many frequencies of wireless radiation including the ranges used by 5G cause an organism s tissues to heat up which in turn can impact the organism s functioning Research shows that 5G may be lethal to honeybees she said Levitt pointed out that this would impact the human food supply She warned We are flirting with catastrophic impacts from insect deaths alone capable of punching holes in the entire food web The Human food supply is endangered Watch

plaintiff in the anti censorship lawsuit Murthy v Missouri Bhattacharya told the conference audience that the academic world in 2020 wasn t open to hearing diverse views on COVID 19 He said In December of 2020 the former president of Stanford John Hennessy invited me to participate in a dialogue with somebody who disagreed with me but unfortunately we were unable to find somebody who would agree to talk with me In that sense this conference is four years too late but it s not too late I say COVID 19 probably won t be the only pandemic the world will face he said and it s in the middle

Insider to save this article Sign Up By Julia Conley A bipartisan group of state lawmakers told their counterparts in the U S Congress Tuesday that they hear frequently from their constituents about concerns regarding the rise of artificial intelligence AI and demanded that they not leave people across the country vulnerable to harm by passing a Republican pushed provision to stop state legislatures from regulating AI The provision is part of the massive tax and spending bill that narrowly passed in the U S House of Representatives in May and is now being taken up by the Senate Republicans hope to approve the bill in the Senate through reconciliation which would allow it to pass with a simple majority along party lines But at the state level half of the 260 lawmakers who wrote to the Senate and House on Tuesday were Republicans who warned that the provision imposing a 10 year moratorium on state level AI regulations would cut short democratic discussion of AI policy and freeze policy innovation in developing the best practices for AI governance at a time when experimentation is vital State legislators have done thoughtful work to protect constituents against some of the most obvious and egregious harms of AI that the public is facing in real time said the lawmakers A federal moratorium on AI policy threatens to wipe out these laws and a range of legislation

President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at removing barriers to American leadership in AI which rescinded former President Joe Biden s executive order for the Safe Secure and

have taken bipartisan action to protect their constituents from urgent AI related harms and a thinly veiled gift to Big Tech companies that will profit as a result of a complete lack of oversight The idea that the U S can afford to take a decade long break from regulating technology that is getting more powerful by the day would be laughable if it weren t so appalling said Beller Members of Congress should listen to their counterparts at the state level and reject this provision immediately More than 140 civil society groups last month as Common Dreams reported at the time expressed their opposition to the provision warning that no person no matter their politics wants to live in a world where AI makes life or death decisions without accountability The Senate parliamentarian is

2005 has found that citizens damaged by pesticides have the right to sue producers of toxic products saying that federal pesticide law does not offer adequate protection from manufacturers of poisonous substances Importantly failure to warn claims serve as the de facto legal backstop to hold pesticide companies accountable given the limitations of the federal and state regulatory systems Litigation is not only for holding chemical manufacturers accountable but also incentivizes more responsible corporate behavior across the board resulting in safer products The U S Supreme Court has also upheld the right of communities to restrict pesticides more stringently than the federal government in Wisconsin Public Intervenor v Mortier 501 U S 597 1991 but that victory for the local democratic process to protect residents and ecosystems health has been thwarted by laws in at least 44 states that preempt the authority of their local municipalities The question now is whether the chemical industry playbook will yield a similar result and preempt people s right to sue in cases of failure to warn In the U S Congress pesticide immunity language has been included in previous Farm Bill language and in the Fiscal Year 2025 Appropriations bill see Daily News here as well as in an ongoing U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA rulemaking advanced by 11 Republican attorneys

industry funded data to carry out safety studies Where the bills stand Idaho The legislature of this state was the first to see the introduction of a pesticide immunity bill in 2024 which some local advocates attribute to the pesticide industry s political power in Idaho given that it is home to one of the few domestic phosphate production facilities in the U S See Daily News from last year here At the beginning of the session the Idaho Conservation League released a press release with relevant information and polling data on how Idahoans feel about corporate immunity from litigation An independent survey of 2 678 registered voters was conducted in September 2024 by Embold Research including 878 from Idaho finding 90 of Idahoans oppose chemical company immunity 88 of Idahoans are concerned that the EPA does not conduct its own safety studies to evaluate new pesticides 96 support warning people when lawsuits show products can cause serious health problems 85 of Idahoans are concerned that foreign corporations are trying to limit their access to the courts when chemicals threaten their health In this year s session the scope of the bill has been expanded to preempt failure to warn claims on any agricultural products that produce feed and fiber The bill House Bill HB 303 is also similar to bills from other states in setting up an exception process where failure to warn claims can still be advanced By a showing that 1 The clear weight of scientific evidence does not support the scientific basis on which the required warning is based and 2 The manufacturer or

Moines Register Demonstrators held a vigil in the Iowa Capitol s rotunda Monday to honor the lives lost to cancer each year in Iowa and demanded lawmakers kill the bill Local advocates point to the 2024 Iowa Cancer Registry in their opposition to this bill referencing the fact that Iowa has the second highest cancer rate in the nation The language remains nearly identical to last year s attempt

failed to move forward This year however there are active bills in both chambers HB 129 SB 992 This year there is an additional liability shield for any agricultural employer who may face failure to warn claims in court moving forward Like some of the other states the Florida legislation offers carveouts for when failure to warn could apply If the product was altered if the label was not followed among other clauses and Builds in a carveout for foreign manufacturers most notably Syngenta ChemChina These bills are problematic for Florida because they not only apply similar repercussions as the North Dakota legislation but also attempt to pit farmers against farmworkers by shielding agricultural employers from liability Farmworkers farmers and anyone living near areas sprayed with pesticides or holding mixtures of pesticide residues will have this legal argument taken away from them if this legislation is signed into law by Gov Ron DeSantis The Florida bills would also set a dangerous precedent by establishing contradictory policies for domestic versus foreign pesticide manufacturers when in reality the four top pesticide companies Syngenta China Bayer Germany Corteva U S and BASF Germany controlled around 70 percent of the global pesticide market in 2018 based on reporting in the 2022 Pesticide Atlas In other words advocates across the state and the country are frustrated that

Environmental Protection Agency that a manufacturer knowingly withheld concealed misrepresented or destroyed material information regarding the human health risks of such pesticide in order to obtain

process Myth 1 These bills do not prevent anyone from suing pesticide manufacturers These bills undermine the foundational legal argument used in thousands of previous and pending cases filed by those who have been harmed by pesticide use and exposure Myth 2 EPA s registration process for pesticides is robust involves rigorous testing and ultimately leads to safe products Substantial scientific literature inspector general reports and litigation going up to the U S Supreme Court point to limitations of pesticide registration including safety claims Myth 3 The weedkiller glyphosate in Roundup will be taken off the market if state legislation is not passed We need a fair legal climate Failure to warn claims have been a basic right in state courts going back to 1947 Users of pesticides are better protected by fair warning of product hazards in the marketplace Myth 4 Farmers will be reliant on unsafe products developed in foreign countries if legislation is not adopted The current

nondescript brick building on Florida Street a couple of miles from her modest one story home on the southwestern side of town Like other residents she got an unwelcome surprise in October 2022 at a public forum held by the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA at the historic Monumental Baptist Church known for its role in the civil rights movement The EPA notified the predominantly Black community that Sterilization Services of Tennessee which began operations in the brick building in the 1970s had been emitting unacceptably high levels of ethylene oxide or EtO a toxic gas commonly used to disinfect medical devices Airborne emissions of the colorless gas can increase the risk of certain medical conditions including breast cancer Sims who is 59 and Black said she developed breast cancer in 2019 despite having no family history of it and she suspects ethylene oxide was a contributing factor I used to be outside a lot I was in good health All of a sudden I got breast cancer she said Local advocates say the emissions are part of a pattern of environmental racism The term is often applied when areas populated primarily by racial and ethnic minorities and members of low socioeconomic backgrounds like southwest Memphis are burdened with a disproportionate amount of health hazards The drivers of environmental racism include the promise of tax breaks for industry to locate a facility in a heavily minority community said Malini Ranganathan an urban geographer at American University in Washington D C The cheaper cost of land also is a factor as is the concept of

Srinagar India review what is known at the molecular level about pesticides role in brain cancer Brain cancer is a heavy burden for its victims and their families and attributing a cause is as with many diseases fraught with difficulty But there are strong clues For example farming is a known risk factor In a 2021 meta analysis of epidemiologic studies between 1998 and 2019 analyzed here by Beyond Pesticides farming was associated with a 13 increase in the risk of brain cancer For farmers whose specific exposure to pesticides was documented in the studies the increase jumped to 20 So there is some reason to point a finger at synthetic chemicals But agricultural workers are not the only ones at risk According to a systematic review in 2019 brain cancer was the 10th leading cause of death in the general population For men ages 20 to 39 brain cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths This was about twice the rate for women For children it is even worse central nervous system tumors which have a high mortality rate are the most common childhood cancer these and leukemia comprise more than half of all malignancies in children In 2023 Beyond Pesticides analyzed a review finding that for children ages 0 to 14 the brain tumors classed as astrocytomas were more strongly associated with maternal and et al exposures to pesticides during pregnancy than with children s

aerobic metabolism so oxygen homeostasis is of utmost importance It is clear that pesticides induce the production of reactive oxygen species ROS which are implicated in many diseases In the brain two important communication pathways can be disrupted by ROS gap junctions which are direct connections between cells allowing for the transfer of molecules such as neurotransmitters and synapses where electrical signals travel between neurons The brain is especially vulnerable because it needs both significant amounts of oxygen and higher levels of iron and copper than the rest of the body These metals easily react with oxygen and their balance must also be carefully maintained Dysregulated iron is implicated in cancer metastasis Too much copper also fosters cell proliferation and metastatic potential A further concern is that pesticides are easily and rapidly fat soluble leading to their accumulation in the brain s high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids Many pesticide families have been demonstrated to produce ROS organophosphates chlorpyrifos quinalphos dichlorvos organochlorines paraquat dieldrin and pyrethroids permethrin for example Many have multiple ways of harming cells For example the authors note that paraquat crosses the blood brain barrier creates ROS in the intercellular fluid and induces oxidative damage in the hippocampus region of the brain and neurons It crosses the placenta where it severely damages the fetal dopamine system The weed killer paraquat also interferes with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or NAD and NADH process which involves enzymes crucial for regulating mitochondrial energy generation the oxygen iron and oxygen copper reactions signal transduction genomic stability gene expression regulation circadian clock management immunity and inflammation Paraquat is still registered in the U S for farm use but banned in more than 70 other countries In addition to its connection with brain cancer it is strongly implicated in Parkinson s disease In October Beyond Pesticides called for the U S Environmental Protection Agency to ban paraquat using the same reasoning the agency employed to ban dacthal in August Epigenetics

that found no link between aluminum in vaccines and 50 negative health outcomes including autism asthma and autoimmune disorders However critics told The Defender the study used flawed methodology and statistical tricks that muddied the findings The authors published their report on July 15 in the Annals of Internal Medicine On July 14 even before the study went live mainstream and health industry media including NBC News and STAT News publicly announced the results Chris Exley Ph D one of the world s leading experts on the health effects of aluminum exposure and Brian Hooker Ph D chief scientific officer of Children s Health Defense CHD said that in order to determine if aluminum exposure is linked to health conditions the researchers should have compared children with no aluminum exposure to children with aluminum exposure But that s not what the Danish scientists did Instead they compared children who received vaccines containing aluminum to children who received vaccines with slightly less aluminum Not only that but there was only a one milligram difference between the amount of aluminum in the vaccine doses received by the children in one of the groups compared to those in another group Comparing children with similar aluminum levels rather than comparing children with low levels of aluminum to children with high levels of the metal further muddled the findings Hooker said The researchers examined national vaccination records of about 1 2 million children born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018 and tracked the rates of 50 chronic health conditions Using

suggested that aluminum may be partially responsible for the rise in allergies among U S kids according to The New York Times J B Handley author of How to End the Autism Epidemic said aluminum in vaccines may trigger autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders by activating the immune system in a way that alters the developing brain of a fetus or child This happens because the aluminum in vaccines travels easily to the brain There it can cause inflammation in vulnerable people by triggering the production of a key cytokine interleukin 6 or IL 6 a protein that affects the immune system

research scientist noted that over 34 000 children were excluded from the study because they received more than three of any one of the aluminum containing vaccines before their second birthday The study described this as an implausible number of childhood vaccines Was this a documentation error or a medical error Jablonowski asked The group had the opportunity to investigate the health of these children and chose not to Recommendations for aluminum containing vaccines are higher in the U S than in Denmark Before a child turns 2 years old the U S Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule calls for four doses of DTaP four doses of pneumococcal three or four doses of Hib three doses of hepatitis B and one dose of hepatitis A Other vaccines that don t contain aluminum are also

A new peer reviewed study suggests changing the type of vaccines given to infants could reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome or SIDS which is one of the leading causes of infant death in high income countries You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A new peer reviewed study linking vaccination to sudden infant death syndrome or SIDS suggests that replacing traditional vaccines with nasal or oral vaccines that target the mucosal immune system could significantly reduce the risk of SIDS one of the leading causes of infant death in high income countries Traditional infant vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity the body s broad based immune response throughout the blood and lymphatic system said the researchers who led the study However that vaccination strategy is based on clinical trials in adults whose immune systems are more developed than those of infants the authors said Vaccines that target the systemic immune system can overwhelm infants and trigger immunodeficiency leading to SIDS or other adverse effects according to the paper published last week in the European Society of Medicine Those shots are also particularly ineffective against respiratory viruses because they don t address the infection that is entering the body through the mucosal surface Vaccines that target the mucosal immune system which protects the eyes ears nose throat gastrointestinal urinary and genital membranes would be more effective the authors say This immune system provides the first line of defense against toxic agents entering the

Steele explained that if a person is exposed to a flu virus through the nose the mucosal immune system will be activated throughout the entire body and can prime the immune system for broader defense Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist for Children s Health Defense said the paper outlined an interesting immunization strategy A vaccine that does not invoke a mucosal immune response will not be able to prevent pathogens from infecting the mucosal membrane he said For example the pertussis vaccine can reduce or prevent symptoms of the disease However it doesn t prevent vaccinated people from becoming infected or transmitting the bacteria because that happens at the mucosal membrane Jablonowski said He said that mucosal immunity is best achieved using live pathogens which may be communicable and could cause the disease you re trying to prevent Live vaccines even when weakened are still pathogens that for eons have evaded our defenses and can cause damage to the human host

in babies are dangerous The authors concede that vaccines that target the mucosal immune system raise some concerns For example nasal sprays run the risk of crossing the blood brain barrier they wrote Steele acknowledged that the issues raised by Jablonowski are legitimate and require extensive research and safety testing However Steele said those concerns don t negate the study s premise that vaccines targeting mucosal immunity ought to be investigated as a potentially safer alternative He said the mucosal vaccine would not contain highly toxic adjuvants such as aluminum which are likely linked to SIDS Steele said while mucosal vaccines would need to have an adjuvant component animal studies show these vaccines can use ingredients that are safer than the current crop of adjuvants designed to supercharge the systemic immune system Steele said We ve got to warn people that multiple shots of aluminum based vaccines in babies are dangerous That s got to stop That means we ve got to moderate the whole approach to vaccination Researcher Neil Z Miller an expert on SIDS and vaccines agreed the study s approach shows promise To limit cases of SIDS and other adverse vaccine reactions the authors provide evidence that we need to stimulate the mucosal immune system rather than the systemic immune system said Miller author of Vaccines Are They Really Safe and Effective Currently parents of infants have no safe options to vaccine risks other than delaying or avoiding vaccinations entirely he said Growing number of studies link SIDS to vaccinations A SIDS diagnosis is given when an infant under age 1 dies suddenly typically during sleep and an investigation into the death fails to yield a cause Ninety five percent of SIDS deaths occur in the first six months of life peaking at 2 to 4 months of age Each year the U S records more than five infant deaths per 1 000 live births far exceeding the rates in other high income countries SIDS is the third leading cause of death among infants after birth defects and prematurity Yet the medical industry remains puzzled about the cause Public health researchers have developed a triple risk model for explaining SIDS The

ends don t justify the means There are legal guardrails in place to protect our basic liberties and rights even during a pandemic You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Editor s note The U S Department of Justice on Wednesday appealed Monday s ruling by a federal judge in Florida that struck down the Biden administration s mask mandate for public transport In America the ends don t justify the means There are legal guardrails in place to protect our basic liberties and rights even during a pandemic That was the message in the decision handed down Monday by a federal judge in our lawsuit to overturn the federal travel mask mandate Since early 2021 anyone traveling on a plane bus or train or anyone who used a shared ride service or even walked into an airport or train station was compelled to wear a face covering often for hours at a time President Biden on his first full day in office signed an executive order on mandatory masking The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC citing a public health emergency promulgated the order just eight days later The CDC circumvented a required notice and comment period and issued no scientific justifications for the specifics of the order Americans were supposed to take the government s word for it put on our masks and ask no questions But when flight attendants announced repeatedly on each flight that compliance is required by federal law did you ever wonder what federal law I did And it led us at the Health Freedom Defense Fund to file suit against the mandate in federal court With assistance from our lawyers at the Davillier Law Group we learned there is no federal law compelling masks for travel The CDC does not have the statutory authority to issue a sweeping mandate requiring masking Nor does the agency have the authority to penalize Americans for non compliance The Biden administration claimed its mask mandate was rooted in authority granted under the Public Health Service Act However a careful reading of that law shows Congress never intended to grant such sweeping powers In fact the law is limited and specific as the court pointed out in its decision One of the bigger red flags for the court was the CDC s claim it could bypass a period of public notice and comment The CDC cited the pandemic emergency as justification for bypassing notice and comment Yet as we all recall by early 2021 the pandemic had been wreaking its havoc for nearly a year yet the agency had proposed no such travel mask mandate It is hard to justify requiring emergency powers and

proposed no such travel mask mandate It is hard to justify requiring emergency powers and circumventing all citizen comments when the CDC was marking time on masks for more than a year Indeed if a mask mandate was key to the pandemic battle Congress could have enacted such a bill with debate transparency and accountability It did not In fact public comment is at the core of credible and transparent regulatory policy because it allows for flaws and pitfalls to be cited and hopefully corrected Despite telling us all for years to follow the science the CDC cited no scientific research to justify the mandate nor did it offer justification for choosing the age of 2 for its exemption clearly indicating the agency arbitrarily chose that age An abundance of research in major medical and scientific publications including in the Journal of the American Medical Association details the negative effects of prolonged mask wearing including among medical professionals and the military The CDC also ignored the serious and medically verified concerns voiced by Americans about how mask wearing creates severe anxiety as the two individual plaintiffs in our case detailed Clearly the federal government simply brushed away bona fide questions about mask efficacy and risk and chose not to cite rationale of its own The government s rationale is what we parents say often when our children question our demands Because I said so That approach usually doesn t work well with kids and it sure falls short in setting policy for hundreds of millions of Americans As our lawsuit pointed out never has a president entered an executive order mandating that every American citizen be required to don a type of garment or device whether when traveling or otherwise for any reason whatsoever And the U S Constitution certainly doesn t grant the president power to enact nationwide edicts just because Congress failed to pass legislation he deems needed So now that you can choose to fly or ride

Defense Fund The bill cosponsored by Sen Daniel Foreman and Rep Robert Beiswenger would have prohibited businesses and Idaho local county and state governments from requiring medical interventions for employment admission to venues transportation or providing products or services It also would have blocked schools and colleges in the state from requiring medical interventions for school attendance or entry into campus buildings The Idaho House of Representatives passed the bill March 19 in a 47 23 vote after the Senate voted 19 14 on Feb 26 in favor of the legislation Little vetoed the bill Saturday morning an hour before the deadline Medical freedom is an Idaho value Little wrote in a letter explaining his veto but he said the bill would have jeopardized the ability of schools to send home sick students with highly contagious conditions Little listed medical freedom measures he had supported in the past but said parents do not need government imposing more limitations on keeping children safe and healthy from contagious illnesses at school Manookian told The Defender that Little s claim is an absolute fabrication because nothing in the bill changes existing pertinent rules or codes that allow schools to exclude children if they are sick Little is hiding behind a lie she added If a child is sick a school has every right to send them home she said They just wouldn t be able to dictate to the parents how that illness should be treated they couldn t force the child to take a test wear a mask or take a drug Idahoans call for legislators to override the veto Medical freedom

Supreme Court last week overturned the Chevron deference doctrine that for 40 years had given federal regulatory agencies the upper hand when challenged in court Legal experts said the move will likely have mixed results You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The U S Supreme Court last week overturned a decision that for 40 years had given federal regulatory agencies the upper hand when challenged in court The court s 6 3 decision which CNN said stands to transform how the federal government works reversed the landmark 1984 decision in Chevron v Natural Resources Defense Council a case that gave rise to what s known as the Chevron deference doctrine Under the Chevron doctrine federal agencies had the power to interpret a law they administer when that law is vaguely written and courts were required to defer to the agency s interpretation of a statute In a ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts the justices rejected the Chevron deference doctrine calling it fundamentally misguided They said courts should rely on their own interpretation of ambiguous laws rather than having to accept the agency s interpretation W Scott McCollough lead litigator for Children s Health Defense s CHD Electromagnetic Radiation EMR Wireless cases and a practitioner of administrative law for more than 40 years told The Defender he was happy to see the Chevron deference doctrine go because it mostly benefitted the powerful Agencies like the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Communications Commission are supposed to work for the public but when they are captured by industry deferring to their expertise may mean deferring to the preferences of the industry they re supposed to regulate McCollough said The bottom line is that the doctrine gave the powerful the people who control the agencies a huge thumb on the scale said McCollough making it nearly impossible for regular people to challenge agency favoritism in court Dr Meryl Nass said on Substack that the crux of the issue is whether the agencies or the courts and plaintiffs should have more power Today the agencies have been captured so I prefer to take away their power Nass said But someday if they can be reined in to work for the public I might wish they had more Who has final say on interpreting the law Kim Mack Rosenberg CHD

close ties including financial ties to the industries they are charged with regulating So they lack objectivity with respect to those industries The ruling means federal judges now have more authority to interpret these laws she explained Mack Rosenberg said the ruling is very important for CHD since many of CHD s lawsuits seek to hold government agencies accountable for their action or inaction and we anticipate future litigation in this area as well Friday s ruling doesn t reopen old decisions so prior cases that used the Chevron deference doctrine in reaching an outcome won t suddenly be moot Removing the deference established by Chevron does not mean that courts will simply ignore agencies interpretations Mack Rosenberg said but the ruling gives courts more potential authority to interpret ambiguous laws without being bound by agency interpretations However she added there is also a drawback The courts many times don t have the niche field expertise required to clarify ambiguous details about certain laws This may be a problem especially in lawsuits regarding laws and regulations that are very scientifically dense or technical When Congress passes laws it sometimes intentionally leaves technical details ambiguous Mack Rosenberg said Congress doesn t have the expertise to write out everything in fine detail she said The idea is that the executive agency with its expert staff interprets and implements that law That s what federal agencies and executives are for For instance the U S Environmental Protection Agency hires people with Ph D s in the environmental sciences she said A federal judge may have zero expertise on environmental issues McCollough pointed this out too Most judges hate administrative law cases he said The topics make their heads hurt because they don t know the difference between nitrous oxide and nitrogen oxides and prefer to not have to figure that out Dissenting Justice Elena Kagan joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji

second time is encouraging In a separate but related case the Court of Appeals of the State of Washington last week granted a motion submitted by Eggleston for a stay of the commission s proceedings against him while the court is considering the case Richardson one of the attorneys representing Eggleston said the difference between the two cases is that the case before federal courts pertains to

Blaming COVID Shots According to InsuranceNewsNet insurers are especially concerned by data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that show mortality rates alarmingly rising for different categories including younger adult mortality rates that are up more than 20 above historic norms in 2023 You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Executives at the largest insurance companies in the United States are alarmed that teenagers young and white collar Americans in the prime of life are inexplicably dying at a record pace causing a monumental outflow of death claims and drag on profits that is shaking the industry and causing some to take a fresh look at the problem According to an Oct 26 report in InsuranceNewsNet U S insurance companies expected higher than normal payouts from excess deaths during the COVID 19 pandemic Insurers saw death benefits rise 15 4 in 2020 the biggest one year increase since the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic followed by a record 100 28 billion nearly double the historic norm in total death benefits paid out by the industry in 2021 The numbers were naturally forecasted to climb during the pandemic but some industry and health authorities are concerned the rates haven t greatly diminished as COVID infection rates have declined InsuranceNewsNet reported According to InsuranceNewsNet insurers are especially concerned by data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC that show mortality rates alarmingly rising for different categories including younger adult mortality rates that are up more than 20 above historic norms in 2023 The CDC numbers reported in August show the death rate for Americans ages 15 45 rose 20 24 above normal in 2020 and soared in 2021 to a nearly 30 death increase for 15 year olds and a more than 45 increase for 45 year olds RFK Jr and Brian Hooker s New Book Vax Unvax Order Now Surge in excess deaths caught carriers off guard Most troubling to insurers CDC data reported in August showed that Americans in the period January May 2023 were still dying at abnormally high rates with the pandemic long over Mortality rates were 25 higher than normal among 15 to 19 year olds and 20 higher among 45 year olds considered in the prime of life Even twenty somethings were dying at a rate nearly 15 above normal and thirty somethings at a pace 20 higher than usual the CDC data show Samantha Chow global leader for Life Annuity and Benefits Sector at Capgemini a large multinational Paris based consulting company told InsuranceNewsNet The surge in excess deaths caught carriers

for an unexpected wave of death claims and the impact on their assets under management Do they have enough reserves to weather these outflows given the excess deaths It s not just about death or health Chow said It is about the industry s ability and readiness to manage this monumental outflow The excess deaths and the record drag on insurance company revenue and the predictive chaos in actuarial tables they represent alarmed the Society of Actuaries SOA the world s largest professional actuarial organization Excess mortality is defined as excess deaths in a given population and time period above the expected number The SOA has conducted ongoing research since 2021 to gather a high level view of U S Group Term Life Insurance mortality results during the COVID 19 pandemic compared to prior baseline results The SOA Research Institute studied more than 2 7 million claims and over 120 billion in earned premiums reported by 20 of the top 21 U S group term life insurers in the U S representing approximately 90 of the employer based group term life insurance industry In an August 2022 poll among its more than 30 000 members worldwide the SOA found that 85 of members thought excess mortality rates would continue to 2025 In August this year the same poll found 79 believed excess mortality rates will continue through 2026 Life insurance executives and actuaries told InsuranceNewsNet The numbers are alarming and could continue to drag earnings and surge death claims for years to come Society of Actuaries no connection between historic death rates and COVID shots Yet in its latest report issued in May the SOA Research Institute found no connection between the historic U S death rates and insurance payouts starting in 2021 and COVID 19 vaccine mandates that rolled out the same year Chow blamed the excess deaths and claims on the ripples of COVID 19 and its varying impacts leading to higher rates of depression suicide and increased substance abuse Other

Event Reporting System VAERS VAERS run by the CDC and U S Food and Drug Administration is the government s early warning system to detect vaccine harms Dr Peter McCullough one of the most highly published cardiologists in the world pointed to a study of deaths after vaccination with detailed autopsies in Heidelberg Germany Of 35 fatalities within 20 days of injection 10 were ruled out as clearly not due to the vaccine eg drug overdose The remaining 25 71 had final diagnoses consistent with a vaccine injury syndrome including myocardial infarction worsening heart failure vascular aneurysm pulmonary embolism fatal stroke and vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia McCullough wrote He also cited his own systematic review of all autopsy studies that include COVID 19 vaccine induced myocarditis as a possible cause of death that found that all 28 deaths were causally linked to COVID 19 vaccination by independent adjudication Kory said a large and expanding volume of scientific literature has described the pathogenicity of the artificial spike protein unleashed by the mRNA injection into the body We know from research on autopsy series that among those who died from the vaccine spike protein was disseminated to all organs and vessels of the body he told The Defender Spike induced damage occurs by numerous mechanisms including necrosis of vessel walls leading to things like aortic dissection inflammation of important organs including the heart and brain causing myocarditis and cognitive deficits respectively Kory said He also also cited fibrinoid

Dowd told The Defender that according to insiders at one of the biggest insurance companies in the U S People in the industry know what s going on but nobody at the top is yet prepared to recognize it The CEOs and CFOs don t believe it s the vaccine It s not that these people are evil They re not separating facts from emotion Dowd added It s not just that there s a vast conspiracy There was this fear that generated a destruction of critical thinking My ethics professor at Indiana University said you can t rationalize facts with someone whose position is based on emotion and ego Register Now We don t have proof yet but data are persuasive In his book Dowd reported on insurance industry research in 2016 which found that group life policyholders whose health insurance is covered by Fortune 500 companies and tend to be younger and well educated were the healthiest Americans dying at one third the rate of the general U S population The trend of greater white collar health continued through 2020 But in 2021 after the COVID 19 jabs were mandated across the Fortune 500 the trend flipped Ages 25 64 of the group life policyholders suddenly experienced 40 excess mortality compared to 32 in the general population Disabilities also soared after the COVID 19 shots from an annual U S baseline of 29 30 million disabled to 33 2 million Dowd who continues to research excess deaths and disabilities for his Humanity Projects told The Defender his new research drawn from U K government statistics shows deaths of schoolchildren went down in the U K in 2020 during the pandemic because the leading cause of death for children ages 1 14 is accidents With lockdowns and school closures Deaths went down But then they started to go up again in 2021 and they ve reached a new high in 2023

them he said This is a six standard deviation Dowd said he believes the COVID 19 vaccines are causing widespread otherwise inexplicable excess deaths We don t have proof It s our thesis he said But if you have a brain in your head the data are persuasive he said Obviously I think it s the vaccines Mathew Crawford a Texas based statistician and finance specialist who spent years analyzing COVID 19 data for his Substack newsletter told The Defender the insurance industry has been in denial over growing evidence for vaccine induced excess deaths for more than a year In March 2022 he said the CEO of German health insurance giant BKK ProVita presented evidence that the vaccines had already killed tens of thousands of Germans He was fired the next day as the story vanished from the news In June 2022 Lincoln National reported a 163 increase in death benefits paid out under its group life insurance policies in 2021 In August 2022 Reinsurance Group of America s RGA financial reports showed massive 2021 losses downplayed by the report authors plus plans for new accounting methods that we should all be worried are designed to sweep iatrogenocide under the rug Crawford said The SOA Research Institute report that claims to exonerate the COVID 19 vaccines in excess deaths actually does the opposite Crawford said Among other evidence he said it shows group life insureds particularly of working age are seeing even more excess mortality than the larger U S population and the sharp numbers during Q3 2021 coincide with vaccine mandates for working age individuals The worm is turning But Dowd said he believes the worm is turning on denial of vaccine harms He said he was optimistic that the work of Josh Stirling founder of the Insurance Collaboration to Save Lives a nonprofit that aims to reduce mortality by providing life insurers with tests to screen policyholders for health problems shows a big tent is forming in the industry to tackle the problem I think the

example 25 of Republicans say they know someone personally who died from side effects of COVID 19 vaccine as do 24 of Democrats and those not affiliated with either major party This is important because this shows it is not a tribal response People from all walks of life are waking up Kory said insurance executives need to ask themselves What explains the sudden unprecedented rise in life insurance claims in the 3rd quarter of 2021 among the healthiest sector of society Why were working age white collar Americans with group life insurance policies i e largely Fortune 500 corporate employees suddenly dying at rates significantly higher than before What happened in the white collar workplace at that time he asked Kory said the answer is clear I will give you the only possibilities that could explain such a sudden rise a series of terrorist attacks wartime mobilization or the proliferation of corporate vaccine mandates As far as I can remember only one of those events actually took place Kory and investigative reporter Mary Beth Pfeiffer in October published an op ed in The Washington Examiner What s behind the spike in deaths among younger working people

checkers rated as false Kory s claim that an increase in death benefits paid out by life insurance providers in the third quarter of 2021 in the U S provides evidence that the COVID 19 vaccines which became widely available in 2021 led to a spike in deaths The AP said the vaccines are proven safe and effective and insurance industry leaders say the delta variant of the coronavirus and deferred medical care during the pandemic likely contributed to the increase in deaths The CDC says there is no evidence that excess deaths are linked to vaccines These vaccines are safe and effective and have undergone the most extensive safety monitoring in U S history a CDC public affairs specialist said The AP reported that death after vaccination remains extremely rare dismissing as not causally linked to the vaccines the unprecedented toll of deaths and injuries reported to VAERS Kory cited five takeaways that challenge that assumption from the mortality report on excess U S deaths by the SOA Research Institute Among working people 35 44 years old a stunning 34 more died than expected in the last quarter of 2022 with above average rates in other working age groups too Kory said quoting data from the SOA Research Institute report COVID 19 claims do not fully explain the increase the SOA report noted From 2020 through 2022 there were more excess deaths proportionally among white collar than blue collar workers 19 versus 14 above normal The disparity nearly doubled in the fourth quarter of 2022 U S actuaries reported The executive of a large Indiana life insurance company was clearly troubled by what he said was a 40 increase in the third quarter of 2021 in those ages 18 64 We are seeing right now the highest death rates we have seen in the history of this business not just at OneAmerica CEO Scott Davison said during an online news conference in January 2022 The data is consistent across every player in that business Excess deaths are a global phenomenon The U K also saw more excess deaths in the second half of 2022 than in the second half of any year since 2010 according to the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries In the first quarter of 2023 deaths among

issue and the SOA s strong desire to not be drawn into any debates regarding COVID vaccine lethality despite evidence unearthed by the society s research is why he and Pfeiffer wrote the USA Today op ed in the first place Unsurprisingly Kory said the SOA does not attempt to interpret or even specifically mention the timing suddenness and magnitude of the rises in death claims of young white collar workers I would agree that it is not their job to do this so the rest of us will he said The way forward is simply to ask if there were any other events preceding and during those massive spikes that

disease after paraquat exposure signaling growing public outrage over decades of corporate cover ups Paraquat increases the risk of Parkinson s disease by about 2 5 times and damages mitochondria leading to progressive movement disorders and irreversible brain degeneration according to National Institutes of Health NIH research The U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA is delaying decisive action on paraquat regulation despite mounting evidence of severe health risks allowing paraquat to remain on the market for at least four more years Despite following safety guidelines many farmers still developed Parkinson s highlighting how protective equipment and labeling failed to shield them from paraquat s dangers Protect yourself from paraquat and other toxic chemicals by checking local pesticide use installing air and water filters eating antioxidant rich foods supporting organic farming and thoroughly cleaning anything exposed to agricultural chemicals Paraquat a toxic herbicide sold by Syngenta under the brand name Gramoxone has been banned in more than 70 countries worldwide as it s been strongly linked to Parkinson s disease a progressive neurological disorder characterized by tremors muscle rigidity slowed movement and balance problems According to studies people who were exposed to paraquat were more likely to develop this disease Thousands of farmers

victims are dying every day Majed Nachawati a lawyer whose clients were not included in the multidistrict litigation told a judge that as settlement talks continued behind closed doors his clients were dying every day Another attorney Curtis Hoke warned that unless Syngenta was forced into court it would just keep delaying the reckoning He was right to worry Syngenta had already successfully postponed several trials including one set to begin just weeks before the settlement was announced This just goes to show that Syngenta s move to settle is a calculated business decision not a moral reckoning It was not because the company admits its wrongdoing but because continuing to fight would have risked exposure they couldn t afford Syngenta actively worked to conceal paraquat s risks

exposure damages the nervous system and triggers this debilitating disease Researchers compared Parkinson s patients and healthy individuals The study participants included 110 individuals diagnosed with Parkinson s disease and 358 healthy controls drawn from the Farming and Movement Evaluation Study which researched farming practices and neurological health What they found was alarming People who had used paraquat were about 2 5 times more likely to develop Parkinson s compared to those who never used it One key discovery was how paraquat behaves inside the body Unlike some toxins that get flushed out quickly paraquat stays active long enough to cause real harm Freya Kamel Ph D one of the study s co authors explained that paraquat increases the production of harmful oxygen molecules that damage delicate cellular structures Paraquat sabotages your mitochondrial function Mitochondria are the energy storehouse of your cells and are essential for keeping brain cells alive and

cognitive decline What s more paraquat triggers Parkinson s when combined with plant lectins according to a separate study The researchers found that lectins transport the toxin straight into the brain The cruel irony here is that paraquat is widely used on lectin rich crops like wheat soybeans potatoes cereal grains and beans We were able to demonstrate that if you have oral paraquat exposure even at very low levels and you also consume lectins then it could potentially trigger the formation of this protein alpha synuclein in the gut Once it s formed it can travel up the vagus nerve and to the part of the brain that triggers the onset of Parkinson s disease the researchers said This series of experiments demonstrates how the interplay between two ingested compounds can conspire to create and then transport toxic protein structures from the gut to the brain The EPA delays action while thousands continue to suffer An investigative report from The Washington Post revealed how the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA is postponing decisive action on paraquat despite rising evidence of its severe health consequences The EPA claims that additional data is needed to resolve uncertainty around the herbicide and the process of gathering additional studies could take at least four more years California s own review linked paraquat to other serious health conditions Even California s Department of Pesticide Regulation often ahead of federal action issued a scientific review linking paraquat not only to neurological harm but also to thyroid dysfunction and birth defects The EPA however claimed it hadn t had time to fully evaluate those findings despite citing the report as a reason to suspend its own regulatory decision In 2021 the EPA reapproved paraquat for another 15 years The approval was challenged by Earthjustice which filed a lawsuit against the EPA claiming the agency repeatedly understated the extent of paraquat s adverse effects In response to that lawsuit the EPA asked the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to allow it to revisit its analysis of paraquat While agencies are delaying action farmers continue to suffer David Jilbert a former

your brain and kidneys by triggering oxidative stress and mitochondrial failure you need to eliminate as much exposure as possible and support your body s natural defenses against oxidative damage Here s what I recommend you start doing today Know if paraquat is used near your home or workplace Investigate if paraquat is sprayed in your area by checking state pesticide use databases or asking local farm bureaus If you are living near farms that grow wheat cotton orchards or pastures you are at higher risk Knowing your local risk is the first step to protecting yourself Install high quality air and water filtration systems Paraquat drifts through the air and contaminates groundwater I would strongly urge you to invest in an indoor air purifier with a true HEPA filter and an activated carbon layer For water use a reverse osmosis filtration system because standard filters are not enough to remove herbicide residues Support your mitochondria with targeted nutrition Your mitochondria are the first victims of paraquat exposure and weak mitochondria make you more vulnerable to oxidative stress Eat foods rich in antioxidants that naturally help neutralize reactive oxygen species like berries citrus fruits carrots and beets Advocate for organic and regenerative farming practices If you are a consumer buying produce shift toward farmers and brands that avoid toxic chemical herbicides If you are a farmer yourself start exploring organic or regenerative farming systems that don t rely on paraquat or similar toxins Every purchase you make or conversation you start has power Changing demand changes the system over time Detox your home and habits Wash all produce thoroughly even organic Take off your shoes before entering your home to avoid tracking in contaminated dust If you handle any materials that could have paraquat on them like work clothes from farming or landscaping jobs wash them separately from your family s laundry These small actions will help lower your cumulative exposure significantly FAQs about Syngenta s Paraquat herbicide Q What is paraquat and why is it dangerous A Paraquat is a highly toxic herbicide sold under the brand name Gramoxone

amicus brief urging the North Carolina Supreme Court to overturn the dismissal of a case involving a 14 year old boy who was given the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine against his will and without his parents consent In August 2022 Emily Happel and her teenage son Tanner Smith sued the Guilford County Board of Education and Old North State Medical Society after Smith was given a dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine which at the time was available only under emergency use authorization EUA by clinic workers at a school vaccination site The vaccine was administered in August 2021 Smith and Happel alleged battery violation of a North Carolina statute prohibiting vaccination with EUA products without parental consent and constitutional violations The trial court dismissed the case in February 2023 on several grounds including that the defendants are immune under the federal Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act or PREP Act and that relevant state laws are preempted by the PREP Act In March 2024 the North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court s dismissal of the lawsuit After Happel and Smith petitioned the North Carolina Supreme Court the court agreed on May 23 to hear arguments about whether the PREP Act protects the defendants from liability and suit and preempts North Carolina s laws governing the plaintiffs claims A hearing has yet to be scheduled CHD s amicus brief argues that the lower courts were wrong to interpret the PREP Act as they did because the U S Constitution does not give Congress authority to nullify state laws governing the in state activities that gave rise to the plaintiffs claims The brief states The lower courts wrongly interpreted PREP as nullifying the North Carolina common statutory and constitutional law that would

Walker said We hope that the Court will determine that Congress did not close the courthouse doors to parents who are attempting to direct the medical care that their child receives We simply want the Supreme Court of North Carolina to give us our day in court where we can present our case fully Walker said the case is also important because it impacts the ability of a child who was 14 at the time to reject an injection that he did not want to receive PREP Act doesn t nullify state laws referenced in the case CHD s amicus brief highlighted the legal argument behind why the lower courts were wrong to say that the PREP Act nullified North Carolina laws relevant to Happel and Smith s case According to CHD s brief federal law reigns supreme only where the Constitution empowers the Federal Government to act and Congress can permissibly nullify state law only through statutes enacted pursuant to an enumerated power Enumerated powers are the powers granted to Congress by the Constitution according to Cornell Law School s Legal Information Institute The brief argues that the specific enumerated power that Congress relied on when it passed the PREP Act called Commerce Clause power does not give the federal government authority to nullify the state laws that govern the claims in the case That s because the underlying activity in this case the vaccination of a minor with an EUA product over his objection and without his parents consent was not commercial or economic and had virtually no effect on interstate commerce Evans said Accordingly as applied by the lower courts the

discuss Target s surveillance system Background on BIPA Passed in 2008 Illinois BIPA safeguards residents biometric data such as facial scans and fingerprints The act recognizes the unique nature of biometric information emphasizing that unlike other personal data like social security numbers biometric identifiers cannot be easily changed if compromised This makes people particularly vulnerable to identity theft and other risks if their biometric data is mishandled Under BIPA companies collecting biometric data in Illinois must follow strict guidelines First they must inform individuals in writing that their biometric information is being collected and specify the purpose and duration of its use Second they must obtain a written release from the individual before collecting the data Third companies must develop and make publicly available a retention schedule and guidelines for permanently destroying the collected biometric data Violating BIPA can result in significant penalties for companies including damages ranging from 1 000 for each negligent violation to 5 000 for each intentional or reckless violation liability for attorneys fees and other litigation expenses precisely the relief the plaintiffs in the current lawsuit are seeking Similar lawsuits and settlements BIPA unique to Illinois provides protections rarely granted by other states s laws This has led to hundreds of David and Goliath legal battles against some of the world s most powerful companies some resulting in huge settlements according to NBC Chicago In recent years several tech giants have found themselves in the crosshairs of Illinois biometric privacy law The most notable case involves Facebook which settled a class action lawsuit for 650 million in 2022 The social media behemoth was accused of collecting and storing digital scans of users faces without permission As a result over 1 million Illinois Facebook users received checks for nearly 400 each Google Snapchat and TikTok also faced their own BIPA lawsuits Google was accused of violating BIPA through its Google Photos service which between 2015 and 2022 allegedly collected and stored biometric data of Illinois residents who

in which some government programs incentivize farming practices that add to the pollution even as other government programs try to induce farmers to reduce the pollution You re talking about systemic dysfunction said Matt Liebman professor emeritus of agronomy and sustainable agriculture at Iowa State University ISU An extraordinary task The U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA has called nutrient pollution The single greatest challenge to our nation s water quality and acknowledges that much of the nutrient pollution flowing into the northern Gulf originates on agricultural land For nearly 30 years the agency has led a task force that includes tribal leaders and officials from 12 states working together to try to impede fertilizer and manure from running off cropland at the center of the country The task force has set a goal of reducing the five year average extent of the hypoxic zone in the Gulf to less than 2 000 square miles by 2035 To meet that goal the task force has been trying to cut total nitrogen and phosphorous loads in the water by 20 by 2025 and 48 by 2035 Key to the effort is a suite of voluntary conservation practices promoted by the U S Department of Agriculture USDA aimed at reducing pollution including idling land not tilling before planting using cover crops to protect the soil and building retention ponds and wetlands to collect and absorb nitrogen Farmers are also encouraged to plant nitrogen absorbing vegetation in buffer strips along streams The USDA said in 2015 that the conservation programs were making headway but in 2022 reported that efforts to reduce flows of nitrogen and phosphorus off farmland were showing negligible results in Conservation Practices on Cultivated Croplands Neither the EPA nor the USDA responded to requests for interviews The U S has spent more than 30 billion since 1997 on efforts to clean up the Mississippi Basin but in a 2023 progress report to Congress the EPA said much more work is needed Reducing nutrient loads is an extraordinary task the EPA report states Attempts to intercept treat or otherwise address nutrients after they are mobilized on the landscape are complex difficult and often costly Last summer the oxygen depleted Gulf hypoxic zone measured roughly 3 000 square miles which was smaller than in previous years But experts said that was mostly due to a deep drought in

river s flow into the Gulf In 2021 after a wet spring and summer the Gulf s hypoxic zone was close to 6 000 square miles And despite government efforts nutrient loads to the Gulf in 2020 tallied roughly 3 7 billion pounds of nitrogen and 452 million pounds of phosphorous from what the government calls the Mississippi Atchafalaya River Basin or MARB the task force said in its report That was up from total MARB nutrient loads to the Gulf in 2017 which were approximately 3 3 billion pounds of nitrogen and 314 million pounds of phosphorus according to the 2019 task force progress report More nitrogen is coming off the fields said R Eugene Turner professor emeritus of oceanography and coastal sciences at Louisiana State University and an expert on the Gulf hypoxic zone On average the load and the concentrations of nitrogen in the river are not coming down Silvia Secchi a professor and natural resource economist at the University of Iowa agreed We have a tremendous amount of nutrients that pollute all the waters here and end up killing fish and damaging the environment downstream said Secchi Government agencies tell you they are spending all this money therefore they must be doing something right she said But if you look at water quality data at what s really happening it s getting worse not better Like a jigsaw puzzle There s a reason federal and state agencies count so heavily on conservation practices to cure nutrient pollution In field trials conducted by agricultural universities and where farmers apply them over a period of years they really work The use of cover crops which are planted not to be harvested but to provide a protective layer over soil has been found to significantly reduce nutrient runoff Planting vegetation in drainage ditches installing sediment retention ponds and building wetlands are also known to be effective Two of the largest conservation programs are the Conservation Stewardship Program CSP and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program EQIP both administered by the USDA Last year the USDA spent 400 million in CSP and EQIP payments in the six biggest Mississippi River Basin farm states Illinois Indiana Iowa

runoff and lower expenses say the biggest impediments are the substantial changes required in how they farm And their fear of losing productivity and revenue As a specialist with the Iowa Department of Agriculture who counsels farmers on best management practices Porter explains it this way It s perceived risk Fear and worry about the effects on their drainage and their bottom line and on yields It s a different system of farming than the one they re using Porter says his Iowa farm is an example of how effective changing farm practices can be in improving water quality He started planting cover crops in 2011 on 550 acres to reduce erosion build soil health and keep excess nitrogen fertilizer in the ground He constructed buffer zones in low lying areas to prevent nitrogen from draining into streams He retired 13 acres and raised a fertilizer free meadow The cost has been paid by state and federal grants As his diligence and techniques took hold over a decade the farm s soil fertility improved and the amount of fertilizer he spread diminished as did the level of toxic nutrients leaving his land Samples of water draining from his farm showed nitrogen concentrations of 1 2 parts per million or less equivalent to natural background levels It s a little like a jigsaw puzzle said Porter It s a systemic solution with multiple layers of best management practices that you fit together based on your topography your soil types It s all available It can work Porter is trying to convince other farmers in his state to follow in his footsteps I m getting yields that I m happy

One big reason many farmers have not been eager to embrace changes that lead to cleaner water is simply because they have not had to The federal Clean Water Act enacted in 1972 provided the EPA and states the powerful authority to limit chemicals and contaminants from being discharged into U S waterways through a point source defined as pipes and manmade ditches The law does not consider flows from irrigated croplands or stormwater discharges as point sources At the time in the early 1970s the implications of waiving oversight of farm pollution were not thoroughly evaluated U S agriculture largely consisted of smaller lower polluting mixed crop and livestock farms that grazed animals in manure absorbing pastures But carving farms out of the Clean Water Act s reach has since proved to be a significant factor in worsening water quality Had the farm sector been held accountable for its waste it would have been compelled to keep fertilizer and manure waste spread on fields out of surface and groundwater That in turn would have kept farms operating at a scale that brought environmental costs in line with revenue Another barrier to any meaningful reduction in nutrient pollution is the action by Congress to incentivize farmers to plant corn a crop that when conventionally grown requires large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer U S farmers grow more corn each year than they can sell driven by government incentives a practice that enriches companies selling corn seed and the chemicals used to grow corn but results in a range of harmful environmental impacts including fouling waterways The scale of the problem dwarfs the level of response unless you change the design of the dominant crop and livestock production systems said ISU s Liebman When it was first identified in the 1950s what scientists now call the Northern Gulf Hypoxia Zone was seen as a small biological curiosity But in the 1980s as researchers gained a greater understanding of the peril to marine life they started mapping the size of the toxic zone documenting its ominous growth Congress passed the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act in 1998 to address pollution in U S coastal waters by pinpointing sources of nutrient contamination and their environmental consequences and working to slash the pollution Now more than two decades later the money and time seem largely wasted

Million to U S Virologist Who Worked With Wuhan Lab But Court Rules He Can Hide the Data A North Carolina judge rejected a FOIA claim for documents related to gain of function experiments conducted by virologist Ralph Baric Ph D U S Right to Know sued to obtain the documents believing they contain crucial evidence about the origin of COVID 19 By Jeff Carlson and Hans Mahncke A judge in North Carolina has rejected a Freedom of Information FOIA claim for documents that almost certainly contain crucial evidence about the origin of COVID 19 The case was brought by the transparency group U S Right to Know The target of the request was the world s most renowned expert on coronaviruses and godfather of gain of function experiments Ralph Baric Ph D who runs the Baric Lab at the University of North Carolina UNC Baric is the brains behind the 2018 DEFUSE blueprint for making COVID 19 like viruses in the lab The blueprint was designed in collaboration with Shi Zhengli the Director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology at whose lab some of the work was to have been done DEFUSE was not the first project on which Shi and Baric worked together In 2015 they created SARS viruses in a lab that could infect humans At the time Rutgers biologist Richard Ebright warned that the Shi Baric experiments would cause a worldwide pandemic He was sadly proven right While Shi and her laboratory have garnered significant attention Baric has largely remained under the radar This may be understandable given that Shi s lab is situated in the city where the pandemic originated however it is somewhat counterintuitive when one considers the availability of evidence On Sept 12 2019 shortly before the outbreak began in Wuhan Shi s lab deleted its entire virus database Although this action is incriminating the likelihood of obtaining any data from China has always been virtually nonexistent In contrast for Baric who falls under U S jurisdiction the prospects of acquiring information should have been nearly certain unless he was being shielded from scrutiny What makes the lack of interest in Baric whether from the media Congress or any other oversight body even more curious is that as we report here for the first time he has received at least a quarter of a billion dollars in U S taxpayer funding over the past two decades A further curiosity is that when Dr Anthony Fauci learned of the likely lab origin of COVID 19 in January 2020 and convened his now infamous secret conference among supposed experts Baric was notably missing It never made any sense why the world s most

never made any sense why the world s most prominent expert on coronaviruses was excluded from a crucial meeting at the highest levels of the U S government whose reported intention was to learn more about the new virus When Fauci was asked about Baric he claimed under oath that he had heard of the name but had never met the man It was later revealed when Fauci s schedules were released pursuant to a FOIA lawsuit against Fauci s organization the National Institutes of Health NIH that not only did Fauci know Baric well but that the two men had a long meeting in Fauci s office shortly after the pandemic started All these facts were hidden from the public When U S Right to Know started making FOIA requests for Baric s data related to his collaboration with Shi and with respect to the DEFUSE blueprint they ran into a brick wall The transparency organization then sued for the data but was once again stymied by UNC at every step of the way Eventually the matter came before Alyson Grine a judge for Orange and Chatham Counties in North Carolina last week Shockingly Grine sided with Baric and ruled that but for a handful of useless documents he would not have to hand over anything U S Right to Know is now considering its legal options By analyzing the grants awarded to Baric over the past two decades we can confirm that he has received taxpayer funding exceeding 262 million This figure is based solely on grants awarded to Baric When considering other indirect funding sources the actual amount may be significantly higher Notably Baric s first multi million dollar grant awarded in 2005 was for the development of Vaccine Candidates for the SARS Coronavirus How is it possible for a government funded scientist who has received over a quarter of a billion dollars from taxpayers to conceal the data obtained with those funds President Joe Biden s hand picked NIH Director Monica Bertagnolli has just announced that her organization prioritizes integrity and transparency However the continued funding of Baric coupled with the lack of any effort to obtain the missing data suggests that what she truly values is dishonesty and the concealment of facts However there is another

S Right to Know somehow was unlucky enough to have drawn the worst possible individual to decide whether Baric could conceal his documents Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us According to testimonials posted by Grine on her own website she appears to be a social justice warrior focused on racial and equity issues In other words she is the least suitable individual to preside over a case that challenges the Deep State Far from representing checks and balances against the Deep State she is in fact a product of it Unsurprisingly she was appointed by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper a democrat who advocates for so called diversity equity and inclusion DEI But even if Grine were not a DEI judge the mere fact that she both studied and later worked at UNC should have meant her recusal from the case There is simply no justification for government funded scientists to conceal their data data that the public has financed An honest scientist would not only be eager but also proud to share their data Baric s lawyers assert that he holds intellectual property rights over his data however even setting aside the question of how someone can claim proprietary rights based on taxpayer funded projects the fact that COVID 19 caused the deaths of 20 million people and damages of at least 30 trillion should have taken precedence over any intellectual property claims The irony that we are expected to believe COVID 19 originated in nature while simultaneously accepting that intellectual property rights are involved does not escape us One aspect we have not yet discussed is the role of the intelligence community and the U S Department of Defense in this matter It is known that Shi and the Wuhan Institute of Virology worked for the Chinese Communist Party

Monsanto owner Bayer AG for health problems they said were caused by their exposure to toxic PCBs in fluorescent lighting in the school where they worked They alleged Monsanto concealed the dangers of PCBs to elevate company profits An appeals court overturned the verdict and then last year the plaintiffs asked the Washington Supreme Court to review the case on three issues including whether or not a state statute that gives plaintiffs only 12 years to bring product liability claims is constitutional Each side will have 30 minutes to argue their positions to the Washington Supreme Court panel of justices The court is also expected to hear competing arguments over whether the plaintiffs should have been able to seek punitive damages and if testimony from a plaintiff s exposure expert should have been excluded More than 200 other teachers students and family members have sued Bayer alleging brain damage from exposure to PCBs at the same school The rest of these cases are all kind of waiting in the wings behind this appeal said Deepak Gupta an attorney for the plaintiffs with the Gupta Wessler law firm If Bayer were to win the statute of repose issue the rest of the cases from the

another type of toxic persistent chemicals said Gupta If other courts were to decide that a statute of repose applies for claims involving forever chemicals that logic could allow manufacturers to escape liability if they made the chemicals decades earlier even though PFAS too can impact people s health many years later he said Both sides arguments regarding the statute of repose and punitive damages rest in part on which state s laws should be applied to the case While the alleged injuries occurred in Washington Monsanto was based in Missouri and though Washington law applies a statute of repose and generally does not allow punitive damages Missouri law would not apply such a statute of repose and does allow for punitive damages When asked for comment about the upcoming hearing Bayer said the claims forming this case and others resulting from exposures at the same school relate to bulk industrial materials Monsanto voluntarily ceased manufacturing in 1977 and are unrelated to any ongoing business Bayer a German conglomerate that bought Monsanto in 2018 additionally states on its website that materials and fixtures contaminated with PCBs were installed by other companies and were decades beyond their useful lives The evidence also is not sufficient in these cases to support a causation and liability finding against the company Bayer states Exposure to PCBs in the air is typically in trace concentrations not significant enough to cause increased risk to health In addition buildings with claimed PCB issues also are often dealing with other indoor air quality issues and air circulation issues Until they were banned by the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA in 1979 PCBs were commonly used in light fixtures caulk paint and building materials The chemicals have

contain caulk contaminated with PCBs according to a 2016 study with a report from the office of Sen Ed Markey D Mass finding that the cleanup could cost up to 50 billion In November 2024 Markey and Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan of Virginia reintroduced a bill that would authorize 52 billion over 10 years to help schools rid their buildings of toxic chemicals including PCBs Despite the widespread contamination the EPA does not require schools to test for the chemicals although it does offer guidelines for schools that do The agency has been identifying potential sources of PCBs in schools and studying methods to reduce their emissions according to an EPA website Last April the EPA denied a request from the Washington Department of Ecology urging the federal government to set tighter limits on PCBs in consumer products to reduce pollution of its waterways The Washington Supreme Court appeal comes after Bayer agreed to a 160 million settlement with Seattle last summer for PCB pollution in a major river that runs through the city Washington won 95 million in a 2016 settlement with Monsanto after it became the first state to sue the company Other states including Illinois Maryland New Jersey Oregon and Vermont have filed lawsuits alleging contamination from Monsanto PCBs In 2000 a class action suit involving about 2 500 cities and towns across multiple states

female teens Eventually two girls joined the experiment providing crucial insights into gender differences in smartphone use and its effects Aitkenhead discovered that while boys primarily used their smartphones for Snapchat Spotify and sports videos girls spent significantly more time on social media platforms This seemed to have a more profound negative impact on the girls mental health and self image which lines up with Haidt s research findings The two day unsupervised camping trip tested the teens ability to navigate the real world without constant digital connection This aspect of the experiment addressed another key concern in Haidt s work the loss of independence and free play in modern childhood Haidt shared these points in an introduction to an article about the unsupervised

changes to their practices under the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA even when their towers make people sick in their homes a federal appeals court ruled The ruling came as a blow to plaintiff Henry Hank Allen who alleged the radiofrequency RF radiation emitted by a cell tower installed next to his home triggered more than 15 episodes of atrial fibrillation Allen told The Defender the ruling confirms the deeply troubling reality that there is no legal remedy for Americans being injured by wireless infrastructure Under the current interpretation of the ADA people like me who are disabled by involuntary exposure to cell tower radiation are simply left behind Allen said In effect the wireless industry has been given a license to harm and a get out of jail free card They can place harmful towers next to homes schools and businesses without consequences even when people are getting sick In late 2023 Allen sued Verizon and other companies involved in the operation of the tower alleging Verizon s tower triggered a slew of health symptoms including life threatening cardiac events extreme fatigue impaired memory and vision sleep disruption and flu like symptoms Children s Health Defense CHD funded the suit Allen s case was the first in CHD s strategic line of cases seeking relief for people disabled by RF radiation under the ADA a federal law that protects people with disabilities in many areas of public life The complaint argued that the space on the tower leased to the telecommunications companies and associated infrastructure that are necessary to access the internet constitute a physical place subject to compliance with the ADA However the U S District Court for the District of Idaho dismissed the case ruling that wireless companies cellular networks are not a place of public accommodation under the ADA On May 12 the U S Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed the lower court s ruling W Scott McCollough lead litigator for CHD s

under the ADA However Verizon couldn t be required to alter the RF radiation emitted by its tower so that RF disabled individuals like Allen could access the company s internet service without getting sick Miriam Eckenfels director of CHD s EMR and Wireless Program said Allen s case shows it s nearly impossible to get relief for people suffering from RF radiation exposure symptoms once a tower goes up near them These rulings emphasize the importance of fighting cell towers before they go up through our Stop 5G program and toppling the ridiculous regime of federal preemption that leaves people exposed and vulnerable with no recourse Eckenfels said Allen agreed There are only two meaningful legal paths forward We must change our local wireless zoning codes to restore control at the community level and we must repeal the preemption laws both state and federal that strip that control away That s why I m asking everyone to join the 704NoMore movement This is how we turn our pain into purpose Allen said CHD s 704 No More initiative is raising money to legally challenge Section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 which prohibits local authorities from denying cell tower applications based on health and environmental effects Eckenfels said people who experience negative symptoms from RF radiation may sometimes feel hopeless but CHD will continue to fight on their behalf Allen said

engaging in several forms of discrimination against Haller McCollough said The appeal asks the 8th Circuit court to vacate the District Court s judgment and send the case back to the District Court Alternatively Haller should be allowed to amend her suit McCollough said the exact issues in the Haller and Allen cases differ but the outcome of their rulings is the same regarding the ADA The bottom line is that wireless companies can t be forced to make ADA mandated accommodations or modifications to their practices or policies when their towers make people nearby sick even in their homes he

Telehealth firms that partner with pharmaceutical companies prescribe more medications and their physicians are more likely to receive inappropriate financial incentives from pharma companies according to a U S Senate investigation The investigation focused on websites launched by drug companies that refer patients to hand selected telehealth companies that can prescribe their medications These relationships have drawn criticism from consumer advocates and lawmakers who fear patients are being pushed to buy expensive and unnecessary medication according to The Washington Post The Senate s report published last week followed a nine month investigation led by Sens Dick Durbin D Ill Bernie Sanders I Vt Elizabeth Warren D Mass and Peter Welch D Vt Most patients who used new telehealth platforms launched by pharmaceutical manufacturers were given a prescription frequently for drugs offered by the same pharmaceutical company according to the report At best these relationships raise questions about conflicts of interest At worst they create the potential for inappropriate prescribing that can unnecessarily increase spending for federal health care programs the

that telehealth firms Populus Health Technologies and LillyDirect linked Cove let patients preselect the drug they want to receive even before meeting with a physician The report also suggested many

examination of the child s medical records by a leading expert Serious health risks associated with MMR vaccine The measles vaccine was first introduced in the U S in 1963 but is now available only as a component of the MMR vaccine The vaccine has significantly reduced the number of reported measles cases but immunity from the vaccine wanes according to Physicians for Informed Consent PIC Research shows that about 60 of vaccinated children are susceptible to subclinical measles infection and by age 24 26 33 of adults are susceptible to clinical infection PIC reported Evidence exists of serious health risks associated with the MMR vaccine The package insert for Merck s MMRII says M M R II vaccine has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of fertility Research also shows the MMR vaccine causes febrile seizures anaphylaxis meningitis encephalitis thrombocytopenia arthralgia and vasculitis Researchers in 2004 found that boys vaccinated with their first MMR vaccine on time were 67 more likely to be diagnosed with autism compared to boys who got their first vaccine after their 3rd birthday The CDC recommends children receive their first dose of

its COVID 19 vaccines and trying to intimidate critics who questioned those claims You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Monday contested Pfizer s motion to dismiss the state s lawsuit accusing the drug giant of false misleading or deceptive marketing of its COVID 19 vaccines and trying to intimidate critics who questioned those claims According to the lawsuit filed Nov 30 2023 Pfizer s claims about the efficacy duration of protection and ability of its COVID 19 vaccine to prevent transmission violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act The lawsuit also alleged Pfizer cited misleading statistics concealed negative data and made unsupported statements about the vaccine s efficacy against variants like Delta and that those actions negatively affected Texas citizens Paxton is seeking over 10 million in civil penalties plus injunctive relief barring Pfizer from making claims about vaccine efficacy similar to those challenged in the lawsuit Pfizer denied the allegations last year when the lawsuit was filed telling Reuters the case had no merit and defending its claims about the vaccine as accurate and science based Last month Pfizer moved to dismiss the lawsuit The company argued that under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act PREP Act Pfizer was protected from liability claims regarding its COVID 19 vaccine medical countermeasure authorized for emergency use under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FD C Act In its motion to dismiss Pfizer reiterated its claim that since the beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic tens of millions of lives were saved by vaccination quoting a recent JAMA article by the U S Food and Drug Administration s FDA Dr Robert Califf and Peter Marks M D Ph D Pfizer said that without the protection afforded to vaccine makers under the PREP Act the company would not have been able to distribute its life saving vaccine The company also argued that Texas can t bring a claim under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act which protects consumers because the so called consumers in this case received their vaccines from the federal government for free Best piercing of the PREP Act

the immunity protection provided under PREP and invoked by Pfizer in this case extends only to possible personal injury claims It does not extend to deceptive marketing parens patriae claims brought by a sovereign the motion said Under parens patriae a state has the right to protect its citizens and can file lawsuits on their behalf Paxton also said Pfizer incorrectly alleged that the lawsuit contested the FDA s regulatory decision to authorize the vaccine But according to the motion the state did not challenge the FDA s emergency authorization of Pfizer s vaccine In fact the state agreed with the FDA s evaluation that the vaccine authorized for emergency use had limited efficacy data and would require further evaluation as the drug was rolled out Texas concerns were not with the FDA s authorization and later approval but with Pfizer s actions following the authorization the motion said Right on the mark Ray Flores senior outside counsel to Children s Health Defense told The Defender Paxton s strong opposition to Pfizer s motion to dismiss is right on the mark He said that because the PREP Act extends to marketing and promotion of a countermeasure it is true that a private citizen can t bring a false advertising or fraud claim against Pfizer Texas contends it can bring a parens patriae claim that PREP won t cover I agree Flores said This is the best piercing of the PREP veil I ve ever seen Flores said Texas made a strong case which he believes will prevail Still people should not get their hopes up for disclosure of bombshell documents Flores said because

vaccine protected against transmission according to the original complaint and reiterated in the motion Paxton filed yesterday Paxton also noted that the clinical trial data assessed vaccine efficacy only against the original virus strain Yet within weeks Pfizer s CEO Albert Bourla went on major news networks promoting that the company s vaccine possessed the very qualities FDA told Pfizer it had not shown the motion alleged misrepresentations outlined in great detail in the original complaint As a result it said Texans heard that the vaccine prevented transmission protected against the Delta strain and was 95 effective And unvaccinated Texans were subjected to a public culture of fear and shame created by claims that their own vaccination status would affect those around them the motion stated The suit also alleged Pfizer s claim that its vaccine was 95 effective against infection was highly misleading from day one because it represented only the relative risk reduction instead of the absolute risk reduction In its calculation of relative risk reduction Pfizer compared only the small subsets of the vaccine and placebo groups who developed COVID 19 systems during the trial 8 versus 162 people respectively instead of considering the entire cohort of nearly 35 000 trial participants according to the original petition Even the FDA the petition said prefers that drug manufacturers advertise absolute risk reduction the actual decrease in risk between getting a treatment or not Pfizer s clinical trial showed absolute risk reduction of only 0 85 according to the motion In other words the Pfizer vaccine reduced a person s risk of getting COVID 19 by less than one percent the motion said but Pfizer never mentioned that fact Pfizer also publicly touted the vaccine s effectiveness in a way that was materially different from what it tested for in the trial The company claimed the vaccine prevented COVID 19 but it only measured whether trial participants tested positive and displayed certain symptoms according to the motion It is now also beyond cavil that Pfizer s unsubstantiated claims ultimately turned out to be false Countless vaccine recipients

and kids in ways that are misleading deceptive and dangerous The investigation comes as the practice of adding fluoride to drinking water is under increasing scrutiny by communities across the country with two states and many towns and counties banning the practice over safety concerns Yesterday the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA also announced it is moving to take fluoride prescription supplements off the market because of the risks fluoride ingestion poses to children s IQ behavioral issues thyroid functioning and gut microbiome Paxton accused toothpaste manufacturers of continuing to flavor their products and deceptively market them in ways that encourage kids to ingest fluoride toothpaste and mislead their parents to use far more than the safe and recommended amount of fluoride toothpaste The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the American Dental Association the American Academy of Pediatrics and others recommend that children under age 3 should use no more than a smear of fluoride toothpaste and children ages 3 to 6 should use no more than a pea sized amount However research has shown that advertising and labeling tactics by toothpaste manufacturers prompt parents to use more toothpaste than is safe leading to toothpaste overconsumption by children A 2024 study published in Nature found that parents tend to overload toothbrushes by a factor of six to seven times the recommended amount Paxton said he will use every tool available to protect our kids from dangerous levels of fluoride exposure and deceptive advertising and take aggressive

Immunity Shield Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Wednesday filed a motion in the U S Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit arguing that Texas consumer laws are not preempted by the federal liability shield granted to COVID 19 vaccine makers under the federal PREP Act You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A lawsuit filed by Texas state officials against Pfizer alleging the vaccine maker violated the state s consumer protection laws by misleading the public about its COVID 19 vaccine should be allowed to proceed Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told a Texas appeals court this week In an appellant brief filed Wednesday in the U S Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit the state argued that Texas consumer laws are not preempted by the federal liability shield granted to COVID 19 vaccine makers under the federal Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act PREP Act Texas sued Pfizer in state court in November 2023 alleging the company s false and deceptive marketing of its COVID 19 vaccine violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act DTPA In January 2024 Pfizer successfully shifted the case to federal court The U S District Court for the Northern District of Texas Lubbock Division dismissed the suit in December 2024 Texas appealed in January Texas claims Pfizer capitalized on Americans fear of the unknown by touting its vaccine as a miracle cure Pfizer s claims led Texas consumers to make choices they would not have otherwise made while Pfizer enriched itself based on these misleading statements to the tune of billions of dollars The state also alleges that Pfizer s misleading statements about its COVID 19 vaccine were coupled with the company s censorship of scientists that set the record straight Texas seeks over 10 million in civil penalties and an injunction barring Pfizer from making similar claims about vaccine efficacy in the future Pfizer has denied the allegations telling Reuters in 2023 the case had no merit and defending its claims about its COVID 19 vaccine as accurate and science based Pfizer sought dismissal of the case arguing that it is immune from liability under the PREP Act which shields COVID 19

The all consuming reach of the PREP Act s tentacles is being challenged once again Flores said I say it over and over again PREP is public enemy No 1 State consumer protection law supersedes PREP Act Texas says In his December 2024 dismissal of Texas lawsuit Senior U S District Judge Sam R Cummings accepted Pfizer s claim of immunity under the PREP Act and rejected Texas argument that Pfizer s marketing statements about its COVID 19 vaccine were connected to trade or commerce or any consumer transaction But in its brief Texas argued the PREP Act s liability shield only extends to claims for loss and does not shield against consumer protection cases filed by the state instead of individual consumers According to the brief in cases brought under the Texas DTPA the state can sue in cases of alleged false misleading or deceptive conduct in trade or commerce when such an action would be in the public interest The brief also argues that the PREP Act s liability shield blocks only those claims involving the administration of a covered product to an individual and does not extend to sovereign consumer protection suits Texas also argued that the immunity shield cannot plausibly be read to cover governmental suits for misrepresentations Flores criticized the lower court s dismissal and said Texas has presented a strong case that a federal appeals court must consider The Texas District Court s one page dismissal is a prime example of the outmoded knee jerk reaction that anything goes under PREP Flores said Whether the state attorney general has the authority which he obviously does to protect its citizens must now be considered and ruled upon by the 5th Circuit Flores agreed with Texas argument that state consumer protection law falls outside the scope of the PREP

Flores said Kansas lawsuit alleges Pfizer violated previous agreements with the state A similar lawsuit filed by Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach also challenges Pfizer s claims about the safety and efficacy of its COVID 19 vaccine According to Flores the Kansas case is one of several important PREP challenges nationwide and is stronger than Texas case Kobach filed the lawsuit in state court in June 2024 alleging Pfizer made misleading claims about the safety and effectiveness of its vaccine and used denial and delay tactics confidentiality agreements and an extended study timeline to conceal significant safety concerns and critical data about the vaccine Pfizer must be held accountable for falsely representing the benefits of its COVID 19 vaccine while concealing and suppressing the truth about its vaccine s safety risks waning effectiveness and inability to prevent transmission the lawsuit states According to the lawsuit Pfizer s misrepresentations also run afoul of three consent judgments agreements between Pfizer and the state of Kansas in 2008 2012 and 2014 stemming from previous cases in which the company agreed not to make misleading claims about its products in the future For example as part of the 2008 consent judgment Pfizer agreed it would not make any written or oral claim that is false misleading or deceptive regarding any FDA approved Pfizer product through any medium Pfizer made similar promises in the 2012 and 2014 judgments According to Flores the previous consent judgments form the centerpiece of Kansas case against Pfizer He rejected Pfizer s claims that the PREP Act supersedes those agreements Kansas v Pfizer has an extra added benefit of three consent judgments where Pfizer promised not to mislead the citizens of Kansas Flores said

said the Kansas lawsuit is similar to a lawsuit challenging AstraZeneca for breach of contract after the company reneged on a promise to provide medical treatment to a clinical trial participant who sustained serious injuries after receiving the company s vaccine Brianne Dressen sued AstraZeneca in May 2024 alleging she was disabled by the company s COVID 19 vaccine in 2020 According to the complaint AstraZeneca s consent form for trial participants promised medical treatment for illness or injury suffered during the study but the company reneged on this promise AstraZeneca argued it was immune under the provisions of the PREP Act But in November 2024 a federal court ruled that the act s liability shield does not extend to breach of contract claims According to the ruling Dressen s claim is based on a broken promise not a countermeasure There is a breach of contract element reminiscent of the so far successful Dressen v AstraZeneca Flores said adding that AstraZeneca faces an uphill battle in that case According to Flores another case that might successfully overcome the PREP Act s liability shield is a North Carolina lawsuit filed in state court in 2022 by the mother of a 14 year old boy who was administered a COVID 19 vaccine at his school without his or his family s consent Last month the Supreme Court of North Carolina overturned the decisions of two lower courts

a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Health and Human Services HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr on Tuesday cheered the use of what The New York Times called unconventional treatments for

vitamin A and vitamin D budesonide a steroid used to relieve inflammation affecting the airways and clarithromycin an antibiotic In an exclusive interview with The Defender Dr Ben Edwards shared the backstory on the positive results that he and other Texas doctors have recently seen using those treatments in responding to the West Texas measles outbreak The standard of care treatment for measles is supportive care including fever reducers cough suppressants and fluids Edwards said Texas Medical Board Rule 200 allows for Texas physicians to also offer complementary and alternative treatment options in which he is well versed According to Edwards the Feb 26 death of a Texas child who tested positive for measles might have been prevented if hospital staff had given her breathing treatments

triggered by respiratory viruses Edwards is an integrative medicine family practitioner in Lubbock who runs a private practice serving roughly 2 000 patients Lubbock is about an hour and a half north of Gaines County where the current case number is highest according to the Texas Department of State Health Services DSHS On Saturday March 2 Edwards received a call from Gaines County resident Tina

who were also sick with measles One of the babies was clinically in not good condition he said Lethargic pale heart rate elevated respiratory rate elevated with mild to moderate respiratory distress just a really sick baby He gave the babies cod liver oil and prescribed budesonide which he then picked up from the pharmacy and delivered to the family I saw the child the next morning Edwards said He looked like a completely different child I thought it must be a mistake This can t be the same child Just the life that was back in his eyes was incredible That was the first indication to me that budesonide was really going to be a miracle worker he added After that Edwards helped facilitate what he called a massive and amazing team effort to swiftly get high quality cod liver oil and budesonide to the sick children in Gaines County When a community comes together in unity in love and wants to help each other it s amazing what can happen he said On Sunday a cod liver oil supplier called Jigsaw was able to accommodate the group s large order One of Edward s patients a private plane pilot offered to immediately deliver the oil So that plane took off got 1 700 pounds of cod liver

it up for us and brought chairs tables water all the things They got the word out and the people just started coming Edwards estimated he saw about 70 patients at the makeshift clinic that day and

hesitant to go to the Lubbock Hospital Edwards did two things to help ensure other families wouldn t face such refusals He instructed Gaines County parents to specifically ask for budesonide rather than simply a breathing treatment if their child is hospitalized with a measles infection Edwards also asked his colleague and friend Dr Richard Bartlett to help educate West Texas hospital doctors on the efficacy of budesonide for mitigating respiratory issues that might arise from a measles infection I needed someone with all the evidence and he has it Edwards said Bartlett a West Texas emergency room physician with over 28 years of experience showed that budesonide could mitigate COVID 19 respiratory symptoms His website Budesonide Works highlights studies and reports that show the steroid s effectiveness So Bartlett stopped in the hospital and was able to help educate the doctors Thankfully the doctors received that Edward said Edwards could understand why hospital doctors might initially be resistant to using budesonide It s an inhaled steroid and steroids can suppress the immune system He said that generally you don t want to suppress the immune system But he added If there s a bacteria like strep or something you need the immune system so I understand the hesitation But with a viral infection especially when it triggers a large inflammatory response locally in the tissues of the airway this is indicated Not every doctor knows this Budesonide s effectiveness was well publicized among frontline doctors who treated COVID 19 patients but that unfortunately wasn t

not think the health authorities higher up in the chain of command would go for that The Texas DSHS did not respond to The Defender s request for comment by the deadline Budesonide requires a prescription but that could change According to Edwards inhaled steroids like budesonide were traditionally used primarily for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease emphysema so he could understand why some doctors may not readily embrace it as a treatment for measles The thought was that steroids can depress the immune system and make the patient vulnerable to a secondary bacterial infection he said However antibiotics can be given at the same time to help mitigate that risk But during the COVID 19 pandemic frontline doctors and researchers including Oxford University scientists found budesonide to be very helpful in mitigating respiratory inflammation So the same principle applies here Edwards said referring to how measles is also a viral infection that can affect a person s breathing Dr Richard Bartlett a West Texas emergency room physician with over 30 years of experience was one of the frontline doctors who showed how budesonide could be used to ease respiratory inflammation from a viral infection His website Budesonide Works highlights numerous studies and reports that show the steroid s effectiveness In a recent interview with The Defender Bartlett described budesonide as a generic widely available inhaled corticosteroid with long term safety data Currently it s available only with a prescription However Bartlett Dr Mary Talley Bowden and Substack writer Jon Fleetwood recently created a bill template to help lawmakers draft legislation to make nebulized budesonide and nebulizer machines available over the counter Bartlett said he has friends in Seminole who have been affected by measles and have benefited from budesonide It s encouraging that we have some tools that are decreasing the risk of a bad outcome He said I am aware of four children who were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit at the Covenant Children s Hospital in Lubbock Texas and received nebulized budesonide All were discharged from the ICU straight to home after receiving budesonide treatments One of the children was discharged only 36 hours after receiving budesonide he said Bartlett said it concerns him that the current measles outbreak in West Texas appears to cause more hypoxia low blood oxygen levels than what one would expect based on looking at how measles is described in medical textbooks This seems more virulent than what we

gives immunoglobulin to babies Although the CDC doesn t list treatments for measles it lists two kinds of prophylaxis or disease prevention for unvaccinated people who have been exposed to the virus The first option is to get an MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure to measles The second option is to receive immunoglobulin within six days of exposure The CDC states The recommended dose for intramuscular immunoglobulin IMIG is 0 5mL kg milliliters per kilogram regardless of the contact s immune status According to the Mayo Clinic immunoglobulin is an antibody that can prevent measles or make symptoms less severe if given within six days of exposure to the virus The use of immunoglobulin in babies recently garnered national attention when NBC on March 14 reported that staff at the University Medical Center UMC Children s Hospital in Lubbock were giving babies as young as three days old injections of immunoglobulin According to NBC the babies were exposed to measles when a woman who was infected with measles gave birth at the hospital on March 12 However the hospital refuted that claim In a statement to The Defender the hospital said the patient began exhibiting symptoms associated with the measles but was immediately moved to an isolated room The patient did not have direct contact with other patients during their stay the statement said When The Defender asked if any babies at the hospital had been given immunoglobulin UMC Health System s Vice President Chief Experience Officer Aaron Davis said Out of abundance of caution we proactively offered a small number of patients who were admitted to the same floor during this time prophylaxis again in consultation with the county health department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC The Defender

Deceptive Trade Practices Act The lawsuit also alleges Pfizer cited misleading statistics concealed negative data and made unsupported statements about efficacy against variants like Delta We are pursuing justice for the people of Texas many of whom were coerced by tyrannical vaccine mandates to take a defective product sold by lies Paxton said in a press release The facts are clear Pfizer did not tell the truth about their COVID 19 vaccines When the failure of its product became apparent Pfizer then pivoted to silencing truth tellers The suit cites complaints made by former U S Food and

unsubstantiated and framed its coverage of the suit as the attorney general trying to hold Pfizer to blame because the pandemic did not end soon enough Pfizer s marketing bore no resemblance to reality The suit alleges Pfizer s claim its vaccine was 95 effective against infection was highly misleading from day one because it represented only the relative risk reduction instead of the absolute risk reduction In its calculation of relative risk reduction Pfizer compared only the small subsets of the vaccine and placebo groups who developed COVID 19 systems during the trial 8 versus 162 people respectively instead of considering the entire cohort of nearly 35 000 trial participants according to the petition Using Pfizer s Phase 2 3 data the absolute risk reduction calculation is

America s most influential liberal national media outlets and its continued hold today On Oct 14 2016 The Daily Beast published a surprisingly candid retrospective on the CIA s historic recruitment of media assets Other journalists were threatened and blackmailed into cooperating with Mockingbird the article noted and many were given falsified or fabricated information about their actions in order to engender their support for the CIA s mission The program has never been officially discontinued At the time the editor in chief and managing director of The Daily Beast was John Phillips Avlon Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown had launched the popular online news site in 2008 By the time she exited five years later a soured merger with Newsweek had left The Daily Beast whimpering rather than roaring Avlon s arrival changed all that Avlon has all the credentials of the CIA s iconic gentleman spy including an old moneyed family with military pedigrees a Yale education and a missionary globalist zeal toward foreign policy and international affairs John Avlon Sr was chairman of a New York real estate company and a trustee of the George S Patton Museum Foundation Born in 1973 young John attended Milton Academy prep school in Massachusetts before earning his B A from Yale and an MBA from Columbia Curiously both Avlon s Wikipedia page and that of his best friend the aristocratic spook Matthew Pottinger note that the two are childhood best friends and Milton schoolmates as if this lifelong partnership is an essential fact in evaluating both men s lives Writing for the New York Sun in 2005 Avlon describes Pottinger one of America s top spies as like a brother to me Pottinger made his bones as a journalist and probably as an espionage operative and propagandist while working as a lead reporter for Reuters and the Wall Street Journal in China before serving as a U S Marines intelligence officer in Iraq and Afghanistan In 2010 Pottinger co authored an intelligence analysis

foreign policy and intelligence agency credentials including as former adviser to the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Avlon began his own rise to prominence with hawkish foreign policy security state sympathies and some obscure counterterrorism credentials of mysterious pedigree His claims as a security and intelligence expert won him a job as speechwriter for New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani After the 9 11 attacks Avlon prepared the mayor s testimony to Congress on Homeland Security and Giuliani s address on counter terrorism to the UN General Assembly Avlon served as Giuliani s chief speechwriter and deputy director of policy during his 2007 08 presidential campaign Mayor Giuliani was by then CEO of a private security and intelligence consulting firm Giuliani credited the Manhattan Institute with masterminding a substantial part of his platform When Avlon joined The Daily Beast a month after its inception in 2008 he was simultaneously a senior fellow at the right wing intelligence agency linked think tank Manhattan Institute which advocates for interventionist foreign policies to achieve U S global hegemony By the way Ronald Reagan s CIA

expanded power for intelligence agencies and the national security state After the 2001 World Trade Center attacks the Institute formed a Center for Tactical Counterterrorism at the request of the

gathering analysis with traditional policing methods The center has an overseas liaison program that places NYPD intelligence officers in foreign countries to gather intelligence and share information with officials in the host country The Center published white papers on intelligence fusion centers local counterterrorism strategies and intelligence led policing In 2008 it was absorbed into a National Consortium for Advanced Policing Dick Cheney chose the Manhattan Institute as his venue to deliver a major foreign policy speech justifying the Iraq War in 2006 That same year President Bush also selected the institute for a speech advocating dramatic expansion of executive powers and praised the organization for supporting pro growth economic policies that really sent a clear signal The Manhattan Institute s City Journal listed Judith Miller as a contributing editor You might recall Miller as the hawkish New York Times journalist known for her deep CIA connections and for peddling false information about Iraq s supposed weapons of mass destruction in support of the CIA s expansionist warmongering Miller went to jail for her role in illegally outing undercover CIA agent Valerie

and the need for censorship as the key tenets of the emerging liberal ideology with a series of articles exposing how the Russians had used Facebook to promote Trump rallies in 17 American cities Robert F Kennedy Jr met with Avlon in 2018 after The Daily Beast made a series of attacks on him over his skeptical stance on certain vaccines Kennedy argued that The Daily Beast articles were error ridden and unfair Avlon refused to allow Kennedy the traditional right to reply that formerly applied across the publishing spectrum when a newspaper attacks a well known individual by name Kennedy described Avlon as congenial but immovable Kennedy recalls He had a photo of my father in his office and was very friendly but refused to allow me to publish a letter or any other response to the various slanders or to correct multiple factual errors Avlon s stubborn refusal to grant this standard gesture of basic journalistic decency suggested to me a hidden agenda I assumed Daily Beast was

published Thursday in The Guardian under the headline Most pregnant women and unborn babies who contract bird flu will die study finds misrepresented the study s findings according to scientists who reviewed the study for The Defender As public health officials ramp up panic around a possible bird flu pandemic The Guardian also reported that a severe strain of bird flu known as highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 is spreading globally However the news outlet added the caveat that human infections are rare limited to people who work in close contact with animals and there is no evidence of transmission between humans That information aligns with the latest update on H5N1 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC which states the current public health risk is low How did The Guardian come up with its headline Let s take a closer look at the study Systematic Review of Avian Influenza Virus Infection and Outcomes during Pregnancy published in the January 2025 edition of the CDC s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal Lead author Rachael Purcell said that while many people who became infected with bird flu were completely fine we wanted to look at what is known about what happens to pregnant women The Guardian reported To accomplish this the authors assessed over 1 600 studies on bird flu Purcell and her team identified only eight studies involving a total of 30 pregnant women who contracted various strains of bird flu None of those were the same H5N1 strains circulating currently The researchers analysis of the eight studies and 30 pregnant women found high mortality rates again from older bird flu strains not those in circulation now They concluded that the mortality rates indicated that awareness of the vulnerability of pregnant women to a new pandemic is needed They didn t claim as The Guardian did that most pregnant women and unborn babies who get bird flu will die The authors said their findings support the case that a paradigm shift is needed where pregnant women are included early in clinical trials for vaccines produced as part of pandemic preparedness Typically pregnant women are excluded from such studies due to safety concerns until a

pregnant women be included early in trials for experimental vaccines is dangerous This is a terrible idea because most drugs and vaccines subjected to clinical trials fail putting fetus and pregnant women at high risk for no benefit internist and bioweapons expert Dr Meryl Nass said Study s data have no bearing on today Purcell and her team searched 1 602 research papers on bird flu to find cases in pregnant women They found only seven case reports and one retrospective study that had data on pregnant women Some of those had to be eliminated because they reported on the same cases The researchers final review included data on 30 pregnant women diagnosed with different types of avian influenza virus infection during pregnancy Most women were from China and contracted bird flu working in poultry factories or at live poultry markets The review found that 90 of women infected with bird flu during pregnancy died and almost all of their babies died with them Of the babies who survived most were born prematurely Nass said it was notable that after reviewing 1 602 studies the authors found so few studies that fit their criteria From this meager amount of data the authors derived mortality rates in pregnancy Children s Health Defense CHD Senior Research Scientist Karl Jablonowski agreed The idea that they would start with 1 600 papers and whittle that down to eight is introducing a huge potential bias Jablonowski said the authors also introduced bias based on the types of studies they used We re seeing the aggregation of the worst possible outcomes in the published literature in order to draw conclusions about mortality Jablonowski said that case reports and case studies focus on bad outcomes The worse the outcome the greater the published documentation he said Is 27 maternal deaths of the 30 infected an accurate description of outcome or an aberration of compounding biases This study was not designed to answer that question He said it was impossible to

vaccine These data have no bearing on today Nass added because bird flu cases affecting chickens cows and the Americans who work with them are mild due to a mutated strain The strains affecting the pregnant women in the study have disappeared Even experts interviewed by The Guardian to endorse the paper like infectious diseases specialist and associate professor Sanjaya Senanayake at the Australian National University were tepid in their support Senanayake told The Guardian the sample size was small and the severe outcomes in the paper couldn t be generalized to the developed world with better resourced healthcare settings However he said he thought the findings of the study were likely to be real Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us More vaccines for pregnant women The bulk of the paper argued that pregnant women should be included in clinical trials for new vaccines for possible future pandemics Purcell told The Guardian the study outcomes highlighted that whilst the risk of avian influenza becoming the next human pandemic is thought to be low it s really important to think about vulnerable populations and how we might protect them and include them in vaccination programs Despite being a high risk population pregnant women are often excluded from vaccine trials from priority access to therapeutics and experience delayed entry into public health vaccination programs she said But Nass argued that we know pregnant women and their fetuses are more susceptible to the adverse effects of drugs and vaccines They should only be included in clinical trials for drugs or vaccines that are sure to be or already licensed Jablonowski said that ethically it s a huge issue to push a vaccine that hasn t even been proven safe in the healthy

Analysis Shows The first peer reviewed study to systematically track trends in the rates of intellectual disability defined as an IQ of less than 70 among children with autism found that those rates have risen and fallen in association with the presence of thimerosal in vaccines recommended to children and pregnant women You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A new peer reviewed investigation into the rates of children with autism who have an intellectual disability found that those rates have risen and fallen for children born between 1992 and 2014 depending on the number of thimerosal containing vaccines recommended for children at that time The study by autism researcher Cynthia Nevison Ph D is the first to systematically track trends in the rates of intellectual disability defined as an IQ of less than 70 among children with autism spectrum disorder ASD The report was published last week in Science Public Health Policy and the Law By linking those trends to changes in vaccine policy Nevison hypothesized that thimerosal a mercury based preservative may play a role in modulating the severity of the disease To identify the trends Nevison analyzed data in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring ADDM Network Since 2000 ADDM has used health and education data to track autism rates among 8 and 4 year olds at multiple sites in the U S This year the CDC released ADDM data showing that 1 in 31 3 22 8 year olds had an ASD diagnosis in 2022 up from 1 in 36 2 8 in 2020 A recent JAMA Open Network study suggested that the number is closer to 1 in 33 The CDC and press frequently argue that the rising rates are the result of better diagnosis a broader spectrum of behavioral symptoms is recognized as part of ASD compared with years past and providers are better trained to diagnose the illness Some groups have celebrated the rising numbers However autism advocacy organizations and some parents of children with more severe forms of autism have pushed back on that claim They argue that many children with autism have intellectual disabilities so severe that living independently is not possible Attributing the rise in numbers solely to better diagnosis risks minimizing the seriousness of the disease and ignores the need to investigate its root causes they say Nevison investigated these claims by tracking the rates of children diagnosed with autism who have intellectual disability which she used as a marker for autism severity over time She analyzed the ADDM data since 2000 when the CDC first began collecting it for 8 year olds born in 1992 to identify the proportion of ASD cases with intellectual disability Nevison found that the rate of intellectual disability in children

disability in children with autism declined from 48 among children born in 1992 to about 38 for children born in 2000 In the next two years the rate dropped sharply to a low of 31 among children born in 2002 The rate remained relatively flat through 2006 before it began rising again reaching nearly 41 for 8 year olds born in 2014 the most recent year for which data are available This trend contradicts the prevailing assumption that rising ASD prevalence is largely attributable to expanded diagnostic criteria capturing more mildly affected higher functioning individuals scientific researcher and publisher of Science Public Health Policy and the Law James Lyons Weiler Ph D wrote in a Substack article commenting on Nevison s findings Trends linked to changes in vaccine policy Nevison told The Defender that the trends correspond with changes in vaccine policy She suggested the initial drop in rates among children born in the 1990s could reflect expanding diagnosis as national attention to the disorder was increasing But then what really caught my eye was that between 2000 and 2002 there was a steeper drop and it was not accompanied by an extreme increase in the number of kids with autism overall she said Nevison noted that autism is increasingly understood to have a strong environmental component involving toxic exposures in utero and early childhood These exposures can cause chronic systemic and neuro inflammation as well as mitochondrial oxidative stress all of which can impose metabolic stress on the developing brain thereby altering brain development and brain functioning she wrote in the paper Children with autism have higher levels of toxic metals in their systems including lead mercury and aluminum Variations in toxic metal load have been associated with the severity of autism she wrote In July 1999 the CDC the American Academy of Pediatrics and vaccine manufacturers agreed that thimerosal should be reduced or removed from childhood vaccines as a precautionary measure However they maintained there was no evidence that it posed any threat The CDC reported that in 2001 thimerosal was removed from all vaccines except for multidose flu shots Multidose flu shots which reduce costs by reusing a single vial for multiple doses contain thimerosal to prevent bacterial and fungal growth The removal of thimerosal from vaccines coincided with the steep drop in the rate of children with autism who had severe intellectual disabilities from 2000 2002 Those rates then stabilized", "chunk_id":

from 2000 2002 Those rates then stabilized for several years As CDC expanded flu shot recommendations rates of autism with severe disability rose In 2001 the CDC wasn t recommending flu shots for children or pregnant women so those groups did not receive vaccines containing thimerosal However in 2004 the CDC began recommending flu shots for pregnant women see Figure 5 in the study in any trimester and children ages 6 to 23 months In 2006 the agency expanded the recommendation to children ages 6 months to 5 years By 2010 the CDC recommended flu vaccination for everyone older than 6 months Nevison s research found that the proportion of children with intellectual disability began to increase again in 2006 the year the CDC expanded recommendations for the flu vaccine She said the growth was not consistent with improved diagnosis as overall autism prevalence was also increasing In other words there weren t just more children diagnosed with autism a growing proportion of the rising number of autism cases involved intellectual disability The timing of policy changes and rising rates of autism with intellectual disability combined with evidence of toxins role in autism severity led Nevison to hypothesize that thimerosal could play a role in influencing the severity of autism When I looked at the trends in IQ I was kind of stunned by the patterns that emerged and felt like this was a story that needed to be told Nevison said Flu shots containing thimerosal given during pregnancy may factor into autism rates Nevison s study also investigated a major shift in autism prevalence nationally by race and ethnicity Between 2008 and 2010 Black and Hispanic children began to surpass white children in autism rates and they also had significantly higher rates of intellectual disability Before that autism prevalence in those groups had been lower and significantly lower for Hispanic children Data on race and ethnicity have only been available since 2002 Since

2006 2008 as an inflection point when the prevalence of autism with intellectual disability increased rapidly after a period of relative stability Based on those numbers Nevison estimated that by 2014 nearly 2 of all Black children had an autism diagnosis with co occurring intellectual disability She hypothesized that this inflection point aligned with the introduction of thimerosal containing flu shots for pregnant women Women and children served by Medicaid are likely to follow CDC recommendations Nevison wrote In some states pediatricians who treat Medicaid patients enrolled in the Vaccines for Children Program which provides cost free vaccines to children whose families cannot afford them must strictly follow the CDC immunization schedule Nevison added Similarly women served by Medicaid are likely under pressure from their doctors to follow the CDC schedule during pregnancy They also may be more likely to receive flu shots from thimerosal containing multi dose vials while wealthier women covered by private insurance may have more opportunity to choose thimerosal free shots from single dose vials Regardless of mercury content the proinflammatory response to flu vaccination per se may activate the maternal immune system in ways that could be detrimental to the fetus Programs such as the Children s Health Insurance Program CHIP which expanded healthcare access for people just above the Medicaid threshold increased access to regular care for lower income people The program has been credited with expanding diagnosis for low income children Nevison noted that it also increased well baby visits the primary setting for routine vaccinations Thus from the perspective of the hypothesis outlined above CHIP could be responsible not only for improving access to the screening and diagnosis of ASD among lower income children but also for potentially causing more ASD among those children she wrote She also acknowledged that other factors including diet

evidence despite thimerosal s known toxicity and its ability to cross the blood brain barrier Jablonowski added that Nevison s study provides important evidence of thimerosal s harm According to CNN most flu vaccines in the U S come in single dose vials that don t contain thimerosal but about 4 come in multidose vials that do During the ACIP meeting presenter Lyn Redwood a nurse practitioner with experience in pediatrics and family medicine cited data showing that during the 2019 2020 flu season over 60 000 pregnant women were vaccinated with multidose vials Nevison said some at the meeting dismissed the risk based on the low percentage of multidose vaccines and relatively small numbers of exposed women She countered that 60 000 women is still a significant number and emphasized the importance of examining what happened to the significantly higher number of women and children who received thimerosal containing vaccines over the last two decades I don t think you can just dismiss the gravity of this issue simply because today less than 5 of the flu shots have thimerosal Nevison said Jablonowski added Our struggles with thimerosal are a testament to how much we ve lost our sensibility when it comes to vaccines and their ingredients We were crazy to include it crazy to defend its inclusion and crazy to recognize the hazard and remove it from only some Autism is not a natural disaster it is a disaster of our own making he said We cannot un injure children but we can stop the injuries from continuing Dr Nevison s analysis Lyn Redwood s ACIP presentation and the ACIP

The Washington Post highlighted the growth of private firms using artificial intelligence facial recognition technology to identify users ages The technology is marketed to sites like TikTok as a means of preventing access to children You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The U S Department of Justice DOJ last week sued TikTok accusing the platform of flagrantly violating the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act COPPA the COPPA Rule and a 2019 decision by the Federal Trade Commission FTC regarding the illegal collection of children s personal information The lawsuit filed in federal court in California alleges TikTok collected extensive data from children under 13 without parental consent allowed users under 13 to create and maintain accounts and failed to comply with parental requests to delete their children s accounts and personal information The lawsuit the latest in a series of U S government actions against the platform follows a complaint filed in 2020 by several advocacy groups including the Electronic Privacy Information Center EPIC alleging TikTok violated COPPA In April President Joe Biden signed a bill banning TikTok in the U S unless its Chinese parent company sells the social media platform s U S assets by January 2025 The DOJ s announcement came on the heels of a Washington Post report Wednesday highlighting the growth of private firms using artificial intelligence AI facial recognition technology to identify users ages The technology is marketed to sites like TikTok as a means of preventing access to children According to the report the technology which is prone to false positives has raised privacy concerns among parents However according to the Post 19 states have passed laws requiring online age checks However those laws have faced legal and constitutional hurdles on censorship and free speech grounds Eva Galperin director of cybersecurity for the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF told The Defender that out of the efforts that our legislators and the U S government have been making to pursue TikTok and limit its reach this is probably the most reasonable This is one with teeth Galperin noted though that other social media platforms have engaged in similar practices She said The DOJ has gone after other social media companies for COPPA violations So has the FTC When the House decided to single out TikTok for banning over privacy violations and other types of behavior I thought that this was pretty outrageous and the reason for that was that there was almost nothing that the House was alleging

over its tracking of children in Chromebooks years ago where it turned out that Google was giving Chromebooks for free to schoolchildren wasn t supposed to track anything they did while they were in school but was in fact gathering that data Galperin said the EFF s 2015 complaint against Google led to further regulatory scrutiny of Google s practices According to Tim Hinchliffe editor of The Sociable the use of facial recognition technology by social media platforms and other websites and online services poses a significant risk to children Hinchliffe said The risks of AI facial recognition on children outweigh the benefits Throughout our entire human existence we ve had people called parents to safeguard children If a parent doesn t want their child s face collected and stored in a database they should have the power and control to keep that technology from being used on their kids without prejudice Hinchliffe also warned that the widespread use of such technologies by children could result in a normalization of their use AI face scanning on kids programs teach them from an early age to accept that they don t have privacy and it is the next step towards a digital identity driven internet passport to eliminate all anonymity Hinchliffe said TikTok built back doors allowing young children access to its platform According to the FTC TikTok and its parent company ByteDance allegedly were aware of the need to comply with the COPPA Rule and the 2019 consent order and knew about TikTok s compliance failures that put children s data and privacy at risk But instead of complying the complaint states that For years millions of American children under 13 have been using TikTok and Defendants have been collecting and retaining children s personal information The FTC wrote that as of 2020 TikTok used human reviewers to determine whether a user was under 13 years of age but allegedly spent an average of only five to seven seconds reviewing each account to make their determination of whether the account belonged to a child The platform then allegedly continued to collect personal data from these children including data that enabled TikTok to target

from you Contact Us Booming age assurance industry leading to an authoritarian nightmare According to the Washington Post concerns over children gaining access to age inappropriate content online have fueled A booming industry of AI age scanners aimed at children s faces comprised of a little known group of companies in an experimental corner of the tech industry known as age assurance These age assurance checks which rely on a style of surveillance that ranges from somewhat privacy violating to authoritarian nightmare the Post reported the door to privacy risks for anyone who uses the web and may subject children and everyone else to a level of inspection rarely seen on the open internet While age assurance could give parents a better sense of control and peace of mind the Post reported that the collection and centralization of users personal and biometric data may boost the chances it could be hacked leaked or misused The Post cited companies such as Yoti Incode and VerifyMyAge describing them as digital gatekeepers that have developed technology that asks users to verify their age by recording a video selfie often while holding a government ID in front of the camera AI tools then determine the users age based on biometric features Major social media platforms and online services including TikTok Facebook Instagram and OpenAI and several adult oriented websites now use such age check tools while 19 states including Florida Texas and Virginia have passed or enacted laws requiring online age checks According to the Post such legislation has created a

all ages to terrible risk forcing them to hand over intimate details of their lives to companies that are largely unproven unregulated and unknown Such concerns persist despite assurances by companies like Incode and Yoti that they delete images after a user s face is analyzed Galperin said the data collected by such companies is housed in Big databases containing photos of people with their real

centralized databases of children s biometric information to legalized pedophilia California based privacy attorney Greg Glaser told The Defender that such data which may potentially include full and partial body shots of children in private settings would be at risk of being leaked onto the dark web At this point in history it is obvious that computer systems are not designed with checks and

in the U S is usually the kidnapping of a child when the parents have divorced but only one parent has been granted custody and the parent without custody essentially takes the child Galperin said This technology could potentially put people in some real danger When adults experience firsthand how AI facial recognition can be used against them I think they d be more hesitant to allow that same technology to be used on their children But if the technology is used on kids first would parents realize the full extent of how dystopian it could get Government and private actors may also take advantage of such data Galperin said This data could also be tempting to advertisers and data brokers who love this kind of info for the purposes of targeted advertising It s also of interest to governments and law enforcement who regularly buy data from data brokers in order to save themselves the trouble of having to go to court to get a warrant or a subpoena for certain kinds of data Others have argued that age assurance technology despite the promise of AI often results in false positives that may shut legal users out of online services The Post cited data from the National Institute of Standards and Technology that age estimators are typically accurate within about three years and from Instagram finding that age checks had stopped 96 of teens who tried to change their accounts to appear over the age of 18 But this still shuts out many potentially legitimate users with certain groups being particularly at risk The Post noted that the systems error rates for girls

particles of titanium dioxide commonly used to make candies cookies and other ultraprocessed foods look brighter and more visually appealing especially to kids can raise blood sugar levels and impair how the body processes glucose among other health harms according to new research in mice The study published in May in Food and Chemical Toxicology adds to growing concerns over the safety of titanium dioxide a widely used color additive that is banned in the European Union but widely used in the U S and elsewhere It also highlights the food industry s increasing use of microscopic materials to preserve or enhance foods These findings raise important questions about the potential risks of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in food products particularly in relation to metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes the researchers say The findings come several months after the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA banned a coloring agent called red dye No 3 amid several efforts nationwide to ban food chemicals particularly from public school meals The U S Department of Health and Human Services has also said that it will direct food manufacturers to phase out eight petroleum based food dyes found in hundreds of foods Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are ultrafine particles between one and 100 nanometers By comparison a sheet of paper is about 1 000 nanometers thick Unlike larger titanium dioxide microparticles nanoparticles may act as intestinal endocrine disruptors the researchers suggest The nanoparticles appear to interfere with how the gut senses nutrients from food in the body and how it produces and releases key hormones involved in digestion and blood sugar level control glucose homeostasis When the body can t control blood sugar properly it can lead to Type 2 diabetes and obesity by making it harder to use insulin and easier to store fat Titanium dioxide nanoparticles in mice caused a weakened hormone response to food related

The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies titanium dioxide as possibly carcinogenic to humans based on animal studies In 2021 the European Food Safety Authority concluded that it could no longer consider titanium dioxide safe for use in food France banned the additive in 2020 followed by the European Union in 2022 However it is still permitted for use in foods in the U S where it can appear on ingredient labels as artificial color or colored with titanium dioxide though labeling is not always required The FDA currently classifies titanium dioxide as a food additive as GRAS

roughly up to 10 times larger but still only about the size of a fine grain of sand Because of their extremely small size nanoparticles have a large surface area to volume ratio which means they break down or dissolve faster and can more easily penetrate cells and tissues They also tend to linger in the body longer which may explain their stronger potential to disrupt normal biological functions

save this article Sign Up By Hana Mensendiek Plumes of manure particles and other toxic gases waft from industrial animal farms over to nearby communities The haze of pollution coats the inside and outside of residents homes with potentially harmful bacteria and when inhaled can lead to respiratory problems Air pollution from industrial animal operations isn t controlled by the federal government and weak local oversight has left many communities to fend for themselves Some are now working with researchers to develop tools and gather evidence that will help them advocate for justice and compensation In one such community in North Carolina residents have collaborated with researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore Maryland to test a technique that can identify and measure the amount of pig manure in dust that settled in and around residents homes The tool will help communities and researchers trace the pollution back to nearby factory farms the researchers say Residents of the community in Duplin County a hotspot for the state s hog production and bad air quality say that local authorities have previously dismissed or overlooked their concerns and complaints about the pollution But having tools and data to reliably show the source of the pollution will help them make their case more effectively says Devon Hall Sr executive director of a community group Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help in North Carolina which collaborated on the research Hall lives within three miles of 30 factory farms He says the community knows that pig manure is in the air because they can smell it and taste it The odor can be so horrific that it immediately makes you want to gag he says The Duplin County community also worries for the health of their families says Hall Particles of swine manure contain dangerous pathogens including antimicrobial resistant bacteria and other zoonotic viruses and parasites say scientists Research shows that communities who live close to factory farms who are disproportionately low income people of color have increased risks of asthma lung disorders and mood disorders including anxiety and depression But the state legislature has repeatedly shielded the hog industry from regulation and common law nuisance to the detriment of communities says Blakely Hildebrand senior attorney at the Southern

scientists led by Chris Heaney an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University s Center for a Livable Future to develop a tool that will help them prove their claims against the farms The project is testing and refining the tool that identifies a segment of bacterial DNA only found in the gut of swine The tool can identify the pig specific genetic sequence called Pig 2 Bac from fecal bacteria in dust that has settled in and around locals homes enabling them to show that pollution from pig operations has reached their residences The project is described in a study that is submitted to the journal Science of the Total Environment for peer review In the study the researchers ran DNA tests to analyze over 1 400 samples collected by residents from nearly 300 households Residents swabbed dust on top of their air conditioning units roof front porch vents refrigerators and TV remotes They sealed the swabs inside tubes containing a liquid solvent similar to those used as home testing kits for the virus that causes COVID 19 and sent them to the laboratory at Johns Hopkins University for analysis The analysis found that the pig specific DNA sequence was widespread inside and outside the homes of people who work in and live next to industrial pig farms They found only one positive sample from an urban area located far from the farms The researchers also calculated that homes in areas close to more and bigger pig farms were contaminated with more fecal waste This further demonstrates that the pig specific genetic marker found in people s homes is linked to the swine farms the

protect their health Local air pollution data will become increasingly important as the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA finalizes new federal rules under the Clean Air Act a bedrock environmental law that factory farms have been shielded from The new rules aim to control air pollution from animal agriculture including hydrogen sulfide ammonia and particulate matter For the past 20 years the EPA has been developing models to enable it to estimate emissions from industrial animal farms During this period the EPA gave factory farms a free pass to pollute without limits or penalties If not for the free pass neighbors of industrial hog operations that have been plagued for decades by hog waste pollution could use this powerful legal tool to hold the industry accountable says Hildebrand Many researchers and activists say the models are long overdue the EPA initially said they would be completed in 2009 The EPA published a draft of the models in November 2024 and is now collecting public comments on the draft When the models are finalized industrial farms will be required to operate with a permit and comply with clean air laws If farms fail to comply with the law communities will be able to use pollutant data to help bring lawsuits against those operations And tools like Pig 2 Bac could help make the case that the pollution is coming from animal operations as

public interest law firm Public Justice who has worked with factory farm water pollution cases says data collected by citizens is often attacked by defendants lawyers for not being credible But if plaintiffs can demonstrate that the data are collected using valid methods then it is admissible he says The tool is already proving useful in bringing justice to communities Duplin County residents used Pig 2 Bac in a landmark nuisance lawsuit against Smithfield the largest pork producer in the world The community complained that waste from a nearby Smithfield operation was contaminating their homes and damaging their health and quality of life The tool helped the plaintiffs demonstrate that the air and their homes were covered in pig waste and linked it to the Smithfield operation Expert witness Shane Rogers from Clarkson University in New York argued that pig manure was likely also inside the residents homes where they eat and sleep a claim the new Pig 2 Bac study results support In 2018 residents won the case and were initially awarded 50 million in damages and compensation which was later reduced to 2 5 million following a change in state law The Pig 2 Bac tool has also helped researchers argue that toxins from industrial farms in Duplin County traveled into public waterways far off site from operations that were not allowed to discharge pollutants Researchers first developed the Pig 2 Bac tool to track pollution in local wells and rivers Pushing for change But as communities living in the shadow of industrial animal farms make headway states have strengthened their right to farm laws which shield the agriculture industry from regulation Since 2018 North Carolina and Iowa two states with the most hogs in the country have made it nearly impossible for residents to file nuisance lawsuits against industrial farms And at least seven more have made it more difficult by changing criteria for filing suits or decreasing the amount of damages plaintiffs can recover And now some activists and lawyers are worried the progress will backslide under the Trump administration Emily Miller attorney at the environmental nonprofit Food and Water Watch says

initiatives including freezing community run projects that monitored local air pollution The EPA funds over one hundred community air monitoring programs including ones relating to factory farms One grant to CleanAIRE North Carolina a local nonprofit installed 30 real time air monitors in Sampson County households to help identify and track particulate matter pollution from nearby pig farms Although the project is still funded there are constant concerns about funding and unexpected changes with personnel says Daisha Wall Community Science Program Manager at CleanAIRE NC Wall says the monitors provide crucial information about how families in the rural community who are largely low income earners and people of color are disproportionately exposed to air pollution from the surrounding pig farms The nearest federal air monitor is unhelpfully 74 miles away says Wall The Trump administration has also deleted from federal websites nationwide air pollution data and data

to organophosphorus pesticides widely used in food production homes and gardens and the human gut microbiome In a new study published in Environmental Health an interdisciplinary research team from the University of California Los Angeles determined that exposure to organophosphorus pesticides is associated with changes in the abundance of several bacterial groups and differential functional capacity in metabolic pathways supported by the human gut microbiome The study draws upon data from a Parkinson s Environment and Gene study PEG in which 190 participants were asked to submit fecal samples and answer interview questions The researchers added The study was initially designed to investigate the etiology of Parkinson s disease PD and participants were recruited in two study waves over the full 10 year exposure window 2001 2007 and 2012 2017 At baseline Parkinson s disease patients were diagnosed within the past 5 years and randomly selected community controls were also recruited the research team shares in their Methodology section Since 2017 we invited previous study participants who could be contacted to enroll in a pilot study of the gut microbiome In addition we invited a household or community member of Parkinson s patients to participate To be eligible for the study it was determined that the participants did not have the following Acute chronic gastrointestinal conditions An immunocompromised state and or were taking immunosuppressants Antibiotic intake continuously or within the past three months The collection kit for the research was based on a protocol developed under the Microbiome Core of the Goodman Luskin Microbiome Center The microbiome was assessed through bacterial DNA found in the fecal samples A software PICRUSt2 was

producing bacteria are an indicator of disturbed homeostasis of the gut environment due to chronic OP organophosphorus pesticide exposure and the body s response to such changes This study builds on existing scientific evidence analyzing the impact of toxic pesticides on human health pertaining specifically to the gut microbiome For example in a 2023 study released in ISME Journal researchers determined that the gut and the brain are deeply integrated through the vagus nerve and the neuroendocrine system The vagus nerve is a treelike bundle of fibers extending from the lower part of the brain to nearly every body organ but particularly the heart lungs and digestive tract The neuroendocrine system comprises specialized cells inhabiting nearly all the organs of the body that respond to signals from the brain and gut to produce hormones that regulate digestive enzymes the pace of digestion air and blood flow in the lungs blood pressure heart rate blood glucose levels and other functions Moreover Dr Demetrio Sierra Mercado shared findings from research originally published in 2022 in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology aimed at documenting the relationship between glyphosate exposure and gut health Sierra Mercado noted how even exposure levels that fall within the realm of safe can lead to anxiety like behaviors and alter the delicate

authors of the new review While there may be as many as 100 000 synthetic chemicals that can migrate into foods from packaging storage containers and processing equipment most of these substances remain unknown according to the review Studies to assess the safety of the chemicals scientists do know about typically involve animal experiments that test exposure to high doses However exposure to even very low doses of some substances that contaminate foods such as endocrine disrupting chemicals including BPA and phthalates can lead to obesity and diabetes And while chemicals are usually studied individually to assess their safety in the real world people are exposed to mixtures of chemicals which may have different health effects Current approaches to testing food contact materials are outdated and need to be urgently updated said Jane Muncke the managing director and chief scientific officer of the Food Packaging Forum in Zurich Switzerland an author of the review article

litigation and to getting to the truth and justice for Jennifer Robi who was profoundly injured by her Gardasil shots Merck did not respond to The Defender s request for comment however the vaccine maker told Reuters it was confident it would win Merck remains confident that it will prevail in the Robi litigation based not only on the scientific evidence and defenses that it had presented during plaintiff s own case but also the additional evidence Merck would have presented in its defense which had not even begun when plaintiff s counsel proposed the adjournment Several other Gardasil cases are also pending against Merck in state courts And as of Feb 4 225 cases were pending in federal court In 2022 a judicial panel ordered the consolidation of the federal lawsuits against Merck into multidistrict litigation in a single court The consolidation order allows Gardasil lawsuits filed throughout the country to move into coordinated discovery and pretrial proceedings Sixteen of those cases were selected to serve as bellwether trials Their outcomes will shape the process for the growing number of claims brought against Merck for Gardasil related injuries Preliminary hearings in those cases are set to begin in the coming months in North Carolina likely before the Robi trial resumes Robi s lawsuit and the lawsuits that make up the multidistrict litigation are historic because the liability shield protecting the pharmaceutical industry under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act has made it extremely difficult to sue vaccine makers The pharmaceutical companies can be sued only if a person first seeks compensation through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP also known as the vaccine court Claimants dissatisfied with the outcome move on to step

most effective influential and beloved leaders Ed Arranga died on Dec 6 following a long battle with cancer Ed was the architect of AutismOne the country s largest annual autism conference Parents and professionals from around the globe gathered each year at Ed s symposium to hear about biomedical advances affecting every aspect of autism They learned about cutting edge treatments and therapies legislative developments and legal insights and they received practical training in how to approach persuade and recruit lawmakers and to effectively advocate for children and adults with the diagnosis Parents describe their AutismOne experiences as life changing The annual conclave was a lifeline where desperately struggling parents learned they weren t alone in the universe Many of them formed lifelong friendships strengthened bonds and fine tuned their children s home and educational plans During the last year of his life Ed fought to keep autism at the forefront of the world s consciousness as the COVID 19 crisis eclipsed all other medical concerns Meanwhile the number of affected children continued to soar Ed spent his abundant life s energies advancing the mission Because he cared nothing for personal credit he was particularly adept at unifying the various autism advocacy groups He preached that our strength lay in numbers and solidarity Ed labored also to bring churches into the movement Reminding ministers and pastors that their predecessors had played key roles in the civil rights movement and in the American Revolution Ed mobilized clergy across the nation to lead the way in alleviating the devastating toll autism imposes on families and society In recent years Ed and his wife Teri made the financial sacrifice of opening up the AutismOne conference presentations online at no cost so as to broadcast vital information to as many parents as possible Ed and Teri whose two sons are diagnosed with autism knew firsthand that autism does not just debilitate the affected individual The diagnosis saps personal emotional spiritual and financial energies of everyone within its penumbra imposing ruinous financial costs derailing careers straining marriages and marginalizing families in ways that hobble entire communities and weaken nations The inevitable discussions at AutismOne about regulatory corruption and the scientifically proven links between autism and vaccines inspired fierce opposition toward the annual conference by the medical cartel and its allied media Hostility from the Medico Pharma establishment amplified the

who were blessed to call him a friend Ed impacted thousands of families lifting their burdens providing critical information confidence encouragement and love His influence reached far beyond the

U S have contributed to metabolic disruption afflicting many Americans In 2024 we have the highest rates in American history of Alzheimer s cancer autoimmune conditions heart disease diabetes cancer

last month spoke at a Senate roundtable on nutrition and the chronic disease epidemic in the U S said the corporate capture of public health agencies medical schools and the media is fueling the

it grows we get sicker fatter or more depressed more infertile It s going to bankrupt the country and it s not slowing down Calley said We are getting destroyed and it s very recent and it s

said Calley also recalled lobbying lawmakers to convince them that taking Coke off food stamps was racist Coke soda to this day is the number one item on food stamps As a lobbyist We paid conservative influencers to say it s the nanny state to question the rigged system But he later realized that fixing a rigged market is not an attack on the free market It s a necessity U S food ingredients

Americans are overweight or obese 50 now of American adults have Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes compared to 1 in 1950 One in two Americans are expected to have cancer in their lifetime young adult cancers are going up 79 in the last 10 years Casey added Autism rates are absolutely astronomical One in 36 children has autism now in the United States That was 1 in 50 in the year 2000 We ve got heart disease which is almost totally preventable as the leading cause of death in the United States killing around 800 000 people per year Casey said Casey said doctors are trained to treat diseases in isolation No one s asking Why is this happening Instead we put ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in a bucket We put depression and anxiety in a bucket We put Alzheimer s in a bucket For Casey there is a very obvious blaring answer one that led her and Calley to write their book earlier this year It s all caused by metabolic dysfunction It s basically like all of us are a little bit dead while we re alive Casey said That s what metabolic dysfunction is It s less energy in the body We re underpowered This starves the brains and other vital organs of the energy they need to

as you know everywhere It s literally in the air she said We re breathing the nanoparticles It s in our food it s in our water it s in everything When plastic breaks down it acts like a xenoestrogen that can literally bind to our estrogen receptors and act like estrogen Pesticides are another contributor to metabolic dysfunction Casey said Some pesticides increase aromatase the enzyme that converts to estrogen she said She cited atrazine a pesticide that is banned in Europe but we spray 70 million pounds of it per year in the U S Then we re barreled with sugar it s in our kids school lunches The sugar everywhere is driving the visceral fat in kids Casey said Tobacco companies takeover of Big Food led to weaponization of food According to Calley Chronic disease wasn t that big of a deal in the 1970s 1980s but there was a sharp turn after cigarette companies bought major food manufacturers in the early 1990s leading to a weaponization of food They did two things very very intentionally Calley said They took over the institutions of trust to say ultra processed food was healthy and then they took their scientists and rigged the food itself to make it more addictive Casey described high fructose corn syrup as a weapon of mass destruction used to make people insatiable We have 10 000 chemicals in our food system Casey said Europe only 400 because they have to show that it s safe before they use it We re allowed to use it and worry about proving its safety later She cited the U S Food and Drug Administration s Generally Recognized as Safe GRAS system where companies self assess to determine if the ingredients they use are safe This has happened very intentionally and it can be undone pretty quickly too But we have to realize this isn t a conspiracy It s

also to blame Anything that actually recognizes the unison and the interconnectivity of why we re getting sick can t be studied through a double blind placebo controlled study Calley said Casey cited the connection between vaccines and autism as an example I bet that one vaccine probably isn t causing autism but what about the 20 that they re getting before 18 months We don t look at it in a synergistic way that s a big problem For Casey the liability shield enjoyed by vaccine manufacturers stemming from the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 has not only protected those companies but also serves as a model that other industries are trying to imitate They re now starting to try and push things like that for pesticides Casey said Institutional capture a defining existential issue in our country For Casey and Calley institutional capture is at the heart of this system There s a defining existential issue in our country where our major institutions have been captured Calley said I think we re going to be brought to our knees if we don t realize this Casey said It s a simple economic incentive problem that s causing all these problems I think that what we

anymore Casey said Healthcare costs are skyrocketing because the medical system knows how to tell Congress that there s no cost too high for something when it comes to pharmaceutical interventions Calley said We re bankrupting the country with interventions once people get sick He pointed out Pharma is responsible for half of the ads on TV news not so much to sell products as to influence the news Big Pharma spends five times more on lobbying and public affairs than the oil industry while the healthcare industry is the highest funder of politicians and the highest spender on research he said Pharma also funds regulatory agencies and scientific studies on food and nutrition These studies are all funded by the chemical companies by the food companies as are university medical and nutrition schools Calley said Fundamentally on the grassroots micro level these industries have co opted our institutions of trust Calley said and those who raise questions are punished If you step outside the guidelines you re at risk for intense litigation and potentially ridicule Casey said citing the example of the COVID 19 pandemic In 2022 every single public health official in America said you were enemy No 1 for talking about sunlight and talking about food and talking about healthy eating Calley said If you were metabolically healthy you did not die of COVID pretty demonstrably Yet

whether the journal advocated views that were influenced by your ongoing relationships with supporters funders advertisers and others Martin requested a response by April 18 It s unclear if Monteiro complied The letter was one of several Martin sent to editors of medical journals questioning their impartiality However The Disinformation Chronicle citing a source inside the U S Department of Health and Human Services said the actual target of Martin s letters is Nature Medicine publisher of the influential Proximal Origin paper The paper helped discredit proponents of the lab leak theory who suggested that COVID 19 emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China Scientists government officials and media outlets widely cited the paper in an attempt to characterize proponents of the lab leak theory as conspiracy theorists In a March 2020 tweet Monteiro said the paper would help to stop spread of misinformation and put conspiracy theories about the origin of SARSCoV2 to rest During an April 2020 White House briefing Fauci said the study provided evidence totally consistent with a jump of species from an animal to a human Not some fringe theory In his letter to Monteiro Martin wrote that some journals have a position for which they are advocating due to advertisement or sponsorship suggesting a quid pro quo relationship that may violate fraud and postal regulations

skeptical about dismissing the lab leak theory But emails and documents revealed through a congressional investigation and some media outlets revealed that under pressure from Fauci and other key public health figures Andersen and Garry fully endorsed the zoonotic theory in Proximal Origin In a Feb 1 2020 email and call between Fauci and several virologists including Andersen the participants expressed concern that COVID 19 might have been manipulated instead of originating in nature Transcripts revealed by The Nation in July 2023 showed that in a February 2020 Slack thread Andersen wrote to other virologists that the main issue is that accidental release is in fact highly likely it s not some fringe theory In a Feb 17 2020 email Jeremy Farrar Ph D the then director of the Wellcome Trust who later became the World Health Organization s chief scientist and assistant director general asked Andersen to make a last minute change to the draft of Proximal Origin from It is unlikely to

has steered clear of regulating junk food fast food and ultraprocessed food Now attitudes are changing Some members of President elect Donald Trump s inner circle are gearing up to battle Big Food or the companies that make most of the food and beverages consumed in the United States Nominees for top health agencies are taking aim at ultraprocessed foods that account for an estimated 70 of the nation s food supply Based on recent statements a variety of potential politically charged policy options to regulate ultraprocessed food may land on the Trump team menu including warning labels changes to agribusiness subsidies and limits on which products consumers can buy with government food aid The push to reform the American diet is being driven largely by conservatives who have taken up the cause that has long been a darling of the left Trump supporters such as Robert F Kennedy Jr whose controversial nomination to lead the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS still faces Senate confirmation are embracing a concept that champions natural foods and alternative medicine It s a movement they ve dubbed MAHA or Make America Healthy Again Their interest has created momentum because their goals have fairly broad bipartisan support even amid a bitterly divided Congress in which lawmakers from both sides of the aisle focused on the issue last year It s likely to be a pitched battle because the food industry wields immense political influence and has successfully thwarted previous efforts to regulate its products or marketing The category of food processing and sales companies which includes Tyson Foods and Nestle SA tallied 26 7 million in spending on lobbying in 2024 according to OpenSecrets That s up from almost 10 million in 1998 They have been absolutely instrumental and highly highly successful at delaying any regulatory effectiveness in America said Laura Schmidt a health policy professor at the University of California San Francisco It

The intensifying focus in Washington has triggered a new level of interest on the legal front as lawyers explore cases to take on major food makers for selling products they say result in chronic disease Bryce Martinez now 18 filed a lawsuit in December against almost a dozen food makers such as Kraft Heinz The Coca Cola Co and Nestle USA He developed diabetes and non alcoholic fatty liver disease by age 16 and is seeking to hold them accountable for his illnesses According to the suit filed in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas the companies knew or should have known ultraprocessed foods were harmful and addictive The lawsuit noted that Martinez grew up eating heavily advertised brand name foods that are staples of the American diet sugary soft drinks Cheerios and Lucky Charms Skittles and Snickers frozen and packaged dinners just to name a few Nestle Coca Cola and Kraft Heinz didn t return emails seeking comment for this article The Consumer Brands Association a trade association for makers of consumer packaged goods disputed the allegations Attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient

Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions held a December hearing examining links between ultraprocessed food and chronic disease during which FDA Commissioner Robert Califf called for more

growing evidence that these foods are deliberately designed to be addictive and he asserted that ultraprocessed foods have driven epidemics of diabetes and obesity and hundreds of billions of dollars

of the lawyers at Morgan Morgan representing Martinez told KFF Health News The 148 page Martinez lawsuit against food makers draws from documents made public in litigation against tobacco companies that owned some of the biggest brands in the food industry Similar allegations were made against opioid manufacturers distributors and retailers before they agreed to pay tens of billions of dollars in a 2021 settlement with states The FDA ultimately put restrictions on the labeling and marketing of tobacco and the opioid epidemic led to legislation that increased access to lifesaving medications to treat addiction But the Trump administration s zeal in taking on Big Food may face unique challenges The ability of the FDA to impose regulation is hampered in part by funding While the agency s drug division collects industry user fees its division of food relies on a more limited budget determined by Congress Change can take time because the agency moves at what some critics call a glacial pace Last year the FDA revoked a regulation allowing brominated vegetable oil in food products The agency determined in 1970 that the additive was not generally recognized as safe Efforts to curtail the marketing of ultraprocessed food could spur lawsuits alleging that any restrictions violate commercial speech protected by the First Amendment And Kennedy if he is confirmed as HHS secretary may struggle to get support from a Republican led Congress that champions less federal regulation and a president elect who during his previous term served fast food in the White House The question is
