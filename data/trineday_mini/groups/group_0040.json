dangers of its Roundup weedkiller Juries have since returned with three unanimous verdicts finding that glyphosate based Roundup herbicides were a substantial cause of cancer and leveling massive punitive damages against Bayer which now owns Monsanto Thousands more people are suing in state and federal courts and corporate documents coming out of the trials are shining light on the heavy handed tactics Monsanto used to deny cancer risk and protect the chemical that was the lynchpin of its profits Monsanto was its own ghostwriter for some safety reviews Bloomberg reported and an EPA

killer than is permissible These legally allowable levels are referred to as Maximum Residue Limits MRLs and they vary from food to food and pesticide to pesticide as well as from country to country Regulators and agrichemical industry interests say as long as residue levels are lower than the established MRLs consuming the pesticide residues is not harmful to humans But a growing number of scientists and medical professionals say such claims are false particularly with pesticides like glyphosate which is the most widely used agrichemical on the planet commonly used in the production of dozens of food crops Glyphosate is sprayed directly onto crops like corn soybeans sugar beets and canola all of which are genetically engineered to tolerate the pesticide Monsanto has also encouraged

should evaluate and interpret relevant data and how it all should translate into a EPA carcinogen risk classification for glyphosate The exercise is academic by design but powerful economic forces are hard at work hoping to influence the outcome Glyphosate is the billion dollar baby the chief ingredient in Monsanto Co s branded Roundup herbicide as well as in hundreds of other herbicides sold

bottom line not to mention it s planned 66 billion merger with Bayer AG as well as to other agrichemical companies that sell glyphosate products Monsanto is also facing more than three dozen lawsuits over glyphosate cancer concerns and needs EPA backing to defend against the court actions The questions about glyphosate and health issues are not new Numerous scientific studies over multiple decades have raised concerns about harmful glyphosate impacts Monsanto has always countered with its own studies and league of supportive scientists who say glyphosate is not carcinogenic and is one of the

sufficient evidence in the body of research to classify glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen That news was particularly worrisome to consumers because glyphosate use is so pervasive that

the Atlantic the EPA has already made it clear it largely agrees with Monsanto s message that the international cancer scientists are wrong The agency issued a report in September laying out the reasons it proposes to classify glyphosate as not likely to be carcinogenic to humans To get to that finding the agency had to inappropriately discount the results of numerous human and animal studies showing evidence of ties to cancer according to many scientists who are asking the EPA to reconsider its position There are strong arguments for a classification of Likely to be carcinogenic to humans

inadvertently publicly posted an internal glyphosate assessment on its website that made a case for the safety of glyphosate The document was up long enough for Monsanto to issue a press release gleefully tout the documents findings and providing a link to a copy of the document before the agency pulled it down explaining it wasn t final The agency s actions have left environmental and consumer activists disheartened and doubtful the EPA will listen to any serious independent scrutiny of glyphosate s safety Their track record is awful said Patty Lovera assistant director of the advocacy group Food Water Watch We don t want to throw in the towel entirely We want to try to hold them to their mission But there is clearly evidence of industry influence They aren t doing anything to inspire confidence that they re taking a serious look at this Consumers rely on the EPA to prioritize their interests over corporate interests and the EPA should not forget that according to the public comment filed by Pamela Koch executive director of the Laurie M Tisch Center for Food Education Policy at Teachers College Columbia University We urge the EPA to apply the precautionary principle in this review Koch wrote We believe that caring for the public health is of the upmost importance and need regulations that protect farm workers workers who apply glyphosate in non

Evidence Thisarticlewas originally published in the San Francisco Chronicle By Nathan Donley and Carey Gillam It s been three weeks since a San Francisco jury found that exposure to Monsanto s Roundup herbicides contributed to former school groundskeeper Dewayne Lee Johnson s terminal cancer and awarded a stunning 289 million in damages to the 46 year old father And during that time we ve seen repeated assertions from the pesticide giant and its allies that in fact the jury was wrong and the weed killer of choice for millions of Americans is perfectly safe Monsanto Vice President Scott Partridge repeated the familiar mantra Hundreds of scientific studies as well as reviews by regulatory agencies across the globe including the U S Environmental Protection Agency have found that glyphosate the active ingredient in Roundup does not cause cancer Monsanto s new owner Bayer AG went further Bayer CEO Werner Baumann told investors that the jury was just flat out wrong and that Bayer would work to ensure that sales of the weed killing products were not interrupted More than 800 scientific studies and reviews support glyphosate safety he told investors Unchallenged the carefully honed talking points sound impressive and conclusive exactly as intended But in the wake of the jury s award many people across the United States who have been spraying the pesticide on their lawns and gardens for years doubt those reassuring words And with good reason Corporate assurances of safety leave out one important word a word that is critically important to anyone who wants to make an informed decision about the cancer risk associated with Roundup and the hundreds of other glyphosate based herbicides on the market That word is independent as in independent scientific studies and reviews As was laid out in the trial there is a wealth of evidence much of it from within Monsanto s own internal documents detailing how much of the research suggesting that Roundup is safe has been orchestrated and or influenced by Monsanto and its chemical industry allies But truly independent research has shown that there is reason for concern As Roundup use on U S farms residential lawns and gardens has soared from roughly 40 million pounds a year in the 1990s to nearly 300 million pounds in recent years the dangers of the chemical have been documented in numerous peer reviewed studies It was those independent and peer reviewed works that convinced the cancer research arm of the World Health Organization to determine that glyphosate is a probable human

the pesticide is not likely to cause cancer By doing so the agency has ignored the fact that its own Office of Research and Development expressed unease with the EPA s handling of the glyphosate evaluation as did a scientific advisory panel convened by the agency to peer review the evaluation Perhaps not surprisingly the trial evidence also included communications detailing what can only be described as cozy collaborations between Monsanto and certain EPA officials Americans deserve better from their regulators whose priority should be to put the public s health far before corporate

suffered several falls finds it hard to speak and is confined to a wheelchair according to his lawyers Isaak attorney Mike Miller said his client has been left with horrible injuries from Parkinson s Isaak should now be given a trial date no later than January due to his decline in cognition and overall debilitation to his health according to a court filing by The Miller Firm and co counsel Isaak had no reason to suspect that chronic low dose exposure to Paraquat could cause neurological diseases such as Parkinson s disease the lawsuit states But evidence will show the lawsuit contends that the paraquat use was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff George Isaak to suffer severe and permanent physical injuries pain mental anguish and disability and will continue to do so for the remainder of Plaintiff George Isaak s life Carol Isaak George Isaak s wife is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit and is seeking a claim for loss of consortium There are hundreds of cases pending in state and federal courts around the country according to a June 22 court filing The plaintiffs in those cases all allege Syngenta was aware of the risks but failed to warn users Syngenta which is owned by a

Isaak s lawyers effort to obtain court approval for a preference trial has come into conflict with an effort by other attorneys representing other plaintiffs in the paraquat litigation Plaintiffs law firm Walkup Melodia Kelly Schoenberger is seeking to create a special committee made up of plaintiffs lawyers that would evaluate and screen cases seeking preference trials Typically such requests for expedited trials go directly to a judge The firm said a committee was needed because many of the plaintiffs in the overall paraquat litigation would likely qualify for preference They are proposing a protocol implemented by a five member committee of plaintiffs lawyers The majority of the plaintiffs including both filed and unfiled cases known to plaintiffs counsel are over the age of 65 The reality of these cases is that there are many plaintiffs as well as many potential plaintiffs whose disease progression is unstable and who have a real and substantial danger of losing their ability to testify or losing their ability to meaningfully utilize their compensation if their trials are not prioritized the firm stated in a court filing The firm added in a separate filing An uncontrolled race to file competing preference motions risks sending a plaintiff to trial who does not represent the plaintiff population And should the initial trials be ultimately unsuccessful it jeopardizes the rights of all remaining plaintiffs in the proceeding Isaak s lawyers oppose the formation of such a committee and filed a memorandum explaining that opposition on Sept 17 arguing that the use of a preference committee is unconstitutional on its face Whether or not a plaintiff meets the criteria deserving of a preference trial should not be left up to the arbitrary nature of a committee of other plaintiffs attorneys they said The attorneys registering opposition to the preference committee additionally allege that the Walkup firm has a conflict of interest because it has already reached a

found that exposure to agricultural pesticides may increase a person s risk of developing Parkinson s disease In 2011 AHS researchers reported that participants who used paraquat or rotenone were twice as likely to develop Parkinson s disease as people who didn t use these chemicals Syngenta argues that newer and more robust research including by AHS scientists has discounted a tie between paraquat and Parkinson s A recent paper from AHS researchers stated that Extensive literature suggests an association between general pesticide use and Parkinson s disease PD However with few exceptions little is known about associations between specific pesticides and PD Because the paraquat litigation is expected to continue to grow the U S Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation MDL

according to Food Democracy Now and the group s Detox Project which arranged for the testing at the San Francisco based Anresco lab Anresco uses liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry LC MS MS a method widely considered by the scientific community and regulators as the most reliable for analyzing glyphosate residues The groups issued a report Monday that details the findings The announcement of the private tests comes as the Food and Drug Administration FDA is struggling with its own efforts to analyze how much of the herbicide residues might be present in certain foods Though the FDA routinely tests foods for other pesticide residues it never tested for glyphosate until this year The testing for glyphosate residues was recently suspended however Glyphosate is under particular scrutiny now because last year the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC classified it as a probable human carcinogen Glyphosate is the world s most widely used herbicide and is the key ingredient in Monsanto Co s branded Roundup as well as in hundreds of other products The Environmental Protection Agency is now finalizing a risk assessment for glyphosate to determine if future use should be limited The tests conducted by Anresco were done on 29 foods commonly found on grocery store shelves Glyphosate residues were found in General Mills

bodyweight per day mg kg bw day while the European Union has set it at 0 3 for instance The EPA is supposed to set an ADI from all food and water sources that is at least 100 times lower than levels

government should conduct an investigation into the harmful effects of glyphosate on human health and the environment and the relationships between regulators and the agrichemical industry that has long touted the safety of glyphosate Monsanto has said repeatedly that there are no legitimate safety concerns regarding glyphosate when it is used as intended and that toxicological studies in animals have demonstrated that glyphosate does not cause cancer birth defects DNA damage nervous system effects immune system effects endocrine disruption or reproductive problems The company which has been reaping roughly 5 billion a year from glyphosate based products says any glyphosate residues in food are too minimal to be harmful Both the U S Department of Agriculture and the FDA have echoed Monsanto s reassurances in the past citing the chemical s proven safety as justification for not including glyphosate residue testing in annual programs that test thousands of food products each year for hundreds of different types of pesticides But the lack of routine government monitoring has made it impossible for consumers or regulators to determine what levels of glyphosate are

applauded by public health advocates because of evidence the chemical causes cancer along with other harms to people and the environment But under heavy pressure from U S officials Thailand s government reversed the planned ban on glyphosate last November and delayed imposing bans on two other agricultural pesticides despite the fact that the country s National Hazardous Substances Committee said a ban was necessary to protect consumers A ban particularly on glyphosate would severely impact Thai imports of soybeans wheat and other agricultural commodities U S Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Ted McKinney warned Thailand Prime Minister Prayuth Chan Ocha in pushing for the reversal Imports could be impacted because those commodities and many others typically are laced with residues of glyphosate Now newly revealed emails between government officials and Monsanto parent Bayer AG show that McKinney s actions and those taken by other U S government officials to convince Thailand not to ban glyphosate were largely scripted and pushed by Bayer The emails were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the Center for Biological Diversity a nonprofit conservation organization The group sued the U S Department of Agriculture USDA and the U S Department of Commerce on Wednesday seeking additional public records regarding the actions of the departments of trade and agriculture in pressuring Thailand on the glyphosate issue There are several documents the government has thus far refused to release regarding communications with Bayer and other companies the organization said It s bad enough that this administration has ignored independent science to blindly support Bayer s self serving assertions of glyphosate s safety said Nathan

assistance in reversing the glyphosate ban from multiple high level officials from the USDA and the Office of the United States Trade Representative USTR Among those Bayer sought aid from was Zhulieta Willbrand who at that time was chief of staff of trade and foreign agricultural affairs at the U S Department of Agriculture After Thailand s decision to reverse the ban on glyphosate Willbrand was hired to work directly for Bayer on international trade matters When asked if the assistance from Willbrand while she was a government official helped her get a job at Bayer the company said that it ethically strives to hire people from all backgrounds and any inference that she was hired for any reason other than the immense talent she brings to Bayer is false In an email to Willbrand dated Sept 18 2019 Travis told her Bayer thought there was real value for U S government engagement on the glyphosate ban and he noted that Bayer was organizing other groups to protest the ban as well On our end

pointed out the risk a glyphosate ban would pose to sales of U S commodities because of the MRL issue and provided other background material the officials could use to engage with Thailand In light of recent developments we are growing more concerned that some policymakers and lawmakers are rushing the process and will not thoroughly consult all farming stakeholders nor fully consider the economic and environmental impact of banning glyphosate Travis wrote to the U S officials The email exchanges show that Bayer and U S officials discussed potential personal motivations of Thai officials and how such intelligence could be useful Knowing what motivates her may help with USG counter arguments one U S official wrote to Bayer about one Thai leader Travis suggested that U S officials engage much as they had with Vietnam when that country moved in April 2019 to ban glyphosate Shortly after the appeal from Bayer McKinney wrote to the Thailand Prime Minister about the matter In an Oct 17 2019 letter McKinney who previously worked for Dow Agrosciences invited Thailand officials to Washington for an in person discussion about glyphosate safety and the Environmental Protection Agency s determination that glyphosate poses no meaningful risk to human health when used as authorized Should a ban be implemented it would severely impact Thailand s imports of agricultural commodities such as soybean and wheat McKinney wrote I urge you to delay a decision on glyphosate until we can arrange an opportunity for U S technical experts to share the most relevant information to address Thailand s concerns A little more than a month later on Nov 27 Thailand reversed the planned glyphosate ban It also said it would delay bans on paraquat and chlorpyrifos for several months Thailand

was a man with simple dreams All he wanted was a steady job and a nice home for his wife and children something better than the hard life he knew growing up He never imagined that he would become the face of a David and Goliath showdown against one of the world s most powerful corporate giants But a workplace accident left Lee doused in a toxic chemical and facing a deadly cancer that turned his life upside down In 2018 the world watched as Lee was thrust to the forefront of one the most dramatic legal battles in recent history The Monsanto Papers is the inside story of Lee Johnson s landmark lawsuit against Monsanto For Lee the case was a race against the clock with doctors predicting he wouldn t survive long enough to take the witness stand For the eclectic band of young ambitious lawyers representing him it was a matter of professional pride and personal risk with millions of their own dollars and hard earned reputations on the line With a gripping narrative force The Monsanto

of increasing the number of women who value free markets and personal liberty In the world of the IWF a group Joan Walsh described in The Nation as the feminists doing the Koch s dirty work that means defending the freedom of corporations to sell toxic products and pollute the environment while trying to frame that agenda as good for women and children E cigarettes should be approved because of the unique biological needs of women for example and climate science education is too scary for students The e cig letter is standard Phillip Morris PR says tobacco industry expert Stan Glanz and

world Recent science suggests that if you want to get pregnant and raise healthy children you should reject the propaganda that groups like the Independent Women s Forum are trying to sell In just the

human exposure to a common pesticide and a physician s commentary urging people to eat organic food I wrote about those studies in more detail here Trying to get pregnant Science suggests eat organic and regulate the pesticide industry Mainstream groups have been giving similar advice for years In 2012 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended reducing children s exposure to pesticides due to a growing body of literature that links pesticides to chronic health problems in children including behavioral problems birth defects asthma and cancer In 2009 the bipartisan President s Cancer Panel reported the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated The panel urged then President George W Bush most strongly to use the power of your office to remove the carcinogens and other toxins from our food water and air that needlessly increase health care costs cripple our Nation s productivity and devastate American lives Unfortunately for our nation acting on that advice has not been possible in a political system indentured to corporate interests For decades pesticide corporations have manipulated science and U S regulatory agencies to keep the truth

evaluating the cancer risk of glyphosate allegedly bragged to a Monsanto executive about helping to kill another agency s cancer study as Bloomberg reported Suppressing science has been a bipartisan decades long project Since 1973 Monsanto has presented dubious science to claim the safety of glyphosate while EPA largely looked the other way as Valerie Brown and Elizabeth Grossman documented for In These Times Brown and Grossman spent two years examining the publicly available archive of EPA documents on glyphosate and reported Glyphosate is a clear case of regulatory capture by a corporation acting in its own financial interest while serious questions about public health remain in limbo The record suggests that in 44 years through eight presidential administrations EPA management has never attempted to correct the problem Indeed the pesticide industry touts its forward looking modern technologies as it strives to keep its own research in the closet and relies on questionable assumptions and outdated methods in regulatory toxicology The only way to establish a scientific basis for evaluating glyphosate s safety they wrote would be to force some daylight between regulators and the regulated Limited government means freedom to harm In Trump s Washington there is no daylight at all between the corporations selling harmful products and the agencies that are supposed to regulate them EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is pushing scientists off advisory boards and stacking the EPA with political appointees connected to the oil coal and chemical industries many of whom are

Forum presented its Valor Award to Nancy Brinker founder of the Susan G Komen for the Cure the nation s largest breast cancer organization a group that has also drawn criticism for taking money from polluting corporations and promoting unhealthy food and toxic products At the 2007 IWF gala in an acceptance speech she called The Character of our Country Brinker warned that millions of lives will be lost unless America acts to avert the coming cancer tsunami But then she said My friends this is not a problem of politics When it comes to cancer there are no Republicans or Democrats no liberals or conservatives Rather she said invoking vagueness as she stood before a group that tells women not to worry about pesticides at an event awash in corporate cash beating cancer is a matter of summoning the will to make cancer a national and global priority But that is exactly a problem of politics It s about Republicans and Democrats both of whom have let Americans down by failing to

emotional recounting the gruesome final chapter of the love of her life But in recent months she has had reason to be hopeful again In an historic verdict in August a jury ruled that Monsanto had caused a man s terminal cancer and ordered the agrochemical corporation to pay 289m in damages The extraordinary decision exposing the potential hazards of the world s most widely used herbicide has paved the way for thousands of other cancer patients and families to seek justice and compensation in court It s like a serial killer but it s a product said Brooks 57 who has a pending case against Monsanto alleging that her husband s use of the company s popular weedkiller at their home led to his fatal disease It s unconscionable I don t see how they can win The world is against them Brooks said she cried when she learned that a jury had ruled in favor of Dewayne Lee Johnson the terminally ill former school groundskeeper who became the first person to take Monsanto to trial over Roundup The verdict stated that Monsanto acted with malice knew or should have known its chemical was dangerous and failed to warn consumers about the risks Monsanto has filed an appeal and a hearing is

and health risks scientific evidence that the jury ultimately found credible and compelling Johnson who is not expected to survive for more than two years said he had prolonged exposures to glyphosate while applying the herbicide to school properties at least twice accidentally getting large amounts of the chemical on his skin Because Monsanto has insisted that the product is safe and has no cancer

behind a wife and three children But Monsanto is fighting to keep it from him It s a big red flag for the company said Jean M Eggen professor emerita at Widener University Delaware Law School adding of the verdict It brings more people out who might not otherwise sue Roughly 8 700 plaintiffs have made similar cases in state courts across the country alleging that exposure to glyphosate based herbicides led to various types of cancer The impact could be huge if Monsanto continues to fight and lose in jury trials and an accumulation of wins could force the company to consider settling with plaintiffs It could become very costly said Eggen comparing the fight to that of the tobacco industry which aggressively fought cases in court but eventually decided settlements were the best option It s really a business decision Monsanto may ultimately consider changing the labels to warn consumers about cancer risks and work to settle with consumers who have had high exposures said Lars Noah

children and four grandchildren used Roundup from the 1970s until a few years ago around their yard and on multiple properties they purchased and renovated The couple said they chose the herbicide

The case was filed in July 2017 on behalf of more than 75 plaintiffs and Gordon is the first of that group to go to trial According to the complaint Gordon purchased and used Roundup for at least 15 continuous years through approximately 2017 and was diagnosed with a form of non Hodgkin lymphoma in 2006 Gordon has gone through two stem cell transplants and spent a year in a nursing home at one point in her treatment She is so debilitated that it is difficult for her to be mobile Her case like that of the thousands of others filed around the United States alleges use of Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides caused her to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma She s been through hell St Louis attorney Eric Holland one of the legal team members representing Gordon told EHN She s horribly injured The

attention to this The German company s intended 66 billion acquisition of Monsanto Co comes amid growing concern over the future of the company s top selling weed killer a chemical called glyphosate that Monsanto introduced to the world 40 years ago as the active ingredient in its Roundup herbicide Monsanto reaps billions of dollars annually roughly a third of its sales from those products So it s no small matter that in mid October the Environmental Protection Agency EPA plans to spend four days holding public meetings with a scientific advisory panel on the topic of whether or not glyphosate can cause cancer The idea of shining a public spotlight on this mounting concern about the world s most widely used herbicide has not set well with Monsanto and the rest of the industry that profits from glyphosate products like Roundup Agrichemical interests have gone so far as to tell the EPA that the meetings should not be held at all and have said that if they are many of the world s top scientists should be excluded from participating The industry clearly does not welcome the public scrutiny the meetings bring but it should be satisfied that the EPA has made it clear it has no intention of contradicting Monsanto s claims of glyphosate s safety After all in a Sept 12 report issued to the public the EPA offered a 227 page evaluation of glyphosate s cancer causing potential that ended with a proposed conclusion that glyphosate was not likely to be carcinogenic to humans at doses relevant to human health risk assessment All of this before the meetings are held To its credit the EPA did issue several caveats in that report acknowledging that some research does link glyphosate to cancer but offering various explanations as to why the agency doesn t believe those study results are significant and or are outweighed by other studies The agency also added a host of qualifiers stating that with respect to epidemiological studies the data is limited and outdated Because there has been such an increased use of glyphosate following the introduction of glyphosate tolerant crops in 1996 there is a need for more recent studies since a large number of studies were conducted prior to 1996 the EPA stated The agency also said that research needs to be done on glyphosate formulations not just glyphosate alone And the agency included a specific caveat with respect to research tying glyphosate to non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL saying There are conflicting views on how to interpret the overall results for NHL Some believe that the data are indicative of a

say the company s Roundup herbicide gave them or their family members NHL and the company is fighting a court battle with the state of California over regulatory efforts to add glyphosate to a list of known or probable carcinogens And there remains the matter of the EPA s long overdue environmental and health risk assessment for glyphosate in which the EPA could add restrictions to the use of glyphosate if the agency deems those are necessary That risk assessment was due out in 2015 Then the agency said it would be released in 2016 Now the agency says it may be completed by spring of 2017 With the Bayer acquisition the lawsuits and the risk assessment looming Monsanto has been pulling out all the stops to defend glyphosate The pressure on the EPA to defend glyphosate began immediately after the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC declared in March 2015 that research showed glyphosate was probably carcinogenic to humans The IARC decision was announced on Friday March 20 2015 and by the following Monday morning Monsanto s Dan Jenkins the company s regulatory affairs leader was already calling and emailing EPA officials demanding they correct the record on glyphosate Emails obtained through Freedom of Information request show Jenkins submitted talking points to the EPA to try to contradict IARC And since then Monsanto has only intensified its efforts to invalidate the findings of the IARC group attacking the veteran scientists as an unelected undemocratic unaccountable and foreign body Monsanto has also subpoenaed emails and other records from the chairman of that IARC committee Aaron Blair a scientist emeritus at the National Cancer Institute who served as chairman of the IARC team Blair has a long career of accolades and appointments that acknowledge his expertise and he has served on numerous national and international scientific review groups including for the EPA But Monsanto has deemed Blair s work

served on numerous national and international scientific review groups including for the EPA But Monsanto has deemed Blair s work suspect And Monsanto s apparently has done some arm twisting in Congress On Monday the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform wrote to the National Institutes of Health reciting many of the complaints Monsanto and its allies have made about IARC and challenging grants the NIH has made to IARC The EPA s appearance of aligning with Monsanto angers many in the scientific community who say the EPA is straying from established scientific principles and ignoring key evidence so it can keep the corporate interests who profit from glyphosate herbicides happy This chemical is a probable human carcinogen by any reasonable definition It is nonsense to say otherwise said Christopher Portier former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry at the U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Prior to that role Portier spent 32 years with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences NIEHS where he served as the NIEHS associate director director of the Environmental Toxicology Program and associate director of the National Toxicology Program In retirement Portier who was an invited specialist to the IARC review on glyphosate has done some part time work for the Environmental Defense Fund Portier and more than 90 other international scientists have issued a detailed report laying out the specific research that ties glyphosate to cancer both in animal studies and in human observations The scientists said the only way for regulators to discount the evidence is to bend well established rules for scientific evaluations They say available human evidence does show an association between glyphosate and non Hodgkin lymphoma while significant carcinogenic effects are seen in laboratory animals for rare kidney and other types of tumors There is also strong evidence of genotoxicity and oxidative stress including findings of DNA damage in the peripheral blood of people exposed to glyphosate the scientists said The most appropriate and scientifically based evaluation of the cancers reported in humans and laboratory animals as well as supportive mechanistic data is that glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen the report states On the basis of this conclusion and in the absence of evidence to the contrary it is reasonable to conclude that glyphosate formulations should also be considered likely

The amount of money that is involved in this compound is gigantic It s a worldwide conglomerate of financial interests that are affected by this It seems more than coincidental that the EPA s rationale for dismissing scientific studies that IARC said showed cancer links closely dovetails with the findings of a 16 member Monsanto funded panel That group of 16 scientists all but four of whom had previously worked either as employees or consultants for Monsanto issued a report in December that supported Monsanto s contention that there is no real evidence that glyphosate can cause cancer Leading the work was Gary M Williams director of environmental pathology and toxicology at New York Medical College and a consultant to Monsanto Williams has a history of publishing positive findings about glyphosate he was an author of one of Monsanto s most touted studies a 2000 research report that concluded glyphosate is not only not a carcinogen but is considered to be practically nontoxic That panel is preparing to release five articles supporting glyphosate safety in the journal Critical Reviews of Toxicology soon according to Intertek Scientific Regulatory Consultancy which was paid by Monsanto to arrange the panel In the EPA report the one bright spot for critics of glyphosate is that the EPA does call for more testing Specifically the agency acknowledges the need to explore the fears that glyphosate formulations may be more toxic than glyphosate alone The EPA is developing a research plan with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to evaluate the role of glyphosate in product formulations and the differences in formulation toxicity the EPA said Fresh answers can t come soon enough for consumers who worry about persistent levels of glyphosate in the

of Agriculture has quietly dropped a plan to start testing food for residues of glyphosate the world s most widely used weed killer and the key ingredient in Monsanto Co s branded Roundup herbicides The agency spent the last year coordinating with the Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the Food and Drug Administration FDA in preparation to start testing samples of corn syrup for glyphosate residues on April 1 according to internal agency documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests Documents show that at least since January 2016 into January of this year the glyphosate testing plan was moving forward But when asked about the plan this week a USDA spokesman said no glyphosate residue testing would be done at all by USDA this year The USDA s plan called for the collection and testing of 315 samples of corn syrup from around the United States from April through August according to the documents Researchers were also supposed to test for the AMPA metabolite the documents state AMPA aminomethylphosphonic acid is created as glyphosate breaks down Measuring residues that include those from AMPA is important because AMPA is not a benign byproduct but carries its own set of safety concerns scientists believe On Jan 11 USDA s Diana Haynes wrote to colleagues within USDA Based on recent conversations with EPA we will begin testing corn syrup for glyphosate and its AMPA metabolite April 1 2017 with collection ending August 31 2017 This program change will need to be announced at the February PDP Conference Call Haynes is director of a USDA Agricultural Marketing Service division that annually conducts the Pesticide Data Program PDP which tests thousands of foods for hundreds of different pesticide residues The USDA spokesman who did not want to be named acknowledged there had been a glyphosate test plan but said that had recently changed The final decision for this year s program plan as a more efficient use of resources is to sample and test honey which covers over 100 different pesticides Glyphosate residue testing requires a different methodology and will not be part of that screening in honey he said The USDA does not routinely test for glyphosate as it does for other pesticides used in food production But that stance has made the USDA the subject of criticism as controversy over glyphosate safety has mounted in recent years The

attorneys in those cases indicate that Monsanto may have manipulated research regulators relied on to garner favorable safety assessments and last week Congressman Ted Lieu called for a probe by the Department of Justice into Monsanto s actions Along with the USDA the Food and Drug Administration also annually tests thousands of food samples for pesticide residues Both agencies have done so for decades as a means to ensure that traces of weed killers insecticides fungicides and other chemicals used in farming do not persist at unsafe levels in food products commonly eaten by American families If they find residues above the maximum residue level MRL allowed for that pesticide and that food the agencies are supposed to inform the EPA and actions can be taken against the supplier The EPA is the regulator charged with establishing MRLs also called tolerances for different types of pesticides in foods and the agency coordinates with USDA and FDA on the pesticide testing programs But despite the fact that glyphosate use has surged in the last 20 years alongside the marketing of glyphosate tolerant crops both USDA and FDA have declined to test for glyphosate residues aside from one time in 2011 when the USDA tested 300 soybean samples for glyphosate and AMPA residues At that time the agency found 271 samples contained glyphosate but said the levels were under the MRL low enough not to be worrisome The Government Accountability Office took both agencies to task in 2014 for the failure to test regularly for glyphosate Europe and Canada are well ahead of the United States when it comes to glyphosate testing in food In fact the Canadian Food Inspection Agency CFIA is preparing to release its own findings from recent glyphosate testing The CFIA also routinely skipped glyphosate in annual pesticide residue screening for years But it began collecting data in 2015 moving to address concerns about the chemical that were highlighted when the World Health

glyphosate residues what it called a special assignment last year But the effort was fraught with controversy and internal difficulties and the program was suspended last fall Before the suspension one agency chemist found alarming levels of glyphosat e in many samples of U S honey levels that were technically illegal because there have been no allowable levels established for honey by the EPA That revelation caused angst in the beekeeping industry and at least one large honey company was sued by consumer organizations over the glyphosate contamination The same chemist also found glyphosate levels in many samples of oatmeal including infant oat cereal The FDA did not publicize those findings but they were revealed in internal records obtained through a FOIA request Officially the FDA was only looking for glyphosate residues in corn soy eggs and milk in last year s testing assignment though internal records discussed tests on sugar beets popcorn wheat and other foods or grains Newly obtained FDA documents show the agency is engaged now in a glyphosate collaboration designed to validate the testing methodology to be used by multiple FDA laboratories Once the first phase of this

Hemming who previously worked as a scientist for Roundup maker Monsanto Co now operates a commercial testing facility located just a few miles from Monsanto s headquarters But Hemming said his lab s testing did find residues of glyphosate in the samples of breast milk he received from a small group of mothers who were worried that traces of the world s most popular herbicide might be invading their bodies Food companies consumer groups academics and others have also solicited testing for glyphosate residues fueled by fears that prevalent use of the pesticide on genetically engineered food crops may be contributing to health problems as people eat foods containing glyphosate residues Those fears have been growing stoked by some scientific studies that have shown health concerns tied to glyphosate as well as data from the U S Department of Interior finding glyphosate in water and air samples The concern surged last year after the World Health Organization s cancer research unit said it had found enough scientific evidence to classify glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen Consumers groups have been calling on the U S government to test foods for glyphosate residues on behalf of the public to try to determine what levels may be found and if those levels are dangerous But so far those requests have fallen on deaf ears It would seem that would be an easy request to meet

residues on a range of food products including infant formula and other baby foods and also looks for residues in drinking water The purpose of the program is to assure consumers that the food they feed their families is safe according to the USDA But while the USDA looks for residues of other herbicides as well as fungicides and insecticides the agency routinely does not test for glyphosate It

do we know there are only trace amounts without the testing And all that World Health Organization talk of cancer connections to glyphosate Monsanto hired its own experts who concluded that finding was wrong The Environmental Protection Agency which sets the tolerance levels allowed for glyphosate and other pesticides has said glyphosate is safe at certain defined tolerance levels and has actually raised those tolerance levels in recent years At the same time the EPA has been conducting a multi year re evaluation of glyphosate its usage and impacts The agency was due to release a risk assessment last year In fact EPA s chief pesticide regulator Jim Jones said in May that assessment was nearly completed then and should be released by July 2015 But this week an EPA spokeswoman said the report would likely be made public sometime later this year The government pegged glyphosate use in the United States at nearly 300 million pounds for 2013 the most recent year the estimate is

latest evidence that glyphosate herbicides are so pervasive that residues can be found in foods not produced by farmers using glyphosate This article was originally published in Environmental Health News By Carey Gillam As U S regulators continue to dance around the issue of testing foods for residues of glyphosate weed killers government scientists in Canada have found the pesticide in 197 of 200 samples of honey they examined The authors of the study all of whom work for Agri Food Laboratories at the Alberta Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said the prevalence of glyphosate residues in honey samples 98 5 percent was higher than what was reported in several similar studies done over the last five years in other countries Glyphosate is the world s most widely used herbicide and is the active ingredient in Roundup brands as well as hundreds of others sold around the world for agriculture and other purposes Use has grown dramatically over the last 25 years and consumers have become concerned about residues of the herbicide in their food The data provides fresh evidence that glyphosate herbicides are so pervasive in the environment that residues can be found even in a food that is not produced by farmers using glyphosate The researchers noted in their report that they ran into delays trying to calibrate their testing equipment due to difficulties encountered in obtaining a honey sample which did not contain traces of glyphosate Bees pick up traces of pesticides as they move from plant to plant unintentionally transferring residues from crops or weeds sprayed with glyphosate back to their hives In a different study researchers on the Hawaiian island of Kauai took honey directly from 59 bee hives and found glyphosate residues in 27 percent of them The Hawaiian researchers said bee hives located near farming areas as well as golf courses where glyphosate is used had higher concentrations of the pesticide The Canadian report also comes amid growing evidence that glyphosate herbicides can cause cancer specifically non Hodgkin s lymphoma On Tuesday a jury in San Francisco unanimously found that Roundup a glyphosate based herbicide made popular by chemical manufacturer Monsanto Co use was a substantial factor in causing non Hodgkin s lymphoma in a California man That echoed a similar unanimous jury verdict handed down in August in a separate case in which a cancer victim also alleged his disease was due to exposure to Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides Both verdicts came after plaintiffs lawyers presented evidence of multiple studies

after a similar look at honey samples by a U S Food and Drug Administration chemist in 2017 That FDA scientist found all 28 honey samples he looked at had traces of glyphosate with 61 percent of the samples having enough glyphosate to be measured The other samples had residues of the herbicide too slight to measure Safe levels The Canadian report published in a journal called Food Additives Contaminants Part A said that glyphosate is currently an active ingredient in 181 herbicides registered for use in Canada and its widespread use has made it commonly found in the environment The study authors pointed out that Canada like the United States does not have a legal standard for how much of the herbicide is considered safe in honey Regulators in different countries set what are referred to as maximum residue limits MRLs and tell consumers their food is safe if pesticide residues remain below the MRLs In Europe the MRL for glyphosate in honey is 0 05 mg kg also expressed as 50 μg kg The Canadian study authors said that all of the levels they found were below the European limit though the highest was just barely within the legal limit Because the residues did not exceed the MRL

but dropped the plan with little explanation only a couple of months before testing was to have started Legislative push for testing Amid all the concerns about glyphosate and residues in food U S Rep Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut this month introduced a measure called the Keep Food Safe From Glyphosate Act The bill would require the USDA to routinely test food samples for glyphosate residues The bill would also ban the spraying of glyphosate as a desiccant on oats The practice is employed by some farmers to dry their oats before harvesting It makes harvest more efficient but leaves higher residues on finished oat based foods Monsanto now a unit of Bayer AG has marketed glyphosate for use on oats as a desiccant for years and the company also has successfully convinced the EPA to raise the MRL for glyphosate residues allowed in oat products In 1993 for example the EPA had a tolerance for glyphosate in oats at 0 1 parts per million ppm but in 1996 Monsanto asked EPA to raise the tolerance to 20 ppm and the EPA did as asked In 2008 at Monsanto s suggestion the EPA again looked to raise the tolerance for glyphosate in oats this time to 30 ppm In her bill DeLauro is looking to slash the MRL for glyphosate residues in oats to 0 1 ppm Canadian farmers are among the world s top producers of oats and desiccation with glyphosate has been a common practice there Health Canada has

than 40 years of widespread use new scientific tests show formulated weedkillers have higher rates of toxicity to human cells This article was originally published in The Guardian By Carey Gillam US government researchers have uncovered evidence that some popular weedkilling products like Monsanto s widely used Roundup are potentially more toxic to human cells than their active ingredient is by itself These formulated weedkillers are commonly used in agriculture leaving residues in food and water as well as public spaces such as golf courses parks and children s playgrounds The tests are part of the US National Toxicology Program s NTP first ever examination of herbicide formulations made with the active ingredient glyphosate but that also include other chemicals While regulators have previously required extensive testing of glyphosate in isolation government scientists have not fully examined the toxicity of the more complex products sold to consumers farmers and others Monsanto introduced its glyphosate based Roundup brand in 1974 But it is only now after more than 40 years of widespread use that the government is investigating the toxicity of glyphosate based herbicides on human cells The NTP tests were requested by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA after the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC in 2015 classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen The IARC also highlighted concerns about formulations which combine glyphosate with other ingredients to enhance weed killing effectiveness Monsanto and rivals sell hundreds of these products around the world in a market valued at roughly 9bn Mike DeVito acting chief of the National Toxicology Program Laboratory told the Guardian the agency s work is ongoing but its early findings are clear on one key point We see the formulations are much more toxic The formulations were killing the cells The glyphosate really didn t do it DeVito said A summary of the NTP work stated that glyphosate formulations decreased human cell viability disrupting cell membranes Cell viability was significantly altered by the formulations it stated DeVito said the NTP first phase results do not mean the formulations are causing cancer or any other disease While the work does show enhanced toxicity from the formulations and show they kill human cells the NTP appears to contradict an IARC finding that glyphosate and or its formulations induce oxidative stress one potential pathway toward cancer The government still must do other testing including examining any toxic impact on a cell s genetic material to help add to the understanding of risks according to DeVito The NTP work informs a global debate over whether or not these glyphosate based weedkilling chemical combinations are

from store shelves picking up products the EPA told them were the top sellers he said It is not clear how much Monsanto itself knows about the toxicity of the full formulations it sells But internal company emails dating back 16 years which emerged in a court case last year offer a glimpse into the company s view In one 2003 internal company email a Monsanto scientist stated You cannot say that Roundup is not a carcinogen we have not done the necessary testing on the formulation to make that statement The testing on the formulations are not anywhere near the level of the active ingredient Another internal email written in 2010 said With regards to the carcinogenicity of our formulations we don t have such testing on them directly And an internal Monsanto email from 2002 stated

glyphosate cites the EPA assessment and says that glyphosate herbicides have been extensively evaluated and are proven to be a safe and efficient weed control tool The study authors said their new meta analysis evaluated all published human studies including a 2018 updated government funded study known as the Agricultural Health Study AHS Monsanto has cited the updated AHS study as proving that there is no tie between glyphosate and NHL In conducting the new meta analysis the researchers said they focused on the highest exposed group in each study because those individuals would be most likely to have an elevated risk if in fact glyphosate herbicides cause NHL Looking only at individuals with real world high exposures to the pesticide makes it is less likely that confounding factors may skew results the authors said In essence if there is no true connection between the chemical and cancer then even highly exposed individuals should not develop cancer at significant rates In

Chemical By Carey Gillam The Environmental Protection Agency s ongoing risk assessment of the world s most widely used herbicide is starting to generate more questions than answers On Monday it also generated a giant oops from the EPA On Friday April 29 the EPA posted on its website a series of documents related to its long awaited risk assessment for glyphosate the active ingredient in Monsanto s Roundup herbicide and other weed killing products sold around the world The risk assessment started in 2009 and was supposed to conclude in 2015 But questions about whether or not glyphosate may cause cancer are dogging the agency s review and have slowed the process On Monday after the contents of the documents started to generate questions from media EPA yanked those documents from its website An agency spokeswoman said this Glyphosate documents were inadvertently posted to the Agency s docket These documents have now been taken down because our assessment is not final EPA has not completed our cancer review We will look at the work of other governments as well as work by HHS s Agricultural Health Study as we move to make a decision on glyphosate Our assessment will be peer reviewed and completed by end of 2016 The EPA said it was working through some important science issues on glyphosate including residues of the chemical in human breast milk an in depth human incidents and epidemiology evaluation and a preliminary analysis of glyphosate toxicity to milkweed a critical resource for the monarch butterfly Inadvertent or not one of those documents posted and then withdrawn was a doozy a heavy hammer that seeks to knock down worries about glyphosate ties to cancer The agency released an Oct 1 2015 internal EPA memorandum from its cancer assessment review committee CARC that contradicts the March 2015 finding by the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC classifying glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen EPA found instead that glyphosate is Not Likely to be Carcinogenic to Humans The memorandum stated that the classification was based on weight of evidence considerations CARC said this The epidemiological evidence at this time does not support a causal relationship between glyphosate exposure and solid tumors There is also no evidence to support a causal relationship between glyphosate exposure and the following non solid tumors leukemia multiple myeloma or Hodgkin lymphoma The epidemiological evidence at this time is inconclusive for a causal or clear associative relationship between glyphosate and

with a group of independent scientists to go over troubling information related to glyphosate Lieu cited concerns that EPA is relying on Monsanto backed data rather than independent peer reviewed research in assessing glyphosate Sources close to the situation say that meeting has been scheduled for June 14 though both EPA and Lieu s office declined to comment The EPA s diligence on digging into glyphosate questions and concerns is encouraging to those who want to see a thorough risk assessment done But the delay and the questionable actions with releasing documents and then withdrawing

By Carey Gillam CAMBRIA Calif Standing on the ridge overlooking her central California farm new widow Teri McCall sees her husband Jack nearly everywhere There atop the highest hill is where the couple married in 1975 two self described hippies who knew more about how to surf than farm And over there surrounded by the lemon avocado and orange trees J ack planted sits the 800 square foot house the young Vietnam veteran built for his bride and a family that grew to include two sons and a daughter Solar panels Jack set up in a sun drenched stretch of grass power the farm s irrigation system And down there clasped in the cusp of the velvet green valley sits the century old farmhouse Jack and Teri eventually made their permanent home Jack installed a stained glass window featuring a heart and flowers over the front door Literally hundreds of times a day something reminds me of him McCall says as she and a visitor strolled through the orchards on a recent sunny spring morning That s part of why it s so hard to believe I can never see him again Anthony Jack McCall 69 died Dec 26 after a painful and perplexing battle with non Hodgkin lymphoma The loss is certain fixed forever into his family s heartbreak But questions about why and how he was stricken a man who never smoked stayed fit and had no history of cancer in his family are part of what some legal experts see as a potential landmark legal claim against one of the world s largest agrichemical companies Monsanto Co McCall shunned pesticide use on his farm except for the herbicide called Roundup marketed by Monsanto as having extremely low toxicity He used Roundup regularly spraying it himself around the farm to drive back worrisome weeds He even recommended Roundup to friends telling them it was supposed to be much safer than alternatives on the market and touting its effectiveness But now in his death McCall is one of several plaintiffs in more than a dozen lawsuits that claim the active ingredient in Roundup a chemical called glyphosate gave them cancer and that Monsanto has long known glyphosate poses significant risks to human health including a risk of causing cancer The lawsuits brought by plaintiffs in California Florida Missouri Delaware Hawaii and elsewhere over the last several months claim Monsanto has hidden evidence and manipulated regulators and the public into believing in the safety of glyphosate which annually brings in about 5 billion or a third of total sales for the agribusiness giant Like McCall many farmed or worked in agricultural jobs in which they

the longest running mass tort action in U S history Asbestos was used for years as a safe and effective flame retardant in the construction industry but has been tied to lung diseases and cancers and spawned hundreds of millions of dollars in legal claims The glyphosate litigation partly mirrors courtroom battles Monsanto has been fighting for years involving the polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs

classified by agency scientists as a possible human carcinogen in 1985 before classified in 1991 as a having evidence of non carcinogenicity for humans The classification was changed despite the fact that some peer review members did not concur The lawsuits also cite evidence of fraud at laboratories used by Monsanto to perform toxicology studies of glyphosate and point to fraud convictions of executives at those labs St Louis based Monsanto a global agrichemical and seed powerhouse cites its own evidence to counter both the validity of the allegations in the lawsuits as well as the IARC findings Last year the company hired a team of experts to review the safety of glyphosate and said that team found no cancer links Comprehensive long term toxicological studies repeated over the last

considering restrictions processes that have become fraught with infighting and accusations of bias from both fans and foes of glyphosate The European Food Safety Authority EFSA said in November that evidence shows glyphosate is unlikely to be carcinogenic But the European Parliament has said the herbicide use should be reined in with a ban on non professional use and around parks and playgrounds because of the health worries The EPA was due to release a fresh risk assessment on glyphosate nearly a year ago but has stalled the process amid the uproar And in an odd twist to the saga on April 29 the agency posted an internal document t o its website showing that the EPA s cancer assessment experts have determined that glyphosate is Not Likely to be Carcinogenic to Humans On May 2 EPA withdrew the memo from its website and said it was not supposed to have been released because the cancer assessment is ongoing But Monsanto heralded the release of the document as proof of what it has been

country For the second time in less than eight months a US jury has found that decades of scientific evidence demonstrates a clear cancer connection to Monsanto s line of top selling Roundup herbicides which are used widely by consumers and farmers Twice now jurors have additionally determined that the company s own internal records show Monsanto has intentionally manipulated the public record to hide the cancer risks Both juries found punitive damages were warranted because the company s cover up of cancer risks was so egregious The juries saw evidence that Monsanto has ghost written scientific papers tried to silence scientists scuttled independent government testing and cozied up to regulators for favorable safety reviews of glyphosate the active ingredient in Roundup Even the US district judge Vince Chhabria who oversaw the San Francisco trial that concluded Wednesday with an 80 2m damage award had harsh words for Monsanto Chhabria said there were large swaths of evidence showing that the company s herbicides could cause cancer He also said there was a great deal of evidence that Monsanto has not taken a responsible objective approach to the safety of its product and does not particularly care whether its product is in fact giving people cancer focusing instead on manipulating public opinion and undermining anyone who raises genuine and legitimate concerns about the issue Monsanto s new owner the German pharmaceutical company Bayer asserts that the juries and judges are wrong the evidence of a cancer risk is invalid the evidence of bad corporate conduct is misunderstood and out of context and that the company will ultimately prevail Meanwhile Monsanto critics are celebrating the wins and counting on more as a third trial got underway this week and 11 000 additional plaintiffs await their turn As well a growing number of communities and businesses are backing away from use of Monsanto s herbicides And investors are

occurring emerging and re emerging infections according to his preview of the presentation NIAID s blending of bioterrorism defense and emerging infectious diseases research has long generated debate in the scientific community especially insofar as it brought a rise in high security labs and high risk research Gain of function research GOF makes viruses more pathogenic or transmissible Much of this gain of function research is considered dual use research of concern DURC because it can be applied toward benevolent civilian aims or misapplied toward the development of bioweapons The new

presentation come from James Le Duc former director of the maximum security Galveston National Laboratory who invited Fauci to give the talk as part of a forum for students on national defense He described Fauci s presentation as having drawn a connection between zoonotic and laboratory threats Your talk was perfect in summarizing the importance of the role that academia has played in contributing to the defense of the Nation against threats of bioterrorism Le Duc said The linkage you drew between naturally occurring and manmade threats from infectious diseases was especially relevant as was your summary of the evolution of the NIAID programs in biodefense and emerging infectious diseases Fauci s biodefense legacy has taken on a new significance in light of the COVID 19

proliferation of high security labs earlier in the decade had lacked any unifying strategic mission and that the government had never assessed the risks Since no single agency is in charge of the expansion no one is determining the aggregate risks associated with this expansion the Government Accountability Office report read As a consequence no federal agency can determine whether high containment laboratory capacity may now meet or exceed the national need or is at a level that can be operated safely Four years later this problem had remained unresolved The National Security Advisor rejected a proposed assessment of whether the proliferation of high security labs outpaced national need and posed undue risks having determined that it is not in the best interests of U S national security to allocate resources in that way Subsequent GAO reports uncovered major biosecurity breaches As recently as January 2023 the GAO identified major gaps in the oversight of the riskiest research and reiterated that no single department was responsible for the biosafety and biosecurity of pandemic pathogens We maintain that implementing our 2009 recommendation to charge a single federal entity with periodic government wide strategic evaluations of high containment laboratories would help the Department of Health and Human Services assess the risks the report read The scientific community is split on whether SARS CoV 2 emerged through zoonotic spillover or through a lab accident perhaps at the Wuhan Institute of Virology which was working with American partners on gain of function research Some scientists say the COVID 19 pandemic has validated the ramp up in research on high risk viruses in the U S and abroad Other scientists say it has underscored its dangers

Project GVP was designed to discover and catalog thousands of novel viruses that could spill over in nature or pose global biosecurity risks estimated to be 500 000 viruses or more Among the project leaders were Shi Zhengli a senior scientist with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and her American collaborator Peter Daszak Sequencing for the GVP was to be led in part by BGI China s largest genomic sequencing company Both the WIV and BGI have ties to the People s Liberation Army China s Academy of Military Medical Sciences was also set to be a collaborator Hundreds of records obtained by U S Right to Know from Freedom of Information Act lawsuits show how the GVP was boosted by the State Department and underwritten by USAID as it got off the ground from 2016 2019 They also show that the U S forged ahead despite unanswered questions around who would own the data and whether Chinese partners would be transparent with the research When the COVID 19 pandemic hit the WIV s library of coronavirus samples was unavailable for independent inspection At least 11 051 samples were left in WIV freezers by USAID backed scientists The documents give a window into the U S government s aims in entering into high risk projects with the Wuhan lab Officials hoped health security provided a noncontroversial opportunity for collaboration The project also served the U S government s desire for more cooperation on China s work on infectious diseases and its Belt and Road Initiative the records show American institutions were told that if China undertook novel virus research without U S participation it could pose a national security risk according to a draft pitch from May 20 2019 outlining the project Chinese officials were told the same Limited access to the information gained

as it got off the ground with 1 3 million according to a letter by Sen Roger Marshall R Kan USAID also underwrote the prototype for the GVP a similar novel virus collection and research project called PREDICT with at least 210 million The GVP was created by Daszak the president of a nonprofit called EcoHealth Alliance and two other leaders of PREDICT epidemiologist Jonna Mazet of UC Davis and Dennis Carroll former director of USAID s Emerging Threats Division As PREDICT wound down and the resources were diverted to the GVP a sample disposition plan was shared with USAID indicating that 6 380 samples from bats collected by PREDICT as well as 3 000 human samples and 1 671 rodent samples were left in WIV freezers These include samples from Yunnan Province where coronaviruses closely related to SARS CoV 2 the virus that causes COVID 19 circulate The WIV was excluded from eligibility debarred from federal funding for 10 years in September 2023 the maximum number of years allowed by law for its failure to turn over lab notebooks about its coronavirus experiments to its funders at the NIH EcoHealth and Daszak are also under investigation by the Department of Health and Human

focus on Gain of Function Research research on live animals and ranking viruses according to their risk of starting a pandemic DEEP VZN s precautions contrast with PREDICT whose funds were used to isolate novel coronaviruses create chimeras and analyze and publish which viruses posed the greatest risk of infecting humans PREDICT may not have inactivated about half of its collected samples and did not expressly prohibit gain of function research with newly discovered viruses or dual use research of concern The newest safety precautions seem designed to prevent the kind of research some scientists worry could lead to a pandemic Yet though the proposal for DEEP VZN appears to prohibit gain of function research the term isn t clearly defined by the scientific community and isn t described in more detail in their proposal The definition is murky enough that the NIH did not apply rules restricting gain of function research to experiments that constructed chimeric viruses more pathogenic than the parent virus in humanized mice Razor thin safety margins when handling wildlife While DEEP VZN s precautions may mitigate risk in the lab the risk of exposure in the field remains Bites and scratches can cut through gloves and fluids like blood urine and saliva have splattered into researchers faces Standard safety gear like Tyvek suits may offer inadequate protection In our experience Tyvek easily tears and allows exposure to undergarments or skin EcoHealth Alliance stated on a January 25th 2017 PREDICT team call They also noted that gloves make handling animals difficult in hot humid areas due to perspiration which could tempt virus hunters to remove them Virus hunters can become infected even if they use all appropriate safety gear and have no obvious

to viruses they otherwise would not be exposed to said Justin Kinney an Associate Professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and co founder of Biosafety Now a non profit that advocates for increased regulations on pathogen research There is a risk that some workers could become infected with previously undiscovered viruses could transmit those viruses to others and could potentially trigger a new pandemic According to virus hunter and infectious disease specialist Michael Callahan in Politico the margins for personal protection during these expeditions are razor thin The fact that researchers are not infected every time they do a field collection is a question that continues to stump us However documents obtained by U S Right to Know show that PREDICT thought the risk of infection during sampling was minimal It is highly unlikely that PREDICT team members as part of their routine activities are at increased risk of exposure to pathogens from the animals being sampled above the background level of the local community who actively hunt and consume many of the animal species being sampled one document reads Viral sequences pose information risk Some scientists and biosafety experts worry that other labs will use viral sequences published by DEEP VZN to perform high risk experiments even if DEEP VZN doesn t These concerns are not unfounded considering novel coronaviruses like swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus SADS discovered by PREDICT have been recovered and studied outside of the project Publishing the sequences of potential pathogens could even give bad actors the blueprints for an arsenal of plagues according to Kevin Esvelt a biologist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Virologists will almost certainly use other funds to resurrect some of the newly identified viruses from knowledge of the viral genomes And unless stringent new biosafety regulations are adopted by the US and other governments dangerous gain of function experiments will almost certainly be performed on the newly identified viruses that have the greatest potential to trigger a new pandemic said Kinney Unfortunately there are barriers to adopting

differences usually large differences between the research proposed in a grant application and research performed under a funded grant he said Indeed DEEP VZN s proposal states that no viruses will be

discovery scientists remain split on the benefits of such programs Ravindra Gupta a microbiology professor at the Cambridge Institute for Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Diseases says that

referring to the Global Virome Project a virus hunting offshoot of PREDICT Increased knowledge of mammalian viruses can also help rapidly contextualize where how and why new human viruses originate in wildlife wrote Colin Carlson an assistant research professor at Georgetown s Center for Global Health Science and Security He described how PREDICT helped categorize SARS CoV 2 at the beginning of the pandemic PREDICT funded work has contributed to the sequence libraries along with rapid isolation of the virus and global data sharing that allowed taxonomists to rapidly classify SARS CoV 2 and propose candidate origins he said Opponents of viral discovery programs note that they haven t predicted any pandemics yet and any benefits can be achieved by safer means Monitoring of virus in humans livestock crops and wastewater poses little or no risk and provides much greater and much more immediately actionable practical benefits said Ebright Any such viruses have already infected humans or are poised to do so Early detection can prevent widespread transmission without the risk of introducing novel pathogens to human populations Prominent virologists have also argued that an easier

pathogens can be challenging even during or in response to an actual outbreak It seems all previous efforts around outbreaks have failed wrote Andrew Clements PREDICT s USAID senior scientific advisor in a 2018 email discussing whether PREDICT should sample animals to find the reservoir of an Ebola outbreak The benefits of the research that will be funded by DEEP VZN are very unclear said Kinney Indeed only one novel PREDICT virus posed a potential threat to humans This virus was sequenced from a patient rather than an animal and only spread to a handful of people Although PREDICT almost certainly discovered hundreds of potential zoonoses their true zoonotic potential is almost impossible to assess leading to the surprising statistic that the programme only led to one conclusive discovery of a zoonosis the Bas Congo virus wrote Carlson Steven Salzberg a biomedical engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University goes further than Kinney stating that there are no benefits whatsoever to programs like DEEP VZN He also disagrees with claims that PREDICT funded work may have helped respond to the pandemic or shed light on COVID s origins It s true that we had a few viruses from animals that told us perhaps where it originated e g from bats but 3 years later we still don t have an answer to that question So it s simply false to say those sequences helped us identify things at the beginning of the pandemic said Salzberg The risk benefit ratio is extremely unfavorable said Ebright In particular virus discovery research in wildlife is not needed for and does not

in biosecurity protocols governing the management and storage of biological samples left behind when projects like PREDICT end according to documents obtained by U S Right to Know PREDICT was a 200

an excerpt from Chapter 5 Seedy Business What Big Food is hiding with its slick PR campaign on GMOs by Gary Ruskin co director of the public watchdog group US Right to Know Updates Ketchum PR

Ketchum reported terminating its relationship with the Russian Federation on Jan 1 2016 The Council for Biotechnology Information the trade group for the largest agrichemical firms paid Ketchum over 11 million between 2013 2016 million to run its marketing and promotional website GMO Answers The agrichemical industry faces major public relations challenges so it needs superb PR assistance Perhaps it is not surprising that they hired the public relations firm that represents Russia Ketchum to manufacture the spin they need to keep its lavish profits flowing from the sale of genetically engineered seeds and related pesticides We Americans have good reason to distrust the ways that Russia and its PR firm Ketchum spin Russia s aggressive foreign policy So why should we trust Ketchum

than 21 artificially sweetened beverages per week compared to those who consumed none was associated with almost doubled risk of overweight or obesity 6 A study of beverage consumption among children and adolescents aged 6 19 published in International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition found that BMI is positively associated with consumption of diet carbonated beverages 7 A two year study in of 164 children published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition found that Increases in diet soda consumption were significantly greater for overweight and subjects who gained weight as compared to normal weight subjects Baseline BMI Z score and year 2 diet soda consumption predicted 83 1 of the variance in year 2 BMI Z score It also found that Diet soda consumption was the only type of beverage associated with year 2 BMI Z score and consumption was greater in overweight subjects and subjects who gained weight as compared to normal weight subjects at two years 8 The U S Growing Up

of excessive weight gain metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease 11 according to a 2013 Purdue review over 40 years published in Trends in Endocrinology Metabolism Other types of studies similarly suggest that artificial sweeteners do not contribute to weight loss For example interventional studies do not support the notion that artificial sweeteners produce weight loss According to the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine review of the scientific literature consensus from interventional studies suggests that artificial sweeteners do not help reduce weight when used alone 12 Some studies also suggest that artificial sweeteners increase appetite which may promote weight gain For example the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine review found that Preload experiments generally have found that sweet taste whether delivered by sugar or artificial sweeteners enhanced human appetite 13 Studies based on rodents suggest that consumption of artificial sweeteners can lead to consuming extra food According to the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine review Inconsistent coupling between sweet taste and caloric content can lead to compensatory overeating and positive energy balance In addition according to the same article artificial sweeteners precisely because they are sweet encourage sugar craving and sugar dependence 14 A 2014 study in the American Journal of Public Health found that Overweight and obese adults in the United States drink more diet beverages than healthy weight adults consume significantly more calories from solid food at both meals and snacks than overweight and obese adults who drink SSBs sugar sweetened beverages and consume a comparable amount of total calories as overweight and obese adults who drink SSBs 15 A 2015 study of

into phenylalanine which interferes with the action of an enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase IAP previously shown to prevent metabolic syndrome which is a group of symptoms associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease According to a 2017 study in Applied Physiology Nutrition and Metabolism mice receiving aspartame in their drinking water gained more weight and developed other

find a link between artificial sweeteners and weight gain Two industry funded studies did not A 2014 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition meta analysis concluded that Findings from observational studies showed no association between LCS low calorie sweetener intake and body weight or fat mass and a small positive association with BMI body mass index however data from RCTs randomized controlled trials which provide the highest quality of evidence for examining the potentially causal effects of LCS intake indicate that substituting LCS options for their regular calorie versions results in a modest weight loss and may be a useful dietary tool to improve compliance with weight loss or weight maintenance plans The authors received funding to conduct this research from the North American Branch of the International Life Sciences Institute ILSI 24 The International Life Sciences Institute a nonprofit that produces science for the food industry is controversial among public

many other products marketed as diet Evidence also links aspartame to weight gain increased appetite and obesity related diseases See our fact sheet Aspartame is tied to weight gain This evidence

Food and Drug Administration to investigate the marketing and advertising practices of diet products containing aspartame The agencies declined to take action see FTC response and FDA response In July 2023 the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC classified aspartame as possibly carcinogenic to humans The World Health Organization FAO Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives JECFA

sweeteners for weight loss including aspartame The recommendation is based on a systematic review of the most current scientific evidence which suggests that consumption of non sugar sweeteners is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes cardiovascular diseases and all cause mortality as well as increased body weight The FDA has said aspartame is safe for the general population under

scientists have both raised concerns about negative effects of aspartame and shortcomings in the science submitted to the FDA by the manufacturer G D Searle Monsanto bought Searle in 1984 In 1987 UPI published a series of investigative articles by Gregory Gordon reporting on these concerns including early studies linking aspartame to health problems the poor quality of industry funded research that led to its approval and the revolving door relationships between FDA officials and the food industry Gordon s series is an invaluable resource for anyone seeking to understand the history of aspartame NutraSweet Aspartame studies point to serious health risks While many studies some of them industry sponsored have reported no problems with aspartame dozens of independent studies conducted over decades have linked aspartame to a long list of health problems Aspartame risks include Cancer An April 2025 study in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety provided substantial evidence that aspartame is a risk factor for the development of liver cancer our study reveals that aspartame induces liver cancer In May 2024 the World Health Organization s cancer research agency the IARC published its full monograph on aspartame As announced in January IARC found aspartame is possibly carcinogenic The monograph notes that a minority of the working group supported classifying aspartame as probably carcinogenic to humans based on a combination of limited evidence for cancer in humans and sufficient evidence for cancer in experimental animals supported by the limited mechanistic evidence A large 2022 cohort study in PLOS Medicine involving 102 865 French adults found that artificial sweeteners especially aspartame and acesulfame K were associated with increased cancer risk

the evidence of the potential carcinogenic effects a re evaluation of the current position of international regulatory agencies must be considered an urgent matter of public health Research published in Scientific Reports in May 2024 employed network toxicology and molecular docking techniques to systematically examine the potential carcinogenic effects and mechanisms of aspartame The findings suggest that aspartame has the potential to impact various cancer related proteins potentially raising the likelihood of cellular carcinogenesis by interfering with biomolecular function Furthermore the study found that the action patterns and pathways of aspartame related targets are like the mechanisms of known carcinogenic pathways further supporting the scientific hypothesis of its potential carcinogenicity Transgenerational impacts Anxiety and learning deficits A 2022 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports that exposure of mice to aspartame at doses equivalent to below 15 of the FDA recommended daily intake for humans produces anxiety like behavior The anxiety appears in up to two generations descending from the aspartame exposed males These data do not merely add anxiety to the long list of aspartame s adverse effects but also raise the previously unrecognized possibility that aspartame s adverse effects are not limited to the individuals who consume it but persist for generations to come the researchers wrote Therefore aspartame deserves a place on the list of environmental agents such as hormones insecticides and drugs of abuse whose

reported their headaches could be provoked by chewing sugarless gum containing aspartame according to a 1997 paper in Headache Journal A crossover trial comparing aspartame and a placebo published in 1994 in Neurology provides evidence that among individuals with self reported headaches after ingestion of aspartame a subset of this group report more headaches when tested under controlled

article was first published by Huffington Post By Carey Gillam It s been a rough year for Big Soda sellers of those sugary soft drinks that kids and adults love to chug A June 16 decision by city leaders in Philadelphia to impose a soda tax as a means to discourage consumption of beverages seen as unhealthy is only the latest in a string of bad news for companies like Coca Cola and PepsiCo which have seen soft drink sales steadily declining Nervous investors drove shares in those companies lower after the Philadelphia move in recognition of what is but the latest evidence that consumers lawmakers and health experts are connecting sweetened beverages to a range of health problems including obesity and type 2 diabetes Last year San Francisco passed a law requiring ads for sugary drinks to include warnings about the possible negative health effects associated with the products A critical blow came last June when World Health Organization WHO Director General Margaret Chan said the marketing of full sugar soft drinks was a key contributor to rising child obesity around the world especially in developing countries WHO published a new sugar guideline in March 2015 and Chan suggested restrictions on sugar rich beverage consumption Mexico already implemented its own soda tax in 2014 and many cities in the U S and around the world are currently considering such restrictions or disincentives like added taxes while others have already done so The Mexican soda tax has correlated with a drop in soda purchases according to research published earlier this year It s no surprise that the beverage industry which reaps billions of dollars annually from soft drink sales has been fearing and fighting against this shifting sentiment But what is surprising is one of the places where the beverage industry has sought and apparently garnered some help from a top official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention whose mission in part is to prevent obesity diabetes and other health problems Email communications obtained by U S Right to Know through state Freedom of Information requests detail how a leading beverage and food industry advocate last year was able to ask for and input and guidance from Dr Barbara Bowman director of CDC s Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention on how to address World Health Organization actions that were hurting the beverage industry Bowman leads a CDC division charged with providing public health leadership and works with states to promote research and grants to prevent and manage risk factors that

out to Bowman to complain that the World Health Organization was giving a cold shoulder to the chemical and food industry funded group known as ILSI which Malaspina founded in 1978 The email strings include reports of concerns about Coca Cola s new Coca Cola Life sweetened with stevia and criticisms that it still contained more sugar than daily limit recommended by WHO The emails include reference to the WHO s call for more regulation on sugary soft drinks saying they were contributing to rising obesity rates among children and complain about Chan s comments Any ideas how we can have a conversation with WHO Malaspina writes in a June 26 2015 email to Bowman He forwards her an email string that includes top executives from Coca Cola and ILSI and expresses worry about negative reports about products with high sugar content and sugary soda tax plans in Europe In the email string Malaspina says the WHO actions can have significant negative consequences on a global basis The threat to our business is serious Malaspina writes in the email chain he sends to Bowman On the email chain are Coca Cola Chief Public Affairs and Communications Officer Clyde Tuggle as well as Coca Cola s Chief Technical Officer Ed Hays Directly he tells Bowman that officials at WHO do not want to work with industry And says Something must be done Bowman replies that someone with Gates or Bloomberg people may have close connections that could open a door at WHO She also suggests he try someone at PEPFAR program a U S government backed program that makes HIV AIDS drugs available through the sub Saharan Africa She tells him that WHO is key to the network She writes that she will be in touch about getting together In a subsequent June 27 2015 email Malaspina thanks her for the very good leads and says we would want WHO to start working with ILSI again and for WHO to not only consider sugary foods as the only cause of obesity but to consider also the life style changes that have

appears improper according to Marion Nestle author of the book Soda Politics and a professor of nutrition food studies and public health at New York University These emails suggest that ILSI Coca Cola and researchers funded by Coca Cola have an in with a prominent CDC official Nestle said The official appears to be interested in helping these groups organize opposition to eat less sugar and disclose industry funding recommendations The invitation to dinner suggests a cozy relationship This appearance of conflict of interest is precisely why policies for engagement with industry are needed for federal officials But CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harben said the emails do not necessarily represent a conflict or problem It is not unusual for CDC to be in touch with people on all sides of an issue Harben said Robert Lustig Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology at the University of California San Francisco said ILSI is a known front group for the food industry Lustig said he finds it interesting that the CDC has yet to take a stance on limiting sugar consumption despite the WHO concerns about links to disease Lustig directs UCSF s WATCH program Weight Assessment for Teen and Child Health and is co founder of the non profit Institute for Responsible Nutrition Neither Bowman nor Malaspina responded to requests for comment The email exchanges show that Bowman did more than simply respond to questions from Malaspina She also initiated emails and forwarded information she received from other organizations Many of Bowman s emails with Malaspina were received and sent through her personal email account though in at least one of the communications Bowman forwarded information from her CDC email address to her personal email account before sharing it with

checkered relationship with the World Health Organization working at one time closely with its Food and Agricultural Organization FAO and with WHO s International Agency for Research on Cancer and the International Programme on Chemical Safety But a report by a consultant to WHO found that ILSI was infiltrating WHO and FAO with scientists money and research to garner favor for industry products and strategies ILSI was also accused of attempting to undermine WHO tobacco control efforts on behalf of the tobacco industry WHO eventually distanced itself from ILSI But questions about ILSI influence

Environmental Health Perspectives showed a link between aspartame and cancer in lab rats A study in rats links the popular artificial sweetener aspartame to a wide range of cancers but industry officials charge that the research is badly flawed Aspartame is found in the low calorie sweetener Equal and in many other sugar free products under the brand name NutraSweet It is the second best selling nonsugar sweetener in the world Researchers in Italy concluded that rats exposed to varying doses of aspartame throughout their lives developed leukemias lymphomas and several other cancers in

immediate departure from the agency on Thursday two days after it came to light that she had been offering guidance to a leading Coca Cola advocate who was seeking to influence world health authorities on sugar and beverage policy matters In her role at CDC Dr Barbara Bowman director of CDC s Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention has been involved in a range of health policy initiatives for the division charged with providing public health leadership She began her career at the CDC in 1992 Bowman s boss Ursula Bauer Director National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion sent an email to staff members after my June 28 story in this blog revealed the Coca Cola connections In that email she confirmed the accuracy of the report and while she defended Bowman s actions she said the perception that some readers may take from the article is not ideal She also warned employees to avoid similar actions saying the situation serves as an important reminder of the old adage that if we don t want to see it on the front page of the newspaper then we shouldn t do it Bowman s exit was announced through internal emails Bowman told colleagues in a CDC email sent Thursday that she had decided to retire late last month She made no reference to the revelations about her connections with Coca Cola or any other concerns Bauer sent a separate email applauding Bowman s work with CDC Barbara has served with distinction and has been a strong innovative dedicated and supportive colleague She will be greatly missed by our center and CDC Bauer said in the email Bowman s departure comes at a time when several questions about Bowman and her department are dogging the agency according to sources inside the CDC In addition to the questions about ties to Coca Cola which is actively trying to push back on policies regulating or reining in soft drinks there are questions about the efficacy and transparency of a program known as WiseWoman which provides low income under insured or uninsured women with chronic disease risk factor screening lifestyle programs and referral services in an effort to prevent cardiovascular disease The departure also comes a day after the organization I work for U S Right to Know filed another FOIA seeking additional communications The Coca Cola connections date back decades for Bowman and tie her to former

that the World Health Organization was giving a cold shoulder ILSI The email strings include reports of concerns about Coca Cola s new Coca Cola Life sweetened with stevia and criticisms that it still contained more sugar than daily limit recommended by WHO The communications came as the beverage industry has been reeling from a series of actions around the world to rein in consumption of sugary soft drinks due to concerns about links to obesity and type 2 diabetes A critical blow came last June when World Health Organization WHO Director General Margaret Chan said the marketing of full sugar soft drinks was a key contributor to rising child obesity around the world especially in developing countries WHO published a new sugar guideline in March 2015 and Chan suggested restrictions on sugar rich beverage consumption Mexico already implemented its own soda tax in 2014 and many cities in the U S and around the world are currently considering such restrictions or disincentives like added

group sent a letter today to the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA asking it to stop the Coca Cola Company from making apparently illegal claims that its artificially sweetened sodas prevent mitigate or treat obesity The Coca Cola Company has made apparently illegal disease claims on at least eight occasions Federal law and rules allow food companies to make science based health claims that link a product to reduced risk of a disease but prohibit them from making disease claims or claims to diagnose mitigate treat cure or prevent a specific disease In this case there is growing

The San Antonio Heart Study observed a classic positive dose response relationship between AS artificially sweetened beverage consumption and long term weight gain Furthermore it found that consuming more than 21 artificially sweetened beverages per week compared to those who consumed none was associated with almost doubled risk of overweight or obesity 5 A study of beverage consumption among children and adolescents aged 6 19 found that BMI is positively associated with consumption of diet carbonated beverages 6 A two year study of 164 children found that Increases in diet soda consumption were significantly greater for overweight and subjects who gained weight as compared to normal weight subjects Baseline BMI Z score and year 2 diet soda consumption predicted 83 1 of the variance in year 2 BMI Z score It also found that Diet soda consumption was the only type of beverage associated with year 2 BMI Z score and consumption was greater in overweight subjects and subjects who gained weight as compared to normal weight subjects at two years 7 The U S Growing Up Today study of more than 10 000 children aged 9 14 found that for boys intakes of diet soda were significantly associated with weight gains 8 Other types of studies similarly suggest that artificial sweeteners do not contribute to weight loss For example interventional studies do not support the notion that artificial sweeteners produce weight loss According to the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine review of the scientific literature consensus from interventional studies suggests that artificial sweeteners do not help reduce weight when used alone 9 Some studies also suggest that artificial sweeteners increase appetite which may promote weight gain For example the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine review found that Preload experiments generally have found that sweet taste whether delivered by sugar or artificial sweeteners enhanced human appetite 10 Studies based on rodents suggest that consumption of artificial sweeteners can lead to consuming extra food According to the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine review Inconsistent coupling between sweet taste and caloric content

Judi Shils refuses to see barriers in the way of her goal to help transform food service at California s West Contra Costa Unified School District There are many barriers of course to bringing fresh organic locally grown food to students and teachers in a district that serves 30 000 meals a day at 55 schools to many students who live under the poverty line Thanks to a robust community partnership a collaboration of farmers chefs school district officials parents teachers and businesses the East Bay Area district took the first step to show what s possible serving made from scratch organic breakfasts and lunches to 1 200 students and teachers at two schools Jan 30 Feb 3 The program called The Conscious Kitchen and organized by Shils nonprofit group Turning Green aims to shift the paradigm of school food service to a framework they call FLOSN fresh local organic seasonal non GMO Shils began working last spring with parents teachers and principles to create the Taste of the Conscious Kitchen a weeklong demonstration of FLOSN meals at Peres Elementary School in Richmond and El Cerrito s Madera Elementary The project involved 14 chefs cooking made from scratch FLOSN food menus here with all food sourced from local organic farmers ranchers and purveyors and meals exceeding the USDA National School Lunch Program nutritional guidelines While some have criticized swoop in and fix efforts to change school food for example a recent Huffington Post story about the Revenge of the Lunch Lady who salvaged a made for TV food fix flop in a West Virginia district the Conscious Kitchen model is rooted in community partnerships built over the long term and the belief that it takes a village to feed school children well The demonstration week indeed took a village chefs donated time servers volunteered local farmers and purveyors donated much of the food a crowd funding campaign raised 5 000 and Patagonia Clif Bar Family Foundation and Dr Bronner s Family Foundation which also provides funds to my group US Right to Know underwrote the rest Food has a way of galvanizing communities Shils said All these stakeholders came together with the shared goal of health and wellness for our children I really liked it Unlike some other school food improvement efforts students at Peres and Madera responded enthusiastically to the change to fresh whole foods as well as the

healthy food When they do the other food I feel like it s poor Which raises the biggest barrier to transforming school food systems money It does cost more to do this than what we re spending currently LeBlanc said though exact cost comparisons are difficult to make The maximum rate of reimbursement for school lunches from the USDA program in the current school year is 2 04 for breakfast and 3 39 for lunch for students identified as severe need while paid for meals are reimbursed at a low of 29 cents for breakfast and 44 cents for lunch Many students in the West Contra Costa district

Sucralose is the most widely used artificial sweetener in the United States Most commonly sold under the brand name Splenda sucralose is used in over 6 000 food products It is often found in diet sodas including Diet Coke with Splenda Diet Pepsi with Splenda as well as Gatorade s Propel Water low calorie Kool Aid Atkins Diet products and other low calorie foods and drinks Sucralose is 600 times sweeter than table sugar and itself contains no calories Although it has been marketed as a healthy product that can help fend off obesity and diabetes studies suggest that sucralose consumption is linked to leukemia weight gain obesity diabetes liver inflammation metabolic dysfunction and other illnesses Sucralose backers have also claimed it is poorly absorbed and does not significantly bioaccumulate in the human body However a 2018 study found that sucralose metabolizes and bioaccumulates in rats Based on this recent science U S Right to Know petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to investigate deceptive advertising claims by Tate Lyle and Coca Cola Key facts about sucralose risks In May 2023 the World Health Organization advised people not to consume non sugar sweeteners including sucralose for weight loss The recommendation is based on a systematic review of the most current scientific evidence that links non sugar sweeteners to type 2 diabetes cardiovascular diseases and all cause mortality as well as increased body weight The Food and Drug Administration approved sucralose for use in 1998 in 15 food categories and as a general purpose sweetener a year later It was the fastest shift in FDA s history from a specified usage to general purpose approval of an artificial sweetener Of the over 100 sucralose studies FDA reviewed at the time none involved humans only three lasted more than a year and many of them were not even published for public scrutiny Subsequent studies including longitudinal ones involving human populations have linked sucralose to a range of health dangers FDA has not reevaluated its authorization with the current science FDA s 1998 authorization claims that sucralose is relatively poorly absorbed into the body Recent science casts doubt on that claim see USRTK petition to FTC In a 2008 interview former FDA official Alan Rulis discussed rocky moments in the sucralose petition process We discovered way too late in

What is sucralose Sucralose known as E 955 in the European Union is synthesized by chlorinating the sugar sucrose by substituting three hydroxyl groups with chlorine atoms Its chemical structure can be seen below Sucralose was invented by accident in 1975 when a laboratory leader at Queen Elizabeth College told an assistant to test the chemical which he understood at the time as taste After discovering the sweet taste of the compound originally under consideration as an insecticide the team continued its scientific work The research team filed for a patent in 1976 and received it in 1984 Sucralose is a marketing name Tate Lyle invented with no science based etymology The compound s proper chemical name is trichlorogalatosucrose Because the word sucralose is similar to sucrose a naturally occurring sugar it falsely expresses an easy similarity with a natural sugar In its first decade on the market McNeil Nutritionals then a subsidiary of Johnson Johnson marketed Splenda as made from sugar so it tastes like sugar Several regulatory agencies deemed this to be deceptive advertising Sucralose is most commonly sold as Splenda Other brand names include Cukren Zerocal Nevella Candys Sukrana Canderel Yellow and SucraPlus What are the health risks of sucralose Scientific studies of sucralose reveal the following health risks Leukemia A 2016 study from researchers at the Ramazzini Institute published in the International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health examined sucralose consumption in mice Researchers found a significant dose related increased incidence of males bearing malignant tumors and a significant dose related increased incidence of hematopoietic neoplasias in males particularly at doses of 2 000 and 16 000 parts per million These

of diet drinks with meals should be counseled against A 2018 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded that research subjects who consumed sucralose showed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity leading the researchers to conclude Sucralose may have effects on glucose metabolism Lowered insulin sensitivity sometimes called insulin resistance can lead to higher blood sugar levels and the development of type 2 diabetes Our study provides confirmatory evidence that sucralose has a negative impact on insulin action even in healthy individuals the researchers concluded A 2018 study in Nutrition pointed to impacts on insulin secretion and by extension risk of type 2 diabetes among healthy sucralose consuming subjects Long term consumption of sucralose can develop insulin resistance and decrease AIR acute insulin response which may represent the earliest sign of development of type 2 diabetes mellitus researchers wrote Our study also demonstrated reduced AIR after a 4 wk ingestion of sucralose This result may imply that chronic exposure to sucralose leads firstly to increased insulin secretion and later to reduction of insulin secretion A 2019 study in the Journal of Immunology Research found that a 48 mg sucralose sip increases serum insulin and unbalances monocyte subpopulation in noninsulin resistant healthy young adults Heightened insulin levels known as hyperinsulinemia increases the risk of obesity type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease and cancer The authors wrote The apparently innocuous consumption of sucralose should be reexamined in light of these results In 2022 a 10 week human study of sucralose consumption published in Microorganisms concluded that sucralose amounts far lower than the suggested acceptable daily intake alter the balance of the gut microbiome while also being associated with significant elevations in glucose levels and serum insulin in response to glucose loads Genotoxicity A May 2023 study in

insights into the adverse effects of sucralose on male reproductive physiology highlighting its role in disrupting autophagy inducing oxidative stress and impairing reproductive function Cells exposed to sucralose via in vitro experiments had significantly lower cell survival rates Sucralose exposure significantly reduced cell viability in TM3 and TM4 cells induced oxidative stress and disrupted autophagic flux by impairing autophagosome lysosome fusion Additionally sucralose downregulated T1R3 protein expression suggesting a role for sweet taste receptor signaling in testicular cell regulation In vivo chronic oral exposure to sucralose led to decreased sperm viability and dysregulated reproductive function including altered testicular morphology and suppressed steroidogenesis Sucralose in human breast milk and babies Sucralose can enter into the breastmilk of breastfeeding mothers according to a 2019 study in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition The study of 34 breastfeeding women concludes that sucralose appeared in breast milk two hours following ingestion with concentrations varying markedly between individuals Since the study assessed breast milk after just a single diet soda ingestion researchers note that concentrations reported may underestimate true infant exposure via the breast milk Future research should determine concentration after repeated exposures and whether chronic ingestion of artificial sweeteners via breast milk has clinically relevant health consequences including alteration of taste preferences gut microbiota metabolism and weight trajectory of infants A 2020 study published in Gut Microbes concluded that sucralose consumption in pregnant mice inhibited intestinal development induced imbalance of gut microbiota and low grade inflammation and further disrupted gut barrier function in three week old offspring The researchers wrote These data suggest that excessive sucralose should be taken with caution especially during pregnancy and lactation and also provide new insight into a better understanding of the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adulthood Bioaccumulation A 2018

release 8 27 18 Formation of toxic or carcinogenic compounds Sucralose dangers may also include toxic compounds released when the sweetener is heated according to these studies In a 2019 study the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment BfR pointed to cancer risks associated with cooking foods containing sucralose at a temperature of 250 F or higher Cooking at this temperature may lead to the formation of chlorinated organic compounds with a health damaging potential such as polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxins PCDD dibenzofurans PCDF and chloropropanols the study concludes Consumption of these hazardous substances and toxins could lead to diseases such as cancer the skin disorder chloracne as well as liver and kidney damage Harmful compounds might be formed when foods containing the sweetener sucralose are heated BfR news release 4 9 19 In 2020 the German agency BfR published a review of 19 studies on sucralose in the journal Food Chemistry The researchers concluded that sucralose can be degraded at high temperatures e g during cooking or baking of sucralose containing foods and that As a consequence potentially toxic chlorinated compounds might be generated A 2015 study published in Scientific Reports found decomposition in form of CO2 along with the formation of hydrogen chloride and other minor compounds in heated food substances containing sucralose at temperatures of 200 F and above The study concluded These findings not only corroborate the suspected instability of sucralose to high temperatures but also indicate that even exposed to mild conditions the formation of hazardous polychlorinated compounds is observed Irritable bowel syndrome In a 2018 study published in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases researchers found that given over a six

Colon cancer A 2020 article in Frontiers in Oncology based on research on mice raised concerns about colon cancer risks associated with sucralose consumption The study concluded that sucralose caused significant increases in the number and size of cancerous colon tumors A likely mechanistic explanation would be that inflammation was exacerbated by sucralose The study further surmised that a steady stream of sucralose in the diet could lead to impaired inactivation of digestive protease damage to the gut barrier and exacerbated inflammation Liver inflammation A 2017 study of mice in Frontiers in Physiology reported Sucralose consumption for 6 months altered the gut microbiome composition fecal metabolites and pro inflammatory gene expression in the liver The alterations induced by sucralose consumption could affect the development of inflammation and further influence other physiological functions in the body Can sucralose contribute to severe SARS Cov2 In a May 2023 letter to the BMJ Open Gastroenterology scientists from North Carolina State University at Raleigh noted recent research that reported a significant decrement in gut bifidobacteria in persons with severe Covid This caught our attention because the common artificial sweetener sucralose eg Splenda has a profound effect on the microbiome including significant reductions in bifidobacteria in the gut they wrote This raises the question of whether the organochlorine sweetener sucralose which is present in tens of thousands of food products may contribute to the observed depletion in bifidobacteria and low bacterial diversity found in severe SARS CoV 2 Additional research is needed they said Review studies on non sugar sweeteners Two review studies published in 2023 raised health concerns about the class of non sugar sweeteners which include acesulfame K aspartame advantame cyclamates neotame saccharin sucralose and stevia In May 2023 the World Health Organization advised people not to consume non sugar sweeteners including sucralose The recommendation is based on the agency s systematic review of the most current scientific evidence that consumption of non sugar sweeteners is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes cardiovascular diseases and all cause mortality as well as weight gain Replacing free sugars with NSS does not help with weight control in the long term People

Johnson Johnson spent over 200 million marketing Splenda with the misleading slogan made from sugar so it tastes like sugar even though the product contains no natural sugars The advertising campaign was the target of multiple lawsuits and regulatory reviews across the world Courts or agencies in France Australia and New Zealand ruled the slogan was false and misleading and banned the advertisements from their respective countries The Australia Advertising Claims Board ruled in 2006 that for the made from sugar so it tastes like sugar slogan reasonable members of the public viewing the Advertisement are likely to conclude that at the very least a significant proportion of the SPLENDA product is made from some modified form of sugar The Board ruled that the ad is likely to mislead or deceive viewers and ordered it discontinued New Zealand s Advertising Standards Complaints Board refused the same advertisement in a 2005 ruling on the grounds that it gave rise to a likelihood of a consumer being confused and misled as a result of the comparison in the advertisement In 2007 the Commercial Court of Paris ruled that McNeil violated French consumer protection laws and ordered the company to stop what it concluded was misleading wording in its advertising The court also ordered McNeil to pay 40 000 Euros in damages to Merisant which manufactures artificial sweeteners made with aspartame Equal and NutraSweet In the U S a similar lawsuit between Merisant and McNeil concluded with an undisclosed settlement Splenda s current marketing in the U S no longer

opinion by forging ties with influential scientists and officials including at the nation s top public health agency the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Now the Trump administration has appointed a new CDC chief Dr Brenda Fitzgerald who as Georgia public health commissioner for the past six years partnered with Coke to run a program against child obesity Coca Cola KO 0 00 gave 1 million to Georgia SHAPE which seeks to increase physical activity in schools but is silent about reducing soda consumption even though studies have found that high sugar intake especially in liquid form is adriver of obesity and diabetes as well as cancer and heart disease In a2013press conference Fitzgerald praised Coke for its generous award She wrote a commentary about the obesity epidemic for Coca Cola s website declaring the need to get our students moving And in an interview with a local TV station she made clear her priorities Georgia SHAPE she said is going to concentrate on what you should eat while saying nothing about what you shouldn t The agency Fitzgerald will now run already had cozy relationships with Coca Cola These connections can be seen in emails that circulated

according to a report published August 23 by the American Journal of Public Health A Mexican soda tax correlated with a similar drop in soda purchases according to research published earlier this year One would expect the efforts would be heartily applauded by the CDC And indeed earlier this year a CDC research report said more aggressive measures were needed to convince Americans to cut back on sugary drinks But behind the scenes mounting evidence suggests that rather than cracking down on the soda industry high ranking officials within the CDC s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion are instead cozying up to beverage giant Coca Cola and its industry allies even in some cases aiding the industry as it argues that sodas are not to blame At least one internal ethics complaint over industry influence was lodged this month according to a source inside the CDC And more may be coming as a group of scientists within the CDC reportedly are attempting to push back against a culture cultivating close ties with corporate interests One recent focus of scrutiny has been the ties between Michael Pratt Senior Advisor for Global Health in the CDC s disease prevention unit and Coca Cola s brainchild the nonprofit corporate interest group called the International Life Sciences Institute ILSI ISLI was founded by Coca Cola scientific and regulatory affairs leader Alex Malaspina in 1978 and continues to advocate for the agenda of beverage and food industries Some in the scientific community see ILSI as little more than a front group aimed at advancing the interests of those industries with little regard for public well being Still ILSI s money and influence are well known at the CDC and Pratt s work with ILSI is a prime example Documents show that

consumption of sugar laden foods and beverages to help control obesity and other health problems policy makers should be focusing on a lack of exercise as the primary culprit the industry says That type of strategic spin is expected from companies that make money off those sugary foods and drinks They re protecting their profits But it s harder to understand how the CDC can sign off on Pratt s involvement in the industry effort This public employee presumably drawing a taxpayer funded paycheck has spent the last few years working in a range of roles near and dear to the industry He co authored a Latin America health and nutrition study and related papers funded in part by Coca Cola and ILSI he has been acting as a s cientific advisor to ILSI North America serving on an ILSI committee on energy balance and active lifestyle Until his activities came under scrutiny he was listed as a member of the ILSI Research Foundation Board of Trustees his bio was removed from the website earlier this month Pratt also served as an advisor to an international study of childhood obesity funded by Coca Cola And for roughly the last year or more he has held a position as a professor at Emory University a private research university in Atlanta that has received millions of dollars from Coca Cola entities The CDC says Pratt s temporary assignment at Emory has ended But now Pratt is headed to the University of San Diego UCSD to take the role of Director of the UCSD Institute for Public Health And coincidentally or not ISLI is partnering with the UCSD on a unique

especially promising suggestion given that documents recently supplied by the CDC related to employee ties to Coca Cola were only turned over after large swaths of communications were blacked out Those emails pertained to former Pratt colleague Dr Barbara Bowman who was director of the CDC s Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention until departing the agency this summer amid scrutiny of her ties to Coca Cola Bowman was instrumental in helping direct CDC funds to a pet project that ILSI is working on with the U S Department of Agriculture to develop a branded foods database Email communications obtained that were not redacted showed that Bowman a former Coca Cola nutritionist maintained a close connection with the company and ILSI as she rose in rank at the CDC The emails show that Bowman was happy to help the beverage industry cultivate political sway with the World Health Organization WHO as it tried to beat back regulation on sugary soft drinks The emails showed ongoing communications regarding ILSI and beverage industry interests Bowman retired in late June after those emails became public ILSI has a history of working to infiltrate public health organizations A report by a consultant to WHO found that ILSI was infiltrating the organization with scientists money and research to garner favor for industry products and strategies ILSI was also accused of attempting to undermine WHO tobacco control efforts on behalf of the tobacco industry So should the public be concerned The CDC says no But we at the consumer group U S Right to Know believe the

the public The following is an excerpt from Chapter 1 Seedy Business What Big Food is hiding with its slick PR campaign on GMOs by Gary Ruskin co director of the public watchdog group US Right to Know Monsanto is one of the world s largest producers of genetically engineered seeds and manufacturer of the best selling herbicide Roundup Our government relies on data from Monsanto about GMO crops yet the company has in the past hid crucial information about the health risks of its products and operations In a Washington Post article describing how Monsanto polluted the town of Anniston Alabama with toxic PCBs Michael Grunwald recounts a key moment in a deposition of Monsanto s Anniston plant manager In 1998 a former Anniston plant manager William Papageorge was asked in a deposition whether Monsanto officials ever shared their data about PCB hazards with the community Why would they he replied 1 Indeed why would they It s a great question one that applies not only to PCBs but to genetically engineered foods as well If there were something wrong with genetically engineered food would Monsanto or the other agrichemical companies tell us If there were health risks would the companies disclose them Their history suggests that the answer is probably not The big agrichemical companies have a well documented record of hiding the truth about the health risks of their products and operations Let s review some key moments in that history PCBs Monsanto was the principal manufacturer of toxic polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs According to the U S Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Approximately 99 of the PCBs used by U S industry were produced by the Monsanto Chemical Company in Sauget Illinois until production was stopped in August 1977 2 PCBs were banned in 1979 According to the U S Environmental Protection Agency PCBs have been demonstrated to cause cancer as well as a variety of other adverse health effects on the immune system reproductive system nervous system and endocrine system 3 The dangerous legacy of Monsanto s PCB pollution remains especially in the town of Anniston Alabama 4 According to the Washington Post regarding Anniston thousands of pages of Monsanto documents many emblazoned with warnings such as CONFIDENTIAL Read and Destroy show that for decades the corporate giant concealed what it did and what it knew In 1966 Monsanto managers discovered that fish submerged in that creek turned belly up within 10 seconds spurting blood and shedding skin as if dunked into boiling water They told no one In 1969 they found fish in another creek with 7 500 times the legal PCB levels They decided there is little object in going to expensive extremes in limiting discharges In 1975 a company study found that PCBs caused

slightly tumorigenic to does not appear to be carcinogenic 5 Baycol Bayer AG is the corporate parent of Bayer CropScience AG a major agrichemical company with 2013 revenues of nearly 9 billion from genetically engineered seeds fungicides herbicides and insecticides 6 In 1997 Bayer began producing the statin cholesterol lowering drug Baycol It promoted the drug as simple and safe 7 But it withdrew Baycol from the market in 2001 because the frequency of fatal rhabdomyolysis rapid breakdown of muscle tissue which can cause kidney failure was far higher than in other statins 8 As early as October 1999 the FDA had already criticized Bayer s marketing of Baycol as false lacking in fair balance or otherwise misleading with too little emphasis on the risk of rhabdomyolysis 9 According to Public Citizen Approximately one year before Baycol was removed from the market in August 2001 its manufacturer Bayer using FDA data on other statins found that Baycol had 20 times more reports of rhabdomyolysis per million prescriptions than Lipitor 10 In 2003 the New York Times reported that company documents indicate that some senior executives at Bayer were aware that their anticholesterol drug had serious problems long before the company pulled it from the market Still worse documents and other evidence suggested that Bayer promoted Baycol even as a company analysis found that patients on Baycol were falling ill or dying from a rare muscle condition much more often than patients on similar drugs There were about 100 deaths and 1 600 injuries linked to Baycol induced rhabdomyolysis

higher than initially suggested by manufacturers 13 The Times reported that tens of thousands of women have claimed that they suffered a host of health problems from silicone filled breast implants including hardening of the breast tissue implant rupture and disabling disorders that resemble autoimmune disorders like lupus In 1995 Dow Corning declared bankruptcy because it was according to the

implants or silicone Dow Corning stopped telling this to callers after the FDA sent a letter in which the company was accused of giving out misleading information about breast implants on its hot line The letter said the company was to take immediate corrective action The FDA wrote These statements overstate the safety of breast implants and minimize known or suspected side effects 15 In February 1997 the Times reported that a Louisiana state court found that Dow Chemical Company had knowingly deceived women by hiding information about the health risks of silicone used in breast implants 16 Bayer plant explosion On August 28 2008 an explosion killed two people at the Bayer CropScience plant in Institute VA According to a report by the U S House Energy and Commerce Committee the explosion came dangerously close to replicating the catastrophic explosion that was so deadly in Bhopal India Bloomberg s account of the congressional investigation explained that executives at Bayer conducted a campaign of secrecy destroyed evidence and withheld information from emergency responders after a deadly chemical explosion The toxic insecticide methomyl was released in the explosion But Chemical Safety Board Chairman John Bresland said Bayer officials told emergency personnel on the day of the explosion that no dangerous chemicals had been released 17 Bayer went to great lengths to prevent disclosures about the explosion it even tried to employ a federal terrorism provision that no company had ever invoked before to block a hearing by the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board

industrial accident However the DuPont shift supervisor who called 911 about the accident failed to disclose the presence of the methyl isocyanate and its potential danger to the public According to the Houston Chronicle DuPont shift supervisor Jody Knowles gave no details about the chemicals involved and minimized the risk in the 911 call to the La Porte fire department We have a possible

president of Dow Paul Oreffice argued on NBC s Today Show that there is absolutely no evidence of dioxin doing any damage to humans except for causing something that is called chloracne It s a rash 26 However in July 1983 the New York Times reported that The Dow Chemical Company knew as early as the middle 1960 s about evidence that exposure to dioxin might cause people to become seriously ill and even die but the company withheld its concern from the Government and continued to sell herbicides contaminated by dioxin to the Army and the public In 1965 Dow s toxicology director wrote that dioxin could be exceptionally toxic to humans Dow s medical director wrote regarding dioxin that Fatalities have been reported in the literature 27 There is also a strong appearance that Monsanto prepared fraudulent studies to convince the EPA that dioxin was relatively nontoxic These studies were exposed by the EPA chemist Cate Jenkins in a memorandum titled Newly Revealed Fraud by Monsanto in an Epidemiological Study Used by EPA to Assess Human Health Effects from Dioxin 28 Jenkins found a long pattern of fraud regarding dioxin contamination of a wide range of Monsanto Corp products as well as health studies of Monsanto s dioxin exposed workers 29 DBCP Dow and Shell were the main manufacturers of the pesticide DBCP 1 2 Dibromo 3 Chloropropane Early results from DBCP animal health risk

the story of Syngenta s unusually forceful attacks against Tyrone Hayes a professor of integrative biology at the University of California Berkeley Hayes had published studies showing that Syngenta s widely used herbicide atrazine is an endocrine disruptor in frogs In response Syngenta launched a multi pronged effort to in the words of Syngenta communications manager Sherry Ford discredit Hayes Among other tactics Syngenta deployed against Hayes Aviv reports that In 2005 Ford made a long list of methods for discrediting him have his work audited by 3rd party ask journals to retract set trap to entice him to sue investigate funding investigate wife The initials of different employees were written in the margins beside entries presumably because they had been assigned to look into the task 1 In its efforts to defend atrazine Syngenta also investigated the investigative reporter Danielle Ivory who now writes for the New York Times According to Beau Hodai and Lisa Graves when Ivory was asking questions about atrazine Bret Jacobson the founder and president of Maverick Strategies and Communications a public relations consulting firm specializing in opposition research submitted a dossier on Ivory to the firm Quinn Thomas Public Affairs 2 Brainwashing children In 2012 the Council for Biotechnology Information a public relations front group for the big agrichemical companies

following is an excerpt from Chapter 6 Seedy Business What Big Food is hiding with its slick PR campaign on GMOs by Gary Ruskin co director of the public watchdog group US Right to Know The creation and use of front groups and shills is a standard public relations tactic of the tobacco fossil fuels chemicals and other industries to advance their public relations legislative regulatory or other goals They provide a number of PR advantages to companies and industries They multiply the number of speakers on behalf of a corporate point of view validating it from an independent or academic perspective making it seem that the company or industry is not alone or isolated They may have more credibility than the company or industry because they may not be seen as directly profiting from corporate actions and because their conflicts of interest may be hidden The front groups and shills may say things that for many reasons the company or industry wishes it could say but cannot say directly The use of front groups in public relations was invented and pioneered by the legendary public relations and marketing genius Edward Bernays in his work on behalf of the tobacco industry and many others 1 Following are a few of the agrichemical industry s key front groups and shills Henry Miller Henry I Miller is perhaps the most prolific and best known apologist for genetically engineered food and crops He is the the Robert Wesson Fellow in Scientific Philosophy and Public Policy at the Hoover Institution 2 He was the founding director of the FDA s Office of Biotechnology He has written numerous articles and op eds in the Wall Street Journal New York Times Forbes and other news outlets in support of genetically engineered food and against the labeling of it 3 He was even featured in TV advertisements against Proposition 37 a ballot initiative for labeling of genetically engineered food in the State of California 4 Miller s bio on the Forbes website proclaims I debunk junk science and flawed public policy 5 However during the course of his life Miller himself has often presented an agile defense of junk science and flawed public policy Defending the tobacco industry In a 1994 APCO Associates PR strategy memo to help Phillip Morris organize a global campaign to fight tobacco regulations Henry Miller was referred to as a key supporter of these pro tobacco industry efforts 6 In 2012 Miller wrote that nicotine is not particularly bad for you in the amounts delivered by cigarettes or smokeless products 7 Denying climate change Miller is a member of the

defended the use of widely criticized neonicotinoid pesticides and claimed that the reality is that honeybee populations are not declining 10 Miller has repeatedly argued for the re introduction of DDT a toxic pesticide banned in the United States since 1972 which has been linked to pre term birth and fertility impairment in women 11 Defending exposure to radiation from nuclear power plants In 2011 after the Japanese tsunami and radiation leaks at the Fukushima nuclear power plants Miller argued in Forbes that those who were exposed to low levels of radiation could have actually benefitted from it 12 At that time he even penned an article titled Can radiation be good for you 13 Defending the plastics industry In an article in Forbes Miller defended the use of the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A BPA which is banned in Europe and Canada for use in baby bottles 14 Henry Miller s other activities Miller was a trustee of the infamous industry front group American Council for Science and Health according to the ACSH website 15 American Council on Science and Health The American Council on Science and Health is a frequent defender of genetically engineered foods and crops 16 It is a front group for the tobacco agrichemical fossil fuel pharmaceutical and other industries Personnel ACSH s Medical Executive Director is Dr Gilbert Ross 17 In 1993 according to United Press International Dr Ross was convicted of racketeering mail fraud and conspiracy and was sentenced to 47 months in jail 40 000 in forfeiture and restitution of 612 855 in a scheme to defraud the Medicaid system 18 ACSH s Dr Ross was found to be a highly untrustworthy individual by a judge who sustained the exclusion of Dr Ross from Medicaid for ten years 19 Funding ACSH has often billed itself as an independent group and has been referred to as independent in the press However according to internal ACSH financial documents obtained by Mother Jones ACSH planned to receive a total of 338 200 from tobacco companies between July 2012 and June 2013 Reynolds American and Phillip Morris International were each listed as expected to give 100 000 in 2013 which would make them the two largest

from 2005 2011 according to Greenpeace 22 Indefensible and incorrect statements on science ACSH has Claimed that There is no evidence that exposure to secondhand smoke involves heart attacks or cardiac arrest 23 Argued that there is no scientific consensus concerning global warming The climate change predictions are based on computer models that have not been validated and are far from perfect 24 Argued that fracking doesn t pollute water or air 25 Claimed that The scientific evidence is clear There has never been a case of ill health linked to the regulated approved use of pesticides in this country 26 Declared that There is no evidence that BPA bisphenol A in consumer products of any type including cash register receipts are harmful to health 27 Argued that the exposure to mercury a potent neurotoxin in conventional seafood causes no harm in humans 28 Bruce M Chassy On the agrichemical industry PR website GMOAnswers Bruce Chassy is identified as an independent expert 29 In reality he is nothing of the sort He has been supported by the agrichemical and processed food industries and defends them in the media and on his website Academics Review and elsewhere 30 Chassy has hid his ties to industry before For example a 2003 letter in Nature Biotechnology points out the journal s failure to require its authors to disclose close ties to companies that directly profit from the promotion of agricultural biotechnology The letter continues that Bruce Chassy has received research grants from major food companies and has conducted seminars for

"The FDA does not test whether GMOs are safe The following is an excerpt from Chapter 2 Seedy Business What Big Food is hiding with its slick PR campaign on GMOs by Gary Ruskin executive director of U S Right to Know In recent testimony before Congress the FDA stated that it is confident that the GE foods in the U S marketplace today are as safe as their conventional counterparts 1 However FDA does not itself test whether genetically engineered foods are safe The FDA has repeatedly made this clear As Jason Dietz a policy analyst at FDA explains about genetically engineered food It s the manufacturer s responsibility to insure that the product is safe 2 Or as FDA spokesperson Theresa Eisenman said it is the manufacturer s responsibility to ensure that the GMO food products it offers for sale are safe 3 Nor does the FDA require independent pre market safety testing for genetically engineered food As a matter of practice the agrichemical companies submit their own studies to the FDA as part of a voluntary consultation Moreover the FDA does not require the companies to submit full and complete information about these studies Rather as the FDA has testified After the studies are completed a summary of the data and information on the safety and nutritional assessment are provided to the FDA for review 4 That the FDA does not see the complete data and studies is a problem according to a Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Reviews article by William Freese and David Schubert the FDA never sees the methodological details but rather only limited data and the conclusions the company has drawn from its own research the FDA does not require the submission of data And in fact companies have failed to comply with FDA requests for data beyond that which they submitted initially Without test protocols or other important data the FDA is unable to identify unintentional mistakes errors in data interpretation or intentional deception 5 At the end of the consultation the FDA issues a letter ending the consultation Here is a typical response from FDA in its letter to Monsanto about its MON 810 Bt corn Based on the safety and nutritional assessment you have conducted it is our understanding that Monsanto has concluded that corn products derived from this new variety are not materially different in composition safety and other relevant parameters from corn currently on the market and that the genetically modified corn does not raise issues that would require premarket review or approval by FDA as you are aware it is Monsanto s responsibility to ensure that foods marketed by the firm are safe wholesome emphasis ours and in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements 6 This testing regime is insufficient for several other

for several other reasons Most of the animal safety testing prepared for the FDA is merely short term A study in the International Journal of Biological Sciences summarizes the typical testing regime The most detailed regulatory tests on the GMOs are three month long feeding trials of laboratory rats which are biochemically assessed Such tests may well be too brief in duration to uncover pathologies that develop more slowly such as many types of organ damage endocrine disturbances and cancer 7 There are too few peer reviewed studies on the health risks of genetically engineered food In their 2004 article in Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Reviews William Freese and David Schubert wrote that Published peer reviewed studies particularly in the area of potential human health impacts are rare For instance the EPA s human health assessment of Bt crops cites 22 unpublished corporate studies with initially only one ancillary literature citation 8 Similarly a 2014 review in Environment International of 21 studies of the effects of genetically engineered foods on the digestive tracts of rats found an incomplete picture regarding the toxicity and safety of GM products consumed by humans and animals 9 In other words it concludes that there is not enough evidence to say that genetically engineered foods are safe to eat The FDA permits companies to submit their own safety studies but does not require independent ones However the evidence regarding pharmaceutical studies strongly suggests that industry funded studies are more likely than independent ones to be favorable to industry Here s Ben Goldacre s review of this evidence in 2010 three researchers from Harvard and Toronto found all the trials looking at five major classes of drug antidepressants ulcer drugs and so on then measured two key features were they positive and were they funded by industry They found over five hundred trials in total 85 per cent of the industry funded studies were positive but only 50 per cent of the government funded trials were That s a very significant difference In 2007 researchers looked at every published trial that set out to explore the benefit of a statin This study found 192 trials in total either comparing one statin against another or comparing a statin against a different kind of treatment Once the researchers controlled for other factors they found that industry funded trials were twenty times more likely to give results favoring the test drug Again that s a very big difference We ll do one more In 2006", "chunk_id":

psychiatric drugs in four academic journals over a ten year period finding 542 trial outcomes in total Industry sponsors got favorable outcomes for their own drug 78 per cent of the time while independently funded trials only gave a positive result in 48 per cent of cases 10 These results present a compelling argument for FDA to require independent pre market safety testing for genetically engineered food but the FDA fails to do so Perhaps more importantly the agrichemical industry is under no obligation to report the results of all their studies How do we know that they are not suppressing evidence of health risks of genetically engineered food It is well known that in other industries publication bias and the suppression of studies is commonplace That is certainly true in the pharmaceutical industry Here for example is Ben Goldacre s description of missing evidence in trials on antidepressants researchers found seventy four studies in total representing 12 500 patients worth of data Thirty eight of these trials had positive results and found that the new drug worked thirty six were negative The results were therefore an even split between success and failure for the drugs in reality Then the researchers set about looking for these trials in the published academic literature the material available to doctors and patients This provided a very different picture Thirty seven of the positive trials all but one were published in full often with much fanfare But the trials with negative results had a very different fate only three were published Twenty two were simply lost to history never appearing anywhere other than in those dusty disorganized thin FDA files The remaining eleven which had negative results in the FDA summaries did appear in the academic literature but were written up as if the drug was a success This was a remarkable piece of work spread over twelve drugs from all the major manufacturers with no stand out bad guy It very clearly exposed a broken system in reality we have thirty eight positive trials and thirty seven negative ones in the academic literature we have forty eight positive trials and three negative ones 11 Why shouldn t we expect the agrichemical industry to follow the pharmaceutical industry s pattern of suppressing negative results This question seems especially relevant given the agrichemical industry s

Why shouldn t we expect the agrichemical industry to follow the pharmaceutical industry s pattern of suppressing negative results This question seems especially relevant given the agrichemical industry s history of suppressing evidence of health risks of their other products and operations It makes no sense for the FDA to trust an industry with such a record It is also worth remembering that in the U S there is a history of fraud in toxicological testing As Dan Fagin and Marianne Lavelle explain in their book Toxic Deception The U S regulatory system for chemical products is tailor made for fraud The subjects are arcane the results subjective the regulators overmatched and the real work conducted by or for the manufacturers themselves 12 Regarding Monsanto s role in such frauds they write that Paul Wright had been a research chemist at Monsanto before he went to work for IBT then the nation s largest toxicology lab in 1971 as its chief rat toxicologist Wright stayed at the lab for only 18 months before he returned to Monsanto But it was long enough the federal government investigators concluded for him to be in the middle of a series of apparently fraudulent studies that benefitted Monsanto products In all three cases regarding an herbicide and a chlorinator the federal government investigators wrote in an internal memo there was evidence that Monsanto executives knew that the studies were faked but sent them to the FDA and the EPA anyway 13 Finally how can we assess the health risks of genetically engineered foods that are currently on the market At this time we can t The FDA does not require any post market studies of health risks of genetically engineered food As a 2010 study in the International Journal of Biological Sciences points out although some stakeholders claim that a history of safe use of GMOs can be upheld there are no human or animal epidemiological studies to support such a claim as yet in particular because of the lack of labeling and traceability in GMO producing countries 14 Without such epidemiological studies on genetically engineered food we can t know whether GMOs are safe or not and if they cause illnesses what they are

concluded that the FDA s testing program is not statistically valid 15 The Washington Post explains the GAO s conclusion The U S Food and Drug Administration does not perform enough pesticide residue tests on either imported or domestic foods to say whether the American food supply is safe 16 Of course the agrichemical companies say their genetically engineered foods are safe What s curious about this is that they have enough money to carry out independent pre market and post market testing of the health risks of their products Such testing would be an easy way to put to rest any questions about health risks But they don t Why not Also the agrichemical industry could lobby for federal laws or rules requiring pre market and post market safety testing for genetically engineered foods And they would likely prevail They haven t done that either Why not It suggests they don t want to know the answers or they don t want us to know the answers Or both This doesn t inspire trust Even at the outset some FDA scientists had concerns about the health risks of genetically engineered food According to the New York Times Among them was Dr Louis J Pribyl one of 17 government scientists working on a policy for genetically engineered food Dr Pribyl knew from studies that toxins could be unintentionally created when new genes were introduced into a plant s cells But under the new edict the government was dismissing that risk and any other possible risk as no different from those of conventionally derived food That meant biotechnology companies would not need government approval to sell the foods they were developing This is the industry s pet idea namely that there are no unintended effects that will raise the F D A s level of concern Dr Pribyl wrote in a fiery memo to the F D A scientist overseeing the policy s development But time and time again there is no data to back up their contention Dr Pribyl a microbiologist was not alone at the agency Dr Gerald Guest director of

genetically engineered food before it was sold Three toxicologists wrote The possibility of unexpected accidental changes in genetically engineered plants justifies a limited traditional toxicological study 17 The federal government s premise for lax regulation of GMOs was the notion of substantial equivalence that new genetically engineered foods were substantially equivalent to regular foods so there was no need for regulation As the FDA s 1992 guidance to industry stated FDA believes that the new techniques are extensions at the molecular level of traditional methods and will be used to achieve the same goals as pursued with traditional plant breeding 18 It was with this idea that the agrichemical industry evaded rigorous safety testing But the premise of substantial equivalence was dubious from the start It was an a priori political concept adopted without studies or evidence to treat genetically engineered food as GRAS Generally Regarded As Safe It was claimed by the agrichemical industry not proven by independent study For this reason some FDA staff opposed the idea of substantial equivalence For example Dr Linda Kahl an FDA compliance officer was concerned about unpredictable or unknown safety risks from genetically engineered food She wrote The process of genetic engineering and traditional breeding are different and according to the technical experts in the agency they lead to different risks Dr Kahl wrote There is no data that addresses the relative magnitude of risk for all we know the risks may be lower for genetically engineered foods than for foods produced by traditional breeding But the acknowledgment that the risks are different is lost in the attempt to hold to the doctrine that the product and not the process is regulated 19 Along the same lines E J Matthews of the FDA s Toxicology Group warned that genetically modified plants could contain unexpected high concentrations of plant toxicants and that these could be uniquely different chemicals that are usually expressed in unrelated plants 20 Substantial equivalence is a pseudo scientific concept explained a commentary by Erik Millstone Eric Brunner and Sue Mayer in Nature because it is a commercial and political judgment masquerading as if it were scientific It is moreover inherently anti scientific because it was created primarily to provide an excuse for not requiring

so in its 2001 proposed rule on pre market notice of genetically engineered food The FDA wrote Because some rDNA induced unintended changes are specific to a transformational event e g those resulting from insertional mutagenesis FDA believes that it needs to be provided with information about foods from all separate transformational events even when the agency has been provided with information about foods from rDNA modified plants with the same intended new trait and has had no questions about such foods In contrast the agency does not believe that it needs to receive information about foods from plants derived through narrow crosses such as traditional plant breeding 22 Yet even though the FDA has acknowledged the flaws in its own premise of substantial equivalence the underlying policy lives on now without any justification at all So the FDA states that it is confident about the safety of GMOs currently in the marketplace But it does not itself conduct safety testing on GMOs It does not sponsor independent safety testing It does not require independent safety testing It does not require long term safety testing to uncover ill effects that have delayed onset It does not have access to the full data and content of all industry safety testing And it does not require post market epidemiological testing Without such testing and full access to industry data the FDA cannot

cardiovascular disease overweight obesity cancer type 2 diabetes dementia and other chronic and dangerous health problems including increased risk of all cause mortality The Academy has also rewarded its corporate sponsors One well known example in 2015 the Academy announced a partnership with Kraft which was widely seen as an endorsement of some of Kraft s products as healthy options to include in children s menus at schools The Academy s first nutrition seal the Kids Eat Right label was put on Kraft Singles individually wrapped slices of processed cheese product This was a major coup for the Kraft Foods Group reported the New York Times The Times reported Kraft is a frequent target of advocates for better children s nutrition who contend that many of its products are over processed

foods are industrially formulated with added sugar artificial sweeteners additives and flavorings to be highly rewarding and even addictive They can alter the brain s reward pathways the same way that other addictive substances do making them challenging to consume in moderation In fact a body of scientific research has emerged in recent years to show that some ultra processed foods UPFs can be as addictive as cigarettes and cocaine Several major food brands were once owned by the world s largest tobacco companies Evidence suggests the same tactics used to formulate and market cigarettes were used in the creation of food products Finding the bliss point Manufacturers of ultra processed foods often seek to find the most alluring combination of salt sugar and fat in their products This point of perfection is known as the bliss point a term coined by American market researcher and food scientist Howard Moskowitz in the 1990s The bliss point is just that sensory profile where you like food the most Moskowitz who is known for his work on soft drinks and pasta sauces told RetroReport There is no one bliss point There are groups of bliss points Manufacturers usually work to locate the bliss point through rigorous focus group testing alongside the use of psychological research The bliss point triggers dopamine a neurotransmitter in the brain that is responsible for feelings of pleasure and well being to spike then crash This brings about good feelings then bad feelings and generates the craving to feel good once more How ultra processed food manufacturers addict consumers Food companies not only research taste but also consumers responses to color smell and mouth feel of products And sometimes food scientists tweak a specific ingredient in products like the salt sugar or fat itself Michael Moss writes in his book Salt Sugar Fat How the Food Giants Hooked Us For example food scientists have changed the shape of fat globules to improve how products feel in the mouth And they ve ground salt finer which helps the flavor hit the taste buds faster for an improved flavor burst One hallmark of addiction is the speed with which substances hit the brain Moss explains in

foods to combat the obesity and diabetes epidemics in the United States wrote in a letter to the FDA in February 2024 For far too long the food and beverage industry has been allowed to use deceptive

public health Tying together concerns around food addiction and its harmful effects Ashley Gearhardt professor of psychology at the University of Michigan and a leading expert in food addiction wrote in 2023 testimony before the U S Senate Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions titled What is Fueling the Diabetes Epidemic A scientific body of evidence suggests that addictive processes play an important role in contributing to patterns of ultra processed food intake implicated in poor health obesity and diabetes If addictive mechanisms are being triggered by ultra processed foods this may be an overlooked reason why it can be challenging to reduce intake of ultra processed foods even in the face of health conditions like diabetes What is the evidence that ultra processed foods are addictive A 2023 review of 281 studies in 36 countries found that the combination of refined carbohydrates and fats often found in UPFs seems to have a supra additive effect on brain reward systems above either macronutrient alone which may increase the addictive potential of these foods Overall the researchers found that 14 of adults and 12 of children were addicted to ultra processed foods which is similar to the levels of addiction seen for other legal substances in adults eg 14 for alcohol and 18 for tobacco the authors added The research published in BMJ noted", "chunk_id":

addiction seen for other legal substances in adults eg 14 for alcohol and 18 for tobacco the authors added The research published in BMJ noted the speed at which UPFs deliver carbohydrates and fats to the gut may also be important to their addictive potential Drugs and routes of administration that affect the brain more quickly have a higher addictive potential The authors also noted the social justice implications with UPF addiction They wrote People facing food insecurity are more reliant on UPFs to meet their daily energy needs and are more likely to exhibit higher levels of UPF addiction In a study published in JAMA Psychiatry in 2011 researchers examined neural activity in 48 women with high food addiction scores using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI They found that while there were limited differences in reward circuitry activation between participants with high FA and low FA during food intake the high food addiction group exhibited patterns of neural activation associated with reduced inhibitory control This suggests that consumption of a palatable food may override desires to limit caloric food consumption in participants with high FA resulting in disinhibited food consumption The study authors concluded Similar patterns of neural activation are implicated in addictive like eating behavior and substance dependence elevated activation in reward circuitry in response to food cues and reduced activation of inhibitory regions in response to food intake Withdrawal is a key component of addiction With this in mind researchers conducted a review to determine whether highly processed HP foods are linked to withdrawal symptoms in animals and humans The research published in the journal Obesity Reviews in 2022 found Evidence suggests that HP food withdrawal occurs in animals Well controlled experimental animal studies have demonstrated behavioral and biological indicators of HP food withdrawal which follow a similar time course to other addictive substances Anecdotal and self report evidence also suggests that humans experience withdrawal like symptoms when they attempt to reduce their intake of HP foods In an editorial published in

learned from past addiction epidemics are relevant for the negative public health consequences of food addiction and UPFs particularly the need for policies that reduce the accessibility of UPFs in the modern food environment reformulate UPFs to reduce their addictive potentials and minimize risks for children and adolescents to develop food addiction Ultraprocessed foods were consistently more associated with the Yale Food Addiction Scale indicators than were naturally occurring minimally processed foods according to the study authors of a review titled Is Food Addictive republished in 2021 in the Annual Review of Nutrition Notably ultraprocessed foods were significantly more problematic for individuals who endorsed experiencing elevated YFAS symptoms of addictive like eating providing further support for the role of ultraprocessed foods in food addiction They concluded As with addictive drugs some but not all individuals exhibit an addictive pattern of consumption marked by diminished control over intake intense cravings and an inability to cut down despite negative consequences higher YFAS scores are associated with mechanisms implicated in addictive disorders and

signs of addiction to highly processed foods This was determined if the person had two or more symptoms out of 11 plus significant impairment or distress The authors noted that 44 of the adults indicated at least 1 symptom of food addiction the most common being intense cravings to processed foods Notably older adults who rated their mental health as fair or poor were at least three times more likely to meet food addiction criteria compared with those reporting excellent very good or good mental health The researchers added Many people report eating highly processed foods not only for the calories they provide but also to experience pleasure and cope with negative emotions Cravings for highly processed foods can also be intense and challenging to resist and people may experience withdrawal like symptoms when they try to reduce the amount they consume A Brazilian based cross sectional study that included around 6 000 people examined whether consuming ultra processed food was associated with food addiction The Yale Food Addiction Scale was used to determine food addiction in participants The results which were based on self reported questionnaires and published in the journal Appetite in 2023 found that individuals with food addiction had lower consumption of fresh fruits vegetables and beans They also had higher consumption of UPF hamburgers sausages instant noodles packaged snacks and or salty cookies and sandwich cookies sweets and or treats In an article published in 2020 in Nutrients Dr Robert H Lustig wrote that the global pandemic of non communicable diseases stems from markers of obesity and poor diet and argued that ultra processed foods should be regulated in the same way other addictive substances are regulated This is because they fall under the same four criteria abuse toxicity ubiquity and externalities that are considered by the public health community as necessary and sufficient for regulation Of the addictive nature of UPFs Lustig wrote Added sugar and specifically the fructose moiety is unique in activating reward circuitry fructose works both directly and indirectly to increase consumption and that both obesity and chronic fructose exposure down regulate dopamine receptors requiring greater and greater stimuli to enact a reward signaling effect tolerance a primary component of addiction A systematic review

experiments combined sweeteners with fats such as hydrogenated oils or lard The current review found that the most common foods associated with addictive symptoms were those high in added fats and or refined carbohydrates such as sugar When given the choice between saccharin sweetened water and cocaine rats are more likely to choose the sweeteners according to a 2018 study published in PLoS One In the study researchers tested rats that had never been fed refined sugars or sweeteners before no prior experience with refined sugar or artificial sweetener Rats were allowed to choose mutually exclusively between water sweetened with saccharin an intense calorie free sweetener and intravenous cocaine a highly addictive and harmful substance the large majority of animals 94 preferred the sweet taste of saccharin Importantly each day before making their choices rats were allowed to alternatively sample the other option learn their respective reward value The researchers concluded Our findings clearly demonstrate that intense sweetness can surpass cocaine reward even in drug sensitized and addicted individuals How Big Tobacco acquired Big Food In the late 1980s major tobacco corporations like R J Reynolds and Philip Morris now Altria acquired and owned several Big Food brands including Kraft Nabisco and General Mills At this time Big Tobacco began to change and reformulate these food products using the same tactics in targeted marketing and formulation of their tobacco products with an increase in colors flavors and additives to create more appealing and addictive processed foods This also included food specifically marketed to children Though these tobacco companies have severed ties with food corporations many of these processed food formulations remain In fact a 2023 research report published in the journal Addiction found that tobacco owned foods were 29 more likely to be classified as fat and sodium hyper palatable food HPF and 80 more likely to be classified as carbohydrate and sodium HPF than foods that were not tobacco owned between 1988 and 2001 The availability of fat and sodium HPF and carbohydrate and sodium HPF was high in

criteria for tobacco products Gearhardt argues that ultra processed foods can be considered addictive And to identify the key addictive components in highly processed foods the same care and control employed in understanding the addictive potential of drugs needs to be applied to studies of highly processed foods The Yale Food Addiction Scale YFAS Because food addiction has been controversial to define Gearhardt then a doctoral student at Yale University created The Yale Food Addiction Scale YFAS in 2009 as a standardized tool to measure the signs of addictive eating behaviors The self reported questionnaire uses questions based on criteria used for substance disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM It is meant to evaluate behavior with questions similar to those that would ask about other substance abuse issues including drugs and alcohol regarding cravings withdrawal symptoms and failed efforts to stop The scale has become a staple for food research around the world and has been translated into many languages Gearhardt explained to the Guardian I took the standard diagnostic criteria for alcohol nicotine cocaine and heroin and translated them to food The YFAS is the basis for much of the research conducted on food addiction in the past 15 years Nonfiction books Ultra Processed People Why Do We All Eat Stuff That Isn t Food and Why Can

include cookies sodas and energy drinks fruit flavored yogurts margarine packaged pastries plant based meats and milks canned soups frozen meals sweetened breakfast cereals granola and energy bars hot dogs deli meats and potato chips Brands like Nestlé PepsiCo Coca Cola Unilever Frito Lay Kraft Heinz and Kellogg s are among the world s largest manufacturers of ultra processed foods Some researchers

classification system is a commonly used framework around the world to categorize processed foods Created by researchers at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil in 2009 the system considers the physical biological and chemical processes that occur after foods are separated from nature and before they are consumed or used in the preparation of dishes and meals In this framework food is broken into four categories 1 Unprocessed or in its natural form 2 Processed with culinary ingredients 3 Processed foods 4 Ultra processed foods How much ultra processed food do Americans eat Research shows that Americans are among those who eat the most ultra processed food in the world In 2018 57 of calories that the average American ate came from ultra processed foods up from 53 5 in 2002 According to a cross sectional study published in BMJ Open non Hispanic white and Black Americans eat the most ultra processed food in the U S Hispanic adults eat less of these foods than other racial demographics Younger people those who are less educated and or have a lower income tend to eat the most ultra processed foods American children also eat a significant amount of ultra processed food A large study published in JAMA found that in 2018 67 of the calories that kids eat came from ultra processed food This was an increase from 61 4 in 1999 The estimated proportion of energy intake from consumption

foods was associated with reduced risk of overall cancer head and neck cancers esophageal squamous cell carcinoma colon cancer rectal cancer hepatocellular carcinoma and postmenopausal breast cancer The researchers concluded that this study suggests that the replacement of processed and ultra processed foods and drinks with an equal amount of minimally processed foods might reduce the risk of various cancer types In a groundbreaking multinational cohort study published in 2023 conducted by researchers at the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC and University of Vienna researchers examined the data of more than 250 000 people from seven European countries All participants were free of cancer at baseline and were asked about their food and drink habits After a median

fast food burgers fries and soft drinks increase the risk of cardiovascular disease Photo credit Colynary Media Unsplash A growing body of research shows that ultra processed foods and notably artificial sweeteners increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease mortality Cardiovascular disease CVD is an umbrella term for diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels These conditions include coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease peripheral arterial disease carditis heart failure and arrhythmias Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide Scientists say the consumption of ultra processed foods UPFs may promote cardiovascular disease through several mechanisms Because UPFs are typically high in refined sugars salt carbohydrates unhealthy fats and or artificial additives they can contribute to obesity high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes all of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease A diet high in these foods may displace more nutritious options leading to a poor diet further increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease UPFs have become a staple in the American diet Today about 57 of the calories American adults consume comes from UPFs That percentage rises to 67 in American children What is the scientific evidence linking ultra processed foods and cardiovascular disease related mortality In a 2024 large umbrella review that included 45 epidemiological meta analyses that included the data of nearly 10 million people to evaluate the associations between ultra processed food consumption and a variety of adverse health outcomes The research which was published in BMJ showed that the strongest available evidence pertained to direct associations between greater exposure to ultra processed foods and higher risks of all cause mortality cardiovascular disease related mortality along with several other adverse health conditions Notably the study authors wrote One meta analysis study specifically pooled heart disease related deaths such as ischaemic heart disease related mortality and cerebrovascular disease related mortality with each 10 increase in total ultra processed food exposure In the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition a longitudinal analysis published in 2021 investigated ultra processed food consumption and mortality risk in an

and heart disease Notably the study authors observed that the increased risks of mortality from ultra processed foods were significantly higher in women than in men An observational study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2023 examined the risk of cardiovascular disease in people with Type 2 diabetes Researchers found In participants with Type 2 diabetes at study entry higher UPF consumption was associated with reduced survival and higher CVD mortality rate independent of diet quality Researchers concluded Besides prioritizing the adoption of a diet based on nutritional requirements dietary guidelines for the management of Type 2 diabetes should also recommend limiting UPF What is the scientific evidence linking ultra processed foods and overall cardiovascular disease A multi centre prospective cohort analysis in nine European countries published in The Lancet in January 2025 including 428 728 participants found that ultra processed foods were positively associated with all cause mortality as well as mortality from circulatory diseases cerebrovascular disease ischemic heart disease digestive diseases and Parkinson s disease Replacing processed and UPFs with unprocessed minimally processed foods was associated with lower mortality risk In a meta analysis published in eClinical Medicine in 2024 researchers assessed 20 observational studies that included the data of more than 1 million people to examine the relationship between eating ultra processed foods and the risk of cardiovascular events CVEs They found a 10 increase of UPF by daily weight proportion was associated with a 1 9 increase of CVEs risk an additional daily serving corresponding to 2 2 CVEs risk increase and 10 increase by daily energy proportion corresponding to 1 6 CVEs risk increase The researchers concluded UPF consumption was associated with a higher risk of CVEs in the positive linear relationship Our findings highlight the importance of minimizing UPF consumption for cardiovascular health and might help to pursue public health policies in control of UPF consumption A large observational prospective study using the NutriNet Santé cohort in

serving of UPF the risk increased by 4 for CVEs and 2 for all cause mortality With increasing UPF intake the risk of CVEs reflected a linear upward trend A review published in Nutrients in 2020 assessed several health outcomes related to ultra processed foods Of the 43 studies assessed 37 found an association between UPF consumption and at least one adverse health outcome Among those health outcomes researchers found links between UPFs and cardio metabolic risks along with cardiovascular disease In children links were shown between UPF consumption and cardio metabolic risk Notably the researchers wrote No study reported an association between UPF and beneficial outcomes What is the scientific evidence linking ultra processed foods with coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis In a 2021 study published in the Journal of Nutrition examined whether ultra processed foods were associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease in a study sample of more than 13 000 adults

investigated an association between ultra processed food consumption and coronary atherosclerosis risk using computed tomography scans and self reported diet questionnaires from more than 1 000 men They found that approximately 500 g day of UPF consumption was associated with a 2 fold greater prevalence of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis than consuming only 100 g day independently of total energy intake and other well established cardiovascular risk factors What is the scientific evidence linking ultra processed foods and increased risk of arrhythmia In a 2023 study published in Heart researchers examined the association between UPF consumption and risk of atrial fibrillation Researchers used data from the UK Biobank that included more than 120 000 They found that the greatest ultra processed food consumption was associated with a significant increase in atrial fibrillation risk even in fully adjusted models and a 10 increase in absolute intake of ultra processed food was associated with a 5 increase in atrial fibrillation risk What is the scientific evidence that artificial sweeteners increase cardiovascular disease risk Artificial sweeteners like aspartame and sucralose are common ingredients used as sugar substitutes in ultra processed foods and beverages Research shows that these sweeteners are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease Artificial sweeteners may affect the body s metabolism gut microbiota and insulin response all of which could impact cardiovascular health In a 2022 review published in BMJ researchers sought to

and added sugar or artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame They also often contain artificial additives and preservatives These foods often lack essential nutrients and fiber which are important for brain health A diet rich in fruits vegetables whole grains lean proteins and healthy fats has been associated with a reduced risk of dementia Some studies suggest that a diet high in ultra processed foods may indirectly contribute to dementia risk by promoting chronic conditions such as obesity diabetes and hypertension which are known risk factors for cognitive decline Consuming high amounts of ultra processed food UPF may also lead to chronic inflammation oxidative stress and alterations in gut microbiota which could also negatively impact brain health Americans are among

people in the United Kingdom After examining ultra processed food consumption and various forms of dementia the researchers found In the fully adjusted model consumption of UPF was associated with higher risk of dementia Alzheimer s disease and vascular dementia respectively In addition replacing 10 of UPF weight in diet with an equivalent proportion of unprocessed or minimally processed foods was estimated to be associated with a 19 lower risk of dementia In a 2024 systematic review of observational studies published in the Journal of Neurology researchers investigated the link between UPF

included 5 cohort studies and the data of more than 617 000 people The researchers found of the included studies 4 demonstrated a risk association between the consumption of ultra processed foods and the development of Alzheimer s disease while 1 study showed a risk association only with the development of cognitive decline The authors concluded Although there have been few studies on the topic so far the included studies have a longitudinal design with robust results Our findings reinforce the importance of public strategies aimed at raising awareness among the population about the harmful effects of UPF consumption on cognitive health In an ecological study published in 2023 in PLoS ONE researchers investigated among other associations the link between diet and Alzheimer s disease in a Brazilian population They used data from databases related to the rate at which drugs for the disease were prescribed along with data related to nutrition and food security Researchers found

than 14 000 study participants were included in the cognitive impairment cohort The researchers found that a 10 increase in relative intake of UPFs was associated with higher risk of cognitive impairment and intake of unprocessed or minimally processed foods with lower risk of cognitive impairment In a cross sectional analysis published in 2023 in the European Journal of Nutrition researchers examined the data of more than 3 600 people from the U S over the age of 60 The data included self reported questionnaires related to diet along with several cognitive performance assessments Researchers found that UPF consumption was significantly associated with worse performance in Animal Fluency in older adults without pre existing diseases Animal Fluency is a common test used to assess mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer s disease in which patients are asked to name as many animals as possible in 60 seconds An early sign of dementia or Alzheimer s disease may be when a patient answers fewer than 15 animals in the time frame The study authors concluded While longitudinal studies are required to provide stronger evidence these results suggest that decreasing

of developing depression and anxiety Photo credit Gadiel Lazcano Unsplash Ultra processed foods increase the risk of developing depression and anxiety according to a growing body of scientific evidence This is especially true of artificially sweetened sodas and beverages Researchers say the consumption of ultra processed food may indirectly promote depression through several mechanisms including nutrient deficiencies inflammation and an imbalance of the gut microbiota along with blood sugar fluctuations and food chemicals Ultra processed foods are industrially formulated with added sugars salt carbohydrates fats and or additives Sweeteners including high fructose corn syrup sucralose and aspartame are commonly found in ultra processed food UPFs have become a staple in the American diet Today about 57 of the calories American adults consume comes from UPFs That percentage rises to 67 in American children What is the evidence linking ultra processed foods with depression and anxiety A prospective study published in the journal JAMA Network Open in 2023 examined the self reported diet and mental health of more than 30 000 middle aged women between 2003 and 2017 All women were free of depression at the beginning of the study After adjusting for lifestyle factors and comorbidities the researchers found that when compared with participants who ate the least ultra processed food those who ate the most had an increased risk of depression Interestingly when comparing the groups who ate the least and most amounts of UPFs only artificially sweetened beverages and artificial sweeteners were associated with greater risk of depression In a 2024 cohort study and systematic review published in Clinical Nutrition Brazilian researchers examined the prospective association between depressive symptoms and the consumption of ultra processed food In the original research the scientists examined the data of more than 15 000 people who were free of depressive symptoms and or depression at baseline Food questionnaires were used to assess study participants diet After a mean follow up of 18 3 months researchers found that each 10 increase in the dietary share of ultra processed foods was associated with a 10 increase in the hazard of incident cases of depressive symptoms In a systematic review published in Nutritional Neuroscience in 2022 researchers investigated the link between ultra processed food and mood disorders The results included data from more than 260 000 people from 12 countries Results showed that UPF consumption was associated with an enhanced depressive mental health status risk The researchers wrote For every 10 increase in UPF consumption per daily calorie intake 11 higher risk of depression was observed among adults In an

mechanistic basis might lie in the macro nutritional characteristics of UPFs rich in saturated fats and sugar and low in dietary fiber micronutrients and phytochemicals that may influence a variety of interacting pathways including inflammation and oxidative stress Non nutritive ingredients used in industrial processing such as aspartame might also add to the problem as this artificial sweetener was shown to inhibit the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters dopamine norepinephrine and serotonin which are important in the development of depression A 2022 systematic review and meta analysis published in Nutrients sought to synthesize the association between ultra processed food consumption and depression as well as other mental disorders Seventeen studies with a total of more than 380 000 participants were included in the analysis Researchers found Greater ultra processed food consumption was cross sectionally associated with increased odds of depressive and anxiety symptoms both when these outcomes were assessed together as well as separately Furthermore a meta analysis of prospective studies demonstrated that greater ultra processed food intake was associated with increased risk of subsequent depression In a 2024 systematic umbrella review published in BMJ researchers examined ultra processed food consumption and various adverse health effects The review included 45 analyses Among the findings were associations between all cause mortality obesity and Type 2 diabetes The findings also showed increased risk of anxiety and depressive symptoms The researchers wrote We observed associations in separate assessments of prevalent combined common mental disorder outcomes across six cross sectional designs and incident depressive outcomes across two

quality For a 2023 study published in the Journal of Affective Disorders researchers used data from participants diet along with clinical and brain imaging data to examine the link between ultra processed foods UPFs depression and gray matter volumes in the brain The researchers examined the diet and depressive symptoms reported by 152 adult study participants who also underwent magnetic

associated with lower volumes in the posterior cingulate cortex and the left amygdala which in the participants with obesity also encompassed the left ventral putamen and the dorsal frontal cortex The researchers concluded UPF consumption is associated with depressive symptoms and lower volumes within the mesocorticolimbic brain network implicated in reward processes and conflict monitoring In a

low mood feelings of persistent sadness and a loss of interest in things a person typically enjoys Other symptoms can include feelings of hopelessness difficulty concentrating irritability changes in sleep patterns fatigue and thoughts of death or suicide It is a leading cause of disability throughout the world The disorder affects nearly 280 million or 5 of people worldwide according to the World Health Organization This estimate is likely to be inaccurately low because many people who experience depression do not seek help or receive treatment What is anxiety While everyone once in a while experiences symptoms of nervousness worry and fear anxiety disorders are mental health conditions characterized by significant feelings of distress that can hinder daily activities Common types of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder GAD social anxiety disorder panic disorder and specific phobias Symptoms of anxiety disorders can vary widely but may include excessive worrying

researchers sought to examine the association between Type 2 diabetes T2D and ultra processed foods UPF The prospective analysis included data from more than 104 000 people The researchers found that after adjusting for lifestyle and socioeconomic factors and comorbidities consumption of UPF was associated with a higher risk of T2D These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for several markers of the nutritional quality of the diet for other metabolic comorbidities and for weight change The absolute amount of UPF consumption grams per day was consistently associated with T2D risk even when adjusting for unprocessed or minimally processed food intake In an umbrella review published in 2024 in BMJ researchers examined the consumption of ultra processed foods and the risk of various adverse health outcomes Using data from 45 analyses researchers found that the strongest available evidence pertained to direct associations between greater exposure to ultra processed foods and higher risks of all cause mortality cardiovascular disease related mortality common mental disorder outcomes overweight and obesity and type 2 diabetes They concluded Coupled with existing

consumption and the prevalence of diabetes increased during 1997 2011 in Chinese adults Higher UPF consumers had a significantly higher risk of diabetes than non consumers The association between UPF consumption and diabetes was partly mediated by overweight obesity In a study published in the Journal of Nutrition researchers aimed to investigate the associations between ultra processed food consumption and diabetes risk in Asian populations by assessing the data from more than 7 000 Koreans between the ages of 40 and 69 They found compared with the lowest quartile of ultra processed food intake the highest quartile was positively associated with diabetes risk The association did not change after additional adjustment for diet quality or BMI The consumption of carbonated drinks ham sausage instant noodles and ice cream were particularly notable for their associations with increased risk of type 2 diabetes In response to these findings the study authors wrote Public health strategies should also focus on making unprocessed or minimally processed foods more affordable and accessible and provide support for industry actions to formulate less processed foods Food manufacturers can reformulate their processing methods to reduce additives and harmful substances in their products To encourage consumers to make informed choices food labeling may also disclose more detailed information on food processing methods and contents of additives and preservatives in the food products In a study published in The Lancet Diabetes Endocrinology in 2024 researchers sought to examine the connection between Type 2 diabetes and emulsifiers which are food additives that are used to mix two or more substances together They are commonly found in ultra processed foods The study

dementia The evidence shows that these hyperpalatable foods which usually include high amounts of sugar salt and artificial additives are also linked to early death or increased all cause mortality The term all cause mortality refers to deaths in a population from any cause What is the evidence linking ultra processed food and all cause mortality A meta analysis published in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine in April 2025 showed a linear dose response association between the ultraprocessed food consumption and all cause mortality The researchers conclude The findings support that ultraprocessed food intake contributes significantly to the overall burden of disease in many countries and its reduction should be included in national dietary guideline recommendations and addressed in public policies A multicentre prospective cohort analysis in nine European countries published in The Lancet in January 2025 including 428 728 participants found that ultra processed foods were positively associated with all cause mortality as well as mortality from circulatory diseases cerebrovascular disease ischemic heart disease digestive diseases and Parkinson s disease Replacing processed and UPFs with unprocessed minimally processed foods was associated with lower mortality risk In a population based cohort study that included more than 115 000 people scientists investigated the link between ultra processed food consumption and all cause mortality The research which was published in 2024 in BMJ found that compared with those in the lowest quarter of ultra processed food consumption participants in the highest quarter had a 4 higher all cause mortality Ready to eat meat products like processed meats along with artificially and sugar sweetened drinks and highly processed breakfast foods were also associated with higher all cause mortality A 2019 prospective cohort study published in BMJ found that a higher consumption of ultra processed foods was independently associated with 62 relatively increased hazard for all cause mortality For each additional serving of ultra processed food all cause mortality increased by 18 Researchers came to these results after examining the data of nearly 20 000 study participants ages 20 to 91 years old following up every other year between 1999 and 2014 They separated the type of consumption of ultra

with a 14 higher risk of all cause mortality They concluded An increase in ultraprocessed foods consumption appears to be associated with an overall higher mortality risk among this adult population In an umbrella review published in 2024 in BMJ researchers examined the consumption of ultra processed foods and the risk of various adverse health outcomes Using data from 45 analyses researchers found direct associations between exposure to ultra processed foods and 32 health parameters spanning mortality cancer and mental respiratory cardiovascular gastrointestinal and metabolic health outcomes And based on the pre specified evidence classification criteria convincing evidence supported direct associations between greater ultra processed food exposure and higher risks of incident cardiovascular disease related mortality and type 2 diabetes The researchers concluded These findings provide a rationale to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of using population based and public health measures to target and reduce dietary exposure to ultra processed foods for improved human health A prospective cohort study published in 2022 in BMJ investigated the rate of all cause mortality as it related to individual diet and ultra processed food intake in nearly 23 000 adults Researchers found that adults with the lowest quality diet and the highest ultra processed food consumption were at the highest risk for all cause and cardiovascular mortality A significant proportion of the higher mortality risk associated with an elevated intake of nutrient poor foods was explained by a high degree of food processing A 2021 meta analysis published in the British Journal of Nutrition examined all observational studies that explored the link between eating ultra

rates in the world Since the 1970s the rate of childhood obesity has tripled in the U S with 1 out of 5 American kids currently obese Americans are among the highest consumers of ultra processed food UPF in the world more than half of our calories come from UPFs Typically these foods are highly palatable and often high in fat and sugar or sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame They also usually contain additives and preservatives Such foods include sugary sodas and drinks fruit flavored juices and yogurts chips cookies deli meats and sausage ice cream frozen meals canned soups and much more Many experts argue that the increase in UPF consumption has been an important contributor to the obesity epidemic in the country and throughout the world Obesity increases the risk of several serious

of more than 9 000 British children found that growth trajectories of body mass index fat mass index weight and waist circumference from 7 to 24 years of age were greater among children with the highest vs lowest quintile of UPF consumption The researchers concluded These findings suggest that radical and effective public health actions that reduce children s exposure to and consumption of UPF and remove barriers to accessing minimally processed foods are urgently needed to counteract the growing burden of obesity in England and globally In a multi country study of children published in

Based on DeCamp's riveting book, The Franklin Cover-up , \"Conspiracy of Silence\" begins with the shut-down of Nebraska's Franklin Community Federal Credit Union after a raid by federal agencies in November 1988 revealed that $40 million was missing. When the Nebraska legislature launched a probe into the affair, what initially looked like a financial swindle soon exploded into a startling tale of drugs, money laundering, and a nationwide child abuse ring.

Two years ago today - when President George Bush announced US, British and Allied forces would begin to bomb Baghdad - protesters claimed the US had a secret plan for Iraq's oil once Saddam had been conquered. In fact there were two conflicting plans, setting off a hidden policy war between neo-conservatives at the Pentagon, on one side, versus a combination of Big Oil\" executives and US State Department \"pragmatists\". \"Big Oil\" appears to have won. The latest plan [was] drafted with the help of American oil industry consultants. Insiders told Newsnight that planning began \"within weeks\" of Bush's first taking office in 2001, long before the September 11th attack on the US. The industry-favoured plan was pushed aside by a secret plan, drafted just before the invasion in 2003, which called for the sell-off of all of Iraq's oil fields. The new plan was crafted by neo-conservatives intent on using Iraq's oil to destroy the Opec cartel. Philip Carroll, the former CEO of Shell Oil USA who took control of Iraq's oil production for the US Government a month after the invasion, stalled the sell-off scheme. Mr Carroll told us he made it clear to Paul Bremer, the US occupation chief who arrived in Iraq in May 2003, that: \"There was to be no privatisation of Iraqi oil resources or facilities while I was involved.\" Formerly US Secretary of State, [James] Baker is now an attorney representing Exxon-Mobil and the Saudi Arabian government. \" </s><|im_end|>\\n", "chunk_id": "wtkcsv:11:6fd2e455ecf3", "wtk_id": 11.0}, {"doc_idx": 24310, "dataset": "wtk_pipe_csv_260223", "filename": "260223WTK.csv", "source_url": "https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-kids-build-soybeanfueled-car", "publisher": "WTK Archive", "found_on": "WTK Archive", "title": "", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Kids Build Soybean-Fueled Car as reported by CBS News The star at last week's Philadelphia Auto Show wasn't a sports car or an economy car.

A car that can go from zero to 60 in four seconds and get more than 50 miles to the gallon would be enough to pique any driver's interest. So who do we have to thank for it. Ford? GM? Toyota? No - just Victor, David, Cheeseborough, Bruce, and Kosi, five kids from the auto shop program at West Philadelphia High School.

The declassified document is called \"Information Operations Roadmap\". It was obtained by the National Security Archive at George Washington University using the Freedom of Information Act. Officials in the Pentagon wrote it in 2003. The Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, signed it. The operations described in the document include a surprising range of military activities: public affairs officers who brief journalists, psychological operations troops who try to manipulate the thoughts and beliefs of an enemy, computer network attack specialists who seek to destroy enemy networks. The military's psychological operations, or Psyops , is finding its way onto the computer and television screens of ordinary Americans. \"Psyops messages will often be replayed by the news media for much larger audiences, including the American public. Strategy should be based on the premise that the Department [of Defense] will 'fight the net' as it would an enemy weapons system,\" it reads. The document recommends that the United States should seek the ability to \"provide maximum control of the entire electromagnetic spectrum\". US forces should be able to \"disrupt or destroy the full spectrum of globally emerging communications systems, sensors, and weapons systems dependent on the electromagnetic spectrum\". The fact that the \"Information Operations Roadmap\" is approved by the Secretary of Defense suggests that these plans are taken very seriously indeed in the Pentagon.

Bush signed the provisions into law, then said he could ignore them all. On several other occasions, Bush contended he could nullify laws creating \"whistle-blower\" job protections.

Some facts: According to the World Health Organization, the first \"outbreak\" of the H5N1 virus, also known as avian flu, killed six people in 1997. Since then, H5N1 has allegedly killed 97 more worldwide, the majority of whom lived in poor, rural areas and had direct contact with dead or sick birds often kept in unsanitary conditions. These numbers do not suggest the human population faces an insurmountable threat from this virus. Peter Palese, flu scientist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, told The New York Times in a Nov. 8, 2005 article that H5N1 is a false alarm. The virus has been \"around for more than a dozen years, but it hasn't jumped into the human population.\" The reason? It probably can't. There are better ways to promote America's health than selling sickness through the language of fear. Before the government employs \"all instruments of national power,\" including \"quarantine authority,\" as the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza declares, we need to be told what \"pandemic flu\" really means.

The active sonar used by navies sends out loud pings of sound that seem to frighten and disorient whales. The effect was documented off Greece in 1996 and established later during naval exercises in the Bahamas, off the Canary Islands and off Spain. In the 2000 Bahamas stranding, a local marine biologist collected some of the whales that died onshore and froze them for later study -- which helped NOAA conclude that sonar was the likely cause.

Many researchers doubt it will ever happen. The virus does not infect people easily, and those who do contract it almost never spread it to other humans. Bird flu is what the name implies: mostly an avian disease. It has infected tens of millions of birds but fewer than 200 people, and nearly all of them have caught it from birds. But when A(H5N1) does get into people, it can be deadly. It has killed more than half of its known human victims -- an extraordinarily high rate. The virus lacks just one trait that could turn it into a pandemic: transmissibility. Everything hangs on transmissibility. But it is impossible to predict whether A(H5N1) will become contagious among people. Most bird flu viruses do not jump species to people. Some experts say that since A(H5N1) has been around for at least 10 years and the shift has not occurred, it is unlikely to happen. Others refuse to take that bet. The best protection in any flu pandemic will come from a vaccine, but scientists cannot tell ahead of time what strain the vaccine should protect against. There is no assurance that the next pandemic will even involve A(H5N1). It may involve a different strain of bird flu, and an A(H5N1) vaccine would not work for it.

Ehrlich's endorsement is the latest turn in the debate over Maryland's electronic voting machines that were used in nearly every polling place in the 2004 election. The state has committed $90 million to the system, which critics say is vulnerable to tampering. Last month, Ehrlich -- who championed the Diebold machines in 2003 -- express[ed] concern about reliability questions raised in California and Florida about those machines. A review of California's voting systems found more than a dozen vulnerabilities that security analysts said could be fixed. More than two dozen states now have some requirement for vote verification. Note: These vulnerabilities were discovered after the machines were used widely in previous elections.

Finding answers is tough because autism, a little-understood developmental disorder, often is diagnosed at the very ages when children get vaccines.

Nuclear conflict, mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the world. The document predicts that abrupt climate change could bring the planet to the edge of anarchy as countries develop a nuclear threat to defend and secure dwindling food, water and energy supplies. The threat to global stability vastly eclipses that of terrorism, say the few experts privy to its contents. 'Disruption and conflict will be endemic features of life,' concludes the Pentagon analysis. 'Once again, warfare would define human life.' The report was commissioned by influential Pentagon defence adviser Andrew Marshall, who has held considerable sway on US military thinking over the past three decades. Climate change 'should be elevated beyond a scientific debate to a US national security concern', say the authors. Last week the Bush administration came under heavy fire from a large body of respected scientists who claimed that it cherry-picked science to suit its policy agenda and suppressed studies that it did not like.

Army Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer and J.D. Smith were among a dozen intelligence officers and contractors who worked on the clandestine program set up long before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to track al-Qaida. They are accusing the Pentagon...of violating their First Amendment rights by blocking their access to legal counsel during the closed sessions. Able Danger identified the Sept. 11, 2001, attack leader Mohamed Atta, and three of the 9/11 plot's 19 hijackers, as possible members of an al-Qaida cell linked to the 1993 World Trade Center attack or its participants,\" the suit said. Shaffer, a Bronze Star recipient who fought undercover in Afghanistan, caused a stir in August when he stepped forward to say that he and other Able Danger operatives had identified Atta as long as 21 months before the Sept. 11 attacks. That claim - later supported by the Able Danger team's leader, Navy Capt. Scott Phillpott - contradicted a central finding of the commission Congress had set up to probe the Sept. 11 attacks , which concluded that none of the hijackers had been known to U.S. authorities before the assault.

It's not the top 20 percent, or even the top 10 percent. The big gains have gone to a much smaller, much richer group than that. A new research paper by Ian Dew-Becker and Robert Gordon of Northwestern University, Where Did the Productivity Growth Go?,\" gives the details. Between 1972 and 2001 the wage and salary income of Americans at the 90th percentile of the income distribution rose only 34 percent, or about 1 percent per year. So being in the top 10 percent of the income distribution, like being a college graduate, wasn't a ticket to big income gains. But income at the 99th percentile rose 87 percent; income at the 99.9th percentile rose 181 percent; and income at the 99.99th percentile rose 497 percent.

Pandemics, dirty bombs, cyber attacks, bioterror and other exotic threats are always on the verge of being unleashed onto a shamefully unprepared republic. Yet, judging from statistics on life expectancy, violent deaths and war, we live in much less perilous times than any generation before us. Avian flu, for example. We are cautioned that a pandemic...is only months away. One World Health Organization estimate says 2 million to 7 million people will die in the next pandemic. But it is not 1918. The WHO reports that since 2003, there have been 152 cases of avian flu, resulting in 83 deaths. A flu pandemic has been regularly predicted since 1997 and (knock on wood) it has never arrived. Dirty bombs -- conventional explosives mixed with radioactive material -- present another example of overreaction. In 2004, experts warned in the normally staid Wall Street Journal that a terrorist attack with a dirty bomb was an imminent certainty. They announced: Shame on our leaders and on us if the lamentations of the next blue-ribbon panel will be intoned over the graves of hundreds of thousands of Americans, the collapse of our economy, and perhaps a fatal blow to our way of life.\" But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission says a dirty bomb would contaminate \"up to several city blocks.\" The commission's advice, if one goes off, is to walk away and take a shower.

The device, which uses two opposing crystals to generate a powerful electric field, could potentially lead to a portable, battery-operated neutron generator for a variety of applications, from non-destructive testing to detecting explosives and scanning luggage at airports. The device is essentially a tabletop particle accelerator. At its heart are two opposing pyroelectric\" crystals that create a strong electric field when heated or cooled. The device is filled with deuterium gas - a more massive cousin of hydrogen with an extra neutron in its nucleus. The electric field rips electrons from the gas, creating deuterium ions and accelerating them into a deuterium target on one of the crystals. When the particles smash into the target, neutrons are emitted, which is the telltale sign that nuclear fusion has occurred. The new study also verified the fundamental physics behind the original experiment. This suggests that pyroelectric crystals are in fact a viable means of producing nuclear fusion, and that commercial applications may be closer than originally thought.

There is nothing new about such an interest. In the US, it stretches back at least half a century. Impressed by claims that the Soviet Union was developing psychological warfare, the CIA and the Defence Advanced Projects Agency (Darpa) began their own programmes. Early experiments included the clandestine feeding of LSD to their own operatives and attempts at 'brain-washing'. By the 1960s, Darpa, along with the US Navy, was funding almost all US research into 'artificial intelligence', in order to develop methods and technologies for the 'automated battlefield' and the 'intelligent soldier'. Contracts were let and patents taken out on techniques aimed at recording signals from the brains of enemy personnel at a distance, in order to 'read their minds'. These efforts have burgeoned in the aftermath of the so-called 'war on terror'. The step beyond reading thoughts is to attempt to control them directly. A new technique - transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) - has begun to generate interest.

He accused the West of supplying the weapons fuelling African conflicts which leave civilians homeless -- and prey to war crimes, hunger, disease and rape -- while greedy companies exploit the oil and mineral wealth.

A memo of a two-hour meeting between the two leaders at the White House on January 31 2003 - nearly two months before the invasion - reveals that Mr Bush made it clear the US intended to invade whether or not there was a second UN resolution and even if UN inspectors found no evidence of a banned Iraqi weapons programme. Mr Bush told Mr Blair that the US was so worried about the failure to find hard evidence against Saddam that it thought of \"flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft planes with fighter cover over Iraq, painted in UN colours\". Mr Bush added: \"If Saddam fired on them, he would be in breach [of UN resolutions]\". The revelation that Mr Blair had supported the US president's plans to go to war with Iraq even in the absence of a second UN resolution contrasts with the assurances the prime minister gave parliament shortly after. On February 25 2003 - three weeks after his trip to Washington - Mr Blair told the Commons that the government was giving \"Saddam one further, final chance to disarm voluntarily\".

The estimate of how many more barrels of oil are buried deeper underground is staggering. We know there's much, much more there. The total estimates could be two trillion or even higher,\" says Clive Mather, Shell's Canada chief. \"This is a very, very big resource.\" Very big? That's eight times the amount of reserves in Saudi Arabia. Note: For those who fear oil shortages and an energy crisis, here's yet another example of huge, untapped energy reserves.

To Sancho, the results showed the vulnerability of voting equipment manufactured by Ohio-based Diebold Election Systems, which is used by Leon County and many other jurisdictions around the country. While electronic voting systems hold promise for improving the election process,\" the Government Accountability Office said in a report to Congress last year, there are still pressing concerns about \"security and reliability . . . design flaws\" and other issues. Election officials have repeatedly clashed with voting-machine manufacturers. A new wave of concern over today's voting technologies, started in 2003, when a Seattle-based activist named Bev Harris released thousands of Diebold documents she said she found on an unsecured portion of the company's Web site. Some computer scientists said the documents showed Diebold's systems were vulnerable to attack. Today, more than 800 jurisdictions use their technology, Harris said.

Hydrogen electrons pass through a conductor that creates the current to power an electric engine. Hydrogen fuel now costs two to three times as much as gasoline, but gets up to three times the mileage of gas, making the overall cost about the same. As an added benefit, there are no carbon emissions -- only water vapor.

During the record-setting hurricane season of 2005, three of the most powerful storms--Rita, Katrina, and Emily--did have lightning, lots of it. And researchers would like to know why.

It's tempting to think that, because Emily, Rita and Katrina were all exceptionally powerful, their sheer violence somehow explains their lightning. But Blakeslee says that this explanation is too simple. \"Other storms have been equally intense and did not produce much lightning,\" he says. \"There must be something else at work.\" Note: A number of researchers suspect there may have been clandestine involvement in Katrina and other recent hurricanes, possibly using HAARP technologies, which have been well documented.

Why We Fight [was originally] the title of a series of propaganda films that Frank Capra began making in 1942, with the aim of encouraging the American war effort against Nazism. Director Eugene Jarecki (The Trials of Henry Kissinger) has used the films as a commentary on the contemporary obsession of the American elite with military power. He also harks back to a speech by President Eisenhower, who, just before he left office, referred to the military-industrial complex\". Eisenhower was worried that too much intelligence, and too much business acumen in America, had become focussed on the production of unnecessary weapons systems. Since Eisenhower's time, everything has become much worse, as Eugene Jarecki describes it. The war in Iraq was made possible by a new range of weapons systems: a bomb called the \"bunker buster\" was dropped by stealth bombers on the first night of the conflict. Is American foreign policy dominated by the idea of military supremacy? Has the military become too important in American life? Jarecki's shrewd and intelligent polemic would seem to give an affirmative answer to each of these questions.

Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, a molecular pathologist at the Armed Forces Institute of Technology [said that] the 1918 virus appears to be a bird flu virus. But if it is from a bird, it is not a bird anyone has studied before. It is not like the A(H5N1) strain of bird flus in Asia, which has sickened at least 116 people, and killed 60. It is not like the influenza viruses that infect fowl in North America. Yet many researchers believe that the 1918 virus, which caused the worst infectious disease epidemic in human history, is a bird flu virus. And if so, it is the only one that has ever been known to cause a human pandemic. That, Dr. Taubenberger said, gives rise to a question. Are scientists looking for the next pandemic flu virus in all the wrong places? Birds, Dr. Slemons said, do not have much of an immune response to influenza, and so there is no particular pressure for the virus to mutate. He said birds are chronically infected with lots of flu viruses at once, and all the viruses coexist peacefully. Some experts like Dr. Peter Palese of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York say the A(H5N1) flu viruses are a false alarm. He notes that studies of serum collected in 1992 from people in rural China indicated that millions of people there had antibodies to the A(H5N1) strain. That means they had been infected with an H5N1 bird virus and recovered. Despite that, and the fact that those viruses have been circulating in China more than a dozen years, almost no human-to-human spread has occurred. The virus has been around for more than a dozen years, but it hasn't jumped into the human population,\" Dr. Palese said. \"I don't think it has the capability of doing it.\" \" </s><|im_end|>\\n", "chunk_id": "wtkcsv:199:521f80bb2c3a", "wtk_id": 199.0}, {"doc_idx": 24498, "dataset": "wtk_pipe_csv_260223", "filename": "260223WTK.csv", "source_url": "https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-fuels-paradise-power-source-turns-physics-its-head", "publisher": "WTK Archive", "found_on": "WTK Archive", "title": "", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Fuel's paradise?

Randell Mills, a Harvard University medic who also studied electrical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, claims to have built a prototype power source that generates up to 1,000 times more heat than conventional fuel. Independent scientists claim to have verified the experiments and Dr Mills says that his company, Blacklight Power , has tens of millions of dollars in investment lined up to bring the idea to market. What has much of the physics world up in arms is Dr Mills's claim that he has produced a new form of hydrogen, the simplest of all the atoms, with just a single proton circled by one electron. In his \"hydrino\", the electron sits a little closer to the proton than normal, and the formation of the new atoms from traditional hydrogen releases huge amounts of energy. According to Dr Mills, there can be only one explanation: quantum mechanics must be wrong. \"We've done a lot of testing. We've got 50 independent validation reports, we've got 65 peer-reviewed journal articles,\" he said. \"We ran into this theoretical resistance and there are some vested interests here.

Last year's decision by HHS to award the contract to the little-known VaxGen is being scrutinized by at least two congressional committees. The company's product will have to pass more large-scale tests proving its safety and effectiveness on people before it is fully licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for use on humans, and company officials say they do not expect it to be fully licensed at least until 2007.

Note: Isn't it amazing that though oil production fell, and though we all are paying much higher gas prices, Exxon Mobil earned the largest profits ever in the same quarter as Hurricane Katrina?

The kernel of truth in all the conspiracy theories is that the Bush administration's biggest supporters and closest political allies have benefited mightily from its policy of open-ended war. Halliburton, Vice President Dick Cheney's old company -- which is all about both oil and defense -- has seen its stock rise from about $12 a share to about $80 a share under this administration.

For a decade, Kenneth Ring, a psychology professor and researcher at the University of Connecticut, has looked into the question through the near-death experiences of others. Mr. Ring ... talked with hundreds of people between the ages of 18 and 84 who have come close to physical death. [His books] Life at Death [and] Heading Toward Omega both deal with near-death experiences and how they change people's lives. A near-death experience ... often happens to individuals who find themselves on the verge of imminent biological death. It involves ... a sense of the most profound peace and well-being that is possible to imagine. It's a sense of being separate from the physical body and sometimes being able to see it as though a spectator off to one side or from up above. These people have a sense of moving through a dark space or tunnel toward a radiantly beautiful white or golden light. They are absorbed in that light, having in some cases a panoramic life review in which virtually everything that they've ever done in their life they're able to see; perhaps meeting the spirits of deceased love ones or friends. And in some cases, they are asked to make a decision as to whether they would like to continue or go back to their body. The most powerful antidote to the fear of death is coming close to death ... and remembering one of these experiences. After having a near-death experience, people believe the end of life isn't [the end]; they believe in some sort of life after death. [Those] who have a near-death experience almost totally lose their fear of death.

Much of the current US nuclear policy has been in place since before I was secretary of defense, and it has only grown more dangerous and diplomatically destructive in the intervening years. On any given day...the president is prepared to make a decision within 20 minutes that could launch one of the most devastating weapons in the world. To declare war requires an act of congress, but to launch a nuclear holocaust requires 20 minutes' deliberation by the president and his advisors. After leaving the Defense Department, I became president of the World Bank. During my 13-year tenure, from 1968 to 1981, I was prohibited...from commenting publicly on issues of US national security.

To launch weapons against a nuclear-equipped opponent would be suicidal. To do so against a nonnuclear enemy would be militarily unnecessary, morally repugnant, and politically indefensible.

At a screening late on Friday ahead of its gala on Saturday, \"The Power of Nightmares\" by filmmaker and senior BBC producer Adam Curtis kept an audience of journalists and film buyers glued to their seats and taking notes for a full 2-1/2 hours. The film, a non-competition entry, argues that the fear of terrorism has come to pervade politics in the United States and Britain even though much of that angst is based on carefully nurtured illusions.
