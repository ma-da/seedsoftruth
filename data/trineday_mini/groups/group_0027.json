Up 5G The Untold Story the world s first documentary on the real world health effects of 5G garnered hundreds of views within hours of its June 11 premiere on YouTube The film features interviews with previously healthy residents of Stockholm Sweden who experienced serious health problems within days of having 5G antennas activated near their homes Symptoms included insomnia headaches fatigue tinnitus and heart palpitations Most people are uninformed or misinformed about the health risks of 5G antennas and towers Mona Nilsson co founder and director of the Swedish Radiation Protection Foundation and one of the film s writers told The Defender Nilsson said she hopes the documentary will raise public awareness of 5G as a very important health issue The so called safety limits applied in most countries all over the world including in the USA allow the public to be exposed to levels of this kind of radiation that are well documented to be harmful Nilsson said Current regulatory limits around the world have obviously been set to protect the industry s needs instead of public health she said The situation runs against what we must expect from a democratic society It is time for a wake up call The film documents how Nilsson teamed up with Lennart Hardell M D Ph D to write case reports that scientifically document people s experiences of health problems resulting from 5G For the reports Hardell and Nilsson measured the radiation levels at the people s homes and reported the residents symptoms They also documented how the symptoms swiftly disappeared when the residents relocated somewhere with lower radiation levels Hardell an oncologist and epidemiologist with the Environment and Cancer Research Foundation who has authored more than 350 papers almost 60 of which address radiofrequency RF radiation Hardell one of the first researchers to publish reports on the toxicity of Agent Orange emphasized that case reports are important for documenting the toxicity of an environmental exposure It is time for a wake up call Hardell said The public including the medical profession needs to recognize RF radiation as a causative factor for health issues So far Nilsson and Hardell have published eight case reports and one summary of seven of them Children may be more sensitive to RF radiation Nilsson explained that 5G which started being rolled out in Stockholm and elsewhere in 2020 was intended to provide faster transmission speed than 3G and 4G networks 5G uses higher frequencies than previous", "chunk_id":

were pointing it directly to my apartment Within the first week he experienced a hard beating of his heart fatigue and headaches One day his ex girlfriend came by the apartment After half an hour sitting in my living room she felt pain in her brain and started to cry he recalled The film also reports that children may be more sensitive to RF radiation than adults One of Hardell and Nilsson s case reports documented that an 8 year old developed severe headaches when he started attending a school near a 5G cell tower Unfortunately Nilsson said the industry has shown no interest in the results of our studies and the reported serious health effects of their new 5G technology According to Nilsson the 5G rollout is intended to meet the needs of the telecommunications industry rather than benefit the public As of July 3 2024 438 scientists and medical doctors signed the 5G appeal which calls for a moratorium in light of research that already shows RF radiation can harm human

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit CHD s emergency motion for an emergency injunction to stay the Federal Communications Commission FCC amendment to the Over the Air Reception Devices rule OTARD would have stopped the rule from going into effect March 29 The OTARD rule amendment allows private property owners to place fixed base station antennas on their property and for the first time to provide wireless data voice services including 5G to users on neighboring properties The rule amendment was designed to enable quick deployment of wireless including 5G in neighborhoods especially in rural areas by removing any requirements for permit or notice and by preemption of state laws and local zoning laws including homeowners association and deed restrictions The emergency motion filed March 18 is part of CHD s lawsuit against the FCC regarding the amended rule On March 23 the FCC filed its opposition to the emergency motion and on March 24 CHD filed its

grant such motions because we believe that if there was ever a case in which such a motion should have been granted this is the case Tachover said The court s decision didn t provide any reasoning It

disheartening considering the horrific human rights violations allowed by FCC s rule and its far reaching impacts The rule effectively sentences vulnerable adults and children to eviction diminished property values debilitating illness agonizing pain and even death without legal recourse Sadly all these violations will continue until we can secure relief on the merits The FCC s response to the

court to prevent the Biden administration from pressuring social media companies to censor certain content The administration appealed in July 2023 and in June 2024 the U S Supreme Court struck down the injunction The Supreme Court ruled the plaintiffs lacked standing because there was insufficient evidence they were directly injured by the government s actions The Louisiana District Court later granted a preliminary injunction in the Kennedy v Biden case however the court simultaneously issued a stay pending the Supreme Court s decision on the injunction in Missouri v Biden After the Supreme

Kennedy and CHD were specific targets of censorship and that they continue to be censored In a declaration by CHD President Mary Holland Holland said CHD was deplatformed from Facebook and YouTube in August and September 2021 and continues to be deplatformed from major social media sites to this day Doughty found the government s conduct is traceable to direct statements and instructions to social media platforms including Facebook Instagram and YouTube He said Kennedy and CHD showed they faced ongoing injuries that could be redressed by the court In October a three judge panel in the 5th

Vaccines From the beginning the official COVID 19 narrative has been inconsistent hypocritical and or contradictory because medical authorities used double standards to create the illusion their narrative was logical and sensible You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up We are not only in an epidemiological crisis we also are in an epistemological crisis How do we know what we know What differentiates opinion from a justified belief For nearly two years the public has been inundated by a sophisticated messaging campaign that urges us to trust the science But how can a non scientist know what the science is really saying Legacy media sources offer us an easy solution Trust us Legions of so called independent fact checking sites that serve to eliminate any wayward thinking keep those with a modicum of skepticism in line Research has been redefined to mean browsing Wikipedia citations Rather than being considered for their merit dissenting opinions are more easily dismissed as misinformation by labeling their source as untrustworthy How do we know these sources are untrustworthy They must be if they offer a dissenting opinion This form of circular reasoning is the central axiom of all dogmatic systems of thought Breaking the spell of dogmatic thinking is not easy but it is possible In this article I describe six examples of double standards

scientific publications or expert opinions that conflict with our medical authorities narrative information that will be categorically dismissed because it appears on The Defender I will instead demonstrate how from the beginning the official narrative has been inconsistent hypocritical and or contradictory 1 COVID deaths are presumed but vaccine deaths must be proven As of April 8 VAERS included 26 699 reports of deaths following COVID vaccines The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC officially acknowledges only nine of these In order to establish causality the CDC requires autopsies to rule out any possible etiology of death before the agency will place culpability on the vaccine But the CDC uses a very different standard when it comes to identifying people who died from COVID The 986 000 COVID deaths reported by the CDC here are as footnote 1 indicates Deaths with confirmed or presumed emphasis added COVID 19 If a person dies with a positive PCR test or is presumed to have COVID the CDC will count that as COVID 19 death Note that in the CDC s definition a COVID fatality does not mean the person died from the disease only with the disease Why is an

to SARS CoV 2 prior to a death sufficient to establish causality but recent exposure to a vaccine considered coincidental 2 CDC uses VAERS data to investigate myocarditis yet claims VAERS data on vaccine deaths is unreliable On June 23 2021 the CDC s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met to assess the risk of peri myocarditis following COVID vaccination especially in young males This was the key slide in this presentation The observed risk of myocarditis is 219 in about 4 3 million second doses of COVID vaccine in males 18 to 24 years old The CDC is fine with using VAERS data to assess risk of myocarditis following vaccination yet the agency rejects all but nine of the 26 699 reports of deaths following the vaccines Why does the CDC trust the peri myocarditis data in VAERS but not the data on deaths One reason may be because the onset of myocarditis symptoms is closely tied to the time of vaccination In other words because this condition closely follows inoculation the two events are highly correlated and suggestive of causation For example here is another slide from the same presentation The majority of cases of vaccine induced peri myocarditis suffered symptoms within the first few days after injection As explained above this is highly suggestive of a causative effect of the vaccine A recent study in The Lancet included a similar graph taken directly from VAERS on deaths following vaccination Once again the event death closely follows vaccination in the majority of cases As we regard the two graphs above we should acknowledge that the temporal relationship between the injection and the adverse event is suggestive of causation but does not stand as proof of such However it is also important to note that if the vaccination caused the deaths that is exactly what the plot would look like It should be clear that the CDC has no justification for dismissing VAERS deaths if the agency is willing to accept reports of myo pericarditis from the very same reporting system 3 CDC pushes relative risk for determining vaccine efficacy but uses absolute risk to downplay risk of adverse events In Pfizer s Phase 3 trial nine times more placebo

reduction of 90 This seemed an encouraging finding and was used as a major talking point to compel the public to accept this experimental therapy despite the absence of any long term data However the risk of a trial participant contracting severe COVID Table S5 was 1 in 21 314 0 0047 if they were vaccinated If they received the placebo the risk was still only 9 in 21 259 0 0423 The vaccine reduced the absolute risk of contracting severe disease by 0 038 Mainstream media and the CDC never mentioned the minuscule reduction in absolute risk of contracting severe COVID by getting inoculated Moreover with 0 6 of vaccine recipients in the trial suffering a serious vaccine injury one that results in death medical or surgical intervention hospitalization or an impending threat to life approximately 16 serious adverse events will result for every serious case of COVID prevented by vaccination However when it comes to risk of myo pericarditis the CDC states Myocarditis and pericarditis have rarely been reported especially in adolescents and young adult males within several days after COVID 19 vaccination The CDC further states While absolute risk remains small the risk for myocarditis is higher for males ages 12 to 39 years In other words the risk of adverse events is being considered in absolute terms not relative The CDC presentation slide above Table 1 indicates the relative risk of contracting myo pericarditis in males 18 to 24 is 27 to more than 200 times higher than expected in unvaccinated young men that age When assuaging the public s fear around vaccine induced myocarditis the CDC finds it useful to cite absolute risk yet when promoting the efficacy of the vaccine the CDC emphasizes relative risks This double standard has been quietly and masterfully employed to reduce vaccine hesitancy and encourage compliance 4 FDA requires randomized control studies for early treatment medications but not for boosters The CDC reports that as of April 8 98 3 million Americans had received a COVID booster On March 29 the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA authorized a second booster for the immunocompromised and adults over age 50 These authorizations were made not because of solid evidence the boosters are effective but rather to remedy the fact that the primary vaccine series has been widely shown to have waning efficacy within a few months As

March 29 the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA authorized a second booster for the immunocompromised and adults over age 50 These authorizations were made not because of solid evidence the boosters are effective but rather to remedy the fact that the primary vaccine series has been widely shown to have waning efficacy within a few months As reported by The Defende r Dr Peter Marks director of the FDA s vaccine division Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research admitted the fourth booster dose approved last week was a stopgap measure in other words a temporary measure to be implemented until a proper solution may be found in the future Despite the lack of solid evidence the FDA continues to recommend and authorize boosters Yet when it comes to early treatment options the agency holds medicines including those the agency has already licensed and approved for other uses to a different standard In this CNN interview from August 2021 Dr Anthony Fauci head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases warns people not to take ivermectin for COVID because there is no clinical evidence that this works With regard to hydroxychloroquine Fauci said We know that every single good study and by good study I mean randomized control study in which the data are firm and believable has s shown that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of Covid 19 as reported by the BBC on July 29 2020 Where then are the randomized control studies in which the data are firm and believable that show boosters are effective at preventing COVID There aren t any None have been done As of today the FDA still refuses to authorize the use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID despite hundreds of studies that demonstrate significant benefits ivermectin hydroxychloroquine in prevention as well as early and late treatment The double standard here is blatant There are no randomized control studies that show boosters are effective in preventing COVID Nevertheless these experimental therapies have the FDA s blessing while inexpensive highly effective safe and proven medicines are ignored despite the enormous evidence that supports their use 5 FDA uses immunobridging to justify Pfizer shots for young kids but rejects antibodies as indicative of immune protection from COVID Immunobridging is a method of inferring a vaccine s

indicates when an individual is protected from infection Nevertheless the FDA used immunobridging as a means to justify authorization of the Pfizer vaccine to children ages 5 to 11 as explained in The Defender here and here Because there were no deaths or serious cases of COVID in the pediatric trial the FDA chose to reject its own position and that of its advisory committee regarding antibody titers as a correlate for vaccine efficacy 6 Causation must be proven for vaccine injuries but correlation suffices for proving vaccine efficacy When it comes to vaccine injuries the public is often reminded that correlation does not equal causation In other words just because an injury was preceded by inoculation doesn t mean the vaccine caused the injury But what constitutes causation in medicine A mechanism of action needs to be identified and pathological studies must confirm this mechanism while eliminating other potential causative factors Causation can be proven only on a case by case basis Proving causation requires an enormous burden of proof in medicine For example does smoking cause lung cancer The answer is yes it can That doesn t mean that it will However when it comes to the benefit of medical intervention such as a vaccine causation does not have to be established Correlation suffices In the COVID vaccine trials fewer vaccinated people contracted COVID than unvaccinated ones Yet there were those who received the vaccine who contracted the disease anyway To be fair this is how all new medical interventions are evaluated The benefit doesn t have to be caused by the vaccine in the strictest sense there just has to be a correlation between vaccination and a relative protective effect The more often this happens the more confident we can be that the outcome wasn t simply a coincidence Likewise when it comes to assessing the harm of medical intervention the most sensible outcome to consider is mortality After all what would be the point of

problem gets brushed aside because there were two deaths from COVID in the placebo arm versus just one in the vaccinated cohort allowing the vaccine manufacturer to claim a 50 efficacy in preventing this outcome However if we attribute a protective benefit to the vaccine in preventing this one fatality we must also conclude that the vaccine was responsible for the extra death when considering mortality from all causes Doing otherwise would be applying yet another double standard How the pandemic could have played out differently To summarize how devastating the use of these double

with Steve Kirsch a former police detective claimed that about 50 of the sudden infant death cases she investigated showed the child had received a vaccination in the previous 48 hours But coroners

least some childhood vaccines for their kids as did nearly 20 of pregnant women who had previously given birth Nearly half 48 of pregnant women who had not previously given birth said they were undecided about childhood vaccination One third 33 of parents of young children said they intended to refuse some or all vaccines on the childhood immunization schedule for their child A total of 174 pregnant women and 1 765 parents of young children participated in the two surveys administered concurrently in April 2024 The study was conducted by five researchers from Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Some experts suggested the survey s results indicate a growing number of new and expectant mothers are questioning the safety efficacy and necessity of vaccines for their kids Prior to the COVID era only a small fraction of parents were questioning the CDC s vaccination schedule less than one in four said Brian Hooker Ph D chief scientific officer for Children s Health Defense CHD I really believe that the message is getting out regarding the actual frequency of vaccine adverse events Hooker who participated earlier this week in a Senate hearing on vaccine injuries said he believes the increase in the number of parents questioning the childhood immunization schedule is partially due to the obvious shortfalls and dangers of COVID 19 shots and also due to the efforts of Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and those working with him In February Kennedy said the U S Department of Health and Human Services will investigate all

Florida based board certified obstetrician gynecologist said the survey s results reflect what she s observed at her practice I can attest to the fact that the majority of my patients of reproductive age have not had any injections since 2021 and early 2022 Biss said Biologist Christina Parks Ph D said the results mirror what she s seen and heard from many mothers and families As the study suggests many mothers are still undecided during pregnancy not because they are opposed to vaccines but because they simply haven t yet had the opportunity or motivation to fully engage with the subject Parks said Parks said that while many new mothers were originally not opposed to vaccinating their children they were completely caught off guard by the number and timing of vaccines their infant receives in such a short span She said They ve told me the sinking feeling they had in the doctor s office was the catalyst for deep research especially if they observed something concerning in their child afterward Thus the active engagement of parents in understanding vaccination is likely the factor driving vaccine hesitancy and or selective refusal Internal medicine doctor Clayton J Baker Jr said that even though public health agencies review of the childhood vaccination schedule is ongoing a growing number of parents are thinking critically about their kids vaccinations What

children vaccinated with the full childhood immunization schedule She said It s important to remember that most mothers don t just accept information at face value They often take what they ve heard

vaccination Researchers also noted increased risks of several autoimmune conditions especially after booster doses You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A large scale peer reviewed South Korean study has found significantly increased risks of serious cardiac and neurological conditions following mRNA COVID 19 vaccination and lesser risks of several autoimmune diseases The nationwide population based cohort study published Tuesday in Nature Communications followed nearly 4 5 million people for an average of 15 months after vaccination Researchers found a striking 620 increased risk of myocarditis and 175 increased risk of pericarditis in people who received the vaccine compared to historical controls The study also revealed a 62 increased risk for Guillain Barré syndrome GBS a rare neurological disorder The researchers did not highlight the the cardiac and GBS risks but only used the data to confirm the validity of their study design which focused on determining the risks of autoimmune diseases associated with mRNA COVID 19 vaccines The researchers found a 16 increased chance of systemic lupus erythematosus SLE the most common lupus type and a 58 higher risk of bullous pemphigoid BP large fluid filled blisters The study also revealed that booster shots were associated with slightly increased risks of several autoimmune connective tissue diseases AI CTDs including alopecia areata patchy hair loss psoriasis scaly inflamed skin and rheumatoid arthritis Given that the risk of SLE and BP was increased in certain demographic conditions such as age and sex long term monitoring is necessary after mRNA vaccination for the development of AI CTDs the study authors noted Brian Hooker Ph D chief scientific officer at Children s Health Defense CHD noted how the authors minimized the most alarming data but told The Defender the study was otherwise very robust Hooker said several other studies also show relationships between autoimmune disorders including systemic lupus and mRNA vaccination The Nature Communications article follows another South Korean study published in May that found significant increases in the incidence of Alzheimer s disease and mild cognitive impairment following COVID 19 mRNA vaccination One of largest studies of its kind The South Korean study one of the largest of its kind examined the

adults completed the primary COVID 19 series by October 2022 the researchers studied the health history of the control cohort for the two year period prior to their first vaccine dose up to Dec 31 2020 just before the vaccine rollout The vaccination group was observed through Dec 31 2022 Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist at CHD criticized the observation period for the historical control group pointing out that this timeframe bridges the first year of the SARS CoV 2 pandemic This makes it impossible or really darn difficult to disentangle results based on vaccination or infection he told The Defender Ideally this study would include a contemporary unvaccinated cohort for scientific examination However the researchers chose not to study unvaccinated people due to concerns over inappropriate cohort selection and potential selection bias The mean follow up times were 471 24 66 16 days for the vaccination cohort and 471 28 66 15 days for the historical control cohort The researchers used comprehensive demographic data and healthcare records from the National Health Insurance Service NHIS and Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency KDCA databases which cover over 99 of the South Korean population They attributed disease conditions when confirmed by the corresponding International Classification of Diseases ICD 10 diagnostic codes through at least three inpatient or outpatient visits during the observation period To ensure fair comparisons between the vaccinated group and the historical control group researchers used statistical methods to balance out differences in Age and sex Income levels and place of residence Health habits like smoking and drinking Existing health conditions from high blood pressure to HIV They also accounted for changes over time such as when people got booster shots High risk of myocarditis in women among key findings The researchers used their assessment of increased risks for myocarditis pericarditis and

cases 62 increased risk Hooker told The Defender he found it odd that increased risks for these control sequelae were treated in passing It s like Oh everyone knows that these vaccines cause myocarditis pericarditis and GBS ho hum If you have that adverse event oh well too bad for you Jablonowski said that given the extreme risk increase of myocarditis from vaccination found in the study it was stunning that neither the paper s title nor abstract even mentioned it He attributed the exclusion to the changing scope of censorship in science He said We know that myocarditis is most often the result of the second mRNA dose Figure 5 of the paper further verifies this as column C denotes a 9 17 times increase in myocarditis for those who receive only mRNA vaccinations as opposed to 2 91 times increase in myocarditis for those who are cross vaccinated with mRNA and non mRNA vaccines Jablonowski highlighted the paper s confirmation of other studies showing people younger than 40 are nearly twice as likely to develop myocarditis as those over 40 12 53 times increased risk versus 6 18 times But he was surprised by the study s findings that females are nearly twice as likely to develop myocarditis as males 10 53 times increased risk versus 5 26 times To my knowledge this has never been shown in any population before Regarding the study s primary stated purpose the researchers found that mRNA vaccination did not increase the risk of most autoimmune connective tissue diseases However they identified a statistically significant 16 increased risk of systemic lupus

recommended three weeks apart and two Moderna doses four weeks apart Booster shots may increase amount of free floating DNA in key immune cells The researchers wrote that the association between mRNA vaccination and SLE remains unclear but they admitted that vaccine associated SLE has been found in other studies The researchers noted that mRNA vaccines may increase levels of certain antibodies in

amount of free floating DNA in key immune cells This could potentially disrupt normal immune function Hooker said that Mechanisms regarding innate immune activation via DAMPS damage associated molecular patterns have been proposed for these relationships between mRNA vaccines and autoimmune disorders like SLE This process involves cells releasing bits of their own DNA and other molecules

surrounding the COVID 19 pandemic Issues ranged from COVID 19 s origins to how taxpayers money was spent to how well government officials cooperated with the investigation Here are seven highlights from the report 1 The COVID virus most likely resulted from a lab leak The virus that spurred the COVID 19 pandemic most likely resulted from gain of function research conducted at a lab in Wuhan China the press release stated The congressional investigators listed the five strongest arguments in favor of the lab leak theory The virus possesses a biological characteristic that is not found in nature Data shows that all COVID 19 cases stem from a single introduction into humans This runs contrary to previous pandemics where there were multiple spillover events Wuhan is home to China s foremost SARS research lab which has a history of conducting gain of function research at inadequate biosafety levels Wuhan Institute of Virology WIV researchers were sick with a COVID like virus in the fall of 2019 months before COVID 19 was discovered at the wet market By nearly all measures of science if there was evidence of a natural origin it would have already surfaced The report said that the EcoHealth Alliance headed by virologist Peter Daszak used U S taxpayer dollars to facilitate gain of function research in Wuhan China EcoHealth Alliance is a nonprofit that received millions in taxpayer funded NIH grants including at least one involving gain of function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology The report cited multiple failures by the NIH and EcoHealth including how NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID headed by Dr Anthony Fauci failed to oversee EcoHealth s work and how EcoHealth failed to timely report a dangerous experiment to the NIH HHS in May suspended EcoHealth Alliance s government funding after the committee released evidence that the nonprofit had violated the terms of its NIH grant 2 Extended school closures lockdowns unsupported by science Closing schools and keeping them closed long term was unsupported by available science and evidence The report pointed out that early data from Wuhan China showed that children were unlikely to become seriously ill or die from COVID 19 That was later confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which reported that children made up less than 0 01 of

The report also cited data showing that school closures were unlikely to mitigate the spread of COVID 19 The science indicated that schools were not vectors for viral spread the report said The report also discussed how lockdown efforts beyond school closures were unsupported by scientific evidence Lockdowns unnecessarily hurt U S businesses and individual citizens especially kids 3 Fauci said the 6 feet apart recommendation just appeared Masking and social distancing recommendations lacked conclusive evidence showing they helped curb the spread of COVID 19 During the pandemic public health officials were flip flopping on the efficacy of masks without providing scientific data they noted Forcibly masking young kids ages 2 and up caused more harm than good the report said Fauci said during a closed door testimony that the social distancing guidance of remaining 6 feet apart sort of just appeared 4 U S government is failing those injured by COVID vaccines The committee members analyzed how well the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program CICP the government s mechanism for responding to people injured by a COVID 19 shot is functioning They concluded that CICP is failing to efficiently fairly and transparently adjudicate claims for COVID 19 vaccine injuries CICP operates under HHS Creating a robust and transparent vaccine injury compensation program is needed The report explained Regardless of any claims that COVID 19 vaccines are particularly dangerous it appears that the federal government mandated them without an adequate system in place to adjudicate the inevitable injuries they cause This may have significant effects on the trust of the public and damage confidence in vaccines The report authors said it s not anti vax to debate or discuss vaccine injury It s especially paradoxical to label someone injured by the COVID 19 vaccine as anti vax This divisive language they wrote was a critical misstep of the COVID 19 vaccination campaign which alienated and dismissed people who had experienced rare but life altering adverse reactions to the vaccine 5 HHS obfuscated evidence HHS officials in the Biden administration deliberately obfuscated

destroyed sensitive emails from his private Gmail account that contained messages between Fauci and Daszak A memo and over 150 emails obtained by the committee show that Morens spent considerable time and energy avoiding the Freedom of Information Act FOIA a law that requires federal agency records to be provided to the public on request with limited exceptions In addition to deleting sensitive emails Morens worked with an NIAID administrator in the FOIA office to strategically misspell keywords that the public might request to be searched the committee alleges The committee said in its press release that Morens likely lied to Congress on multiple occasions unlawfully deleted federal COVID 19 records and shared nonpublic information about NIH grant processes with Daszak 7 Daszak also

hospital acquired pneumonia which he said she likely developed during a previous hospital stay Kory said The causative organism was a highly antibiotic resistant E coli superbug which she contracted during the first hospital ICU intensive care unit stay This went largely unrecognized and poorly treated during the second hospital stay because they began to tunnel in by blaming measles for her worsening pneumonia and repeatedly writing in the chart that she was unvaccinated Of the eight days she spent in the second hospital visit the child was given antibiotics for only four days Not until two days before her death did the thought of a possible hospital acquired infection creep into the records The bug was utterly resistant to the antibiotics they put her on If the hospital staff had

was hospitalized at UMC Daisy was admitted to Covenant Children s Hospital the same hospital where a 6 year old girl died in February after developing pneumonia following a measles diagnosis However the 8 year old s medical records all pertain to the care she received at UMC Kory Hooker Edwards and Humphries were not able to review Covenant Children s Hospital records The Defender asked Covenant Health s Senior Media Community Relations Manager Meredith Cunningham to comment on the care Daisy received at Covenant Children s Hospital Cunningham said patient privacy laws prevent the hospital from sharing details on patient care The Defender also reached out to UMC Health System s Vice President Chief Experience Officer Aaron Davis for comment on Daisy s UMC medical records but did not receive a response by the deadline However in a statement provided to The Washington Post on April 6 Davis confirmed the child died at UMC According to Kory and Hooker Daisy was admitted twice to UMC in March Her first visit began March 21 when she was admitted to the emergency room ER with diagnoses of community acquired pneumonia a urinary tract infection and dehydration Hooker said Kory said she was also diagnosed with hypoxia or low blood oxygen levels At admittance to the hospital s main pediatrics ward staff noted the child had a prior diagnosis of mononucleosis from a positive test for Epstein Barr virus that was done before she went to UMC She also had a prior diagnosis of sepsis at admittance However she tested negative for sepsis at UMC On March 24 she tested positive for measles using a PCR test A rash was noted on the torso and face during this admission but also oral thrush Kory said According to the Mayo Clinic oral thrush occurs when the fungus Candida albicans builds up in the mouth Kory said the child s oral thrush was worrisome because it is a sign of immunosuppression The Mayo Clinic states", "chunk_id":

it s more likely to occur in babies and older adults because they have lower immunity It s also more likely to occur in other people with weakened immune systems or certain health conditions or people who take certain medicines Oral thrush is a minor problem if you re healthy But if you have a weakened immune system symptoms may be more serious and harder to control Later she was transferred to the hospital s ICU The hospital staff gave her antibiotics and oxygen to address her pneumonia and low blood oxygen She began to improve On March 24 she was sent home Child returns to UMC put on steroids as antibiotics are halted Three days later on March 27 Daisy was readmitted to UMC after her parents brought her to the ER with a cough fever of up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit and shortness of breath The problems start here said Kory referring to her treatment when she was admitted the second time to UMC The admitting doctor s diagnosis was pneumonitis and antibiotics were quickly stopped after admission Kory said The records suggest that the hospital staff assumed her pneumonitis or lung inflammation was due to a measles infection Hooker said Because measles is a virus doctors presumably did not immediately consider the possibility that her lung inflammation may have been caused by a bacterial infection Kory gave a rundown of what occurred over the days leading up to the child s death on April 3 The doctors first put Daisy on high dose steroids without putting her on anti infectives According to Drugs com anti infectives is a general term that describes any medicine that is capable of inhibiting the spread of an infectious organism or by killing the infectious organism outright Kory said the high dose steroid might have been safe and beneficial if paired with appropriate anti infectives but prescribing steroids without anti infectives was a lousy idea Kory Hooker and Humphries all confirmed that the child did not at any point receive budesonide a steroid used to relieve

caused by measles even though on day four she decompensated in respiratory status Kory said On day four the child s white blood cell count WBC shot up to 13 from 4 5 and then on day six it went up to 27 Kory said A classic measles pneumonia has normal or low white blood cell count Kory said It was wild that they ignored such a high white count It is possible they dismissed it as a result of the steroids but for a seasoned ICU doctor I never attribute WBCs over 20 to steroids They tried everything to oxygenate her but all efforts failed On day six staff intubated the girl and restarted her on antibiotics On day seven staff somewhat correctly broadened the kind of antibiotic they were giving the child to include ceftazidime Kory said However the adult guidelines would have dictated imipenem which the bug she died from was sensitive to Sadly the type of bacteria causing her pneumonia was resistant to ceftazidime Kory said According to Kory s analysis of the records the child s attending doctor wrote on the day before her death that she was experiencing severe pulmonary sequela of measles infection around 3 weeks ago The attending doctor added We are concerned that the true extent of her lung injury d t due to measles is unknowable and it may be an end stage process given the span of illness and the fact she truly is an outlier On day eight Daisy died of refractory hypoxemia

care Anytime we admit someone to a hospital and we re starting them on antibiotics especially broad ones you send cultures so that you can identify what the organism is so that you can then narrow and target the exact organism Kory said Hooker agreed He told The Defender that while it may be true that the child had some residual viral pneumonia due to her measles infection the problem was the bacterial pneumonia that she likely picked up during her first stay in the ICU Hooker criticized UMC staff for an apparent lack of curiosity about figuring out early on what types of pneumonia the girl had via a sputum culture He noted that the test results showing that the girl had E coli bacteria in her lungs did not come back until 10 p m on April 2 By that time she was already on a

samples were all collected on school grounds raising concerns among environmental and health advocates about safety risks for children and other vulnerable community members You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Shannon Kelleher Almost 80 of air samples collected last year in California s four most agriculture intensive communities contained pesticide residues though the concentrations were unlikely to be harmful to human health according to a recently released state regulatory report The California Department of Pesticide Regulation CDPR collected 207 air samples at stations in Oxnard Santa Maria Shafter and Watsonville once a week throughout 2023 finding at least one of the 40 pesticides they tested for in 163 of the samples according to the results The monitoring stations detected a total of 19 different pesticides in the air samples including the herbicide pendimethalin and the fumigant 1 3 dichloropronene Telone which have both been linked to cancer These chemicals and others detected by CDPR have also been linked to nausea shortness of breath and eye and respiratory irritation Despite being banned in 34 countries Telone is the third most heavily used pesticide in California and CDPR has been criticized for failing to implement regulations that adequately protect mostly Latino farmworkers from the chemical The samples were all collected on school grounds raising concerns among environmental and health advocates about safety risks for children and other vulnerable community members The latest air sampling results continue to show pesticides sprayed on fields drift off site and contaminate the air nearby a serious concern for those who live go to school or work near farm fields Alexis Temkin a senior toxicologist at the Environmental Working Group EWG said in a press release Some pesticides can drift several miles from fields putting many people at risk including farm workers and vulnerable populations like young children pregnant people and the elderly said Temkin None of the pesticides in the 2023 air samples were detected at concentrations at or above the levels CDPR considers threatening to public health CDPR said The detections of pesticides below health protective targets do not indicate risks for people living working or going to school near agricultural fields the state agency said Despite detecting the presence of pesticides in the majority of samples the agency issued a press release earlier this month stating that 95 of all samples analyses had no detectable pesticides The way the

cardiaques qui rapportait que les médecins disent qu ils voient un nombre alarmant de patients apparemment en bonne santé faire des crises cardiaques et que ces patients sont de plus en plus jeunes Le rapport note que plus de 10 des patients ayant subi une crise cardiaque ne présentaient aucun facteur de risque connu comme l obésité ou le tabagisme Selon Today des médecins de l hôpital Mount Sinai de New York suivent les patients pour voir s ils peuvent découvrir les nouveaux facteurs de risque à l origine de cette tendance et percer le mystère des jeunes crises cardiaques Le rapport suggère plusieurs facteurs de risque notamment l épidémie d obésité et l inflammation qui couve depuis longtemps bien que Brand ait noté que Today n a pas suggéré ce qui pourrait être à l origine de l

after the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP in 2023 recommended them for childhood obesity according to a new study published in the AAP s flagship journal Pediatrics GLP 1 drugs typically used to treat obesity or diabetes include the blockbuster drugs Ozempic Wegovy Mounjaro and Saxenda Of those only Wegovy and Saxenda are approved for children However several lesser known GLP 1 drugs can be prescribed off label for children Researchers with the health data and analytics company Truveta analyzed more than 310 000 health records They found that prescriptions for GLP 1 drugs for children and teens ages 8 17 increased 65 immediately following AAP s recommendation and another 5 per month after that Axios reported The researchers found that before the AAP recommendation the diabetes drug metformin was by far the most prescribed medication for weight loss in kids However after the new guidelines prescriptions for semaglutide the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic surged and prescriptions for metformin dropped No long term safety data The authors of the study highlighted the lack of safety data on GLP 1 drugs and children Research about the safety profile of newer GLP 1 medications for adolescents is needed to support informed decision making about obesity pharmacotherapy they wrote They said safety concerns are particularly salient in the era of robust social media discourse and direct to consumer advertisement of GLP 1 medications Pediatrician Michelle Perro author of What s Making Our Children Sick How Industrial Food Is Causing an Epidemic of Chronic Illness and What Parents and Doctors Can Do About It said the surge in prescriptions is concerning for several reasons First and foremost there is no long term safety data she said Additionally this approach relies on overmedicalization of obesity and dependence on pharmaceuticals rather than addressing the root causes of obesity Children who do lose weight on the drugs often suffer profound muscle loss

AAP recommendations increase prescriptions in an exploding drug market About 20 of U S children and adolescents are chronically obese according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The authors said one of the motivations for the study was that when the AAP began recommending weight loss drugs people in the clinical and public health communities raised concerns about how the drugs would affect children s health The U S Food and Drug Administration FDA approved Saxenda to treat obesity in kids 12 and up in December 2020 and Wegovy in December 2022 Weeks later in January 2023 the AAP issued new guidelines on childhood obesity recommending early diagnosis and aggressive treatment The AAP recommendations included weight loss drugs for obese children as young as 8 and consultation for bariatric surgery for children with severe obesity as young as age 13 The guidelines also recommend nutrition counseling as a first line treatment but the study didn t identify any increase in nutrition counseling or referrals that correlated with the change in guidelines At the time the new guidelines were the AAP s first update in 15 years Market forecast to reach 150 billion per year by 2030 GLP 1 drugs work by making people feel full so they eat less The drugs are effective at helping people to lose weight However the self administered weekly injections work only as long as the patient keeps taking them otherwise the weight comes back Research shows that patients who take the drugs long term risk exposing themselves to a host of side effects ranging from vomiting diarrhea and nausea to fainting andserious issues like pancreatitis stomach paralysis and kidney disease In clinical trials 9 in 10 people experienced side effects According to one study Ozempic increases the risk of thyroid cancer by 50 75 As Perro noted there are no long term studies on the effects of the drugs in adults or children a problem experts say because children will have to take

the latest media coverage of vaccines An attorney associated with Robert F Kennedy Jr on Wednesday accused mainstream media of deliberately stoking fear and outrage about vaccines in an attempt to derail Donald Trump s nomination of Kennedy for secretary of the U S Department of Health and Human Services In an op ed published in The Wall Street Journal Aaron Siri said a recent New York Times report mischaracterized three narrow petitions his firm filed with the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA The petitions raised concerns about specific versions of three different vaccines including one polio vaccine Contrary to the Times headline Kennedy s Lawyer Has Asked the F D A to Revoke Approval of the Polio Vaccine the petitions did not ask the FDA to revoke the polio or any other vaccine The Times also wrongly implied that Siri filed the petitions on behalf of Kennedy The attempts to stoke fear are based on legal work I did for a different client which I never discussed with Mr Kennedy Siri wrote Although Siri said he has worked for Kennedy including representing Kennedy s presidential campaign he filed the FDA petitions on behalf of another client Informed Consent Action Network ICAN Siri explained that one of the petitions he filed on behalf of ICAN related to IPOL one of six polio containing vaccines currently licensed by the FDA The drug protects people from severe symptoms but does not stop transmission Citing FDA documents Siri wrote that IPOL was licensed for children based on a clinical trial with no control group and only three days of safety review after injection That is patently insufficient to determine possible effects on growing children he said Most drugs go through multiyear placebo controlled trials ICAN s petition asked the FDA to require a proper trial for IPOL especially given that under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 IPOL s manufacturer Sanofi is protected from liability for injuries caused by the vaccine Siri wrote

into babies should reflect what is in the vial It is hard to see how anyone can read these petitions and not share these concerns Since Congress passed the 1986 act the number of vaccines the CDC recommends for children during their first year of life has jumped from three to 29 Siri wrote During that time rates of chronic diseases among children have skyrocketed Siri concluded We must be able to raise valid questions about vaccines without fear that anyone who deviates from the accepted orthodoxy will be smeared as a radical There are many issues that divide Americans but drug and vaccine

assertions untrue or misleading denied their claims about retaliation and said the company stands behind the quality and safety of all our products including those made at Sturgis In a statement a spokesperson said that since 2022 the company had increased plant staff by 300 people spent 60 million on upgrades and stationed multiple food safety consultants there on weekdays The company said the

instead of retrieving a portable pump an employee used a piece of cardboard from a trash bin to funnel coconut oil a formula ingredient into a tank during production of the company s Pure Bliss by Similac Organic brand Abbott said the cardboard was reactively used to prevent spilling onto the floor The company denied that there was a trash receptacle in the area and said plant practice was for cardboard to be stacked on a pallet before being recycled Food safety laws require companies to use clean tools to transfer ingredients not a makeshift implement like cardboard said Patrick Stone a former FDA inspector who works as a consultant No one would think that s a proper use he said It s not something that s been cleaned and verified it s clear of contamination Abbott however downplayed

lot The brand is advertised as suitable for newborns In another incident in February an employee said that the company had signed off on the use of an amino acid that was 10 months past its manufacturer s best by date A photo of the label viewed by ProPublica showed a best by date of April 2024 The law requires that ingredients in the formula not expire before the formula as a whole Stone said Abbott said that the powder s expiration date had been extended which it said regulations permit in some cases after the company used third party testing to confirm its nutrient levels But the worker said the amino acid powder was chunky and employees refused to add it to a formula mixture It had been manufactured in October 2023 Abbott told ProPublica that two containers of amino acid mix were in fact placed on hold due to crustiness and later destroyed When we find products that don t meet all specifications we dispose of them the company said Some of the workers said they ve felt pressure not to disrupt the manufacturing process At one meeting in February a worker said a senior manager told employees the plant needed to improve its profit margins by either increasing production or reducing the amount of formula it discarded as unusable Abbott disputed the idea that it is cutting corners to make more formula Any assertion that quality is being sacrificed at the

December 2022 the FDA issued a citation that noted concerns related to contamination prevention worker hygiene and the handling of consumer complaints documents say A report from that inspection completed just seven months after Abbott signed the consent decree said the agency found problems similar to those that had shut down the plant The report noted among other things six instances of

agenda puzzling The Guardian cited Dr Paul Offit director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children s Hospital of Philadelphia who suggested there was no point in discussing thimerosal In a post on X Tuesday Kennedy responded to a report by The Guardian last week characterizing thimerosal as safe noting that thimerosal s label advises against its use during pregnancy and that thimerosal has never been shown to be safe Redwood s presentation noted that thimerosal was first used as a vaccine preservative in the 1930s without any studies demonstrating its safety The U S Food and Drug Administration FDA later grandfathered thimerosal as an approved vaccine ingredient without performing adequate safety testing Redwood said thimerosal has a 49 6 concentration of mercury the third most toxic element for humans and that thimerosal levels in flu vaccines are 250 times higher than the U S Environmental Protection Agency s EPA safety limit Thimerosal can cross the placenta and blood brain barriers and converts to inorganic mercury in the brain Redwood said noting that infants young children older adults pregnant women and fetuses are particularly vulnerable to its effects Redwood RFK Jr push back at media claims that thimerosal is proven safe Redwood s presentation and Kennedy s X post also addressed the mainstream media s narratives by citing several studies that have demonstrated thimerosal s risks to human health This included a 2001 Institute of Medicine report finding that the link between thimerosal and the rise of neurological conditions in children including autism is biologically plausible The report recommended the termination of all vaccines containing thimerosal Redwood cited a 2005 primate

purchasing vaccines The U S Food and Drug Administration earlier this month approved Merck s RSV shot clesrovimab which will be marketed as Enflonsia It joins two other recently approved RSV drugs One is Sanofi and AstraZeneca s monoclonal antibody shot for infants Beyfortus nirsevimab The other is Pfizer s RSV vaccine Abrysvo for pregnant mothers Data presented by the CDC during Wednesday s ACIP meeting reassured committee members that the recently approved RSV interventions were safe and effective However an analysis of the CDC s Vaccine Safety Datalink for the 2023 2024 respiratory season revealed an association between Abrysvo and an increased risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy which include gestational hypertension preeclampsia eclampsia and HELLP syndrome a life threatening pregnancy complication Presenters repeatedly emphasized that RSV a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild cold like symptoms but can be serious in infants is the leading cause

If any other country was doing this to us it would be considered an act of war We ve got to do something about it Price who is 18 years old said American food manufacturers are using tactics that Big Tobacco pioneered to market harmful products to youth My generation is so clearly being targeted by these Big Food companies she said U S food companies using toxic ingredients that are banned overseas Hari told Kelly that American food manufacturers use thousands of ingredients they don t include in identical products sold in other countries Right now American food companies are using toxic ingredients that in other countries are either banned or regulated differently in the same exact products that they serve American citizens Hari said Hari cited McDonald s French fries which she said contain 11 ingredients in the U S but only three in other countries and Skittles which uses 10 different artificial food dyes in the U S and titanium dioxide which is banned in Europe because it can cause DNA damage Hari also singled out Kellogg s for targeting little children after pledging in 2015 to remove artificial food dyes from its cereal products by 2018 But they never did she said

Hari said There are thousands of chemicals that have not even been reviewed by the FDA U S Food and Drug Administration at all Hari said They ve been literally just slid right into the food system without anybody knowing what the risks are what the safety data looks like Hari said the skyrocketing rates of disease including cancer are related to a lot of these additives She cited the neon food coloring in Froot Loops cereal used as a marketing tool to make the cereal more attractive to U S children but which is contributing to obesity Hari also cited the dangers of glyphosate the active ingredient in the widely used herbicide Roundup produced by Monsanto now owned by Bayer which has been linked to human health risks It s pervasive and unfortunately it s making its way into every single thing we eat Hari said It s in wheat it s in oats you re finding it in all major products like Cheerios Glyphosate has now been implicated to cause non Hodgkin lymphoma bladder cancer autoimmune disorders leaky gut fertility issues Hari said There s so many things that can be linked back to the uses of glyphosate in our environment And it s literally ending up in breast milk and

They used the same kinds of tactics that they had deployed with all of their tobacco industry product development for these foods Price said tobacco companies would target kids by putting these signs

ingredients in foods adversely affect childhood development Price said Price said baby formula contains highly reactive easily oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from seed oils These fats

Insider to save this article Sign Up Children who addictively used social media or cellphones were two to three times more likely to report suicidal ideation or behavior than their peers according to a study published June 18 in JAMA What surprised researchers most was that screen time alone didn t predict mental health issues said Yunyu Xiao Ph D lead author of the peer reviewed study and assistant professor of psychiatry and population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medical College It is not the total amount of time spent on screens that predicts suicide related behaviors or mental health issues Xiao told The Defender Instead it s the quality and emotional dependence on screen use not the quantity that matters most Will U S issue parental advisory for social media The study s publication came one day after the Dutch government advised parents to keep kids younger than 15 off social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram due to physical and psychological problems including depression panic attacks and poor sleep When asked if she thought the U S should issue a similar advisory Xiao said It s an important question since the study showed that addictive use behaviors common on platforms with endless scroll algorithmic content and social validation features can increase mental health risk during a sensitive developmental window The U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS has not issued parental guidelines similar to the Dutch advisory However HHS Press Secretary Vianca N Rodriguez Feliciano said the recent Make America Healthy Again MAHA report acknowledged research linking social media to heightened mental health issues including emotional distress Rodriguez Feliciano said HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr is deeply committed to

long term study of brain development and child health Kids were ages 9 or 10 when they joined the ABCD Study Each year from 2016 to 2022 the children completed a survey about their cellphone social media and video game use The survey assessed the kids addictive use by asking them to rate how strongly they agreed with statements such as I feel the need to use social media apps more and more The thought of being without my phone makes me feel distressed and I play video games so I can forget about my problems The researchers used statistical analysis to identify trends which they called trajectories in the kids digital behavior to see if those trends were linked to mental health issues According to the report Almost 1 in 2 youths had a high addictive use trajectory for mobile phones and more than 40 had a high addictive use trajectory for video games Many others had increasing addictive use over the 4 year observation period that ended with high addictive use almost 1 in 3 had this trajectory for social media and 1 in 4 for mobile phones Both high and increasing addictive use trends of social media and cellphones were linked with two to three times greater risks of suicidal ideation and behaviors compared with the low addictive use trend For video games they found that the high addictive trend was also linked to a higher risk of suicidal ideation and behaviors Researchers said many prior studies focused on tracking screen time while their study was the first to look at kids addictive use of screens The most important takeaway Xiao said is that not all screen time is harmful in fact many young people use screens for creative educational or social purposes without issue However when screen use becomes compulsive interferes with daily life and is difficult to control it can signal a mental health risk The authors noted that the study uses self reported data which some researchers have found to be more susceptible to bias than other types of

particularly pronounced in girls 65 of whom are distressed or struggling in a manner that substantially impairs their ability to function effectively in the world and rises to the level of clinical concern according to the authors of a study published this month You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Feelings of aggression anger and hallucinations are rising sharply among adolescents in the U S and India and the increase is linked to the progressively younger age at which children are acquiring cellphones according to a new study Researchers with the nonprofit Sapien Labs wrote in their Jan 23 report Swift action is needed to safeguard younger generations from a future marked by increased anger aggression and violence We urge parents at the very least to delay giving their child a smartphone until at least 8th grade or age 13 so as to give them more time to develop healthier social skills and reduce tendencies for anger and aggression The report was based on data from 10 475 adolescents ages 13 17 in the U S and India with roughly 5 000 teens from each country The teens completed an online survey about 47 aspects of their mental health which the researchers called mind health and well being The authors compared the teens results with those of adults They identified three trends in the data 1 Mind health and well being are poorer with each younger generation There is a generational decline in mind health and well being affecting younger and younger people the authors said According to the report Just a few decades ago the relationship between psychological wellbeing and age followed a U shaped curve Younger and older generations had the highest wellbeing with a dip in middle age Recent data from the Global Mind Project and others shows that this curve has now collapsed with mind health and wellbeing now poorer with each successively younger generation In other words teens ages 13 17 fare worse mentally than young adults ages 18 24 who in turn fare worse than 25 to 34 year olds and so on The trend is particularly pronounced in girls the authors said where 65 are distressed or struggling in a manner that substantially impairs their ability to function effectively in the world and would be of clinical concern 2 Teens report a sense of detachment from reality hallucinations and more Nearly half of the teens ages 13

The authors also found differences when comparing younger and older adolescents Thirteen year olds reported markedly increased feelings of aggression toward others hallucinations anger and irritability compared with 17 year olds This suggests that these problems are rising in younger adolescents the authors wrote They said the magnitude of the increase in aggression across just a five year gap was particularly disturbing The increase in aggression was especially pronounced in females 3 Decline in mind health linked to earlier cellphone use According to the report These rapidly increasing problems of aggression and anger irritability particularly in females can in a large part be attributed to the increasingly younger age at which children are now getting a smartphone The authors pointed out that age differences for aggression anger and irritability rates disappeared from their data when they statistically controlled for the individual s age of owning their first cellphone suggesting that the age at which a child or teen receives a smartphone likely affects the person s level of aggression anger and irritability Altogether they wrote with more children getting their first smartphone at a younger age these findings predict an increasingly violent future for society The 17 year olds in the study reported typically getting a cellphone starting at age 11 or 12 Meanwhile 13 year olds typically reported getting their first cellphone at age 10 The authors acknowledged that it s still not yet fully clear how getting a cellphone at a younger age contributes to a rise in anger aggression and hallucination However they said staring at a cellphone likely exposes children and adolescents to content that s inappropriate for younger audiences and pulls them away from engaging directly with their families friends and the broader community In addition the authors said the numerous hours spent online disturbs sleep and displaces crucial in person interactions

first of its kind study published in Obesity Reviews shows that food and beverage companies undermine the eating habits of young people by deploying ubiquitous ads that encourage poor dietary choices which lead to a higher risk of obesity Type 2 diabetes and other diet related diseases You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Pamela Ferdinand Unhealthy food and beverage companies powerfully undermine the eating habits of young people by deploying ubiquitous ads that encourage poor dietary choices and increase the risk of serious disease and premature death according to a sweeping new study published in Obesity Reviews The first of its kind summary highlights a clear cumulative pattern The more high fat high sugar and salty food ads young people see the more of those products they consume and the higher the risk that they may develop obesity Type 2 diabetes and other diet related diseases Companies also disproportionately target adolescents lower income communities and Black and Latino youth with the marketing of health harming food and beverages Teens and young adults are a formative stage of life when they are highly sensitive to reward cues and peers They are also more likely than other age groups to respond emotionally to brand messaging across advertising platforms that can influence their eating habits preferences and long term health the authors say Stronger regulation of the misleading and ubiquitous marketing of these products targeting young people is urgently needed says co author Nicholas Freudenberg Distinguished Professor of Public Health at CUNY Graduate School of Public Health in New York The review summarizes 25 years of scientific evidence and findings from 108 empirical studies and 19 systematic reviews of unhealthy food marketing to adolescents 13 17 and young adults 18 25 It underscores that the ubiquitous and pervasive broadcast of ads and commercials for fast foods soda energy drinks candy baked goods and other unhealthy foods and beverages have important cognitive behavioral and health influences on young people the authors say Key findings include Increased consumption More than 90 of studies found

person living in a low income area or household or being Black or Latinx was associated with greater exposure to unhealthy food marketing the authors say calling the tactics predatory This type of marketing may be going beyond simple targeted marketing practices since it focuses on foods known to harm health and disproportionately advertises them to groups of young people who are already burdened or at high risk of becoming burdened by chronic diet related diseases Policy gaps and health harming industry power The World Health Organization considers unhealthy food marketing a public health threat and has recommended stronger policies to protect children The city of London for example has banned advertising of unhealthy foods and beverages in the subway and bus system and will ban junk food television ads before 11 p m starting in October Norway earlier this year also banned the marketing of unhealthy food and drinks to children But current research and regulations continue to fall short especially in the U S the review shows To curb harms and limit unhealthy food marketing to youth the researchers urge Expand legal protections to include teens and young adults not just

Virginia Massachusetts In West Virginia a judge dismissed one lawsuit challenging religious exemptions while another judge ruled mandatory school vaccines violated the state s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023 In Massachusetts a grassroots effort prevented a House vote on a bill to remove religious exemptions for schoolchildren You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A West Virginia court last week dismissed a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU which challenged Gov Patrick Morrisey s executive order allowing religious objections to the state s vaccine requirements for school attendance In a July 23 ruling Circuit Judge Kenneth Ballard dismissed the ACLU s lawsuit on procedural grounds ruling that the petitioners failed to meet a legal requirement that they notify the state 30 days in advance of filing the lawsuit The ruling did not address the merits of the complaint The lawsuit filed in May in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County on behalf of two West Virginia parents of immunocompromised children alleged Morrisey did not have the constitutional authority to issue an executive order overriding state school vaccination statutes The executive order issued in January cites the state s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023 It allows parents to request a religious exemption for their children by providing a written statement explaining why they object to the vaccines Morrisey called the ruling against the ACLU the first skirmish of a longer fight West Virginia is a radical outlier when it comes to onerous vaccine mandates one of only five states in the nation without a statutorily based religious exemption he said California Maine New York and Connecticut also prohibit religious or philosophical exemptions to school vaccine mandates Every other state offers a religious or personal exemption to public school vaccine requirements Mary Holland CEO of Children s Health Defense CHD applauded the ruling Being forced to put a man made pharmaceutical product into one s body violates religious freedom and other rights on many grounds she said West Virginia state law requires children to receive vaccines for chickenpox hepatitis B measles meningitis mumps diphtheria polio rubella tetanus and whooping cough before starting school The state does not require COVID 19 shots for kids Chanda Adkins president of West

battle is not over yet but it is headed in the right direction Separate West Virginia ruling favors families seeking religious exemptions In another ruling in West Virginia the Raleigh County Circuit Court on July 24 granted a preliminary injunction to three families challenging the county Board of Education s decision to deny their children the right to attend public school The lawsuit relates to a dispute between Morrisey s executive order and the state Board of Education s subsequent directive to county school systems That directive instructs schools to follow the state s current school vaccination law which does not recognize religious exemptions instead of Morrisey s order In his ruling Circuit Judge Michael Froble said the state s mandatory school vaccine law is invalid because it doesn t contain a religious exemption so it runs afoul of the Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023 according to West Virginia Watch The West Virginia Board of Education said the ruling is limited and applies only to the three families in question The board said it would decide its next steps in the coming days Chris Wiest an attorney for the plaintiffs told West Virginia Watch that the plaintiffs were being forced to either give in to the state s demands of vaccination contrary to their religious beliefs or not send their kids to school which is a guarantee under the West Virginia Constitution for the West Virginia Supreme Court a fundamental right Wiest said this placed a substantial burden on these plaintiffs religious exercise According to West Virginia Watch Morrisey called the ruling another legal victory in the fight for religious freedom Attorney Aaron Siri who has represented claimants across the U S in cases concerning COVID 19 mandates and vaccine injuries is one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs A hearing on a permanent injunction is expected in the coming months Adkins said Morrisey s executive order has already opened the door for hundreds of children to

to Candice Edwards executive director of Health Action Massachusetts the House bill was moved from the Joint Committee on Public Health to the House Steering Policy and Scheduling Committee last week a precursor to sending the bill to the House floor for a vote The Steering Committee doesn t hold hearings or amend bills she said Its main role is to send bills directly to the House floor for a vote often without any further review It s a fast track step in the process bills rarely get redirected to another committee once they re there However in what Kane called a near miracle health and medical freedom advocates launched a campaign to prevent the legislation from going to a vote Phone calls and emails over the past five days stopped that from happening he said of the effort supported by CHD This occurred even though no legislative alert was sent out when the bill moved Edwards said leaving parents in the dark We did not want this to get to a floor vote Edwards said The referral of a bill out of the Steering Committee to another committee rarely happens but we pushed hard and made the case Instead the bill was routed on Wednesday to the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing Edwards

Surveillance of Americans Well before President Donald Trump announced support for Stargate a 500 billion private sector AI project Silicon Valley and the DOD had already teamed up to transform U S healthcare into an AI driven system reliant on the widespread collection of personal healthcare data according to a new investigative report by Unlimited Hangout s Max Jones You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up During a press conference with Silicon Valley luminaries during his second day in office President Donald Trump threw his political support behind a 500 billion private sector artificial intelligence AI project called Stargate The joint venture between OpenAI Oracle SoftBank and others will fund infrastructure for AI Among other things part of that funding will develop AI for early cancer detection and the rapid creation of mRNA cancer vaccines But well before Trump s announcement Silicon Valley and the U S Department of Defense DOD had already teamed up to transform U S healthcare into an AI driven system a system designed to unleash the power of predictive medicine for the early detection and treatment of disease in an individual or population sometimes even before an illness manifests according to a new investigative report by Unlimited Hangout s Max Jones The future of predictive medicine depends on data sharing between the DOD the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS which oversees 13 public health agencies and the private tech sector Jones wrote Predictive medicine will be used for mass surveillance of Americans and will inform future approaches to pandemics Jones reported Jones said that at the heart of this new system is the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics CFA Announced last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC CFA aims to establish a National Weather Service but for infectious diseases using mass data collection to predict and control disease outbreaks The Defender reported To launch the initiative HHS announced an estimated 262 million in grant funding over five years to establish a network of 13 infectious disease forecasting and analytics centers to coordinate this work across the U S Peter Theil s CIA linked data mining firm Palantir will manage the data for the network Jones said The next pandemic will likely utilize the currently expanding biosurveillance infrastructure and AI disease forecasting software to develop targeted policy measures for specific communities and potentially individuals during future pandemics he wrote CFA will focus on building a digital infrastructure to facilitate data sharing across all levels of government and the healthcare center It is also developing interoperable data tools to enable different

the roots of this emerging biosecurity apparatus across multiple government sectors that are building alliances with Silicon Valley For example U S Army Surgeon General Mary K Izaguirre recently met with Stanford scientists and Google executives to be briefed on how AI can revolutionize emergency medicine in the armed forces Big Pharma is also turning toward predictive medicine Jones wrote Pfizer s scientists have promoted the use of AI to predict the next pathogen spillover event and to quickly share disease and intelligence data and to make healthcare delivery more efficient Most importantly for pharma giants like Pfizer better disease surveillance makes it possible for the rapid development of new vaccines for illnesses with pandemic potential Pfizer scientists proposals echo those of global institutions including the World Health Organization WHO and the Gates Foundation backed Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations CEPI which have partnered since 2016 on a research program to speed vaccine development following the declaration of a global pandemic CEPI is collaborating with Harvard Medical School to develop a tool that uses AI to predict the ability of a new virus variant to escape immunity It is also building a Global Vaccine Library that will use AI technology to predict how existing viruses might mutate in order to identify the next vaccine targets To inform its work on medical countermeasures in the U S HHS will use several different biosurveillance programs developed by Palantir Jones reported For example a program called HHS Protect a secretive database that hoards information related to the spread of COVID 19 gathered from more than 225 data sets including demographic statistics community based tests and a wide range of state provided data The database includes private health information Palantir s Gotham software used as the basis for HHS Protect has also been used by police departments across the country for predictive policing

Government and private companies will be using advanced AI tools and other surveillance tech to conduct pervasive and persistent surveillance before during and after the 2024 Paris Olympics You must

of visitors from around the globe converge in France It s not just the eyes of the world that will be watching Artificial intelligence AI systems will be watching too Government and private companies will be using advanced AI tools and other surveillance tech to conduct pervasive and persistent surveillance before during and after the Games The Olympic world stage and international crowds pose increased security risks so significant that in recent years authorities and critics have described the Olympics as the world s largest security operations outside of war The French government hand in hand with the private tech sector has harnessed that legitimate need for increased security as grounds to deploy technologically advanced surveillance and data gathering tools Its surveillance plans to meet those risks including the controversial use of experimental AI video surveillance are so extensive that the country had to change its laws to make the planned surveillance legal The plan goes beyond new AI video surveillance systems According to news reports the prime minister s office has negotiated a provisional decree that is classified to permit the government to significantly ramp up traditional surreptitious surveillance and information gathering tools for the duration of the Games These include wiretapping collecting geolocation communications and computer data and capturing greater amounts of visual and audio data I am a law professor and attorney and I research teach and write about privacy artificial intelligence and surveillance I also provide legal and policy guidance on these subjects to legislators and others Increased security risks can and do require increased surveillance This year France has faced concerns about its Olympic security capabilities and credible threats around public sporting events Preventive measures should be proportional to the risks however Globally critics claim that France is using the Olympics as a surveillance power grab and that the government will use this exceptional surveillance justification to normalize society wide state surveillance At the same time there are legitimate concerns about adequate and effective surveillance for security In the U S for example the nation is asking how the Secret Service s security surveillance failed to prevent an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on July

surveillance They have used the AI surveillance during major concerts sporting events and in metro and train stations during heavy use periods including around a Taylor Swift concert and the Cannes Film Festival French officials said these AI surveillance experiments went well and the lights are green for future uses The AI software in use is generally designed to flag certain events like changes in crowd size and movement abandoned objects the presence or use of weapons a body on the ground smoke or flames and certain traffic violations The goal is for the surveillance systems to immediately in real time detect events like a crowd surging toward a gate or a person leaving a backpack on a crowded street corner and alert security personnel Flagging these events seems like a logical and sensible use of technology But the real privacy and legal questions flow from how these systems function and are being used How much and what types of data have to be collected and analyzed to flag these events What are the systems training data error rates and evidence of bias or inaccuracy What is done with the data after it is collected and who has access to it There s little in the way of transparency to answer these questions Despite safeguards aimed at preventing the use of biometric data that can identify people it s possible the training data captures this information and the systems could be adjusted to use it By giving these private companies access to thousands of video cameras already located throughout France harnessing and coordinating the surveillance

Preparing for the Olympics in 2023 France enacted Law No 2023 380 a package of laws to provide a legal framework for the 2024 Olympics It includes the controversial Article 7 a provision that allows French law enforcement and its tech contractors to experiment with intelligent video surveillance before during and after the 2024 Olympics and Article 10 which specifically permits the use of AI software to review video and camera feeds These laws make France the first EU country to legalize such a wide reaching AI powered surveillance system Scholars civil society groups and civil liberty advocates have pointed out that these articles are contrary to the General Data Protection Regulation and the EU s efforts to regulate AI They argue that Article 7 specifically violates the General Data Protection Regulation s provisions protecting biometric data French officials and tech company representatives have said that the AI software can accomplish its goals of identifying and flagging those specific types of events without identifying people or running afoul of the General Data Protection Regulation s restrictions around the processing of biometric data But European civil rights organizations have pointed out that if the purpose and function of the algorithms and AI driven cameras are to detect specific suspicious events in public spaces these systems will necessarily capture and analyze physiological features and behaviors of people in these spaces These include body positions gait movements gestures and appearance The critics argue that this is biometric data being captured and processed and thus France s law violates the General Data Protection Regulation AI powered security at a cost For the French government and the AI companies so far AI surveillance has been a mutually beneficial success The algorithmic watchers are being used more and give governments and their tech collaborators much more data than humans alone could provide But these AI enabled

Shellenberger said Deep state agencies within the U S government have for two decades sought to gain control over the production of news and other information around the world as part of ongoing covert and overt influence operations Shellenberger described this as a woke reign of terror spanning the last 12 years where people were scared to speak their mind in public and in private The witnesses frequently cited USAID the target of recent cuts by the Trump administration Shellenberger said USAID helped develop censorship structures in countries like Brazil and implemented a broader strategy for information control that included censorship but also taking control of investigative journalism worldwide USAID has been in the process of taking over so called independent investigative journalism around the world Shellenberger said and at the same time training nongovernmental organizations how to demand censorship He said USAID also promoted digital IDs that tie people s bank

According to a 34 page preprint paper on vaccine effectiveness published in The Lancet 3 939 of 4 03 million Swedes who received the second dose of a COVID vaccine died less than two weeks later You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up People appear to die at rates 20 or more above normal for weeks after receiving their second COVID vaccine dose according to data from a huge Swedish study The figures are buried in a preprint paper on vaccine effectiveness released last month The headline finding of the paper was that protection against COVID including severe cases plunged after six months The researchers did not explicitly examine deaths from all causes which have risen since the summer in many countries that have highly vaccinated populations But on page 32 of the 34 page report a chart shows that 3 939 of 4 03 million Swedes who received the second dose died less than two weeks later Over a one year period that rate of death would translate into an annual mortality rate of about 2 5 a year 1 person in 40 almost three times the overall Swedish average In a typical year about 1 in 115 Swedes dies Of course that huge gap does not account for an important confounding factor younger people who have a much lower risk of death were less likely to be vaccinated But Sweden also provides detailed data on overall deaths nationally making a crude baseline comparison possible That data shows that from an average of about 1 650 Swedes died every week between 2015 and 2019 between April 1 and early August the period in which almost all of those 4 million Swedes in the study received their second dose Death rates hardly varied over those years In other words during the spring and summer Sweden normally has about 3 300 deaths every two weeks not just in the people who received vaccines but in all 10 6 million of its people So let s make an incredibly conservative assumption one that strongly favors the vaccines The next couple paragraphs are a bit tricky but I hope the payoff is worth taking the time to read and think through them Assume that the group of people who received vaccines were so much older and unhealthier than those who didn t that they would have accounted for every single death in Sweden whether or not they were vaccinated In other words assume that even if the vaccines did not exist every person in Sweden who died would have been part of that group of 4 03 million people the researchers tracked while not one other person would have died In that case those 4 03 million people should have about 3 300", "chunk_id":

million people the researchers tracked while not one other person would have died In that case those 4 03 million people should have about 3 300 deaths every two weeks They CANNOT HAVE MORE because all of Sweden does not have more But the vaccines do exist Those 4 03 million people received them And in the two weeks after receiving the second vaccine dose as a group the researchers reported they had not about 3 300 deaths but 3 939 And 3 939 deaths is about 20 more deaths than should have occurred in those two post vaccine weeks Again the 20 figure understates the real gap because in the real world some deaths will occur in the 6 6 million unvaccinated people too so the actual baseline number for the vaccinated group is not 3 300 deaths but somewhat lower Unfortunately the researchers did not report any details on the deaths so it is impossible to know if they are disproportionately cardiovascular It is also impossible to know whether one particular vaccine was disproportionately linked to deaths Sweden used mostly the Pfizer mRNA vaccine as well as some of AstraZeneca s DNA AAV vaccine which is not available in the U S and a small amount of Moderna s mRNA vaccine Of course it is just possible the extra deaths are due to chance Or that the handful of elderly Swedes who received vaccines in February and March accounted for a hugely disproportionate number of the post vaccine deaths Because per week Swedish death rates are higher in the winter a large number of post vaccine deaths in those months would somewhat reduce the strength of the signal though it would still exist But the caveats aside the Swedish figures offer a very large real world dataset apparently showing a notable increase in all cause mortality directly following COVID vaccination They are yet another piece of evidence in an increasingly worrying picture alongside case and anecdotal reports a known link to heart inflammation in young men the updated Pfizer clinical trial data revealing a numerical

significant relationship between aluminum exposure and autism The buried link appears on Figure 11 page 19 of the corrected supplemental materials The original version showed that children who received a large dose of aluminum were not at greater risk of getting a neurodevelopmental diagnosis including autism than kids who received a small or moderate dose Yet the corrected version showed that kids who received a large dose had a statistically significantly higher risk of being diagnosed with autism or other pervasive developmental disorders compared to those who received a moderate dose of aluminum Jablonowski said he and Hooker determined that the results were statistically significant meaning they couldn t be attributed to chance by looking at the confidence intervals for each statistic A confidence interval shows the range of values you expect the true estimate to fall between if you redo the study many times The corrected figure also showed that children who received a

Even before the corrected materials were added to the study Hooker and Jablonowski noted a host of flaws For instance the authors failed to mention there were increased risks of certain diseases for kids vaccinated with aluminum containing vaccines compared with kids who received no aluminum containing vaccines Before Hviid went on summer break he told The Defender in an email that his team didn t include a control group of unvaccinated children who had no aluminum exposure because differences between unvaccinated and vaccinated children likely would have biased the results Instead the team opted to compare groups of vaccinated children who were exposed to different amounts of aluminum Hviid said Yet the study reported results for 15 237 children who were either unvaccinated or vaccinated only with a shot that contains no aluminum such as the measles mumps rubella MMR vaccine The MMR vaccine used in Denmark has no aluminum according to the authors That creates a cohort of children unvaccinated with an aluminum containing shot Jablonowski said Hooker and Jablonowski compared the outcomes of children who didn t receive an aluminum containing vaccine with the outcomes of children who received aluminum containing vaccines Kids who received an aluminum containing vaccine were 26 more likely to have atopic dermatitis than kids who were unvaccinated or only got the MMR shot Jablonowski said Those kids were 50 more likely to have allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and these are really strong statistically significant signals Jablonowski said the study authors might

feeling This is the place she thought After attempting to buy two other properties before being outbid by cash buyers Bray and her husband Jon began to wonder whether their dream of owning and operating their own farm would become a reality We always wanted to farm but we aren t trust fund kids we didn t grow up in agriculture we didn t have a farm handed down to us so it wasn t something that was very accessible to us Bray said This was a dream come true but it wasn t without challenges In 2022 Bray then 39 purchased the valley property which they now operate under the name Blue Mountain Farm growing a variety of vegetables and raising pigs and a dairy cow near the town of McCurtin While Bray eventually realized her dream the rising cost of farmland has priced out many other would be farmers and ranchers or forced others into early retirement The parts of the country where farmland prices have seen the largest increase have also been where the number of agriculture producers has declined the most From 2017 to 2022 the average value per acre of all American farmland grew from 4 368 to 5 354 an increase of nearly 23 according to U S Department of Agriculture USDA data on the market value of farmland and its buildings But in the 409 counties across the country that saw a producer decline of 15 or greater over the past five years average farmland values increased by 31 according to Investigate Midwest s analysis of USDA reports land value records and other property data In reviewing property records and speaking with more than a dozen officials who closely track farmland values Investigate Midwest found there are multiple causes for the decline in producers in counties that saw the most significant increase in value Population growth expanding into rural communities has increased prices and reduced farmland as 11 million acres of agricultural land were converted into residential properties from 2001 to 2016 according to the American

biggest competition for farmland used to be from the person who wanted a hobby farm but maybe wasn t farming full time said Vanessa Garcia Polanco a policy campaign director with the National Young Farmers Coalition Today the biggest threat we see is from corporations and hedge funds The increase in competition for farmland has been especially detrimental for young and would be farmers According to a 2022 National Young Farmers Coalition survey 59 of farmers under 40 said finding affordable land was very or extremely challenging Farmland ownership has received increased attention from lawmakers in recent years especially concerning foreign owned companies Lawmakers in dozens of states have pushed laws limiting foreign land ownership including from countries like Iran and China often claiming these buyers drive up costs that push out family farms However U S Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack recently called that focus misguided and said the growth in American investment firms buying farmland is a more pressing concern Do you know roughly a third of all the farming operations that generate more than 500 000 in sales are owned by investment outfits Are you concerned about Wall Street owning farmland Vilsack said in response to a question about foreign owned land while speaking at the North American Agricultural Journalists conference in April But Paul Pittman the executive chairman of the investment firm Farmland Partners said companies like his were not to blame for rising prices and were keeping many farms in production That s populist B S and nothing less

purchase was five times more than the median for comp sales in the area based on data from the land value tracking site AcreValue However the firm had shown that its high purchase prices were likely to pay off It had recently sold nearly 2 500 acres of farmland in central Nebraska and South Carolina for a combined 16 2 million a transaction that netted Farmland Partners a 24 return on investment the company announced According to data from the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries investment firms increased their farmland holdings by 231 from 2008 to 2023 While traditional real estate property is constantly expanding many investors see the decrease in available farmland as a partial driver of its value Most farmland investment firms lease the land back to producers who operate the entire farming business In a recent SEC filing Gladstone Land which owns 111 836 acres of farmland across 15 states said it rents most of its land to farmers on a triple net basis which means the tenant pays the related taxes insurance costs maintenance and other operating costs in addition to rent However Pittman the chairman of Farmland Partners board of directors said there are signs that more farmers are struggling to afford rents There s a little more trouble out there than there was 12 months ago and we re seeing it in having an occasional farmer come to us and say Hey can you re rent this farm to someone else Pittman said on a May 1 investor call according to a transcript When we ve had that occur we ve been able to re rent the farms at the same price or in some

remain solid because in the agriculture sector bankruptcies are minuscule The 2022 farm bankruptcy rate was 0 84 per 10 000 farms its lowest rate in nearly 20 years While most farmland is rented to producers there are times when an alternative use can fetch even more money Wind farms can attract lucrative rents and often allow the land to remain agricultural However the growth in solar farms which also attract high rental rates usually means the land can no longer be used to grow crops or raise livestock because of the large solar panels near the ground In Illinois for example a farm that may rent for 400 to 500 an acre a year for agriculture rents for 1 250 to 1 500 a year for solar and the farmer cannot compete with that Pittman said To be honest when I m wearing my fiduciary obligation to my investor s hat if somebody offers us 1 500 an acre it s going to go to solar But wearing my Paul the citizen hat I m not sure that s a great thing Industrial farm growth led to a hollowing out of the middle In most counties that lost producers agriculture production actually increased as the remaining farms often grew larger or were converted to industrial operations Wisconsin s Douglas County located in the state s northwest corner lost 31 of its producers from 2017 to 2022 but saw net cash farm incomes more than double and sales from agriculture products increase by 45 during that same period Across the state five counties saw a producer decline of at least 15 yet also saw agriculture production sales increase Many operators continued to exit and this happened rapidly among Wisconsin dairy farms said Jeff Hadachek an agriculture professor at the University of Wisconsin At the same time the farms that remained were increasing in size Hadachek said the increase in farm production means the local economy may still be growing even with a loss of producers I think economists would typically say that just looking at the number of farms is not the best

operations to improve efficiency which can increase profits in a sector with tight margins for smaller dairy farmers In 1997 the average Wisconsin dairy farm had 55 6 cows while the 2022 average topped 203 per farm according to research from the University of Wisconsin Some farmland investors see profit opportunities in the transition to larger farms and are predicting a continued shift toward industrial agriculture An aging farmer generation fractional family ownership structure and technological advances requiring sizable capital investment will naturally transition farmland holdings from individuals to institutions stated a report from PGIM the 10 billion property asset management company run by Prudential Financial that has increased its farmland holdings in recent years Hadachek said the growth in larger operations has led to a decrease in medium sized farms what he calls a hollowing out of the middle The growth in the larger end reflects consolidation and the economies of scale and size associated with large farms while the growth in the smaller end reflects growth in specialty foods farms targeting the local foods market and hobby farming Hadachek said But Pittman the executive chairman of the investment firm Farmland Partners said data on the decline in the number of farms across the country can be deceiving From 2017 to 2022 America lost 141 733 farms but 80 of those lost farms had less than 2 500 in annual sales You and I know those aren t really farms I don t know why they re called farms Pittman said If you re talking about supporting a

Bolin a poultry producer in McCurtin County who is also a state agriculture commissioner In a recent report titled Farms Under Threat the American Farmland Trust found that between 2001 and 2016 more than 11 million acres of farmland was converted to urban and residential use with Texas California Arizona and Georgia topping the list To stall the urbanization of farmland the American Farmland Trust a nonprofit that says it wants to expand the conservation agriculture movement has facilitated the purchase of more than 78 000 acres to protect it from nonagricultural uses Some states have taken similar measures including Oregon where counties must protect some farmland through specific zoning restrictions Bolin said zoning restrictions might be worth considering although he s hesitant to suggest them It s something that would be super controversial and I don t know where I stand on it Bolin said I know there are some states that help protect farmland but that is more regulation and we don t like that here in Oklahoma But I don t know what the answer is Even if farmland is protected from being converted into another use young farmers still struggle to compete with cash buyers

time to fulfill Not only did we have to finance but we were kind of forced into a commercial funding route instead of the state program route because the government programs take too long Bray said The National Young Farmers Coalition has advocated for the Farm Service Agency to be made a loan making institution with pre approval and pre qualification processes to give farmers needing financing

Pediatrics AAP today called for an end to religious and philosophical vaccine exemptions for children attending daycare and school in the U S In an updated policy statement published in Pediatrics the AAP said universal immunization is necessary to keep children and employees safe The organization said there is a place for legitimate medical exemptions but nonmedical exemptions are problematic We recommend that vaccination is required for participation in certain public activities such as school and daycare and if you choose not to vaccinate you re essentially choosing to exclude yourself from those settings lead author Dr Jesse Hackell told MedPage Today He added We recognize that excluding a child from public education does have problems and yet we reach the conclusion that on balance assuring the safety of the school and daycare environment outweighs that risk because there are other educational opportunities available According to the AAP statement all 50 states the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico require proof of immunization to attend daycare and school and all of them grant medical exemptions However 45 of those also have religious exemptions and 15 allow personal belief philosophical or conscientious objection exemptions Only California Connecticut Maine New York and West Virginia don t allow nonmedical exemptions Massachusetts is debating a law that would eliminate religious exemptions there The AAP statement said reasons for granting medical exemptions can vary but typically require a demonstrated allergy to a vaccine component previous serious adverse reaction to a vaccine or its components or serious underlying immunosuppression Some states including New York have been tightening their medical exemption requirements in recent years Some state medical boards including in California have sanctioned or targeted the medical licenses of doctors who write medical exemptions Medically indicated exemptions when granted appropriately

religious freedom is a hot button issue nationwide She said The AAP s statement calling for an end to religious exemptions to immunization ignores constitutionally protected rights regarding religious freedom and potentially is in violation of other laws as well AAP blatantly suggests that schools discriminate against families with faith based reasons to not take some or all vaccines To claim otherwise is to play word games just as AAP suggests that families are not forced to take vaccines that conflict with their religious beliefs but instead that families simply must choose in those instances between attending school and staying true to their religious values Dr Michelle Perro author of What s Making Our Children Sick How Industrial Food Is Causing an Epidemic of Chronic Illness and What Parents and Doctors Can Do About It criticized the move by the AAP As a pediatrician committed to informed consent and patient rights based on non biased science I strongly support the continued access to medical religious and philosophical vaccine exemptions she said Perro said many vaccines are produced using cell lines originally derived from aborted fetal tissue This poses a moral and ethical conflict for some families She added In addition vaccines contain adjuvants and excipients such as aluminum salts polysorbate 80 and formaldehyde that create neurotoxicity and immune dysregulation in some children Compounding these issues is the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP which grants vaccine manufacturers legal immunity leaving families with no recourse when vaccine injuries occur In a system that removes liability from Pharma while simultaneously mandating their products preserving exemptions is essential to protect not only parental choice medical ethics and the fundamental right to informed consent but protecting the health of our children In an X post today U S Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr criticized the VICP and vowed to fix it The VICP is broken and I intend to fix it Kennedy said I will not allow the VICP to continue to ignore its mandate and fail its mission of quickly and fairly compensating vaccine injured individuals Fundamental right of parents addressed in Supreme Court ruling this year Legally requiring immunization is key to high immunization rates the authors said highlighting court rulings from 1905 1922 and 1944 as legal justification for their stance Mack Rosenberg said AAP is relying on old case law to support its argument and that case law is being challenged and questioned and new case law upholding

Court reaffirmed that parents have a fundamental right to raise their children according to their religious beliefs and any government policy infringing on this right faces strict scrutiny the highest legal standard Blanket bans on religious exemptions as the AAP proposes fail this test Forcing families to choose between their faith and their children s education is unnecessary Forty five states already balance public health with religious accommodations proving it s possible to protect both States can no longer rely on vague claims of public health to justify mandatory medical interventions Under strict scrutiny they must provide concrete evidence something the AAP s proposal lacks The Supreme Court s message is clear a child s access to public education cannot be conditioned on a family violating their deeply held religious convictions Public support for religious exemptions is growing A survey conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania published in January found public support for religious exemptions from school vaccine requirements doubled from 20 in 2019 to 39 in 2025 The survey also showed that only 52 of U S adults support having their state require vaccination as a condition of school attendance The study authors said school entry vaccination rates have fallen while exemptions have gone up They reported that states with nonmedical vaccine exemptions have had steady increases although that number only reached 3 in the 2022 2023 school year The ease of requirements to obtain nonmedical exemptions can have a significant impact on the rate of exemptions and immunizations the authors said In its statement the AAP appeared to question the legitimacy of people s religious beliefs It said no major world religious traditions include scriptural or doctrinal guidelines that preclude adherents from being vaccinated The organization noted that some people develop beliefs drawn from independent religious traditions or diverse denominational perspectives within major religions Those perspectives are nonetheless thought of as religious commitments by those who hold them but they are too complicated for

of Amish farmer Amos Miller s right to sell raw milk outside Pennsylvania not only addresses state regulations but also raises constitutional questions about individuals rights to purchase traditional foods directly from producers You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Story at a glance Amish farmer Amos Miller successfully defended his right to sell raw milk outside Pennsylvania highlighting the broader battle for food freedom Previously regulatory agencies raided Miller s farm detaining 100 000 worth of whole natural foods threatening his livelihood Research shows that raw milk is a nutrient dense food offering probiotics and enzymes that support digestion and immunity which are lost in pasteurization Strict regulations on small farmers often favor large scale industrial producers leaving traditional farms at a significant economic disadvantage Supporting local farms and advocating for food freedom reforms empower consumers giving them access to healthier unprocessed foods directly from trusted sources Amish farmer Amos Miller has been fighting tooth and nail for the right to sell raw milk a nutrient dense food that has been consumed for millennia Raw milk which has not undergone pasteurization retains its natural enzymes probiotics and vitamins components that are essential for gut health and immunity This is because pasteurization while designed to kill harmful bacteria also destroys beneficial nutrients leaving a product that is less nourishing The stakes for small scale farmers like Miller are high According to federal law selling raw milk across state lines is prohibited due to safety concerns citing risks of bacterial contamination from pathogens such as E coli and listeria Despite this Miller s customers believe in the health benefits of raw milk Interestingly the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA recognizes the right of consumers to buy and transport raw milk across state lines for their personal use The government s actions against Miller highlight a troubling trend Regulatory agencies already raided his farm back in 2024 seizing products worth over 100 000 and imposing restrictions that threaten his livelihood But reason has prevailed as a new ruling reinforced a previous decision allowing him to continue selling raw milk outside Pennsylvania Court decision upholds raw milk sales across state borders A January ruling from the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania has brought attention to the ongoing battle for food freedom for consumers This decision which centers on Amish farmers Amos and Rebecca Miller allows them to sell their raw milk products outside the state while a lawsuit against them proceeds The case not only addresses state regulations but also raises constitutional questions about

However it s their raw milk that is sought by health conscious consumers which has also gained the ire of the government Despite the health benefits federal law prohibits raw milk sales across state lines and in Pennsylvania strict permitting processes limit its sale within the state The Millers have challenged these regulations arguing that their business model respects individual freedoms and meets consumer demand for unprocessed foods The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania just upheld a March 2024 ruling that permitted the Millers to continue selling their raw milk outside the state This decision is pivotal as the state had initially sought to completely ban their sales While an important battle has been won the war isn t over yet The Commonwealth Court also acknowledged the Millers raised potentially meritorious constitutional challenges including those tied to the Commerce Clause and the right to purchase traditional foods directly from producers These points will now be examined more thoroughly during a full trial because of the ambiguity of the state law Miller s case is a big win for the sustainable healthy food Miller s attorney Robert Barnes emphasized the broader implications of this ruling for small scale farmers calling it a big win for food freedom on his X account He also stated that this battle is about more than just raw milk it is about the individual getting to decide what to consume and not what the government is pushing In a statement for The Defender Barnes said Amos Miller a fifth generation Amish farmer from the heart of dairy country produced tens of millions of food products for tens of thousands of Americans over a quarter century using the best and healthiest techniques taught and trained by his father and his father before him How do we know The total number of customer complaints to any government agency for any food product of Amos Miller s is a big fat zero the highest known customer satisfaction rate of any farmer in America Yet the government sought to shut him down and close his farm because they demanded 90 of raw milk products be banned from sale to anyone anywhere This win for Amos Miller is a win

The case also underscores a significant tension between traditional farming practices and modern regulatory frameworks These actions often target raw milk producers who operate under stricter standards than large scale agricultural corporations While regulators supposedly cite public health concerns these measures disproportionately burden small farms effectively consolidating market power among industrial producers For the Millers complying with unreasonable state regulations would severely limit their product offerings making their business model unsustainable While regulators argue that raw milk poses public health risks due to potential bacterial contamination advocates counter that traditional farming practices and consumer education reduce these risks Raw milk supporters often cite its immune boosting properties and benefits for digestion They also argue that pasteurization while effective at eliminating harmful bacteria also destroys beneficial nutrients making raw milk a superior choice for many of them Biologically raw milk contains enzymes like lactase which aid in lactose digestion as well as probiotics which support gut health It also contains immune boosting proteins and vitamins Pasteurization eliminates these components leaving a product that some individuals find harder to digest For consumers with specific health concerns these attributes make raw milk an attractive alternative The constitutional questions raised in the case go beyond food safety The Commerce Clause which governs interstate trade is central to the Millers argument By prohibiting raw milk sales across state lines federal regulations restrict consumer choice and create barriers for small farmers The Millers also invoked the right to purchase traditional foods framing the issue as a matter of personal freedom and cultural preservation These arguments resonate with those who view food freedom as an essential aspect of individual rights This new court ruling sets a precedent that will influence future cases involving raw milk and other traditional food products It challenges the status quo of regulatory oversight emphasizing the importance of balancing

government regulations For those who prioritize raw natural products these actions represent an infringement on their personal choice The raid targeted Miller s raw dairy products like milk and eggnog which allegedly caused E coli illnesses in Michigan and New York However Miller s supporters argue that these claims lack substantiated evidence and highlight the disproportionate scrutiny faced by small scale farmers compared to large scale industrial producers I also pointed out that the raid violated established procedural norms According to Barnes the Department of Agriculture failed to provide advance notice or follow proper inspection protocols Instead they acted in a lawless manner by unlawfully obtaining a search warrant based on what Barnes described as materially false statements from a high ranking official with grievances against independent farmers Again this blatant disregard for the rule of law has raised significant concerns about government overreach and the unequal treatment of small farmers One of the more striking revelations is the economic disparity between small farmers and industrial producers As reported by A Campaign for Real Milk conventional dairy farmers earn approximately 16 per 100 pounds of milk sold which keeps them just above the poverty line In contrast farmers like Miller who are able to directly sell to consumers will be able to sustain their operations and even thrive This stark difference exposes the financial motivations behind unfair regulatory actions which align with the interests of Big Dairy I also discussed the health benefits of raw milk in this article Its natural composition which includes beneficial enzymes probiotics and anti inflammatory properties forms the bulk of its therapeutic benefits In fact the Raw Milk Institute reported that it lowered rates of allergies eczema respiratory infections and fevers The raid on Miller s farm also brings attention to the economic and political grip of centralized food systems on government agencies By preserving traditional farming methods these operations offer a sustainable solution to the environmental degradation caused by Big Ag However current regulations often hinder the ability of small scale farmers to compete thus limiting consumer access to healthier more sustainable food options I also concluded my analysis by calling

regulations Whatever the outcome it will show a glimpse into the future of food freedom Five ways to support food freedom and protect your choices There are concrete steps available to protect your right to traditional unprocessed nutrient dense foods like raw milk while also empowering small local farmers and strengthening community food systems Here are my five recommendations 1 Educate yourself about local food laws Knowledge is your most powerful tool to make informed choices and advocate effectively for changes where needed Start by understanding legislation regarding selling raw milk and other food freedom laws in your state Regulations vary widely with some states allowing raw milk sales directly from farms while others impose strict bans 2 Support small local farms Where you spend your money makes a difference Choose to buy directly from local farmers who use traditional sustainable methods Many small farms offer memberships or co ops with access to raw milk grass fed meats and other whole foods By doing this you re not only improving your diet but also helping small farms stay afloat in the face of restrictive regulations 3 Advocate for regulatory reforms Make your voice heard Reach out to your state legislators and express your support for policies that allow direct to consumer sales of unprocessed foods Supporting initiatives like the PRIME Processing Revival and Intrastate Meat Exemption Act which aims to ease restrictions on small slaughterhouses will help pave the way for broader food freedom Grassroots movements rely on individuals like you to drive change 4 Get involved in your community Build connections with like minded individuals by joining food advocacy groups or attending farm tours and events These networks often share resources updates on legislation and ways to support local farmers If there s a rally or hearing for a farmer like Miller in your area attending shows your support and helps amplify a noble cause 5 Choose high quality traditional foods Prioritize your health by incorporating nutrient dense foods into your diet Look for raw dairy grass fed meats and produce grown without synthetic chemicals If raw milk is your choice ensure it comes from a reputable source with rigorous cleanliness standards Doing this supports your body with high quality nutrition while backing farmers who prioritize sustainable and

Race The book published Dec 5 is available from Amazon and other booksellers Following Obama s 2014 moratorium on gain of function research China s efforts to co opt NIH s National Institutes of Health bioweapons research were so successful that some forty four percent of all the gain of function studies that NIH had historically funded occurred at the Wuhan lab And as discussed previously many of those NIH studies occurred under contract provisions that granted China proprietary and exclusive use of the resulting research It is an understatement therefore to observe that Dr Anthony Fauci was not a good steward of US taxpayer research dollars Furthermore tens of millions of US dollars in funding from USAID U S Agency for International Development and other US government agencies have exacerbated the ferment of bioweapons research in Wuhan Since the Wuhan Institute of Virology WIV only thinly veils its links to the People s Liberation Army both Dr Fauci and Dr Peter Daszak and the spooks at USAID must have known that the WIV is the centerpiece of China s biowarfare biodefense program The State Department issued a fact sheet in May 2020 revealing that the Chinese Communist Party has engaged in a national strategy of military civil fusion intended to eliminate barriers between civilian research and the Chinese military in order to achieve military dominance As Elaine Dewar told Paul Thacker Since Xi Jinping became President he made it clear that the military and the civilian researchers in strategic areas such as biotechnology had to work together There was no distinction between civilian and military research from that point forward No one can hold high positions or conduct research at the WIV without being closely involved with and supervised by the

straight up weapons development In 2015 only two years after Chinese scientists used funding from NIAID and techniques they learned from Ralph Baric to triumphantly facilitate a deadly chimeric bird

Chinese Military Medical Science Press a government owned publishing house managed by the General Logistics Department of the People s Liberation Army PLA The book described Chinese success at artificially manipulating animal coronaviruses to infect humans as the herald of a promising new era of genetic weapons The 2015 book offers alarming insight into how senior scientists at one of the PLA s most prominent military universities were thinking about the gain of function research that Tony Fauci was already financing in their laboratories Their thoughts align perfectly with the bioweapons ambitions for gain of function science that Ralph Baric unveiled in his 2007 paper The Chinese authors giddily proclaim their ability to enhance the military effectiveness of their new GOF

easier to develop coronavirus strains that could infect humans In June 2021 Vanity Fair reported that United States National Security Council NSC investigators determined that it became clear that the mice had been engineered sometime in the summer of 2019 before the pandemic even started The NSC officials were left wondering Had the Chinese military been running viruses through humanized mouse

earlier in the decade had lacked any unifying strategic mission and that the government had never assessed the risks Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Since no single agency is in charge of the expansion no one is determining the aggregate risks associated with this expansion the Government Accountability Office GAO report read As a consequence no federal agency can determine whether high containment laboratory capacity may now meet or exceed the national need or is at a level that can be operated safely Four years later this problem had remained unresolved The National Security Advisor rejected a proposed assessment of whether the proliferation of high security labs outpaced national need and posed undue risks having determined that it is not in the best interests of U S national security to allocate resources in that way Subsequent GAO reports uncovered major biosecurity breaches As recently as January 2023 the GAO identified major gaps in the oversight of the riskiest research and reiterated that no single department was responsible for the biosafety and biosecurity of pandemic pathogens We maintain that implementing our 2009 recommendation to charge a single federal entity with periodic government wide strategic evaluations of high containment laboratories would help the Department of Health and Human Services assess the

his plans to retire at the end of the year His story warrants a closer look at what it tells us about American politics business and healthcare For decades before his recent fame Fauci has been a medical researcher credited with important new understandings of the human immune response particularly in HIV and AIDS He also helped develop therapies for several previously fatal diseases including a treatment of vasculitis which turned a 98 mortality rate into a 93 survival rate For most of his career he has been the world s most cited researcher on AIDS and infectious diseases He has received many awards including the Presidential Medal of Freedom Ironically Fauci has also presided over a decades long decline in the overall health of American citizens During his time in public health a great number of chronic illnesses have become commonplace Food allergies autoimmune diseases and cancer now affect more than half of American children Autism once rare now affects 1 in 44 children A lifetime in public health Dr Anthony Fauci was born in Brooklyn in 1940 the son of a pharmacist Pharmacy was the family business and both his mother and sister worked in his father s shop beneath their apartment As a young man Fauci studied medicine at Cornell University graduating first in his class After his residency in 1966 he took a research job at the National Institutes of Health NIH and he has worked for the U S government ever since In his five decades in public health Fauci has advised every President since Ronald Reagan Since 1984 he has been the head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease NIAID one of 27 institutes within the NIH given the mission of researching and preventing infectious immunologic and allergic diseases For many Americans Fauci has been the trusted face of the U S government s response to the pandemic It was his confident explanations both to the public and to policymakers which led to the use of lockdowns business closures

said The level of propaganda we have lived through in the last two years is unprecedented in my lifetime I lived in the Soviet Union after law school fighting for human rights and working against government propaganda and censorship And now we are living through that in the United States According to Holland Fauci is the key player in the U S government s efforts to control all information relating to the pandemic and the virus The documents are coming out that show that the government has been censoring us suppressing factual information that relate to this virus and the pandemic Even criticism of Fauci has been censored says Holland Robert Kennedy s new book The Real Anthony Fauci has been suppressed at every turn she said The 2021 book takes a hard look at Fauci s career and his handling of the COVID 19 pandemic Kennedy has found it almost impossible to promote his book No major publication in the country would review the book said Holland The New York Times would not include it on their bestseller list and he Kennedy was not invited on any major media platform except for Tucker Carlson and The Epoch Times The level of censorship has been astonishing Kennedy isn t the only one censored For two years mainstream media outlets have ignored the scientists who have questioned Fauci s views These scientists have seen their ideas rejected or later retracted by medical journals denounced by government officials and censored by social media platforms Fauci has been candid about his suppression of dissent Attacks on me quite frankly are attacks on science Fauci told CNBC in a

covered up According to Holland it s the role that Fauci may have played in creating and prolonging this pandemic By all appearances they have tried to cover up their role in funding lethal gain of function research in China said Holland They have also suppressed the use of lifesaving early treatments like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and they have suppressed valuable research into preventive measures that could have saved countless lives The result says Holland and other critics is a dark period in American history Fauci s pandemic Starting in early 2020 Americans faced unprecedented government intrusion in their lives Business and school closures lockdowns mask mandates and the man behind these government policies has been Dr Anthony Fauci In countless interviews and press conferences Fauci positioned himself as the one true source of correct COVID 19 information and guidance Emergency orders at the federal state and local levels were based on Fauci s opinions Fauci himself took credit for the policy of lockdowns saying in October 2020 I recommended to the president that we shut the country down That was a very difficult decision because I knew it would have very serious economic consequences Anthony Fauci is clearly at the very center of all things COVID Holland said And he has been in charge of controlling the information about the pandemic From the very beginning when many scientists were pointing to a lab origin for this virus said Holland Anthony Fauci put a stop to that important debate Despite the discovery of NIAID s funding of gain of

vaccines In the COVID response we saw extraordinary corruption said Holland The origin of the virus was covered up Important treatments were suppressed And vaccines were authorized and mandated on inadequate science Suppression of cures One of the most astonishing aspects of Fauci s leadership during the pandemic has been his strong opposition to any potential treatment In two years neither Fauci nor any U S government agency has published a single treatment protocol for COVID 19 patients In contrast China had a treatment protocol online by mid March of 2020 The result of an organized collection of data from hundreds of hospitals treating thousands of patients the Chinese protocol included simple solutions like saline nasal lavage an antiseptic mouthwash to reduce viral loads and cheap drugs like zinc Pepcid chloroquine and antibiotics As of this writing the United States still has no official treatment protocol And no protocols have been proposed by any major American university or research hospital Yet every American doctor who has tried to publish one has been quickly censored and ridiculed Dr Peter McCullough knows this firsthand The author of the protocol that became the most downloaded medical paper of 2020 McCullough was among the first American doctors to develop test and publish a successful treatment protocol resulting in an 85 reduction in hospitalizations and death among his patients A medical doctor and author of over 600 peer reviewed research articles McCullough at first had no thought of developing his own treatment plan But he soon became alarmed at the government s failure to provide treatment advice to America s doctors By May 2020 McCullough began taking action He quickly set up a network of doctors to share information about effective treatments something Fauci never did For his efforts he found himself sued by Baylor University had his Wikipedia page re written to label him a source of COVID misinformation and had

Across the country Dr Pierre Kory was fighting the same battle The co founder of the Front Line COVID 19 Critical Care Alliance Kory and a team of doctors were quickly developing their own protocol and putting it online Like McCullough Kory had discovered the effectiveness of ivermectin hydroxychloroquine and a number of other inexpensive and easily available drugs Kory testified twice to the U S Senate explaining the success of his treatment protocol He also submitted a formal paper to the NIH which quickly dismissed the results as insufficient data lacking proper clinical trials Another research paper explaining the protocol was retracted by the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology due to unsupported claims The efficacy of some of these drugs is almost miraculous We could have stopped the pandemic in its tracks in the Spring of 2020 said Kory Yet Dr Fauci refused to promote any of these interventions It s not just that he made no effort to find effective off the shelf cures he aggressively suppressed them You had Birx Fauci and Redfield doing press conferences every day Kory said in an interview And not one of them ever treated a COVID patient or worked in an emergency room or ICU They knew nothing Dr Fauci s suppression of early treatments said Kory will go down in history as having caused the death of half a million Americans But why would Anthony Fauci suppress effective treatments Why attack doctors trying to find a solution According to Robert Kennedy it might be because safe and effective treatments for COVID 19 would make the new vaccines unnecessary Successful treatments aren t just a marketing challenge for the vaccine manufacturers they re a legal obstacle too Once a successful treatment for COVID 19 is established it becomes much less likely that the FDA will grant Emergency Use Authorization EUA to new vaccines and new drugs Under federal law there must be no approved alternative way of treating or preventing a disease before authorizing an EUA The EUA under which the experimental vaccines were given to millions of Americans would never have been granted if COVID 19 was known to be an easily treatable disease In The Real Anthony Fauci

expensive patented drugs and vaccines on a captive population AIDS COVID 19 isn t the first time that Anthony Fauci has been accused of using public policy to benefit big pharma corporations Forty years ago at the height of the AIDS crisis in America many AIDS activists called Anthony Fauci a sellout to the drug companies You are responsible for all government funded AIDS treatment research said activist Larry Kramer in an open letter to Fauci in the San Francisco Examiner in 1988 You are part of a government bureaucracy that values thriving pharmaceutical company entrepreneurism over the health of people with HIV Kramer s criticism instead of focusing on improving patients health Fauci s only answer to AIDS was the development of new drugs How long will it take you to start focusing on the immune system how to boost it and how to prevent the opportunistic infections that are killing people with AIDS Still you give your blessing to clinical trials of highly profitable toxins You are a pill pushing pimp that cooperates with drug companies in forcing dangerous concoctions down the throats of a desperate community wrote Kramer AIDS drugs are not sold to help people they are sold to make a profit Conflicts of interest Despite the criticism Fauci endured the AIDS crisis produced the most important opportunity of his career using NIAID to develop and profit from new drugs His collaboration with pharmaceutical companies quickly grew into a billion dollar business The 1980 Bayh Dole Act allowed NIAID and government scientists like Fauci to directly profit from drug development Under the law NIAID was now allowed to file patents on the new drugs that their research was creating and then license those drug patents back to pharmaceutical companies Individual government scientists could also put their names on patents and collect royalties This created a new income stream for Anthony Fauci royalties on the sales of all drugs developed through NIAID funded research Drug development very quickly became the focus of Fauci s NIAID and millions of dollars in royalties started to pour in According to a 2006 investigation by the Associated Press NIH and NIAID

the use of that product The conflict of interest is astounding Experiments in New York Drug development for AIDS created a little known episode in Fauci s career Starting in 1985 the NIAID provided funding for clinical drug trials on HIV positive children studies which included children in the New York foster care system According to a 2009 report by the Vera Institute of Justice 25 of the children involved in these experiments died though there is no evidence that they died as a direct result of the experiments NIAID under Fauci exploited the most vulnerable in our society to develop new drugs said Holland These were poor children without parents many of whom were already very sick Episodes like this make one genuinely recall other medical atrocities in history experiments conducted on vulnerable people without proper informed consent Experiments in Africa Experimentation on humans has been a key part of Fauci s role in new drug and vaccine development especially in

development of antimicrobial resistance or AMR a problem that killed 1 14 million people globally in a single year Antimicrobials are a group of drugs that kill microorganisms including bacteria viruses and fungi On April 1 the Trump administration began laying off some 10 000 staff in a planned restructuring of the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS Those let go include more than 140 leaders and staff including several veterinarians at the FDA s Center for Veterinary Medicine CVM including Tristan Colonius the Center s chief veterinary officer according to news reports The layoffs affect personnel working on antimicrobial resistance the American Veterinary Medical Association AVMA confirmed to U S Right to Know The layoffs have dampened hopes that the new secretary of the U S Department of Health and Human Services Robert F Kennedy Jr and the FDA commissioner Martin A Makary might prioritize tackling antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial use on farms say researchers and public interest groups Kennedy has spoken publicly of his concerns regarding industrial farming and Makary has called for cutting antimicrobial use in farm animals to help preserve drugs effectiveness for human health Delcianna Winders director of the Animal Law and Policy Institute at Vermont Law and Graduate School says she is concerned that the job losses will worsen the already declining effectiveness of lifesaving antimicrobial drugs It seems less likely than ever that progress on this ticking time bomb will be made under the current administration she says The AVMA said in a statement that it is unclear how many veterinarians have lost their jobs but that it is working with Congress and the administration to restore key personnel and critical functions including responding to the bird flu crisis that has infected over 168 million birds across the country and has spread to dairy cows and poultry as well as 67 human cases since 2022 including one death A news report by STAT also says that the FDA has appointed Timothy Schell as the new acting director of the CVM Schell", "chunk_id":

CVM in 2000 before jumping to the animal drug company Elanco Animal Health in 2014 for five years He then moved back to the CVM to lead its office of surveillance and compliance He replaces Tracey Forfa who has led the center since 2023 It is unclear what has happened to Forfa The FDA did not respond to requests to confirm Schell s appointment Andrew deCoriolis executive director of Farm Forward a group advocating for the end of factory farming is concerned that Schell s links to industry will not help efforts to reduce the use of antimicrobial drugs in food animals It s pretty hard to take seriously the idea that FDA is going to curb antibiotic use on farms when they appoint a former drug company lobbyist as the chief regulator he says Promises to cut antimicrobials in animal agriculture The cuts to the CVM staff who worked on antimicrobial resistance come at a time when nations around the world including the U S promised to tackle the crisis which is regarded by the World Health Organization as one of the most urgent threats to global public health In September 2024 at a meeting of the United Nations in New York countries including the U S committed to striving to meaningfully reduce antimicrobials used in animal agriculture by 2030 to help curb AMR However nations failed to agree on specific targets to reduce use following pushback from the U S and other meat producing nations More antimicrobials are sold in the U S for use in farm animals than for humans each year research suggests They are used to treat sick animals and to prevent disease and are sometimes given routinely to avoid the risk of infection Diseases can spread more quickly between animals on intensive farming systems where large numbers of individuals are kept in close quarters and hygiene and welfare can be poor The FDA and CVM have several initiatives underway to better manage and track the use of antimicrobials in farm animals These include draft guidance to encourage animal drug makers to voluntarily stop the continuous use of medically important antibiotics in food animals At the time of the layoffs the FDA was considering comments from public interest groups industry

to publishing revisions of another set of voluntary guidance which tells drug makers how to assess the risk to human health from AMR when assessing the safety of new antimicrobial drugs for animals Advocates for cutting antimicrobials in farm animals have criticized aspects of both guidance documents but generally they were regarded as a step in the right direction For example the guidance on setting limits on use didn t go far enough to curb long term use but it could still be an improvement on the current situation where some drugs can be used indefinitely says Steven Roach who works on safe and healthy food at the Food Animal Concerns Trust or FACT a campaign group in Chicago Illinois Collecting data on antimicrobial use In 2023 the Reagan Udall Foundation published plans for a public private partnership with industry to voluntarily collect data on the use of antimicrobials in farm animals The project was funded by the FDA Currently the FDA collects annual data on the volume of antimicrobials sold for farm animals But this is only a crude measure of antimicrobial drugs used Accurate use of data is crucial to be able to assess how and why drugs are administered say campaign groups Public interest groups have long urged the FDA to collect data on antimicrobial use but they objected to the FDA s proposals for a voluntary system which they say may not provide a representative picture of the industry Large industrial farms that may overuse antimicrobials would have little incentive to participate in a voluntary system because it would make them look bad writes Madeleine Kleven an analyst for FACT It is unclear how far the FDA has gotten in building the data collection partnership But last year in a letter to U S Sen Cory Booker D N J the FDA highlighted that it had awarded grants to Cornell University and Kansas State University and to a consulting firm to start collecting data Roach is concerned that the job cuts will hamper progress on data collection The cuts will impact the FDA s ability to get stuff done he says But deCoriolis is skeptical that the voluntary data collection efforts will produce any useful information or results

nations carry more antibiotic resistance genes even without taking antibiotics themselves Keystone strains are affected by antibiotics and overall gut diversity is reduced as well Protecting gut health involves avoiding antibiotics consuming probiotic rich foods daily reducing linoleic acid intake supporting keystone bacteria and considering natural antimicrobial alternatives Antibiotic abuse is a pervasive public health concern around the world According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2 8 million cases of antibiotic resistant infections are diagnosed yearly and 35 000 people die from them But how do bacteria evade antibiotics exactly As it turns out bacteria are hardy microorganisms that adapt to antibiotics in different ways Intrinsic resistance A change in structure or components through evolution eventually creates resistance A change in structure or components through evolution eventually creates resistance Acquired resistance Bacteria begin to resist

experienced more dramatic reductions in numbers during antibiotic treatment followed by a rapid rise in resistant strains afterward Bacterial traits that create resistance remain in your gut You re not in the clear yet even after stopping antibiotics and the microbiome has stabilized According to the researchers the bacteria living in your gut have been permanently altered by antibiotics causing new bacteria that enter your body to gain resistance as well Commensal populations may therefore act as reservoirs for resistance traits that could transfer to pathogenic bacteria through horizontal gene transfer beyond the interaction with antibiotics The key takeaway here is that even short term antibiotic use sets the stage for resistant bacteria to persist and cause long term gut dysbiosis Knowing this it becomes clear that avoiding antibiotics unless necessary is essential to preserving your gut microbiome and lowering your risk for antibiotic resistant bacterial infections Your country s antibiotic use impacts your personal gut health In a similar study published in Nature Communications researchers revealed how antibiotic use this time on a nationwide perspective shapes the

prescribed antibiotic for children for eight consecutive days when they were four weeks old Then researchers closely monitored their gut bacteria and metabolism for 14 months which is a timespan that equates to early adulthood in humans Even a short course of antibiotics early in life significantly reduced the bacterial diversity Moreover that diversity never fully recovered In simpler terms their

bacteria that help maintain balance and stability within the microbial community When antibiotics wiped out these crucial players the whole bacterial ecosystem fell apart and never fully repaired itself The numbers of keystones of the antibiotic group in the 1st 7th months were obviously less than those of control indicating that antibiotic use obviously reduced the number of key species in

colds or mild infections because as the studies have noted even short term antibiotic use dramatically increases resistance and disrupts your gut ecosystem Eat probiotic rich foods regularly Incorporate homemade fermented foods like sauerkraut kimchi yogurt and kefir into your diet every day using traditional methods and clean organic ingredients The probiotics found in these foods help rebuild and maintain a diverse and healthy microbiome which strengthens your overall health Minimize your intake of linoleic acid Found primarily in vegetable oils nuts and ultraprocessed foods linoleic acid damages your gut lining and promotes inflammation weakening your gut health further Swap out all products containing this toxic fat for healthier alternatives like tallow grass fed butter coconut oil or ghee This one shift alone will already dramatically improve your gut s resilience Support keystone gut bacteria Keystone species are the backbone of your gut microbiome Protect and nourish these essential bacteria namely Akkermansia by regularly consuming fiber rich foods like apples with their skins onions and asparagus These foods act as prebiotics that directly feed beneficial gut bacteria ensuring your microbiome stays balanced and resilient Don t forget to consume fermented foods as well to cover all your bases Consider natural antibiotics Instead of fighting harmful bacteria with antibiotic drugs I recommend trying natural options Many foods you eat contain antimicrobial properties that even eliminate drug resistant bacteria Some examples include

use will have significant and lasting effects on the gut microbiome Taking ciprofloxacin for just five days was enough for bacteria in the gut to develop resistance Within days bacteria that were once vulnerable evolved into strains capable of surviving the antibiotic These resistant strains remained prevalent in the gut for at least ten weeks after treatment and were projected to persist for up to a year Q How does national antibiotic use affect individual gut health A The level of antibiotic use in each country directly impacts the gut health of its population People in countries with high antibiotic consumption such as Spain Italy and Greece tend to carry more antibiotic resistance genes in their gut microbiomes even if they have not personally taken antibiotics recently This widespread presence of resistance genes stems from environmental exposure which affects everyone living in these areas Furthermore individuals who travel from countries with low antibiotic usage to high use countries often acquire resistant bacteria during their stay Q What are the long term consequences of antibiotic use in childhood A Using antibiotics during childhood can cause permanent damage to gut health Research found that a short course of antibiotics significantly reduced the diversity of gut bacteria and that this diversity never fully recovered even after a prolonged period The structure of the microbial network became fragmented making the gut microbiome more vulnerable to future disturbances Q What can I do to protect my gut health from antibiotic resistance A Protecting your gut from the harmful effects of antibiotic resistance begins with avoiding antibiotics unless they are necessary Incorporating probiotic rich foods like yogurt kimchi and kefir into your daily diet helps maintain a healthy balance of beneficial bacteria Also reducing your intake of linoleic acid which is found in vegetable oils and many ultraprocessed foods as it damages the gut lining and promotes inflammation Additionally using natural antimicrobials like garlic medicinal honey and ginger can offer effective alternatives to synthetic antibiotics in many cases reducing your reliance on pharmaceutical drugs and helping preserve your gut s natural defenses Originally published by Mercola", "chunk_id":

developing baby doctors told the agency Monday The FDA hosted an expert panel of developmental biologists psychiatrists epidemiologists obstetricians and mental health experts who discussed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs and pregnancy The agency livestreamed the two hour conversation on YouTube and X SSRIs have been implicated in different studies to be involved in postpartum hemorrhage pulmonary hypertension and cognitive downstream effects in the baby as well as cardiac birth defects said FDA Commissioner Marty Makary who opened the event Nearly 1 in 4 middle aged women and up to 5 of pregnant women are on an antidepressant Makary said Antidepressants like SSRIs can be an effective treatment for depression but we have to stop and also look at the big picture he said The more antidepressants we prescribe the more depression there is We have to start talking about root causes SSRIs in particular warrant scrutiny as serotonin may play a crucial role in the development of organs of a baby in utero he said Although opinions varied most panelists agreed that women who are prescribed SSRIs rarely receive adequate informed consent about the risks to them or their future offspring Many of the people that I talk to never received informed consent said Roger McFillin a clinical psychologist and executive director of the Center for Integrated Behavioral Health And it is too late if the information is given when a pregnant woman visits the doctor By that time you have exposed that developing baby to an SSRI McFillin added Michael Levin Ph D professor of biology at Tufts University and director of the university s Allen Discovery Center shared results from studies he and colleagues conducted in which SSRIs disrupted the ability of chick and frog embryos to discern left from right which negatively affected their organ development SSRIs are very likely to cause certain kinds of defects Levin said Some may be fixed by the regenerative process of

blood brain barrier and pass into breast milk and may affect a fetus s developing brain Dr Adam Urato chief of maternal and fetal medicine at the MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham Mass said he believes the FDA must strengthen the warnings Never before in human history have we chemically altered developing babies like this especially the developing fetal brain and this is happening without any real public warning and that must end Urato said Regulatory authorities need to get creative about how to inform women about the possible risks of SSRIs said Dr Josef Witt Doerring a psychiatrist who specializes in identifying and treating psychiatric adverse drug reactions and a former FDA medical officer Having a QR code right on the bottle caps that says watch me and links to patient friendly videos talking about the most important risks could do wonders Witt Doerring said Urato suggested a boxed warning formerly called a black box warning so people realize the impact that SSRIs can have on a woman s pregnancy and developing fetus An FDA letter to doctors could also help he said In 2004 the FDA issued a black box warning for the use of antidepressants in young people citing

sudden cardiac death with the risk doubling after six or more years of use according to Danish research Younger adults face an even higher risk with those ages 30 to 39 showing a five times greater likelihood of sudden cardiac death after six years on antidepressants Antidepressants disrupt heart rhythm by affecting ion channels triggering fatal irregular heartbeat Research shows antidepressants only benefit about 15 of patients beyond a placebo effect primarily those with severe depression rather than general low mood Effective alternatives for managing depression include exercise sunlight exposure gut health optimization and techniques for nervous system regulation More people are taking antidepressants than ever before often for years sometimes for life If you re one of them you ve likely been told they re safe effective and essential for your mental health But there s a growing body of evidence suggesting long term use increases your risk of something far more dangerous than the symptoms you re trying to manage sudden cardiac death Sudden cardiac death is a fast and fatal collapse that often happens with no warning signs While it s more common in older adults it s not limited to them In younger adults sudden cardiac death is usually tied to electrical malfunctions or a thickened heart muscle In older adults it s most often the result of narrowed arteries Either way the outcome is the same a person collapses and dies within minutes often with no time for intervention However the risk profile is shifting and some of that shift appears to be tied to medications millions rely on every day If you re taking antidepressants this information could save your life Because once you understand the risks that come with long term antidepressant use you can start taking steps to protect your heart and improve your mental health at the same time Longer antidepressant use sharply increases your risk of dying from a heart Event New research presented at the 2025

prescriptions within one year at any point during the 12 years leading up to the study That exposure was then divided into two categories short term one to five years and long term six or more years Risk increased the longer people stayed on antidepressants Compared to people who had never used these drugs those on antidepressants for one to five years had a 56 higher risk of sudden cardiac death But the danger didn t plateau It escalated Individuals who had been on antidepressants for six or more years had more than double the risk of sudden cardiac death specifically a 2 2 times greater likelihood of dying suddenly from heart related causes Younger adults face even steeper risk than older users This wasn t just a problem for older adults Among those ages 30 to 39 people who used

factors are driving this connection Study co author Dr Jasmin Mujkanovic from Copenhagen University Hospital explained that there are multiple possible reasons for the higher risk One factor is direct drug effects Some antidepressants alter how electrical signals travel through your heart which could trigger fatal rhythm disturbances Another possibility is that antidepressant use is a marker of more severe psychiatric illness which itself is known to increase cardiovascular risks Depression is also linked to delayed medical care unhealthy behaviors and poor heart health Heart rhythm disruption is a likely mechanism of action Many antidepressants especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants affect ion channels in the heart These ion channels control how electrical impulses flow which tells your heart when to beat When these signals are disturbed your heart slips into an abnormal rhythm known as arrhythmia Some arrhythmias lead to sudden death if not corrected within minutes Antidepressants don t work for most people Antidepressants are still handed out as a first line treatment for everything from sadness to burnout despite growing evidence that they rarely address the actual cause of these problems If you re someone who s been prescribed one odds are you weren t diagnosed with a severe mental illness like schizophrenia or psychosis Instead you re likely dealing with grief anxiety or general low mood common human experiences that often signal deeper physical or emotional imbalances Symptoms like sadness or anxiety are your body s way of signaling that something needs attention Feeling emotionally low isn t always a disorder It s often a sign your system is under stress You could be low in important nutrients or getting too little sunlight or too much blue light You could also be disconnected from your purpose your relationships or your body In any of these cases masking the symptoms with medication ignores the deeper message and leaves the root problem untouched Two thirds of people taking antidepressants don t get any real benefit Even though antidepressants are routinely offered as the go to solution

about antidepressants and sudden cardiac death Q Does taking antidepressants really increase the risk of sudden cardiac death A Yes A large study presented at the 2025 European Heart Rhythm Association meeting found that long term antidepressant use is strongly associated with a higher risk of sudden cardiac death The risk increased by 56 for those who had taken antidepressants for one to five years and more than doubled for those with six or more years of use The longer the use the greater the risk especially in adults under 60 Q Who is most at risk for heart complications from antidepressants A Adults between the ages of 30 and 59 face the greatest increase in risk For example people aged 30 to 39 who used antidepressants for six or more years had a fivefold increase in sudden cardiac death risk compared to those who never used them While risk is elevated across most age groups it s especially high in midlife Q Do antidepressants actually work for depression A In most cases no According to the largest ever review of antidepressant clinical trials covering 232 studies and over 73 000 patients only 15 of users experienced a benefit beyond placebo The drugs showed noticeable effects almost exclusively in people with the most severe depression For the majority the perceived improvement comes from the placebo effect not the drug itself Q How can I safely taper off antidepressants if I ve been on them for a long time A Start by working with a prescriber trained in tapering protocols ideally a holistic or integrative practitioner Lower your dose

Could Set National Precedent The hearing came after the U S District Court for the District of New Jersey in September 2022 dismissed a lawsuit filed in August 2021 by Children s Health Defense against the university on behalf of 18 students challenging the university s COVID 19 vaccine mandate You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A U S Court of Appeals on Tuesday heard arguments in an appeal challenging the constitutionality of Rutgers University s COVID 19 vaccine mandate for students The hearing came after the U S District Court for the District of New Jersey in September 2022 dismissed a lawsuit filed in August 2021 by Children s Health Defense CHD against the university on behalf of 18 students challenging the mandate During Tuesday s hearing before a three judge panel for the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia attorney Julio C Gomez argued Rutgers policy is unconstitutional because COVID 19 vaccines are experimental and administered under an Emergency Use Authorization EUA and because students had the right to refuse an unwanted and potentially unsafe medical procedure This appeal raises a very important question whether a college or a university in New Jersey has the legal authority during a public health emergency to coerce the student s consent to a highly invasive injection of a yet to be fully investigated vaccine Gomez told The Defender Gomez said the facts of the case speak for themselves that the vaccines do not prevent transmission that they pose serious risks of harm that Rutgers knows this because it is involved in the clinical trials that Rutgers has conflicts of interest due to its work for vaccine manufacturers and that the only vaccines currently available are emergency use authorized vaccines As a result of these facts Rutgers does not have the legal authority to mandate these vaccines Gomez said Rutgers mandate is not rational it violates the students rights to informed consent it is coercive and it violates the unconstitutional conditions doctrine Gomez also argued that the university s mandate first enacted in April 2021 was contradictory as it did not also mandate faculty and staff get the vaccine That requirement was added later in 2021 Kim Mack Rosenberg acting general counsel for CHD told The Defender the university s mandate was arbitrary Rosenberg also said Rutgers tried to argue that the EUA status of the vaccines was irrelevant and ignored that the vaccine s safety and efficacy remain unproven In fact that the vaccine does not prevent infection or transmission the alleged basis for the mandate has been known Rosenberg argued that Rutgers having hosted clinical trials for the COVID 19 vaccines should have been quite aware of the vaccines limitations and risks That these shots were

having hosted clinical trials for the COVID 19 vaccines should have been quite aware of the vaccines limitations and risks That these shots were mandated for a student population of an age wherein many serious injuries have been documented and where the risk of serious injury is not fully understood is particularly concerning Rosenberg said As a result Rutgers eviscerated students rights by mandating the experimental vaccines for students participation in classes and key elements of on campus student life such as dormitory residence Rutgers coerced students into taking potentially risky and dangerous vaccine In his arguments Tuesday Gomez argued that any public health policy enacted by Rutgers is legally required to be tethered to recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP By not giving students notice that they have the right to accept or refuse the vaccine Rutgers did not comply with ACIP recommendations Gomez told the court Jeffrey S Jacobson the lawyer representing Rutgers told the court If ACIP recommended something Rutgers had the discretion to mandate it But Gomez countered that Rutgers can say ACIP recommended this vaccine but there is a requirement of adherence to the statute which indicates that everyone needs to be given notice that they have the right to accept or refuse the vaccine There s a fundamental right for the student to make the decision that is permitted under that statute freely without coercion Gomez argued That coercion essentially eliminates or obliterates the right the student needs to be free to decide whether to accept or refuse without any coercive element Gomez pointed out that available COVID 19 vaccines are not fully licensed by the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA The only three vaccines that are available are the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent vaccines and the Novavax vaccine Gomez said All three of those vaccines are emergency use authorized All three of those are still under clinical study And all three of those are still considered experimental by the FDA To support this argument Gomez said that clinical documents for the available COVID 19 vaccines indicate there was insufficient evidence about safety and risk and harm adding that even the most recent documentation indicated ongoing clinical study and post marketing analysis for myocarditis and other issues had to continue Rutgers did not have the ability to exercise good faith in issuing the mandate because it didn t have the information to make that kind of an

disease then it s not rational to mandate them to stop the spread of the disease Rosenberg said this is relevant to the initial dismissal of the case by the lower court The central legal issue before the Court of Appeals is whether the District Court applied the correct standard in dismissing the case On a motion to dismiss the District Court was required to accept as true plaintiffs pleadings including plaintiffs allegations that these vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission and are not safe The District Court did not do so leading to plaintiffs appeal Jacobson attempted to justify the initial imposition of a vaccine mandate only on students but not faculty or staff by saying We had to get our students back to campus We had to get our students back to a mode of in person learning The mandate was one critical tool in our toolbox to do it At the time that we imposed the student mandate we had the regulatory authorization to do it he added We didn t yet have a regulatory basis to mandate it for faculty there s a whole different circumstance with regard to faculty and staff because we have collective bargaining issues with them Jacobson did not address why Rutgers continues to maintain its vaccine mandate for students when other universities have lifted the requirement Speaking earlier this month on CHD TV s Good Morning CHD Gomez said it s surprising Rutgers kept its vaccine mandate in effect as a lot of universities by now have dropped them With the end of the national COVID 19 emergency and public health emergency on May 11 numerous universities ended their vaccine mandates including the State University of New York and the City University of New York Gomez argued that Rutgers continued enforcement of the mandate was reflective of a broader inflexibility demonstrated by the university ever since it enacted the policy In the case of plaintiff Adriana Pinto for instance Gomez said that she needed two classes to graduate when she enrolled in an online course offered by Rutgers in 2021 However Rutgers barred her from taking the class because she was unvaccinated They essentially withdrew her from that class registration because they

anyone Gomez told CHD TV It s so egregious what they ve done Rutgers looking to create infinite market for COVID vaccines Gomez told The Defender CHD s lawsuit is significant because it confronts the court with a very important question whether a university can mandate a vaccine while it is conducting clinical trials on that vaccine Rutgers has hosted and still hosts clinical trials for COVID 19 vaccines Jacobson claimed during the hearing Rutgers was one of many sites that participated in the trial The data went to ACIP ACIP made the recommendation Rutgers followed the recommendation Whatever conflict allegations the plaintiffs are making became irrelevant once ACIP made its recommendation Gomez told CHD TV When we filed our lawsuit Rutgers was already doing clinical trials for Pfizer Moderna and Johnson Johnson s COVID 19 vaccine which meant the university had an incredible financial stake in not only seeing that these COVID vaccines are authorized or licensed but also seeing that as many people as possible are required to take them whether they want to or not Gomez told CHD TV that legal challenges like the one against Rutgers give a voice to vaccine injury victims Life appears to be normal but it isn t he said There are thousands of people who were injured by these products and those people were effectively silenced by the coalition of pharmaceutical companies and media outlets and government that all came together to decide what the truth was going to be and what the public was going to be allowed to see or not see Those people who ve been injured must be heard Otherwise Gomez said We re going to find ourselves in a situation where we don t have the right to say yes or no to what is injected into our bodies Plaintiffs attorneys acknowledged the

to understand that the public believes that the right of informed consent to medical treatment is incredibly important to them Decision could set national precedent Gomez told The Defender the court on Tuesday conducted a fair inquisitive and thorough examination of both sides positions We were very pleased with the judge s understanding of the material and the issues Gomez said he expects the court will issue its decision within several months He told CHD TV the 3rd Circuit can decide the case based strictly on New Jersey law and the authority or statutes that affect Rutgers University specifically or it can decide the case on broader grounds constitutional grounds it really depends on how the court wants to address the issues that we raised in the appeal The best case scenario he said is for 3rd Circuit to decide the District Court erred when it dismissed the lawsuit and to send it back to the District Court in a posture that supports our positions and a posture that allows us to go back to the District Court Gomez added stating that this would then allow the lawsuit to proceed to the discovery phase Conversely the worst case scenario according to Gomez would be if the 3rd Circuit interprets Supreme Court precedent in Jacobson v Massachusetts 1905 in such a way that anyone can issue a vaccine mandate and it has to be followed and an individual doesn t have the right or the dignity to decide what gets injected into their bodies or under what circumstances they lose that right In this instance Gomez said CHD will appeal to the U S Supreme Court Gomez said that the legal precedent in the Massachusetts case was decided over a century ago when our rights were very different He said 100 years worth of precedent have shaped citizens rights since then including identify ing and recogniz ing the right to informed consent as a constitutional right Another difference with the circumstances of the Jacobson case according to Gomez is that at the time the smallpox

know where to begin or even how to be objective It s been my feeling that until the trailing edge gets more informed nothing is going to change much Regular folks have to be able to push their indoctrinated primary care physicians to challenge their own understanding Once enough doctors start to question the narrative coming from the CDC and the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA these

of HHS Some Questions I Am Asking Five Years Out from COVID As the majority of the medical community watched in disbelief and horror as Robert F Kennedy Jr collected the necessary Senate votes required for his appointment to head public health in this country others of us held our breath never expecting that such a much needed referendum on the science could ever occur so quickly We as medical professionals are losing the public s trust While we would like to think it is because of dangerous misinformation spreaders like Kennedy the reality is that we haven t earned it Mistakes were made during the pandemic but were they really so excusable I argue that they were not While we may disagree about what was known and when the reality is that if the public doesn t trust medical authorities any future breakthrough miraculous or not will be of little value because few will trust it We have to regain the public s trust and that can only happen if we take an open and sincere look at what happened over the last five years It is unfortunate that the Senate voted almost unanimously along party lines As expected this was used to politicize his appointment The truth is that very few if any of these Senators were equipped to judge a man I believe whose understanding of the literature and regulatory processes far exceeded theirs In that sense Kennedy s appointment was a testament to the sway the new President has over his party My point which I will defend below is that the Senate got it right but for reasons they were unaware of First I want to dispel the idea that

has no medical training it disqualifies him as a legitimate Secretary of HHS Going back 40 years only three of the last 10 HHS Secretaries Drs Tom Price Louis Sullivan and Otis Bowen were medical doctors Like most doctors I am well versed in topics in my own specialty but defer to the CDC around matters of public health I have vaccinated my children in compliance with the CDC s childhood immunization schedule I never once questioned their opinion and recommendations until COVID Why did then Secretary of HHS Alex Azar an attorney and former Eli Lilly Company executive declare on February 4 2020 that the SARS COV2 virus posed a significant threat to the security of the country before there was even a single COVID 19 death in America This declaration allowed the FDA to preemptively open the door for an Emergency Use Authorization EUA for future countermeasures i e mRNA vaccines well before such a product was available to undergo safety and efficacy trials On the same day Azar invoked the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness PREP act to provide liability immunity for activities related to medical countermeasures against COVID 19 Taken together the EUA and PREP acts allowed the FDA to loosen their standards around the testing of the eventual mRNA products while granting manufacturers of them an airtight liability shield if any harm resulted from their use We as physicians and medical professionals should have been very interested in how Pfizer conducted their trials in the summer and autumn of 2020 The Pfizer formulation which was authorized in December 2020 boasted a 95 efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID 19 It was a miracle of modern medicine But was it Though not reported in the seminal paper in the NEJM by Polack et al Pfizer investigators tested only one in 20 participants who expressed COVID symptoms in their trial This was made clear to the FDA s VRBPAC Vaccine and Related Biological Product Advisory Committee in a memorandum page 41 Suspected Covid 19 Cases weeks before authorization discussions took place The impressive 95 efficacy was based on 170 cases of COVID 19 in the trial participants However more than

accurately determining medium or long term safety signals And yet the public was repeatedly assured that these products have undergone rigorous safety testing None of my physician colleagues ever scrutinized the trial results Perhaps this was excusable given the exigency of the situation However I was shocked to discover that few doctors were able to answer basic questions their patients should have been asking For example what does 95 efficacy mean And what are the chances that vaccination will protect an individual from hospitalization from COVID 19 What are the long term risks of these products Reports of serious adverse events began to come into the CDC s VAERS Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System a system that had been proven by a paper sanctioned by the CDC itself which concluded that fewer than 1 of vaccine adverse events are reported Very few of these reports were investigated by the CDC and were thus ignored because they are unconfirmed As of January 1 2025 VAERS has received more than 22 000 reports of death following COVID 19 vaccination in the U S and her territories a number I encourage readers to confirm themselves How many of them are valid How many more have gone unreported We simply do not know An intense campaign to dismiss and suppress reports of potentially significant and widespread harm proved extremely effective In the autumn of 2021 when adolescents between the ages of 12 17 became eligible to receive the mRNA vaccines parents in my own small community outside of Boston readily complied with the CDC s advice Approximately 200 of the 250 eligible adolescents in my town had received at least one dose of the primary series when two families contacted me They knew I was a physician who urged caution around these products They each had a child who needed to be hospitalized for acute myocarditis within a few days of receiving their first shot These are anecdotes of course However neither family was willing to share what happened

of 2021 to work for his organization Children s Health Defense as the Senior Science Editor for The Defender its online publication Since my return to clinical medicine I have asked dozens of the health care professionals I work with a question Not one doctor or nurse I spoke with knew that if a child that suffers harm from a vaccine on the childhood immunization schedule that the manufacturer cannot be held liable for damages Why is that There is no other product medical or otherwise that enjoys that kind of legal protection This protection was offered to the industry in 1986 through an act of Congress known as The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act Twenty five years later the Supreme Court upheld such blanket protection in Bruesewitz vs Wyeth LLC Notably in an amicus briefing submitted to the SCOTUS the American Medical Association the American Academy of Pediatrics and 20 other physician and public Health organizations explained that by eliminating the threat of most lawsuits the Vaccine Injury Act has prevented manufacturers from abandoning the vaccine market thus ensuring a stable supply of vaccines However our own medical organizations also conceded that prior to 1986 while some vaccine injured children received multimillion dollar awards others received none In response The Vaccine Injury Act established a National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program which according to the briefing has issued more than 2 400 awards totaling over 1 8 billion between 1989 and 2010 While this is not an admission that vaccines are harmful it carries the assumption that the benefits of vaccination far exceed risks It is an assumption which seemed reasonable four decades ago when children were required to receive only a dozen shots There was no epidemic of childhood chronic disease then There is now and our children receive more than 70 While the concomitant rise in chronic disease and vaccine load does not prove causality we should be able to acknowledge that if

response and public concern about the safety and utility of the CDC s immunization schedule is what has propelled Kennedy to the top of the DHHS Are we going to support the deep dives into the data

globally yet fewer than 20 have been tested for toxicity A new study suggests this increased exposure to chemicals is behind the rise in chronic disease neurodevelopment disorders and childhood cancers You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Story at a glance Chronic diseases in children are increasing dramatically with childhood cancers up 35 from 50 years ago and neurodevelopmental disorders now affecting 1 in 6 children An estimated 350 000 manufactured chemicals exist globally with production growing 50 fold since 1950 and expected to triple by 2050 yet fewer than 20 have been tested for toxicity Current regulations like the Toxic Substances Control Act TSCA and Registration Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals REACH fail to adequately protect children as chemical companies aren t required to prove safety before market release and face minimal oversight Children are uniquely vulnerable to chemical exposure due to their developing bodies and higher exposure rates with effects often appearing years after initial exposure While individual actions like avoiding plastics help major regulatory reform is needed to address the growing impact of synthetic chemicals on children s health Chronic noncommunicable diseases are on the rise in children Asthma obesity and even certain childhood cancers now occur far more frequently than they did a few generations ago According to a major study published in The New England Journal of Medicine NEJM by the Consortium for Children s Environmental Health these diseases now rank among the leading causes of illness and death for young people The study points out that environmental pollution and exposure to synthetic chemicals are widespread suggesting that these chemicals produced in huge quantities from fossil fuels are key factors driving this increase Why chronic diseases in children are on the rise Chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes are often thought of as conditions that affect adults However the NEJM study explains that children today are developing noncommunicable diseases at alarming rates These diseases are caused by a mix of factors including genetics lifestyle and environmental exposures Synthetic chemicals appear to be a key part of this picture especially since children face unique risks during the early stages of growth One example the study highlights is the significant rise in childhood cancers estimated at around 35 more cases than seen half a century ago It also reports that male reproductive birth defects have doubled in frequency These trends suggest that children s bodies which are still developing are less capable of defending against chemicals found in everything from food packaging to household

now becoming disturbingly common The study contrasts this surge in child health problems with patterns in adults where deaths and disabilities linked to certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases have decreased over time Better screening and treatments help explain the improvements in older populations In children however environmental factors appear to be overshadowing any of the benefits that have helped adults This gives you a clue that today s generation of children are living in environments filled with new synthetic substances that pose unprecedented risks When a disease begins during childhood it alters a child s quality of life for decades as many of these childhood onset diseases carry into adulthood Synthetic chemicals are everywhere The NEJM paper notes that an estimated 350 000 manufactured chemicals mixtures and plastics exist in global inventories Many of these substances are derived from fossil fuels such as gas oil and coal Production of synthetic chemicals has grown 50 fold since 1950 is increasing by roughly 3 every year and is expected to triple by 2050 If you think about the sheer numbers it s no surprise that children come into contact with these chemicals everywhere from plastic toys and bottles to upholstered furniture carpeting and electronics As noted by the authors once these chemicals enter the market they often spread into the air water and soil Environmental pollution is now so widespread that even remote corners of the planet show signs of contamination Because these pollutants travel long distances in air and water you cannot assume that living far from industrial centers guarantees safety Moreover these substances are found in everyday items like household cleaners shampoos and lotions and repeated exposure from multiple products adds up over time Disturbingly as noted in the NEJM paper unlike pharmaceuticals most synthetic chemicals are not required to prove they are safe before they are sold Fewer than 20 have been tested for toxicity and even fewer have been studied for their possible effects on infants and children This lack of oversight leads to a situation where health impacts often only become

the time scientists uncover harmful effects many kids have already been exposed for years on end Delaying action on childhood health can lead to serious issues like asthma developmental delays or even cancer emerging years after the damage is done The evidence behind chemicals and disease in children The NEJM paper illustrates that the link between chemicals and children s health issues is not just based on theory Researchers have tied several childhood diseases to specific synthetic chemicals over the years Some of the most striking evidence comes from well documented events the tragedy at Minamata Japan for example where mercury contaminated fish eaten by pregnant women led to severe neurologic damage in babies or the cases of mothers taking diethylstilbestrol who remained healthy themselves while their daughters faced a higher risk of reproductive cancers These episodes demonstrated that chemicals cross the placenta and cause serious harm to babies even if the mother appears fine Another incident was the thalidomide disaster where pregnant women in the 1950s and early 1960s took a sedative that caused severe limb defects in more than 10 000 infants worldwide Thalidomide was a turning point in understanding that children and fetuses are especially sensitive to chemicals even at low or short term exposure These events helped shape the field of environmental pediatrics giving researchers a framework to investigate how and why chemicals harm children during key windows of development Today scientists use prospective birth cohort studies to measure chemical exposures in pregnant women and follow their children s health for many years Such studies have revealed links between phthalates found in plastics and personal care products and male reproductive disorders and between certain pesticides or flame retardants and lower IQ scores or neurodevelopmental issues When multiple studies in different locations find similar patterns the evidence becomes hard to dismiss In many cases parents show no obvious harm yet their children suffer health consequences linked to chemical exposures that occurred in the womb Further harm can appear at different times in life Some birth defects or cancers show up early but others such as obesity fertility problems or cardiovascular disease arise years later The NEJM study underscores that this delayed effect makes it easy to miss the true cause If your child develops asthma at age 7 or 8 it s not obvious if a chemical exposure in infancy or even before birth played a role This timing gap", "chunk_id":

environment doesn t become clear for decades which is why stronger prevention efforts are so important Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Why today s laws are failing children The NEJM paper also offers a sobering look at the limitations of current regulations The federal TSCA in the U S was meant to protect the public and the environment from unreasonable risks but experts say it has not lived up to that promise One major shortcoming is that companies producing new chemicals do not have to prove these substances are safe before putting them on the market Instead government regulators must prove a chemical is harmful which is a slow and costly process You might assume that once a hazard is known authorities would step in quickly However very few chemicals have actually been banned or heavily restricted in the nearly 50 years since TSCA first became law Many that were suspected of causing harm lingered for years while manufacturers disputed the science or withheld data under the banner of trade secrets As noted by the authors chemical companies receive government subsidies and enjoy broad legal protections giving them few incentives to reduce production or invest in safer alternatives In the European Union the REACH framework promises more rigorous oversight Unfortunately REACH also falls short the study highlights in part because it allows industry supplied data to serve as a basis for safety with minimal quality checks from independent labs Thus while Europe has banned or restricted more chemicals than the U S the overall outcome remains similar tens of thousands of substances in use with limited real world testing and oversight Most policies also consider chemicals one at a time overlooking the fact that you and your children are exposed to a soup of chemicals every day They also rarely account for children s greater vulnerability Because children have smaller bodies and developing organ systems a dose that s harmless to an adult is often harmful to a child If a hazardous chemical stays on the market for decades it does a lot of damage before regulators step in By then an entire generation has grown up

might have heard about leaded gasoline For decades lead was added to fuel to improve engine performance leading to widespread contamination By the 1970s scientists realized that it had driven up blood lead levels in children across the U S The paper points out that this exposure caused a measurable drop in average IQ scores among those born in that era When lead was finally phased out of gasoline children s blood lead levels fell and average IQ scores improved This example shows that when harmful substances are removed from circulation significant public health benefits often follow Although it s difficult to eliminate all exposures there are still meaningful steps to reduce your exposure at home Plastics are a major culprit so replace plastic containers and bottles with stainless steel or glass especially for foods and beverages If you are repainting a room look for low or no VOC paint since volatile organic compounds irritate airways and have toxic effects Further reduce your reliance on harsh chemical cleaning products Even simple moves such as using fragrance free detergents and soaps reduce the amount of undisclosed chemicals in your and your child s environment Beyond personal choices advocate for bigger changes The NEJM paper makes it clear that our laws need a major overhaul Contact local representatives or support organizations that push for stricter limits on chemicals in consumer goods In addition look for companies that are transparent about their product ingredients Some businesses have begun engaging in what s called chemical footprint reporting which means they openly track and share information about the chemicals in their supply chains When you shop with these brands or ask for safer products you send a message that children s health is more important than corporate secrecy Integrative medical professionals are another helpful resource If your child has asthma or a developmental concern ask your holistic pediatrician if chemical exposures are playing a role and whether they have testing referrals or advice on reducing exposures Open communication with your child s health care providers makes it easier to spot early issues before they

was a student of the high school Obudai Arpad Gimnazium In 1953 he obtained a diploma in chemistry from the Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest He worked for three years as an associate scientist at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences before the Hungarian revolution against Soviet control in 1956 After the failed revolution Pusztai escaped to a refugee camp in Austria and from there made his way to England He completed his doctorate in biochemistry at the Lister Institute in London In 1963 he was invited to join the Protein Research Department at the Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen Scotland Pusztai worked at the Rowett Institute for the next 36 years predominately studying plant lectins During that time he discovered glycoproteins in plants authored more than 270 research papers published three books and was considered an internationally renowned expert on lectins Pusztai was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1998 and has received fellowships from the Leverhulme Trust A DOCUMENTARY BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE Watch Now I first communicated with Pusztai by email in 2003 I was attempting to educate my U S senator on the adverse effects of GMOs genetically modified organisms on mammals I had followed Pusztai s research since first hearing about it in1998 While doing investigative work about GMOs I came across his email address I subsequently sent him an email in hopes that he would respond To my surprise I received a reply within three hours This was the beginning of an amazing opportunity for me as I had not yet directly connected with any research scientists who were concerned about the damaging effects of GMOs My study of GMO crops began in1994 and my on farm research began in 1997 I had the extreme privilege of communicating with Pusztai and more importantly gaining a full understanding of the mechanisms of how GMOs were made and what was responsible for causing the damaging effects on mammals I was subsequently and fortunately mentored by Pusztai for many years Pusztai was a wise and caring man and even though he had tremendous accomplishments he was humble and simultaneously able to stand his ground and

destroying their careers Thanks to Pusztai s insistence on one component of our pig study with Judy Carman Ph D we discovered the extreme behavior differences between the GMO fed pigs and the non GMO fed pigs This is a little known fact yet today because of the refusal to allow its mention in our scientific study published in 2013 The editor of the scientific journal that published the pig study refused any mention of this surprising finding Today I am aware of numerous examples of such extremes in behavior differences in multiple species of animals that are consuming GMO feedstuffs This information has been relayed by a number of nutritionists and veterinarians across North America who are capable of seeing what they look at Is it plausible to believe that GMOs could be having the same effect s on people especially children I will always remember one specific comment Pusztai made to me in the first phone conversation I was privileged to have with him He said I cannot believe how unknowing and uncaring the people in your country are about the food they put in their body How true that was then and regrettably still is today I am truly blessed to have known Pusztai and to

According to the University of Cincinnati researchers who developed the tool Despite COVID 19 vaccine mandates many chose to forgo vaccination raising questions about the psychology underlying how judgment affects these choices You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A team of researchers has developed a powerful new tool in artificial intelligence AI that can predict if someone is or isn t likely to get a COVID 19 vaccine According to the University of Cincinnati the new AI tool uses a small set of data from demographics and personal judgments such as aversion to risk or loss to identify reward and aversion judgment patterns in humans that may help explain one s willingness to get vaccinated The researchers presented their findings in a study published Tuesday in the Journal of Medical Internet Research Public Health and Surveillance The study s findings could have broad applications for predicting mental health and result in more effective public health campaigns the university said According to the study Despite COVID 19 vaccine mandates many chose to forgo vaccination raising questions about the psychology underlying how judgment affects these choices The researchers claim their findings demonstrate the underlying importance of judgment variables for vaccine choice and uptake suggesting that vaccine education and messaging might target varying judgment profiles to improve uptake But critics like Brian Hooker Ph D chief scientific officer for Children s Health Defense said that the new technology implies that those who question vaccines have mental health problems The whole implication here is that nonconformity to the government propaganda machine s standard of care makes one some type of mental case or extreme outlier The whole thing smacks of a Brave New World where potentially non compliant individuals are targeted with messaging based on fear and irrationality Hooker said the new technology is a prefabricated substitute to what Big Pharma and government health agencies avoid rational discussions of science and medicine that might expose the truth about vaccine adverse events Using AI to target the vaccine hesitant Nicole Vike Ph D senior research associate at the University of Cincinnati s College of Engineering and Applied Science was the paper s lead author COVID 19 is unlikely to be the last pandemic we see in the next decades Vike said Having a new form of AI for prediction in public health provides a valuable tool that could help prepare hospitals for predicting vaccination rates and consequential infection rates

claims and also said they were worried about the potential adverse uses of this technology The main problem with research like this is the underlying premise Vaccine hesitancy must be accounted for in terms of the aberrant psychology of the subjects and not with reference to the efficacy and safety of the vaccine s in question said Michael Rectenwald Ph D author of Google Archipelago The Digital Gulag and the Simulation of Freedom As a result Rectenwald said it s implied that if people are vaccine hesitant the fault is endemic to them rather than to the vaccine itself From this premise the research seeks to justify vaccination as normal by linking anomalous mental and psychological characteristics with vaccine hesitancy This may lead to individuals being targeted Rectenwald said Using AI to predict vaccine hesitancy on these terms might include mobilizing AI programs to target and even identify individually vaccine hesitant subjects We might also expect AI programs that seek to overcome vaccine hesitancy with attempts to reprogram said defective subjects At the very least identifying targeting and re educating vaccine hesitant subjects is in the offing Scott C Tips president of the National Health Federation said the new technology poses privacy concerns Tips said It is nobody s business but that of the individual as to whether he or she wants to be vaccinated Why does anyone need to predict health decisions Predictive AI on this issue is nothing but a solution looking for a problem There is no problem here In fact we should be glad that there are people who do not want to be vaccinated Similarly Dr Kat Lindley president of the Global Health Project and director of the Global COVID Summit agreed There are many reasons why someone may be vaccine hesitant and

re defining as a vaccine than to do the safety studies the public has been crying out for said Valerie Borek associate director and lead policy analyst for Stand For Health Freedom This study fits the decades long approach to using psychology and our subconscious to push products and agendas she said There is already technology that can assess biometric data such as heart rate temperature and eye movements combined with audio and location information Citing an example Borek said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention already has a record of using cellphone data for public health surveillance Borek added The government has too much data to comb through so the use of AI is inevitable for public health surveillance How long before the devices we voluntarily wear and carry are used for AI predictions of our health choices Will those predictions lead to any governmental interventions We need to ask these questions of our lawmakers and do what we can to minimize our digital

University of Cincinnati s announcement the development of the new AI tool was based on a survey conducted in the U S in 2021 involving a representative sample of 3 476 adults Respondents provided information such as where they live income highest education level completed ethnicity and access to the internet Participants were asked if they had received a COVID 19 vaccine with approximately 73 of respondents reporting they were vaccinated slightly more than the 70 of the nation s population that had been vaccinated in 2021 according to the study They were then asked to rate how much they liked or disliked a randomly sequenced set of 48 pictures on a seven point scale of 3 to 3 to quantify mathematical features of people s judgments as they observe mildly emotional stimuli The judgment variables and demographics were compared between respondents who were vaccinated and those who were not Three machine learning approaches were used to test how well the respondents judgment demographics and attitudes toward COVID 19 precautions predicted whether they would get the vaccine the announcement states According to the study a small set of demographic variables and 15 judgment variables were identified which predict vaccine uptake with moderate to high accuracy and high precision The announcement says these findings show that artificial intelligence can make accurate predictions about human attitudes with surprisingly little data or reliance on expensive and time consuming clinical assessments The same announcement quoted Aggelos Katsaggelos Ph D endowed professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Northwestern University who claimed The study is anti big data because the new technology can work very simply and without the need for super computation It s inexpensive and can be applied with anyone who has a smartphone We refer to it as computational cognition AI It is likely you will be seeing other applications regarding alterations in judgment in the very near future Katsaggelos said Lindley disagreed She told The Defender Calling this anti big data is an oxymoron because to be able to claim a high level of accuracy the program

meeting of the World Economic Forum WEF in January Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla praised the role of AI in the development of Paxlovid a prescription oral medication marketed as a treatment for COVID 19 It was developed in four months Bourla said whereas development of such a drug usually takes four years He said AI helped significantly reduce the amount of time needed for the drug discovery process where you really synthesize millions of molecules and then you try to discover within them which one works Bourla credited this breakthrough with saving millions of lives and predicted more such developments in the future Our job is to make breakthroughs that change patients lives Bourla said With AI I can do it faster and I can do it better I truly believe that we are about to enter a scientific renaissance in life sciences because of this coexistence of advancements in technology and biology Bourla added AI is a very powerful tool In the hands of bad people it can do bad things for the world but in the hands of good people it can do great things for the world During the same WEF panel discussion Jeremy Hunt the United Kingdom s chancellor of the Exchequer said AI could lead to the rapid development and deployment of vaccines When we have the next pandemic we don t want to have to wait a year before we get the vaccine he said If AI can shrink the time it takes to get that vaccine to a month then that is a massive step forward for humanity A WEF project first announced in 2019 is funding research on the use of synthetic AI generated patients and synthetic clinical trial

must carry a warning label stating they may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children As a result many major food companies reformulated their products in Europe using natural colorings like paprika and beet juice In the U S however the same brands continue to use petroleum based dyes without warning labels Behavioral effects are consistent CSPI emphasized that multiple clinical trials have confirmed what many parents already suspect synthetic dyes worsen hyperactivity and reduce impulse control in children Even children without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD are affected Several dyes are still approved despite links to cancer and allergic reactions According to CSPI Blue 1 is used in thousands of products and has been linked to neuron

concluded that commonly used food dyes including Red 40 Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 are strongly associated with behavioral issues particularly in children already diagnosed with ADHD Children with existing behavioral conditions are especially vulnerable OEHHA s findings showed that children who already struggle with attention hyperactivity or impulse control are at even greater risk when exposed to artificial dyes Even relatively small amounts of dye within limits still legally allowed by the FDA were found to trigger negative behavioral responses The effects are more than just short term hyperactivity While hyperactivity is the most well known symptom associated with dye exposure the report detailed a broader pattern of disruption Children exposed to dyes showed problems with working memory and impulse control These are core functions necessary for academic success and emotional resilience The OEHHA concluded that food dye exposure impacts neurobehavior in children Parents have no way to track how much dye their children consume The lack of mandatory labeling of the quantity of dye in foods is another concern Ingredients like Red 40 or Yellow 5 may be listed but no amounts are disclosed leaving parents with no reliable way to measure their child s exposure This lack of transparency makes it nearly impossible to stay under FDA recommended daily limits even if parents are actively trying to do so Research links food dyes to behavioral harm A 2024 peer reviewed study investigated how synthetic food dyes impact overall health Published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health the review examined health risks linked to synthetic food dyes in children including children with autism ADHD and those without diagnosed behavioral conditions The research revealed widespread behavioral and biological effects The review found that artificial dyes are associated with multiple adverse outcomes such as allergic reactions gastrointestinal and respiratory problems and significant behavioral disruptions in children both with and without behavioral disorders These dyes were also linked to cancer causing DNA damaging and cell damaging effects Some dyes disrupt neurotransmitter function The review noted that Red 3 interferes with neurodevelopment and contributes to cognitive and learning problems Synthetic dyes often

Even medications and vitamins contain unsafe dye levels It s not only junk food that s the culprit Over the counter children s medications and vitamins often contain synthetic dyes in concentrations that exceed FDA safety thresholds In some cases cough syrups delivered nearly triple the acceptable daily intake for Red 40 per serving How to protect yourself and your family from harmful food dyes If you ve been eating processed foods without checking the label there s a good chance you ve been exposed to artificial dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 5 These synthetic color additives interfere with core biological functions and contribute to a wide range of health problems Whether you re trying to support your child s health or take back control of what goes into your body here are three concrete actions to take starting today 1 Read every ingredient list even on healthy packaged foods You d be shocked how often food dyes show up in yogurts sports drinks and flavored waters They re not just in candy and soda If you see names like Red 40 Yellow 5 Blue 1 or FD C followed by a color and number put it back If you re shopping for your kids know that many children s snacks are loaded with these additives even the ones marketed as natural This first step is awareness every label counts 2 Switch to dye free alternatives and whole foods There are dye free versions of nearly every product sometimes it s just a matter of choosing a store brand or organic label I recommend choosing foods with recognizable whole ingredients Fruits vegetables and unprocessed meats don t need added colors to look appetizing For color in homemade treats use turmeric beet juice spirulina or paprika These are natural sources of pigment that won t harm your health 3 Make food swaps a family game not a punishment If you re a parent or caregiver getting children off dyed foods might sound challenging but you don t have to go cold turkey Start with a fun challenge Let s find the best tasting snack

dyes is one of the simplest and most effective steps you can take FAQs about artificial food dyes Q What are synthetic food dyes and where are they found A Synthetic food dyes like Red 40 Yellow 5 and Blue 1 are petroleum derived chemicals found in over 36 000 processed foods children s snacks medications and vitamins They serve no nutritional purpose and are used purely for cosmetic appeal Q What health risks are associated with artificial food dyes A Artificial dyes are linked to behavioral issues especially in children hyperactivity attention difficulties allergic reactions and cancer Red 3 is a known carcinogen while Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 contain trace amounts of cancer causing chemicals Q Why are these dyes still allowed in U S food products A The FDA s safety thresholds are based on decades old data and current regulations prioritize proof of harm over proof of safety The FDA only recently banned Red 3 in food in January despite acknowledging its risks over 30 years ago Q How do other countries regulate artificial food dyes A Europe requires warning labels on foods containing certain dyes stating they may affect activity and attention in children This has led many food companies to reformulate their European products with natural colorings while continuing to use synthetic dyes in U S versions Q How can families reduce exposure to harmful food dyes A Families can protect themselves by reading all ingredient lists even on healthy foods choosing dye free alternatives switching to whole foods using natural colorants like turmeric and beet juice and making food

vaccine related aluminum exposure and persistent asthma in children 24 59 months old Overall kids in the study who received 3 milligrams or more of vaccine related aluminum had at least a 36 higher risk of developing persistent asthma than kids who got less than 3 the study s lead author Dr Matthew F Daley told The Associated Press Daley was quick to urge caution in the interpretation of the results telling STAT I m still going to advocate for vaccines as strongly as I did before we had these findings The study was published in the medical journal Academic Pediatrics In addition to Daley the authors included Dr Frank DeStefano and other current and former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC staff The authors were careful to not suggest a causal relationship between vaccine related aluminum and asthma and noted that additional investigation of this hypothesis appears warranted According to the study authors Aluminum is integral to many vaccines enhancing immunogenicity and effectiveness Aluminum adjuvants have a well established safety profile and are used in many vaccines given in early childhood The CDC undertook the study in response to a call in 2013 from the Institute of Medicine now known as the National Academy of Medicine for more federal research into the safety of childhood vaccines including their use of aluminum CDC makes major concession on aluminum asthma risk Commenting on the significance of the CDC funded study Brian Hooker Ph D P E Children s Health Defense chief scientific officer told The Defender I find this very interesting and there are some concessions in the paper that I would have never believed that the CDC would make asthma correlated with aluminum exposure in both children with eczema and children without eczema Hooker added The CDC states it right in the abstract albeit their hazards ratios reported in the abstract are the lowest of all of those obtained in the study Hooker also noted the CDC never did a comparison study with children who weren t exposed to aluminum at all in their vaccines A true comparison should be done between the maximum aluminum exposure at 2 years of age which is about 4 mg

fully adjusted model in which the agency did not see a significant relationship between vaccine related aluminum exposure and persistent asthma in children My guess is that they ll use the insignificant result to sidestep any further discussion on aluminum adjuvants in infant vaccines he said That is their method of choice and has been in the past Christopher Exley Ph D an expert on aluminum toxicity agreed the study will likely not result in altering the use of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines Exley who wrote a book on the topic conducted many studies while a professor of bioinorganic chemistry at Keele University in the U K and writes a Substack newsletter on the toxicity of aluminum Anyone reading this study should hang fire on thinking that this is a change in thinking concerning vaccines and their safety Exley told The Defender It is a classic aluminum industry study appearing to surrender some possible toxicity of aluminum in vaccines while actually delivering multiple messages signaling the safety of aluminum in general Exley added The idea is to concede the smallest possible ground on aluminum toxicity and at the same time reinforcing what they want readers to think by citing multiple papers by stooges and those working directly for the aluminum industry a classic example being where the authors look to reinforce that ingested aluminum is not a health issue in infants Dr Paul Offit a member of the U S Food and Drug Administration s vaccine advisory panel told The Associated Press he was worried the study will needlessly scare some

showed to be incorrect once absorption rates are considered Lyons Weiler who co authored a study suggesting unvaccinated children are healthier than vaccinated children said Offit ignores massive amounts of peer reviewed research in his assessment of aluminum toxicity What the authors did The authors of the observational study examined health data from 326 991 children born between the start of 2008 and the end of 2014 who received care at seven sites across the U S that participate in the Vaccine Safety Datalink a network of health institutions that partner with the CDC to study vaccine safety The authors divided the children into two groups those who had eczema by 12 months of age and those who did not since children with eczema might be predisposed to develop asthma at a higher rate than children who don t have eczema regardless of how much exposure either group had to aluminum in vaccines If there s any relationship between aluminum and asthma it could look different in kids with eczema than kids without eczema Daley told STAT The authors then examined data on how many vaccinations each child received before they turned 2 and used those data to estimate each child s exposure to aluminum Finally they looked at which children had developed persistent asthma between the ages of 2 and 5 defined by the authors as one inpatient or 2 outpatient asthma encounters and 2 long term asthma control medication dispenses The authors found a positive association between cumulative vaccine associated aluminum before age 24 months and persistent asthma at age 24 through 59 months among children with and without eczema CDC sticks to aluminum in vaccines is safe narrative The CDC says on its Vaccine Safety website that adjuvants such as aluminum salts have been used safely in vaccines for decades However the authors continued data from animal studies suggest the theoretical possibility that aluminum adjuvants could influence allergy risk through inducing a T

form AstraZeneca amended the form to state that its vaccine may cause neurological disorders such as demyelinating disease which could cause substantial disability or death if not treated promptly Within hours of getting her first dose Dressen experienced tingling in her right arm a neurological condition known as paresthesia and blurred vision and vomiting In the ensuing weeks her condition worsened with the paresthesia spreading to her legs resulting in disability and multiple diagnoses indicating her symptoms were related to her vaccination This included a diagnosis in 2021 by the National Institutes of Health NIH of post vaccine neuropathy which NIH neurologists said caused Dressen s dysautonomia and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy Dressen who was 39 when she was vaccinated was previously a preschool teacher but is now unable to work In May AstraZeneca announced the withdrawal of its COVID 19 vaccine globally though the company said it based its decision on the surplus of available updated vaccines resulting in reduced demand for its vaccine The vaccine generated over 5 8 billion in sales globally with the help of the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation which funded and promoted the vaccine in other countries Several countries later stopped administering the AstraZeneca vaccine due to safety concerns In an ongoing class action lawsuit in the United Kingdom U K against AstraZeneca plaintiffs allege that they were injured or their family members died after getting the shot In documents AstraZeneca submitted to the U K High Court earlier this year the company admitted that its COVID 19 vaccine can in very rare cases cause TTS vaccine induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome which causes the body to produce life threatening blood clots According to The Telegraph the U K s Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme has approved 175 applications claiming harm caused by the COVID 19 vaccines at a set amount of 120 000 pounds approximately 156 000

Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS which is where adverse events caused by COVID 19 jabs in the U S are supposed to be collected lists 26 693 deaths along with 147 677 hospitalizations in association with the COVID 19 shot There are also 13 677 heart attacks and 38 024 cases of myocarditis inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis inflammation of the tissue sac surrounding the heart Myocarditis and pericarditis cause symptoms such as chest pain shortness of breath and a fluttering or pounding heart Cases have occurred most often after mRNA COVID 19 injections Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna particularly in male adolescents and young adults according to the CDC Further myocarditis occurs more often after the second injection usually within a week Past investigations have shown only between 1 and 10 of adverse reactions are ever reported to VAERS which is a passive voluntary reporting system so the actual number could be much higher Kyle Warner is one athlete who

adverse vaccine reactions seen among their patients Warner who is 29 years old was at the peak of his career as a professional mountain bike racer when in June 2021 he got his second dose of Pfizer s

not get a COVID vaccine the sheer numbers clearly point to the only obvious cause Initially many of these were not reported We know that many people were told not to tell anyone about their adverse

by a Biden administration Executive Order pledging to protect 30 of land and water by 2030 by bringing it under federal control That protection she said intends for land to have very restricted use It would stop farmers from using land and would require the acquisition of 300 million acres by the federal government This is not about conservation Byfield said this is about control She said the program is linked to a plan by companies like the Intrinsic Exchange Group to monetize and trade on land but also on natural processes like photosynthesis and pollination an agenda pushed by

regenerative agriculture Several speakers including Dr John Day herbalist Sara Woods Kender Joel Salatin and Leigh Merinoff shared everyday strategies for farming buying food preparing food living off

practice Speakers including Richard Cook Lt Col Tommy Waller Sagdal and Judith MgGeary addressed macro level changes that could happen at the policy level to guarantee food sovereignty and food security For example McGeary talked about how she and others worked to successfully block electronic tagging of livestock that would have mandated the tagging of every farm animal driving up costs for small farmers and allowing for surveillance of every animal related farm transaction concentrating profits for Big Agriculture companies Now she said the USDA has initiated a project to mandate electronic tags for cattle and bison crossing state lines and if it isn t stopped it will continue to expand to surveil all animals from birth to death This program and the way it promotes big

Doctors were forced to guess at which treatments might work while hospitals reported shortages of face masks and other personal protective equipment On March 19 2020 California s governor Gavin Newsom was the first to issue a statewide stay at home order Most other states soon followed suit For more than three years the country remained under a COVID 19 public health emergency And during this time the federal government states counties schools and businesses enacted a wide range of mitigation measures to keep people alive and healthy But what were the benefits of these efforts and did they outweigh the costs The answer is far from clear according to Stephen Macedo and Frances Lee political scientists at Princeton University In their forthcoming book In Covid s Wake How Our Politics Failed Us they argue that many pandemic era policies were not grounded in evidence and were undertaken without properly weighing their potential to cause harm Educated elites in particular exercised much power under Covid and made some serious mistakes including adopting a partisan mindset write Macedo and Lee Now they are asking their fellow academics as well as journalists to look back and

planted in 2022 when one of you Stephen Macedo was investigating political polarization and public policy Can you talk more about how it led you to focus on COVID 19 Stephen Macedo My basic thought was that public deliberation was being degraded by extreme polarization which includes affective polarization as political scientists call it mutual loathing on both sides of the political spectrum We weren t taking seriously even as academics as researchers as people trying to discover the truth arguments on the other side My belief was that the whole truth is not on one side of the political

that these efforts might not work against a respiratory virus and could cause downstream harms Yet in March 2020 the World Health Organization s director general asserted that if countries detect test

Organization had sent a mission to China in late January 2020 They spent only a week there They wrote up their report at the end of that week having done a sort of light dive into the country guided by the Chinese They seemed to have believed everything that the Chinese told them and wrote a report that endorsed China s strategy fulsomely without reservation for the entire world Simply taking the claims of the Chinese authority on trust was just crazy A kind of malfeasance That report was released in February 2020 China was already well shut down by that point Italy then adopted that strategy

around the world as well as in this 50 state study that Frances did and that others have done at The Lancet and elsewhere showing that there s a lack of evidence that these measures had measurable effects No one ambiguity here is that there is some evidence that they had an effect on infection rates But there s no evidence of a significant impact on serious illness and mortality and morbidity Frances Lee There have been a few systematic reviews One from 2022 in The BMJ Open concludes that the evidence on the effectiveness of non pharmaceutical interventions remains insufficient to be actionable by policy makers So we did all these things and as we look back we don t have evidence that allows us to reject the null of no effect We can t say that they didn t have an effect We just can t conclude that there was a systematic benefit But we also don t know the pace at which the virus spread We don t even know for sure when it arrived in the U S Certainly by the time lockdowns were

different from other people Their values then can t guide the whole of society Second there s class bias here These are highly educated people for whom staying home and self isolating was much more

I m putting myself in the mind of a science journalist is that these are experts who understand the consequences of getting an infection for example Frances Lee Yes but there are tradeoffs Stephen Macedo And there were a lot of value differences around things like sporting events but also going to church For many people not being allowed to attend religious services was a severe cost which eventually the courts took some account of But there was not I think a fair weighing of what we usually consider to be a fundamental liberty It was limited constrained denied fairly cavalierly

by the lack of engagement on this question Here we are coming up on the 5th anniversary of COVID We did all this stuff Did it work I never see that I think the reason why is because it s so unclear which is very uncomfortable to confront Undark Unclear or do you think people assume that they already know the answer to the question Frances Lee Well they may assume that That may be But why no

that have dominated public discourse replacing them with a rigorous testable and biologically coherent framework Read Part 1 here Despite persistent efforts to reframe autism as a benign neurodivergence or a diagnostic abstraction the data tell a radically different story one of exponential growth expanding disability burden and increasing severity The numbers are not merely alarming they are devastating According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC 2025 report based on data from the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network the national prevalence of autism among 8 year olds rose from 1 in 36 in 2020 to 1 in 31 in 2022 representing a 17 increase in just two years The gender disparity is stark among boys the rate is 1 in 20 and in California widely regarded as having the most rigorous autism surveillance systems the number is 1 in 12 5 These are not isolated spikes or outlier data points they are the latest entries in a persistent trendline that has been climbing unbroken for decades What makes these findings even more consequential is the pattern among younger cohorts In five of the CDC s 16 study sites the autism rate among 4 year olds already exceeds that of 8 year olds strongly suggesting that future reports will show even higher national prevalence as these children age into formal diagnosis This undermines the assumption that we are merely detecting autism earlier Rather it signals that the baseline incidence continues to rise The massive scientific literature that existed 10 years ago described this trajectory as not merely an increase but a pathological acceleration one that can no longer be attributed to demographic shifts diagnostic reclassification or administrative factors In my book The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism I reviewed a huge body of peer reviewed evidence that systematically dismantles the artifact theory For example Cynthia Nevison 2014 demonstrated that even after adjusting for changes in diagnostic criteria and increased awareness the dramatic rise in autism diagnoses remains largely unexplained unless environmental exposures are included in the model

increase as slight But as Rutgers Walter Zahorodny Ph D one of the principal investigators in the CDC s own surveillance network countered Better awareness cannot be driving a disability like autism to increase by 300 in 20 years Existing science goes further pointing to population level implausibilities inherent in the artifact argument If autism rates truly had remained constant over time as

even examining this observation seriously However Holland praised efforts by U S Secretary of Health and Human Services HHS Robert F Kennedy Jr to study the problem The only good news here is that we

nationwide among children aged 8 years in 2022 4 9 for boys 5 3 in California 4 7 in Pennsylvania and autism rates a full percentage point higher in Asian and Black communities than in White communities this is beyond an epidemic The CDC study also evaluated 4 year old children who typically have lower autism rates because many of them have not yet been diagnosed and found rates among that age group also increased Four year olds born in 2018 had ASD at rates 1 7 times higher than those born in 2014 suggesting that future rates will likely be even higher In five of the CDC s 16 study areas autism rates are already higher among 4 year olds than 8 year olds Data don t support better diagnosis theory on rising autism rates The CDC and mainstream media suggest that increasing rates of autism are a result of improved diagnosis which has led to the inclusion of many more high functioning people with autism in the data collection However the data in the latest CDC report

concern has risen among parents researchers have looked to the role environmental risk factors might play in compounding underlying genetic factors that may make some children more susceptible to autism Environmental risk factors include metals like aluminum and mercury in vaccines glyphosate exposure use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and infancy heavy metals in baby food and other organic pollutants Studies also link industrial chemicals including lead arsenic copper selenium iron and magnesium to the disorder Despite growing evidence that environmental factors play a role in the development of ASD the CDC report did not mention environmental exposures as a potential cause Words that do not appear anywhere in the report toxic vaccine environment Rogers said We need better

complexity according to Martha Herbert M D Ph D a pediatric neurologist and neuroscientist Herbert who has researched autism since 1995 recently co authored a scientific review on the neuroimmunology of autism In an interview with The Defender she shared why the review matters and why she s hopeful about future autism research After earning her medical degree from Columbia University Herbert trained at Cornell New York Hospital and the Massachusetts General Hospital at Harvard Medical School She also has a doctorate from the History of Consciousness program at the University of California Santa Cruz She is the author of the public oriented Harvard Health Publications book The Autism Revolution Whole Body Strategies for Making Life All It Can Be and many scientific papers A whole body approach is imperative to understanding complex chronic illnesses such as autism Herbert told The Defender That s what she and her co authors did in their recent scientific review Her co authors include Brian Hooker Ph D Children s Health Defense CHD chief scientific officer and Jeet Varia Ph D CHD science fellow Their review was published Nov 11 on Preprints org and is undergoing peer review with Development and Psychopathology a Cambridge University Press journal The authors examined 519 studies to illustrate how autism spectrum disorder ASD affects multiple body systems including the immune digestive and central nervous systems Their findings pushed back against the notion that autism is a strictly neurological condition The review also pushed back against the idea that ASD is largely driven by genetics Herbert and her co authors contended that serious genetic problems causing autism are rare compared to common genomic vulnerabilities as in subtle changes in single nucleotide base pairs that can trigger an individual s latent vulnerability to environmental factors Those factors may include toxins in food water air consumer products and electromagnetic radiation in the environment Herbert explained Prior to the explosion of synthetic chemicals and synthetic wireless radiation in our world people s latent vulnerabilities to toxicities would have led to much

ASD are the canaries in the coal mine meaning they are responding to toxins in their environment that may eventually reach us all I think that autism is a particularly strong canary in the coal mine Herbert said because the numbers jumped so much starting in the late 1980s That s when Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 which gave vaccine manufacturers liability protection for damages arising from a vaccine related injury or death Since 1986 the number of recommended shots on the childhood vaccine schedule has greatly expanded She emphasized that although exposure to chemical toxins like pesticides and various vaccine ingredients can trigger illness so can exposure to wireless radiation In 2013 she published two peer reviewed papers co authored with Cindy Sage showing why wireless radiation exposure was likely linked to autism Historically she added there s been academic resistance to acknowledging the role environmental factors likely play in the development of ASD Narrow either or paradigms limit scientific research Herbert said academics were embroiled in what she called an either or standoff between thinking ASD was driven by genetics or environment In 2006 she was the lead author of a peer reviewed paper in NeuroToxicology that challenged that mentality The paper promoted the concept of environmental genomics and suggested that certain people appeared to be more physiologically vulnerable to certain environmental factors based on genomic differences Researchers must step beyond narrow either or paradigms if they are to accurately describe real world phenomena Herbert said Unfortunately the medical establishment has largely embraced a reductionist model that favors specialization in a niche area rather than a systems biology model Systems biology is a holistic approach to deciphering the complexity of biological systems according to the Institute for Systems Biology Herbert who considers herself a systems thinker said a lot of the medical research she witnessed was so narrowly focused that it missed the context and complexity of what it was trying to study She said The contact I ve had with people doing more conventional constrained studies suggests to me that they take for granted that they are doing research that will eventually add up to a cure but they don t really have a concept of how it will

reviewed grant proposals submitted to the National Institutes of Health NIH The NIH the nation s medical research agency is part of the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS My experience was that there might be one or a few brilliant gems she said But then the quality would steeply decline in the rest of the proposals because what they were asking for money to study wasn t really that important or incisive and didn t offer leverage into clarifying key questions Herbert said the scientific review she and her co authors conducted rises above the typical compartmentalization of academic papers by integrating many dimensions that are usually discussed separately When integration is present she explained it is easier to see how one thing or factor in one domain can have a significant influence on something at another level or aspect of biology Another major either or paradigm she witnessed in past autism research was metabolism vs genes The training of medical doctors in the institutions where I studied Columbia Cornell and Harvard was weak on metabolism Herbert was fascinated by what she learned in child neurology about metabolic disorders But the textbooks limited the discussion to people at the tails of the curves the people with severe genetic vulnerabilities that led to life constraining or even life threatening metabolic dysfunction Once she started seeing her own patients the kids and adults seldom had the severe genetic or metabolic disorders she d been trained to diagnose Instead there was a flood of symptoms like allergies rashes digestive problems sleep problems chronic infections and not only in people with autism but also in a whole range of other psychiatric and medical conditions That led her to study environmental medicine Do you

required buy in from the administration but the institution failed to provide the integrated infrastructure needed to carry out what we wanted to do However Herbert is now hopeful about the future of

children and is linked to the disruption of the gut microbiome particularly through early antibiotic exposure A study from the University of Colorado Boulder found that there s a 10 day window during early life when specific gut microbes are required for proper pancreatic beta cell development When antibiotics are given during the 10 day window they disrupt the growth of insulin producing cells and contribute to the development of Type 1 diabetes later in life Another study found that maternal use of certain antibiotics before and during pregnancy significantly increased children s risk of

strategically and provide them a nutritious diet Type 1 diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in children in the U S affecting around four out of every 1 000 youths This autoimmune disease causes the body s immune system to mistakenly destroy the insulin producing cells of the pancreas This leads to lifelong dependence on insulin injections frequent blood sugar monitoring and increased risk for severe complications While genetics is involved in its development disruption of the gut microbiome has also been found to play a role Particularly early exposure to antibiotics in children has been shown to alter the composition and function of gut bacteria during vital developmental windows These changes interfere with immune regulation and initiate the autoimmune cascade that leads to Type 1 diabetes A new study conducted by researchers at the University of Utah Health adds more evidence to support this link They found that antibiotic exposure during a specific 10 day

necessary right now Or could there be a safer lower risk approach Remember that the goal isn t to avoid care it s to choose care that supports both you and your baby I outlined some natural antimicrobials in Natural Options to Try Before Taking Antibiotics but make sure to review each option with your healthcare provider to make sure they re safe to use while pregnant 2 Delay antibiotic use in your baby unless it s urgent If you re told your baby needs antibiotics ask about timing dosage and diagnosis If it s something minor like an earache or low grade fever consider monitoring or natural remedies first Preserving your baby s microbiome in the first few months is one of the most powerful long term protective steps you can take 3 Support your child s microbiome from day one If you re able to breastfeed continue doing so Breast milk naturally delivers beneficial bacteria and prebiotics that help shape a healthy microbiome If you re using formula milk look for one designed to support gut development through added prebiotics or microbiota friendly ingredients Also be mindful of your baby s environment Overusing sanitizers antibacterial soaps or unnecessary medications disrupts the very microbial exposures your baby needs to build resilience A little dirt and natural contact go a long way in training a strong immune system Read Dirt Don t Hurt to learn more about why dirt is good for children 4 Use probiotics strategically not generically If your child has had antibiotics or was born via C section it s worth replenishing their gut flora Look for strains backed by research in early life immune development like Bifidobacterium infantis or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG For mothers improving gut health with beneficial microbes like Akkermansia muciniphila which

Type 1 diabetes Q What is Type 1 diabetes and how does it affect children A Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease where the body mistakenly destroys insulin producing cells in the pancreas This leads to lifelong dependence on insulin injections blood sugar monitoring and an increased risk of serious complications Q How do antibiotics affect Type 1 diabetes risk A Antibiotics especially when used during crucial developmental windows in early life disrupt the gut microbiome This affects immune regulation and contributes to an increased risk of developing Type 1 diabetes Q Can antibiotics given during pregnancy affect my child s health A Yes antibiotics taken during pregnancy disrupt the development of your child s gut microbiome which increases the risk of autoimmune diseases like Type 1 diabetes Q Which antibiotics are most linked to a higher risk of Type 1 diabetes A The study found that macrolides such as azithromycin and erythromycin taken by mothers before pregnancy increased the risk of Type 1 diabetes in their children by 17 Additionally sulfonamides and trimethoprim often used to treat UTIs during pregnancy raised the risk by 91 Q Can the effects of

congressional committee in 2021 published a report on its investigation into toxic metals in baby food The investigation was conducted in response to a series of independent reports from consumer advocacy organizations released in 2017 2018 and 2019 revealing the presence of high levels of metals known to be neurotoxic to children in most processed baby food The committee s shocking report confirmed that many baby foods including some prominent organic brands are contaminated with toxic heavy metals including arsenic lead cadmium and mercury Investigators found the toxic metals were present at rates between 5 and 177 times depending on the metal the U S Food and Drug Administration s FDA allowable level of the metals for drinking water The report also warned that most baby food manufacturers don t test finished products for levels of toxic metals Instead they test individual ingredients and can vastly underestimate the heavy metal levels in their finished products The report found that across manufacturers internal company standards allow for dangerously high levels of toxic heavy metals Investigators also raised concerns that the Trump administration failed to take action when presented with data showing that existing testing and labeling practices are inadequate to protect children s health The investigation raised concerns that the FDA doesn t set limits on heavy metals in baby foods except for arsenic in rice cereal It does regulate lead in bottled water juice and candy and limits arsenic and cadmium in bottled water The report underscored the danger

responded to the subcommittee s request and their findings were based on those documents The report harshly criticized Walmart Sprout Foods and Campbell who declined to provide their data After the February report those companies also provided data to the committee to varying degrees A second report issued later in 2021 confirmed that those companies also knowingly sold baby food with high

mercury are neurotoxic and that such chemicals are the major driver of neurodevelopmental issues including autism and ADHD two conditions that have been steadily climbing for several decades and often co occur A 2014 report in The Lancet Neurology linked five industrial chemicals including lead and mercury to increasing rates of autism ADHD hyperactivity and other neurodevelopmental disorders in what the authors called the global silent pandemic of neurodevelopmental toxicity The developing human brain is uniquely vulnerable to toxic chemical exposures the authors wrote and major windows of developmental vulnerability occur in utero and during infancy and early childhood Children and babies also have higher exposure to heavy metals than adults because they consume more food relative to their body weight absorb metals more easily and have not yet developed the mechanisms to metabolize them A long list of peer reviewed studies reviews and meta analyses conducted over the last decade have found a positive association between heavy metals and autism For example a 2019 study found an association between early life exposure to arsenic and autism A 2017 study in Nature Communications

Although the guidelines were created in response to the 2021 reports and subsequent public outcry they don t limit the other metals that the congressional inquiry and consumer groups have identified in baby food The FDA said that although the suggested action levels are not binding the agency can consider them with other factors when deciding to bring enforcement action against food producers In April 2022 the FDA also proposed draft guidance setting lead limits in juices Both new suggestions from the agency are part of its Closer to Zero plan released in April 2021 in direct response to the

aluminum load Vaccines stress mitochondria the powerhouses of the cell Some babies do not have enough mitochondrial reserve to tolerate the oxidative stress of multiple vaccines on the same day As The Defender previously reported pediatric clinics can receive multiple financial incentives for administering vaccines For example insurance companies may offer pediatricians bonus payments for meeting certain benchmarks such as having around 80 of patients fully vaccinated by age 2 The AAP did not immediately respond when The Defender asked how common it is for pediatricians to do catch up vaccinations such as giving a 1 year old additional shots because the baby missed its 6 month vaccinations and whether the AAP continues to encourage the practice 1 year visit most dangerous visit of all Three other pediatricians Drs Renata Moon Paul Thomas and Lawrence Palevsky also told The Defender that administering multiple vaccines to babies and children to catch them up isn t all that rare The death of any child is an absolute tragedy said Moon She told The Defender Catch up vaccines are regularly given in most offices Parents need to clearly understand the risks and benefits of each individual shot and the risks of giving them in different combinations all at one time We need a public health system that we can trust to act only in the best interests of our nation s children and not in the best interests of the pocketbooks of big pharmaceutical companies Dr Paul Thomas a retired Dartmouth trained pediatrician said that it s very common for pediatricians to attempt to catch babies and children up on vaccines This is routinely done at all well visits Most babies are potentially given around nine vaccines at their 1 year wellness visit if the provider is following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule Thomas said The one year well visit has become the most dangerous visit of all especially if pediatricians

from the disease the vaccine covers He added When you understand that vaccines have never been tested with a proper saline placebo the safety data is only collected for a few days weeks or months and

Lawsuit Barbara and Everett Knudson won the right to intervene in a federal lawsuit AT T brought against the City of Walla Walla Washington after city officials denied the telecom giant s application

brought against Walla Walla in federal court after city officials denied the telecom giant s application to build a 65 foot cell tower behind a church Walla Walla city officials said AT T s application did not meet the requirements set out in the city s code They also said they ve been hearing from their constituents that the cell tower poses a fire risk and doesn t belong in a residential neighborhood Barbara Knudson a retired building contractor and her husband Everett a retired CEO and owner of an electrical company own property next to Blue Mountain Community Church where AT T wants to erect the tower The Knudsons said if AT T builds the tower they ll be forced to leave their home of 38 years because the radiofrequency RF radiation emitted by the tower would jeopardize their health especially Everett s Everett age 78 had a heart attack and stroke 10 years ago that left him with severe heart failure and arrhythmias that put him at risk for another stroke He s now 100 reliant on a pacemaker He limits his exposure to RF radiation because it can interfere with his pacemaker Barbara told The Defender My husband was an electrical contractor and understands these structures and what they emit she said If his pacemaker falters for any reason he will have no heartbeat and will die within minutes Everett s situation is potentially life threatening But under federal law including the Telecommunications Act of 1996 local governments are prohibited from considering the environmental effects of RF radiation including health effects of a proposed wireless project as long as the project complies with the Federal Communication Commission s rules on RF emissions In other words the Knudsons can t base a lawsuit against AT T on the argument that the tower would put Everett s health at risk or harm the environment So they are using other legal arguments including how the proposed cell tower poses a fire risk in an attempt to prevent AT T from building

out of the suit The case goes to trial on Nov 12 AT T asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief meaning the telecom giant wants the judge to tell the city it can t stand in AT T s way of its plans to build the tower AT T claims the Telecommunications Act of 1996 doesn t allow local governments to block such wireless projects because of nationwide goals of promoting widespread availability of advanced reliable wireless services The city maintains that the wireless company s application for the tower did not meet the city s code In a letter to Blue Mountain Community Church the Knudsons explained their concerns about being bombarded 24 7 with RF radiation from the tower that may be built on its rear lawn The church said it only leases the property and has no liability for what is placed on it Barbara said It is not publicly known how much money AT T is offering the church for the use of its lawn she added Cell tower would impact inn guests daycare children It s not just Everett s health the Knudsons fear will be harmed by the cell tower The church runs a daycare that serves roughly 100 children Its playground would be about 200 feet from the tower Many of these children get state coupons and very few daycares accept them so these moms are forced to continue to send their children there even if they have concerns about how the RF radiation exposure might impact their kids development and health Barbara and Everett also run a vintage farmhouse bed and breakfast Inn at Blackberry Creek less than 500 feet from the proposed tower site If AT T gets its way the Inn at Blackberry Creek will close Barbara said noting that many of the inn guests are battling cancer and heart issues Our inn is like being in the country in the middle of town so it might be the relaxed atmosphere and gardens that attract them Barbara said We cannot in good faith choose to house people who are trusting a safe environment and not getting one The inn s environment which

But if we don t fight them the cell tower will happen for sure Like a giant green toilet bowl brush The Knudsons intervention in the lawsuit is the latest twist in a legal battle between AT T and Walla Walla over the telecom giant s conditional use permit application filed Nov 7 2022 for building the tower on Blue Mountain Community Church s land Upon first hearing of AT T s plans Walla Walla residents quickly mobilized to educate themselves and others on the tower s possible impacts on the environment their health and their property values We spent a year going to city council meetings twice a month and speaking on this Barbara said We were quickly told that health and safety would not be considered in the siting of the tower More than a dozen residents spoke against the tower during a public hearing on Sept 21 2023 saying the cell tower would be an unwelcome landmark over their naturally forested neighborhood reported the Walla Walla Union Bulletin In November 2023 the city s hearing examiner a professional hired for deciding land use permit applications in Washington state denied AT T s application noting that the company hadn t adequately looked for other possible locations for its tower The hearing examiner also objected to AT T s proposed stealth design intended to disguise the tower as a pine tree It certainly does not look like a natural tree that blends in with the surrounding environment he wrote Barbara agreed It will tower over our tree line like a giant green toilet bowl brush 35 feet over the existing tree line she said and it can grow another 20 feet out and up within a year per federal laws Blue Mountain Community Church sold another portion of its land to a developer who designed a housing development adjacent to the proposed tower The

current lawsuit awaiting the outcome of this lawsuit for fraudulent concealment of a material fact in a real estate transaction Tower poses fire risk According to Barbara AT T s proposed cell tower would create a big fire risk We have already had a fire in this area 15 years ago that burned a portion of the tree line and snapped the main power line that runs beside and behind where this tower will be The power line that snapped caught trees on fire over 300 feet away she said The tower s proposed site is surrounded on four sides by the church and daycare existing homes and a proposed housing development It takes a fair amount of time to cut the power and the closest fireplug is over 800 feet away Barbara said For over a year concerned residents have picketed in front of the church every Sunday bearing signs with phrases such as No cell towers over our kids They plan to keep it up until the Nov 12 trial Barbara said What about health and the environment Barbara found it disturbing that wireless providers like AT T deny any responsibility for how their actions may impact people s health and the environment The big red flag in all of this she said is the statement in AT T s application that quotes federal law stating that health and the environment cannot be considered in this application In other words cities can t legally use the argument that this cell tower will harm people s health and the environment to deny a wireless application In Barbara s view that law needs to change Health and the environment are the foundations of a good building project To exclude them and to shelter cell companies from liability has allowed these companies to run amuck and show no empathy or concern for those near these towers she said This is far from a solid business

school districts and state health boards bar students with medical vaccine exemptions from the classroom some experts say those students face a higher suicide risk Karl Kanthak who has researched school vaccine exemption regulations has provided written and oral briefings regarding vaccine exclusion risks and safety to health and education governing boards He said a growing number of schools are recklessly ordering students with vaccine exemptions to stay home even though they have no idea what the student s mental status is Kanthak said there are parallels between students being barred from school attendance because of their vaccination status and students barred from school for disciplinary reasons In both cases students are deprived of the opportunity to interact with their peers or participate in extracurricular activities and are even barred from attending class online Functionally a school vaccine exemption exclusion is identical to a disciplinary suspension or expulsion Kanthak said If anything it is worse as the student did not break any rules to warrant the action It is now recognized that some youth will respond to a disciplinary suspension or expulsion with a self harm attempt Youth suicides in U S increased during COVID pandemic According to Kanthak a growing number of school administrators in the U S have been excluding students with medical exemptions from school even though these exclusion policies aren t accompanied by a risk benefit analysis weighing the potential harms of barring students from attendance There was no research as to the unintended consequences of this policy Kanthak said When he asked officials at the Washington State Department of Health whether they consulted with state mental health authorities before enacting their exclusion policies for vaccine exempt schoolchildren they didn t respond Everyone s afraid of questioning any aspect of vaccines or the vaccination program because you ll be labeled anti vax Kanthak said School districts and state health boards haven t conducted studies on the potential harms of their exclusion policies However statistics suggest such policies may be connected to an

Washington schools at least through the spring of 2021 However many Washington schools shifted back to remote learning in 2022 following COVID 19 outbreaks among students or teachers In Nevada the Clark County School District which includes Las Vegas and is the fifth largest in the U S reopened schools to in person learning in January 2021 after 18 students committed suicide since the beginning of the pandemic That was double the number recorded in the district for all of 2019 According to the New York State Office of Mental Health suicide is the second leading cause of death for youth in New York and throughout the U S By contrast official statistics from Sweden which did not impose lockdowns or school closures during the COVID 19 pandemic show that suicides among young people decreased in 2020 and subsequent years A Swedish government commission that investigated the country s COVID 19 response found the no lockdown strategy was fundamentally correct and defended the decision to keep schools open noting the low levels of excess mortality in 2020 and 2021 Policies force medically fragile kids into impossible choices Kanthak said he was prompted to become an activist for the issue after a national mumps outbreak in 2016 2017 The outbreak was centered among Marshall Islanders and other Pacific Islanders living in the mainland U S Even though most of the infected students during that outbreak had been vaccinated with the measles mumps rubella MMR vaccine schools in Washington began implementing a zero tolerance policy for students with vaccine exemptions barring them from school Kanthak said he began researching youth suicides and risk factors after one of the students excluded from school committed suicide It was so egregious top to bottom because Washington State doesn t have a specific vaccine exclusion policy Kanthak said While Washington has a disease management policy stipulating the quarantining of students during an outbreak schools must provide the students and their families with written notice and the exclusion period cannot exceed 30 days Kanthak said Washington school boards did not follow this policy during the

intentionally removing protective factors and is intentionally enforcing risk factors on these children without notifying the parents of the danger they re placing the children in Kanthak said Denying education to students with medical exemptions may violate federal state laws New York eliminated vaccine exemptions in 2019 That year the state also enacted regulations allowing schools to reject valid medical exemptions Since then New York has begun cracking down on medical exemptions including revoking previously approved exemptions Kanthak said this policy contradicts the justifications state lawmakers previously presented when advocating for repealing the religious exemptions Protecting those medically exempt students on campus was one of the main arguments for passing the law against the religious exemption so that those kids could safely go to school Kanthak said Addressing the Sarah Doe lawsuit Gibson said that CHD is actively challenging restrictive vaccine mandates

Bayer has paid out approximately 11 billion to settle glyphosate lawsuits The pesticide maker which estimates there are still 67 000 active lawsuits is asking for a Supreme Court ruling to nullify the existing lawsuits and prevent similar lawsuits in the future You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Dave Dickey Up to now there has been one colossal failure after another in Bayer AG s efforts to end all lawsuits claiming glyphosate the active ingredient in the company s weedkiller Roundup can cause cancer primarily non Hodgkin lymphoma Plaintiffs in state courts all across America cite a 2015 International Agency for Research on Cancer study that found glyphosate was probably carcinogenic to humans Bayer vehemently disagrees And in 2019 the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA issued a ruling that said the study was a false claim that does not meet the labeling requirements of the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act FIFRA and that it will no longer approve product labels claiming glyphosate is known to cause cancer That hasn t stopped Roundup lawsuits No siree That s because FIFRA prohibits the sale of any pesticide that is misbranded Under FIFRA misbranded warning labels fail to contain a warning or caution statement that may be necessary to protect health and the environment Plaintiffs argue in state courts that Bayer and the EPA s failure to warn about the potential cancer risks on Roundup labels amounts to FIFRA defined misbranding And up until recently the courts have agreed with that assessment In 2021 the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Hardeman v Monsanto found the glyphosate label misbranded Bayer had no luck pressing its case last year before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals either In John Carson v Monsanto the court ruled for the plaintiff concluding that FIFRA does not expressly preempt Carson s failure to warn claim But in August 2024 Bayer struck paydirt at the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals The court disagreed with the earlier 9th and 11th Circuit Court of Appeals rulings In Schaffner v Monsanto Corporation the appellate court found Because regulations promulgated to implement FIFRA require the health warnings on a pesticide s label to conform to the proposed label approved by the EPA during the registration process the Pre Approved Label and because during Roundup s registration process the EPA approved proposed labels omitting a cancer warning following an extensive review of scientific evidence concerning Roundup s possible carcinogenicity we conclude that the alleged state law duty to include the Cancer Warning on Roundup s label the Pa Duty to Warn imposes requirements that are different from those imposed under FIFRA and that it is therefore preempted by FIFRA Then in February

Bayer In John L Durnell v Monsanto Company the Missouri Court of Appeals upheld a 1 25 million jury verdict to a plaintiff arguing that Roundup caused his non Hodgkin lymphoma Given opposing opinions at the appellate court last month Bayer filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court to rule on whether FIFRA preempts state failure to warn claims targeting the Missouri Court of Appeals verdict The Court should resolve this split now The legal issues have been exhaustively ventilated and explored from every angle in lengthy opinions from multiple federal and state appellate courts There is no material chance the split will resolve itself as the Third and Eleventh Circuits have each denied en banc review And as this case exemplifies the consequences are enormous More than 100 000 cases have been filed seeking to hold Monsanto liable based on a supposed link to cancer that the EPA has exhaustively studied and rejected as unfounded Bayer has paid out approximately 11 billion to settle glyphosate lawsuits Bayer estimates there are still 67 000 active lawsuits Obviously much hinges on whether the Supreme Court grants cert Certainly frustration is mounting among the Bayer brass The Wall Street Journal reports Bayer may stop producing Roundup unless it gets court protection Bayer chief executive officer Bill Anderson s patience is wearing thin We re pretty much reaching the end of the road We re talking months not years In March Bayer announced plans to internally separate the glyphosate business from the rest of its crop protection division Should the courts fail to intervene on Bayer s behalf that might be a first step toward Bayer attempting to sell off its glyphosate business Rodrigo Santos head of Bayer s crop science division didn t flat out deny the possibility of a sale We re going to continue to discuss in the future evaluating all the alternatives that we have for the business That s always what we do I think the writing is on the wall Bayer earned 2 8 billion last year from glyphosate sales Anderson says Bayer is barely breaking even on sales and litigation is costing the company up to 3 billion a year That s not sustainable

Launch Private Health Tracking System With Big Tech Firms Time reported The Trump Administration announced a new initiative on Wednesday designed to allow Americans to share their medical records across a host of apps and programs managed by private tech companies a move that proponents says will facilitate easier access to those records across the country s fragmented health care system but that digital privacy experts fear will risk making patients data less secure For decades America s health care networks have been overdue for a high tech upgrade and that s what we are doing President Donald Trump said during an event announcing the initiative on Wednesday afternoon Making health records more easily accessible has been a goal of the federal government for decades with the hope of allowing patients to seamlessly switch between providers But such efforts have long been dogged by concerns over privacy and the challenges of companies offering competing proprietary records systems

process SAG AFTRA Vaccine Mandate Lawsuit Rejected by Ninth Circuit The National Law review reported In an unpublished but nonetheless significant opinion the Ninth Circuit recently affirmed the lower court s dismissal of a consolidated lawsuit filed by SAG AFTRA members against their union finding the claims time barred and preempted In relevant part the dispute was rooted in allegations that SAG AFTRA by negotiating a return to work agreement that allowed SAG AFTRA s studio and producer bargaining partners to impose COVID 19 vaccine mandates had violated its duty of fair representation and related state law claims to the plaintiffs who opposed receiving the COVID 19 vaccine for various reasons The U S District Court for the Central District of California had previously dismissed the plaintiffs consolidated claims for two primary reasons First it found that the Labor Management Relations Act LMRA preempted the plaintiffs state law claims including for breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty negligence and emotional distress because the state law claims all arose out of the union s purported failure to represent its members fairly an analysis that required interpreting the agreement in question and thus triggered the LMRA Goodbye to Privacy in the US TSA Imposes Facial Scanners at More Airports and Complaints About Mass Surveillance Grow Union Rayo reported More than

Rollout The Street reported The House of Representatives has officially passed the CBDC Anti Surveillance State Act a sweeping bill designed to block the Federal Reserve from issuing or testing a central bank digital currency CBDC without explicit congressional approval The move signals strong Republican resistance to what they view as a potential tool for state surveillance A CBDC is a digital form of a country s national currency issued and backed directly by its central bank Unlike cryptocurrencies CBDCs are centralized and controlled by the government They are designed to function like cash but in digital form with potential for programmability surveillance and tighter monetary control The House of Representatives passed the Anti CBDC Surveillance State Act by a narrow vote of 219 217 making it the third major crypto bill to clear the chamber during what s being called Crypto Week in Washington Notably the act also prohibits the use of a CBDC as a monetary policy tool It states The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall not use any central bank digital currency to implement monetary policy This restriction

Smartphone Data Reveal Patterns of Psychopathology Medscape reported Information on mobility phone usage sleep wake patterns and other passive data collected by smartphones is associated with behavioral markers linked to multiple forms of psychopathology including general mental health burden new research showed In a large observational study of community based adults researchers found that smartphone sensors that measure daily activities captured distinct behavioral signatures that may help identify when mental health symptoms are worsening The findings add to a growing body of work on digital phenotyping which analyzes passive data collected by smartphones and wearables to identify behavioral patterns in real time Although not ready for the clinic researchers said the new analysis suggests a number of potential applications for smartphone sensing which could be used alongside clinician rated and self reported measures offering moment by moment insight into patients lived experience and an opportunity for timely intervention This study helps us understand the breadth of psychopathology that smartphone sensors can detect and how specific those markers are to

host Joe Rogan about the state s COVID 19 pandemic decisions in another show released Monday The governor appeared on the Shawn Ryan Show hosted by a former Navy SEAL and responded to questions that were from Rogan and relayed by Ryan on California s vaccination policies Rogan asked through the Shawn Ryan Show who is responsible for requiring California students to be vaccinated against COVID 19 and who will take responsibility for an increase in cases of cancer and myocarditis in vaccinated kids a claim The National News Desk could not confirm Rogan s third question was whether Gov Newsom feels remorse for requiring students to be vaccinated which Rogan called a draconian decision heavily influenced by pharmaceutical companies desire for maximum profit The governor noting that he has signed some of the most progressive laws against big pharma in the country replied that nobody should suggest his vaccination policies were for the purpose of doing the companies bidding California was more restrictive and we were certainly aggressive at scale As it relates to the vaccines vaccines save lives Gov Newsom said But Joe asked a very different question about children and I respect that And that was where there was a lot of feedback with a lot of experts that I had as advisers The state is working with others in the western U S to review COVID 19 policies from the federal government for a report set to be finished next month the governor added He explained that state officials will evaluate the policies with input from international experts and people who opposed

Watch reported Dealing another victory to Gov Patrick Morrisey and his executive order a Raleigh County judge on Thursday granted a preliminary injunction allowing three Raleigh County students to attend school with a religious exemption to the state s strict compulsory school vaccination law Circuit Judge Michael Froble ruled that the state s mandatory school vaccine law is invalid without a religious exemption to the law If there were any question he said the state s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023 makes it clear the law should make exceptions for religious beliefs The lawsuit was brought on behalf of Miranda Guzman Amanda Tulley and Carley Hunter whose children were issued a religious exemption to the school vaccine mandates by the state Department of Health Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state to allow religious exemptions to its school vaccination laws State lawmakers this year did not pass which would have established those exemptions in state code The West Virginia school board voted not to comply with Morrisey s executive order and to instruct county boards of education to require all vaccines and allow only medical exemptions to those vaccination requirements The court finds that only requiring school kids in the public school to have vaccinations but not requiring adults and other people and having learning pods and having athletic activities that does occur really diminishes any kind of argument that compelling state interest in only making sure that children in the public school or attending public schools are receiving their mandatory vaccinations and that they are disregarding their rights for exercising their religion Froble said Seattle 911 Supervisor Wins 800K Settlement Over COVID 19

raises profound challenges to protecting civil rights and civil liberties GAO was blunt in its assessment It said federal agencies lack government wide laws and guidance that identify how civil rights and civil liberties are to be considered and protected as they relate to data collection sharing and use and that they reported varying protections for the public s civil rights and civil liberties in the areas of establishing dedicated offices appointing designated officials and developing standalone policies and procedures for collecting sharing and using data The GAO s analysis underscores the

2025 TikTok Ban Deadline Looms Here s What We Know Mashable reported TikTok is facing a potential ban in the U S that could go into effect just one day before a new administration takes the Oval Office and its fate hinges on legal battles political maneuvers and President elect Donald Trump In April President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that gave ByteDance TikTok s Chinese parent company nine months to either get a new owner or be banned in the U S meaning app stores like Apple and Google and internet hosting companies could face penalties from the government if they distribute or update TikTok TikTok responded to the potential ban in the courts by suing the government in May calling the law unconstitutional because the company claims it subjects a single named speech platform

architecture of federal identity verification the Trump administration has created a searchable nationwide citizenship data exchange that ostensibly is being used to verify U S citizenship status for voter eligibility but which could just as easily be used to monitor every American citizen in apparent violation of a slew of federal privacy laws and without Congressional oversight The expansion of the U S Citizenship and Immigration Services Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements SAVE system and its convergence with the Federal Data Services Hub reflects a broad shift toward predictive governance and centralized identity control While the original purpose of SAVE was to validate non citizen eligibility for entitlements the new system undergirds a sweeping new framework of automated

that has been banned twice by federal courts The EPA originally approved dicamba s use on genetically engineered soybeans and cotton in 2016 Environmental groups sued the EPA over dicamba in 2020 because of its potential drift away from the intended target especially during warmer temperatures and harm neighboring crops nearby ecosystems and rural communities The U S Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled against the EPA and said the agency understated the amount of dicamba damage The court determined that dicamba caused substantial and undisputed damage that tore the social fabric of the farming communities After the court vacated the herbicide s registration the EPA re registered it months later and was again challenged by environmental groups A second federal court vacated that

cheap pink acrylic jumper as it spins around a washing machine This load of washing will shed hundreds of thousands of tiny plastic fragments and threads up to 700 000 in this one washing machine cycle Along with billions of other microscopic synthetic fibres our thread travels through household wastewater pipes Often it ends up as sewage sludge being spread on a farmer s field to help crops grow Sludge is used as organic fertilizer across the U S and Europe inadvertently turning the soil into a huge global reservoir of microplastics One wastewater treatment plant in Wales found 1 of the weight of sewage sludge was plastic From here it works its way up the food chain through insects birds mammals and even humans Perhaps our jumper s life as a garment will end soon lasting only a few outings before it emerges from the wash shrunken and bobbling to be discarded But our thread s life will be long It might have only been part of a jumper for a few weeks but it could voyage around the

just now learning that Dr Anthony Fauci used U S taxpayer money to fund atrocious experiments on beagles but as my new book due out Nov 16 reveals torturing animals for drug company profits is just the tip of the iceberg You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up After an investigation revealed Dr Anthony Fauci used U S taxpayer money for an experiment that involved torturing beagles a bipartisan group of Congress members last week wrote to Fauci to express their grave concerns I was not surprised by the news it s one of many examples of atrocities approved by Fauci and funded by taxpayers that I write about in my upcoming book The Real Anthony Fauci Bill Gates Big Pharma and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health BeagleGate made headlines this weekend after the White Coat Waste Project the nonprofit organization that first pointed out that U S taxpayers were funding research at the controversial Wuhan Institute of Virology revealed experiments on 44 beagle puppies in a Tunisia North Africa laboratory To conduct the experiments researchers removed the dogs vocal cords allegedly so scientists could work without incessant barking In their letter the members of Congress asked Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID and President Biden s chief medical adviser why the need for such testing as the U S Food and Drug Administration does not require drugs to be tested on dogs According to the letter While the documents state that the ostensible purpose of this study was to provide data of suitable quality and integrity to support the application to the U S Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies the FDA itself has recently stated that it does not mandate that human drugs be tested on dogs This is apparently not the first time the NIAID has commissioned drug tests on dogs in recent years As I learned during research for my book Fauci hasn t just experimented on dogs he s also experimented on humans including children My book comes out Nov 16 but today I m releasing the excerpt below where I write about some of the atrocities attributed to Fauci and the NIAID over his long tenure with the National Institutes of Health NIH Read the excerpt from my book The Real Anthony Fauci In 1965 my father kicked down the door of the Willowbrook State School on Staten Island where

similar atrocities somehow elevating him to a kind of secular sainthood What dark flaw in Anthony Fauci s character allowed him to oversee and then cover up the atrocities at Incarnation Children s Center At very best there must be some arrogance or imperiousness that enables Dr Fauci to rationalize the suffering and deaths of children as acceptable collateral damage in what he sees as his noble search for new public health innovations At worst he is a sociopath who has pushed science into the realm of sadism Recent disclosures support the latter interpretation Freedom of Information documents obtained in January 2021 by the White Coat Waste project show that Dr Fauci approved a 424 000 NIAID grant in 2020 for experiments in which dogs were bitten to death by flies The insects carried a disease carrying parasite that can affect humans The researchers strapped capsules containing infected flies to the bare skin of twenty eight healthy beagle puppies and kept them in agonizing suffering for 196 days before euthanizing them NIAID acknowledged it subjected other animals including mice Mongolian gerbils and rhesus monkeys to similar experiments That same year Dr Fauci s agency gave 400 000 to University of Pittsburgh scientists to graft the scalps of aborted fetuses onto living mice and rats NIAID sought to develop rat and mouse models using full thickness fetal skin to provide a platform for studying human skin infections Dr Fauci s sidekick and putative boss Francis Collins who casts himself as a pious Catholic kicked in a 1 1 million sweetener from NIH for this malignant project Of all the desperate public health needs in America of all the pain that a well spent 2 million might alleviate Tony Fauci and his government confederates deemed these demented and inhumane experiments the most worthwhile expenditures of America s taxpayer dollars These disclosures beg many other questions From what moral wilderness did the monsters who devised and

oath as president of the United States outgoing President Dwight Eisenhower in his farewell address warned our country about the emergence of a Military Industrial Complex that would obliterate our democracy In that speech Eisenhower made an equally urgent although less celebrated warning against the emergence of a federal bureaucracy which he believed posed an equally dire threat to America s Constitution and her values In this revolution research has become central it also becomes more formalized complex and costly A steadily increasing share is conducted for by or at the direction of the Federal government Today the solitary inventor tinkering in his shop has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields In the same fashion the free university historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research Partly because of the huge costs involved a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity The prospect of domination of the nation s scholars by Federal employment project allocations and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded We must be alert to the danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite Eisenhower demanded that we guard against this insipid brand of tyranny by entrusting our government to responsible officials ever vigilant against the deadly gravities of technocratic power and industry money that would pull our nation away from democracy and

must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Rebecca Raney American beekeepers and honey producers continued to lose hundreds of thousands of bee colonies each quarter in 2023 according to an annual survey released Aug 1 by the U S Department of Agriculture USDA From January through March respondents to the federal survey reported that they lost nearly 400 000 colonies in a single quarter That number constitutes 15 of the estimated 2 7 million honey bee colonies in the U S During the rest of the year respondents reported losing between 250 000 and 380 000 colonies each quarter It s so hard to keep them alive said Chris Hiatt president of the American Honey Producers Association We just expect we re going to lose 40 to 50 percent Despite the substantial losses the estimated number of honey bee colonies remained stable from 2022 to 2023 with the total number of colonies estimated at 2 71 million The totals have remained the same because beekeepers added or renovated colonies throughout the year Hiatt said that because demand for pollination is increasing the number of hives should have increased as well but that beekeeping operations are struggling to maintain the hives they have Financially everyone should have increased their hive numbers by 10 to 20 percent he said Hive numbers should go up On the positive side the reports of symptoms of colony collapse disorder or CCD decreased in the first quarter of 2024 Last year in the first quarter that number spiked to more than 107 000 colonies In the first quarter of 2024 by comparison that number fell to 70 650 The disorder is characterized in part by the rapid loss of the adult bee population even if the colony has a queen To qualify as colony collapse disorder the loss of bees cannot be explained by the presence of mites or fungi The dramatic onset of CCD in recent decades spurred headlines and public awareness about the risks to honey bees For the annual honey bee colony survey the National Agricultural Statistical Service surveyed 3 300 beekeeping operations that managed five or more colonies on a quarterly basis The agency did not release data on sampling error In a separate report issued by the Bee Informed Partnership a now defunct nonprofit organization beekeepers reported that they lost 50 of their colonies over the course of an entire year from April 2022 to April 2023 The

survey during January through June the hardest months for colonies leading stressors included Varroa mites with beekeepers reporting between 40 and 50 of colonies affected by the insects followed by other pests at about 14 They reported that pesticides qualified as stressors in about 10 of colonies That means that during those months Varroa mites and other pests may have affected as many as 1 7 million colonies and pesticides may have affected 270 000 colonies according to respondents Beekeepers also reported that they lost nearly 14 of colonies during those months because of other factors such as weather starvation insufficient forage queen death and hive damage The numbers from the USDA showed a flurry of activity to keep bee operations going with operators adding hundreds of thousands of colonies 404 000 in the first quarter of 2023 followed by 617 000 in the second quarter 618 000 in the third quarter and 119 000 in the fourth quarter On top of that operators renovated colonies In those cases they added a queen or additional bees to an existing colony Beekeepers reported renovating 216 000 colonies in the first quarter 522 000 colonies in the second quarter 486 000 colonies in the third quarter and 119 000 in the fourth quarter Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us The process is costly Hiatt said with an incredible amount of expensive queens and you re taking away from your strong hives Luckily with bees within a season you can have a strong hive The survey s estimate of 2 7 million colonies in the U S differs substantially from the estimate produced by a separate USDA survey a five year agricultural census In that report the agency estimated that the U S had 3 8 million bee colonies a record number The two federal surveys polled different populations For the one year survey operations with fewer than five colonies were excluded For the five year survey responses came from all farm operations with known bee colonies

beets carrots butterfly pea flower extract turmeric paprika hibiscus and other natural foods One of the hurdles is simply do consumers accept these said Michelle Frame president and founder of Victus Ars Inc a food development and production lab focused on sweets and making supplements and pills more palatable Officials from the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA and the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS announced last month that they would work with food manufacturers to phase out synthetic food dyes made from petroleum The federal effort comes as several states have already

have on the food industry and consumers Dyes play a large role in the creation of candy sodas cereals sports drinks and other processed foods and switching to natural dyes presents a number of challenges Experts say companies face several hurdles if there is a broad switch to natural dyes including availability stability and taste issues And the likely disruptions to supply chains recipes

of its portfolio of products within the next couple of years Still rapid change will be hard to achieve for many companies experts say The initiative to reformulate without synthetic dyes will take years and a lot of money said Shelke Currently the volume of natural alternatives simply cannot meet the demand The push for ingredient changes comes as food and agricultural companies are already signalling reluctance to invest in expanded operations due to Trump administration tariffs which have triggered predictions of a recession and general economic turmoil The federal push to eliminate synthetic dye additives is driven by scientific research linking the dyes to a range of children s health problems including an increased risk for behavioral issues such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD As part of the planned phase out the FDA said it is fast tracking the review of several natural alternatives made from plants that companies could use as replacements for synthetic dyes The announcement said the agencies would revoke authorization for two food dyes citrus red dye No 2 and orange B and work with industry to eliminate six other synthetic dyes by the end of next year Multiple challenges One benefit of the current group of synthetic dyes used in the U S a group of reds yellows greens and blues is their consistency Manufacturers know how much of a dye

the colors especially when you concentrate them down Frame said And where in the world do they all grow so where do you have to import these from Also of concern are storage needs such as refrigeration which could increase food makers equipment needs To have to have refrigeration to store colors can be a huge cost in itself Frame said And you may or may not have the facility space to even put refrigeration in This is a much bigger ask than just hey everybody let s have this in place by 2026 there are too many pieces involved Frame said Synthetic dyes are much more stable than natural dyes maintaining their colors much longer when exposed to heat cold light or acidity Anthocyanins plant pigments found in berries red cabbage grapes and other fruits and vegetables for example create pinks in acidic foods and beverages but start to go purple or blue in more neutral products like icing This potential color degradation could shorten shelf life for many products Maybe before when you put it in the store and it would stay in the store a few months and maybe now it only lasts a month said Monica Giusti a food science researcher and associate chair and professor at Ohio State University s Department of Food Science and Technology Maybe you have to change the step in the process when you add the colorant Maybe you were adding at the beginning now you have to add later That s changing all of your protocols Giusti said And then there s the finicky American consumer who likes soft drinks and snacks to appeal to their eyes as well as their taste buds Maraschino cherries for example are often artificially dyed to achieve a vibrant red color Red radishes can be used instead but no one wants to eat maraschino cherries that taste like cooked radishes Giusti said

January to step into his new role as chair of the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions HELP Committee he wrote an op ed published by Fox News condemning Big Pharma s greed and vowing to take on the industry in his new role Sanders wrote On one of the most important matters facing our country the American people Democrats Republicans Independents Progressives Conservatives could not be more united And that is the need to take on the unprecedented corporate greed of the pharmaceutical industry and to substantially lower the outrageously high price of prescription drugs Sanders singled out Moderna and Pfizer for their record profit making 5 billion and 31 4 billion respectively in 2022 The Vermont senator directed much of his ire toward Moderna for announcing it would raise the cost of its COVID 19 vaccine by 400 when the vaccine went on the commercial market Given the company s massive profits astronomical CEO salaries and the fact that U S taxpayers subsidized Moderna s vaccine research to the tune of 1 7 billion Sanders wrote the price hike was taking things too far In an interview Sanders said Moderna s price increase made the vaccine maker a poster child for pharmaceutical industry greed Sanders called on Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel to appear in front of a HELP committee hearing to answer questions about the price hike Bancel agreed but he also announced a new Moderna sponsored patient assistance program that would make certain the COVID 19 vaccine would be free to all Americans by granting uninsured and underinsured people access to the vaccine Responding to Moderna s pricing policy shift Sanders joked on Face the Nation that maybe it was just a wild and crazy coincidence though he added it was a step in the right direction In his op ed Sanders also criticized Pfizer s exorbitant profits and excessive funding of the Republican Party Pfizer also announced it would quadruple vaccine prices Profit making beyond drug prices Drug prices

Pfizer and Moderna may have misrepresented to the U S government and the American public the safety and efficacy of their COVID 19 vaccines while collecting billions in taxpayer dollars for these products Does your office plan to investigate this including reports that Pfizer knew all along its vaccine did not prevent infection or transmission and that both companies misrepresented clinical trial data and intentionally withheld critical information about potential side effects including myocarditis and strokes 2 If these allegations turned out to be true how would that affect your position on COVID 19 vaccine mandates 3 What is your position on granting blanket immunity to Pfizer and Moderna from liability for any harm their COVID 19 vaccines caused If either company was found guilty of fraudulently marketing those vaccines how would that affect your position on this issue in the future 4 A lawsuit filed by state attorneys general in Missouri and Louisiana alleges U S government officials violated the First Amendment by colluding with media and social media to censor any content that contradicted the government pharma narrative that COVID 19 vaccines are the

Words disappear Eye contact fades Regression sets in These stories follow a pattern and while correlation is not causation patterns are where science begins But instead of investigation we dismiss these parents Instead of listening we silence them The research we re missing I combed through decades of vaccine safety literature The results were sobering There are no long term large scale studies comparing fully vaccinated children to unvaccinated ones using standardized developmental assessments No comprehensive evaluation exists of the full CDC vaccine schedule as administered in real life Most studies focus narrowly on the MMR vaccine or thimerosal a mercury based preservative largely removed from pediatric vaccines two decades ago Even the Institute of Medicine acknowledged in a 2013 report that the safety of the full childhood vaccine schedule especially its timing spacing and cumulative exposure had not been rigorously studied If vaccines were a pharmaceutical drug administered in 70 doses before kindergarten with a suspected link to any chronic disease we d demand independent oversight transparent trials and long term tracking But because these are vaccines we declare the science settled without proving that it is Buried data ignored whistleblowers In my research I came across the 2010 study by Gallagher and Goodman that found a higher autism risk in boys who received the hepatitis B vaccine at birth It wasn t widely publicized or followed up More disturbing was the 2014 revelation by William Thompson Ph D a senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who admitted that his team omitted key data in a pivotal MMR autism study data that showed increased risk in African American boys The study was never corrected How can we claim the science is settled if major findings are buried and whistleblowers ignored A path forward The vaccine autism debate won t be resolved by censorship or soundbites It will be resolved by doing the science we ve

Flu Testing May Be Hiding True Spread of Virus on U S Farms The Guardian reported Serious gaps in testing animals and people could be obscuring the true rate of avian influenza cases in the U S and make it difficult to understand how the H5N1 virus is spreading and how to stop it experts say Facing reluctance from farms to test workers and animals scientists are now turning to experimental studies to understand how H5N1 a highly pathogenic bird flu is spreading through cows and on to other farms The bird flu count among dairy herds in the U S continues rising but infections are more widespread than previously realized as testing in commercially available milk reveals While the risk to people is still low that could change as the virus mutates so its continued circulation remains a big concern The people that we need to get at most now are the other folks on these farms that are getting exposed to huge amounts of virus in these environments said Richard Webby a virologist at St Jude Children s Research Hospital s Department of Infectious Fiseases That s not easy and it s not happening at a scope that we probably need Only about two dozen people have been tested for H5N1

Strengthening Organic in the Farm Bill Beyond Pesticides reported As research continues to emerge on the value of organic farming U S Congress debates its future as Farm Bill negotiations have been stalled for months Recent studies published within the past few months show the significance of organic agriculture s support of fungal and microbial life which is essential to soil health Meanwhile last week the Democrat led Senate and Republican led House of Representatives presented their respective visions to amend the 2024 Farm Bill The office of U S Senator Debbie Stabenow D MN chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee released an initial Senate framework for the now 2024 Farm Bill At the same time U S Representative Glenn Thompson R PA chair of the House Agriculture Committee released an outline of the House version then followed up with more details While the Senate Democratic proposal includes more robust support for expanding and strengthening organic product supply chains and domestic production the House Republican support for organic land management principles and practices demonstrates that the Farm Bill could recognize across the political spectrum its economic ecological and public health benefits in the United States Despite this a growing coalition of advocates is alerting the public and members of Congress that the chemical industry and allied companies are pushing to simultaneously preempt state authority to allow stricter bans of toxic pesticide s at the municipal level and shield the producers and users of toxic pesticides from liability lawsuits

drop and prices to soar Farmers want to produce food in a healthy environment as it makes it easier for us to operate says David Lord a farmer in Essex England But when we re forced to produce so close to the cost of production people are existing on such fine margins they can t invest in the things they need to and they re just pushed to farm in a way they don t want to The debate about

Flu May Be Driven by This Overlooked Factor Civil Eats reported As federal officials grapple with how to contain the highly contagious strain of avian flu that has infected chickens turkeys and dairy cattle on farms across the U S a number of scientists are pointing to one factor that could be driving the spread of its virus and its spillover from wild birds to farm animals Waterfowl ducks geese and swans are the primary host of the viruses and large animal agriculture facilities are often found in close proximity to their remaining wetland habitats For instance California s Central Valley and the East Coast s Delmarva Peninsula are both critical wintering grounds for waterfowl along major North American bird migration routes and epicenters of U S poultry production As a result some scientists who track waterfowl question whether this geographic overlap alongside the shrinkage of waterfowl habitats creates more opportunities for the virus to spread between infected waterfowl and the animals in agricultural facilities Phthalate Chemicals Found in Popular Olive Oils EHN reported Thirteen popular olive oils recently tested have detectable levels of phthalates according to a new

Again Linked to Inflammatory Bowel Disease This Time Among Applicators and Their Spouses Beyond Pesticides reported A study published recently in the journal Environmental Research finds a significant correlation between exposure to certain pesticides and an elevated risk of inflammatory bowel disease IBD a chronic autoimmune condition of the gastrointestinal tract The study adding to the body of science on this subject evaluates self reported data from licensed pesticide applicators and their spouses exposed to pesticides for over 20 years In addition while some of the chemicals found to be most closely associated with incidents of IBD have been banned from use they are forever chemicals that persist in the environment for generations These findings demonstrate once again the failings of the current regulatory process to identify hazards before they are put into the environment The study found evidence that exposure to several organochlorine insecticides dieldrin DDT and toxaphene as well as organophosphate insecticides parathion terbufos and phorate and herbicides 2 4 5 T 2 4 5 TP and metolachlor is associated with elevated IBD risk IBD is a generic term for diseases that result in chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract such as Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis It is estimated that 6 8 million patients globally suffered from IBD in 2017 IBD may result from an imbalance in gut microbiota known as dysbiosis which can increase the gut s susceptibility to infection and trigger an autoimmune response The Environmental Research study cites increasing evidence

reported After failing in several U S states this year global chemical manufacturer Bayer said Tuesday that it plans to amplify efforts to create a legal shield against a proliferation of lawsuits alleging it failed to warn that its popular weedkiller could cause cancer Bayer which disputes the cancer claims has been hit with about 170 000 lawsuits involving its Roundup weedkiller and has set aside 16 billion to settle cases But the company contends the legal fight is not sustainable and is looking to state lawmakers for relief Bayer lobbied for legislation that could have blocked a central legal argument this year in Missouri Iowa and Idaho home respectively to its North America crop science division a Roundup manufacturing facility and the mines from which its key ingredient is derived Though bills passed at least one chamber in Iowa and Missouri they ultimately failed in all three states The legislation backed by Bayer would protect pesticide companies from claims they failed to warn their products could cause cancer if their labels otherwise comply with EPA regulations Assembly Passes Bill to Require Farmers to Notify Before Using Pesticides Near Schools Los

Associated Press reported Vermont s Republican Gov Phil Scott has vetoed a bill to severely restrict a type of pesticide that s toxic to bees and other pollinators saying the legislation is more anti farmer than it is pro pollinator The bill would have banned the use of neonicotinoids commonly called neonics as well as selling or distributing soybean and cereal grain seeds that are coated in the substance The pesticides are neurotoxins and are the most widely used class of insecticides in the world lawmakers have said It s hard to believe that the governor chose World Bee Day to veto this sensible legislation to protect bees and other pollinators from toxic pesticides while supporting farmers through a just transition to safer alternatives Paul Burns executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group said a statement on Monday Vermont s legislature passed the bill after New York Gov Kathy Hochul signed what she described as a nation leading bill last year to severely limit the use of neonics in her state First Human H5N1 Case Reported in Australia as Another Highly Pathogenic Strain of Bird Flu Detected on Victorian Farm The Guardian reported A highly pathogenic

landscape by publicly supporting expanded dietary recommendations for dairy products raising eyebrows across the medical community I grew up in a world where milk was the healthiest thing that you could eat Kennedy said adding new research suggests protein and healthy fats should be more prominent in American diets There s a tremendous amount of emerging science that talks about the need for more protein in our diet and more fats in our diet And there s no industry that does that better than this industry But Kennedy s statements clash with guidance from public health authorities The greater medical community along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to advise adults to limit saturated fat widely present in full fat dairy due to its links to heart disease The U S Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary however is backing Kennedy s push saying We are going to have dietary guidelines that are based on science not based on medical dogma FDA

about narrative monopolization centralized control of science speech and sovereignty Opposition to school vaccination may increase the potential for violence According to the 2021 report the controversy surrounding vaccination mandates for school age children employees facing termination for lack of compliance or perceptions of unfair healthcare treatment for the unvaccinated might trigger increased violence by DVEs The report cited opposition to school vaccination programs The availability of a vaccine for all school age children might spur conspiracy theories and perceptions that schools will vaccinate children against parents will and may increase the potential for violence the report states Parents in at least three states Maine North Carolina and Vermont have sued local school districts and officials after their children were administered the COVID 19 vaccine at school without consent However according to the 2021 report under such conditions DVEs would most likely plot violent acts to intimidate healthcare workers and officials charged with implementing COVID 19 mitigation measures as well as possibly killings or kidnappings of state local or federal

administration STAT News reported today Outgoing Secretary of Health and Human Services HHS Xavier Becerra made the last minute appointments to the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices ACIP They include four new members and four replacements for current members whose terms expire in June According to STAT the appointments were a response to President Donald Trump s nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr founder of Children s Health Defense CHD to lead HHS Kennedy who has not yet been confirmed as HHS secretary faced two confirmation hearings in the U S Senate earlier this week The advisory committee plays an important role of independent eyes on the science said Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist at CHD Biden just made ACIP a political appointment trampling the idea of independent scientists Whether the new appointments will hamper Kennedy s Make America Healthy Again agenda if he is confirmed to lead HHS is unclear According to STAT while the new members terms expire in 2027 ACIP members are at will appointments and can be dismissed at any time Kennedy or any new secretary of HHS would also have the option to fire other existing members of ACIP cancel or postpone vaccine related meetings or disband ACIP altogether The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC under a Trump appointed director could also override ACIP s recommendations According to STAT ACIP plays a pivotal role in the setting of vaccination policy in the U S ACIP reviews the safety and efficacy data of vaccines that are newly approved by the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA and issues recommendations to the CDC The CDC must formally accept ACIP s recommendations before the vaccines are allowed on the market The committee s members are among the only non governmental

someone who serves on an FDA advisory committee I ve seen firsthand how critical it is to have independent unbiased voices people who are not financially tied to the very companies or agendas they are supposed to be regulating New HHS secretary would have several possible avenues for reforming ACIP According to STAT Becerra broke with longstanding practice by bulk appointing new members to ACIP It was long the practice to line up new ACIP members well before their terms would begin with the CDC vetting would be committee members and the HHS having the final say But under Becerra s tenure the appointment process lagged a problem he eventually remedied with a spate of appointments STAT reported Eleven of the current 15 members of ACIP were appointed to ACIP in 2024 STAT noted Becerra s four new appointments set to join the committee July 1 subsequently increased ACIP s roster to 19 members the result of an expansion set out when the committee s charter was renewed last April However it is far from certain that Becerra s selections will be allowed to take their seats on the panel or will remain part of ACIP s roster for long According to STAT there are several avenues through which the new HHS secretary could override or otherwise bypass these selections One option is to withdraw Becerra s selections and replace those picks with candidates that might be more closely aligned with the views of the incoming HHS secretary According to STAT solely replacing the new appointees would not give a new secretary a majority of the committee but additional options include the dismissal of existing members and adding new members to the committee Another option is to renew ACIP s charter which must occur by April 1 2026 According to STAT There is nothing blocking the HHS secretary from

Committee have been postponed ACIP recommendations for vaccines people should get such as the HPV vaccine for pre teens or annual flu shots for everyone over 6 months old could also be watered down to suggestions that people may get these vaccines after consulting with a physician in what is known as shared clinical decision making Such a change would likely depress vaccine uptake sending a signal that the vaccination is optional STAT reported The previous committees have been discouraging shared clinical decision making preferring to hand down edicts rather than information Every corner of medicine should be shared clinical decision making Jablonowski said During his confirmation hearings this week Kennedy suggested that people should have the option along with their physicians to make

credible threat of a public health emergency due to outbreaks of COVID 19 Beccera added Kim Mack Rosenberg general counsel for Children s Health Defense CHD called the last minute move by the Biden

compensation only for unreimbursed medical expenses lost wages up to 50 000 and death At a congressional hearing in February CICP s slow pace of resolving vaccine injury claims came under scrutiny As of Nov 1 13 520 COVID 19 claims had been filed with CICP Of these 65 were determined to be eligible for compensation but only 18 had been compensated A total of 3 373 claims were denied while 10 082 were pending review or in review The average payout of the 18 compensated claims is 24 513 93 However this figure includes a payout of 370 376 offered to a single victim the maximum amount allowed under the program All other payouts totaled a combined 70 874 78 an average of 4 169 10 per claim Of the compensated claims 15 involved cases of myocarditis or myopericarditis with one claim each for

According to The Associated Press AP heated debate took place at the highest levels of the White House in the months leading up to the pardons with some Biden administration officials pushing hard for Fauci and others to be pardoned No other president has employed executive clemency in such a broad and overt way the Times reported The closest parallel may be former President Gerald Ford s pardon of Richard Nixon in 1974 although Nixon had not been charged with a crime According to the AP the pardon may not shield Fauci from all potential legal threats particularly congressional inquiries The new Republican led Congress would still likely have wide leverage to conduct inquiries the AP reported If there was ever any doubt as to who bears responsibility for the COVID pandemic Biden s pardon of

seven million Americans have been hospitalized leaving families grieving and communities forever changed We experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression as weaknesses in our supply

bipartisan support that has already catalyzed 2 billion in financing from 27 contributors including countries foundations and philanthropies to build stronger global health security capabilities Who are these contributors Iversen asked Do you want to guess the Bill Gates Foundation is a big one According to the Pandemic Fund website funds are channeled through 13 governmental and nongovernmental organizations including Gates funded organizations like the WHO the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations CEPI Gavi the Vaccine Alliance and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria The Bill Melinda Gates Foundation also funds similar projects through other partnerships For example Gates and the U S Department of Defense s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA funded the launch of the Sentinel system Sentinel is a proprietary early warning system powered by CRISPR gene editing technology meant to detect deadly pathogens in Africa before they spread Organizations like the Gates Foundation Iversen said have their own agendas that they can advance through such partnerships Gates she said wants to see vaccines for everybody and surveillance for diseases in order to enact vaccines for everybody By offering major funding to poor countries Iversen said groups like the Gates Foundation buy the ability to manipulate or control policy That kind of power she said was key to imposing vaccine mandates and vaccine passports across the world She cited recent reporting by investigative journalist Paul D Thacker who reported that a WHO official testified that the Finnish government was well aware that COVID 19 vaccines didn t stop transmission when the country mandated vaccine passports Dr Hanna Nohynek chair of the WHO s Strategic Group of

Robert F Kennedy Jr has said he wants to reduce the use of toxic agricultural pesticides Big Ag is using Kennedy s statements to promote biologicals to farmers as a natural way to control pests and diseases without disclosing that some biologicals are genetically engineered microbes that are harmful to health and the environment You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Claire Robinson In a classic example of how shamelessly Big Agribiz pivots its marketing the current U S Secretary of Health and Human Services HHS Robert F Kennedy Jr who was part of the legal team that scored the first major court victory against Bayer s Roundup weedkiller is being used as an unwitting front man for biologicals These are substances derived from living organisms that agribusiness companies are increasingly promoting to farmers with claims of improving soil or crop health or controlling pests and diseases all supposedly with the added benefit of reducing the use of chemical pesticides that still provide the largest chunk of the companies profits Biologicals can be genuinely natural For example the biocontrols used in organic farming include ladybirds employed to combat aphids and nematodes used against slugs and snails But they can also be genetically engineered organisms or GMOs such as GM microbes which can pose serious risks to human and animal health and the environment The motivation for Big Agribiz to market GMO biologicals is strong given the ease with which GM products can be patented and a receptive market of farmers weary of chemical dependency and the consequent depleted soils We know that RFK Jr aims to reduce toxic exposures that could contribute to ill health and favours organic farming Evidently in the eyes of Big Agribiz that makes him ripe for exploitation as a walking talking ad man for the new biologicals That s clear from an article in the farming press promoting these products and citing representatives of the GMO agribusiness companies that develop them The article starts by featuring an organic farmer who says he doesn t use chemical inputs The farmer says more producers will follow suit thanks to RFK Jr who has long advocated for American growers to curb their reliance on certain chemicals to grow and protect crops claiming they can be toxic The article then immediately moves to biologicals produced by Big Ag companies as if it s just a continuation of the more natural less toxic approach to farming favored by RFK Jr A lot of money is being invested into biological technologies Heavyweight agriculture companies including Bayer Ag Syngenta AG and Mosaic Co are making moves in the market Biologicals now stand at about 15 billion in global revenue a year That s on track to reach 25 billion by 2030

founder partner and president of research firm DunhamTrimmer Meanwhile the roughly 70 billion market for conventional agriculture chemicals where Bayer and the rest have their roots has seen growth of around 3 annually for more than a decade and that figure is likely to stay steady The article goes on to quote Jonty Brown global head of seed care and biologicals at Syngenta which is expanding in the sector as saying Farmers no matter where you go in the world say they want to use biologicals Existing GM biologicals unimpressive Some biologicals including GM microorganisms made with new genetic engineering techniques such as gene editing are already out there in the marketplace or in the pre commercialisation phase Are these GMO products going to save farming from chemical dependency It seems unlikely judging by one example that s already marketed in the U S Pivot Bio s GM gene edited nitrogen fixing products aim to reduce synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use while maintaining or boosting yield However a 2023 analysis of 26 university based corn trials of Pivot Bio s products tested alongside other non GM microbial products found that 25 showed no significant yield increase over the non GM microbial products More importantly neither the GM nor the non GM products reliably increased yield over and above the effect of the applied synthetic nitrogen fertilizer The authors wrote In total over all products there were 53 corn experiments on biological N itrogen fixer products with 51 experiments finding no benefit to their use with just two experiments finding a yield benefit over nitrogen treatment alone The authors concluded Given the low rate of positive benefits to the use of these products growers should be skeptical of products that claim to provide N fixation for the purpose of allowing a farmer to decrease fertilizer N rate The safety question Are Pivot Bio s products safe The New York Times reporter Eric Lipton wrote After aggressive lobbying in

and have never nor would ask to avoid regulation Pivot s products have been reviewed by the USDA FDA U S Food and Drug Administration EPA U S Environmental Protection Agency and regulators in all the states in which they are sold If that sounds like a reassuringly stringent process the companies letter to the USDA tells a different story The companies are seeking clarity over how the USDA will regulate GM microorganisms for agricultural use as the path wasn t yet established They argue that if a microbial product isn t expected to pose a plant pest or disease risk the USDA s narrow remit when it comes to regulating GMOs and if it s gene edited or cisgenic the latter involving insertion of genes from the same species it should be exempted from regulatory review Sadly the USDA in its 2024 guidance for applications to release GM microbes restricted itself to assessing whether GM microbes pose a plant pest or disease risk The good news is that the USDA didn t exempt gene edited microbes from regulatory review But the other bad news is that while the USDA according to Pivot did review the company s nitrogen fixing bacteria through its Am I Regulated process it decided that they were not regulated Pivot Bio says this precedent setting determination should serve as an example of the types of exemptions to be included in the development of new pathways to commercialisation for modified microbes We don t know exactly what RFK Jr would make of these machinations or the particular products in question But it is clear that GMO biologicals are far from the organic and less toxic type of farming that he and many ordinary people want to see thriving In fact they seem like exactly the kind of farming approach that RFK Jr the most prominent supporter of organic farming in any recent administration opposes That will of course be no obstacle to the shameless marketeers of Big Agribiz who have already set about hijacking regenerative agriculture with the aim of massively

t Advertising to children had a significant impact on cereal purchase decisions and food companies bottom lines according to a Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health report published Thursday in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Carey Gillam Food companies are continuing to push unhealthy cereals high in sugar content into the diets of young children through targeted television advertising despite pledges by leading companies to voluntarily regulate such advertising according to a new analysis The report by the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut published Thursday in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine looked at the purchases of high sugar children s breakfast cereals by U S households over nine years and how the amount of TV advertising directed to children versus adults impacted those choices The authors said they found that advertising to children had a significant impact on cereal purchase decisions Despite promises to only advertise healthier options directly to children and the availability of nutritious cereals in their product portfolios cereal companies continue to market their least healthy products directly to children Jennifer Harris lead author and senior research adviser at the Rudd Center said in a statement Our research provides strong evidence that discontinuing all advertising of nutritionally poor foods directly to children would likely negatively impact food companies bottom line which explains why they appear to resist doing the right thing for children s health Harris said The paper cites statistics showing that two thirds of U S children consume more than the recommended limit for added sugar or roughly 10 of daily

the cereals with child directed TV advertising did meet CFBAI nutrition criteria their median added sugar content was still 12 grams per 40 gram serving and none met government defined nutrition

households than on other households Participating cereal manufacturers have more nutritious products in their portfolios but choose to market the unhealthy ones to kids according to Harris These

interact You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Ten years ago a Huffington Post investigation revealed that Johnson Johnson had illegally promoted Risperdal an antipsychotic drug associated with serious side effects to children and the elderly Today the drug remains one of only two medications approved by the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA to treat autism The other is aripiprazole also an antipsychotic marketed as Abilify and sold by Bristol Myers Squibb According to the Huffington Post s 15 part investigative report the FDA had prohibited Johnson Johnson salespeople from trying to promote Risperdal to doctors to treat children because of its feared side effects including hormonal disorders Yet the company organized special sales units illegally targeting doctors who treated the elderly and children even as adverse events including gynecomastia which causes enlargement of breast tissue in males were reported in some children who took the medication The reports led to thousands of lawsuits with total settlements reaching several billion dollars The FDA first approved Risperdal risperidone to treat schizophrenia That was in 1993 In 2006 the FDA approved the drug to treat irritability symptoms including aggression and temper tantrums associated with autism Research scientist and author James Lyons Weiler Ph D said the distinction between approving the drugs to treat autism versus treating irritability associated with autism is crucial Even though autism rates in U S children have sharply increased from 1 in 10 000 in the 1970s to 1 in 31 in 2022 Risperdal and aripiprazole remain the only FDA approved drugs of their kind for people with autism According to Autism Speaks the two FDA approved medications don t address autism s

practiced in the absence of data on long term safety Studies have shown that children with autism are more susceptible to adverse events There are few studies on how these drugs interact when taken together even though the practice of prescribing multiple drugs known as polypharmacy is also associated with an increased risk of adverse events The existing pharmacologic model for autism is not a treatment paradigm it s behavioral sedation selectively applied Lyons Weiler said As of 2022 Risperdal was the 183rd most commonly prescribed medication in the U S although usage fell by more than half since its peak in 2014 Off label drugs for autism symptoms lack clinical trials FDA approved and drugs prescribed off label for autism related symptoms are all associated with severe adverse events Antipsychotic medications including Abilify Risperdal and Zyprexa are commonly prescribed for aggression irritability and repetitive behaviors Common side effects associated with antipsychotics range from drowsiness dizziness and weight gain to seizures low blood pressure and sexual problems These medications are also associated with high blood sugar stroke and thoughts of suicide or self harm This category of drugs alter neurotransmitter activity broadly and are linked to metabolic syndrome prolactin elevation gynecomastia and profound weight gain Lyons Weiler said Perro said the drugs can also lead to exacerbation of underlying motor issues Antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs improve levels of serotonin a hormone and neurotransmitter that regulates mood These drugs including Celexa Prozac and Zoloft are prescribed to children with autism to reduce anxiety depression and the frequency or intensity of repetitive behaviors But according to Lyons Weiler SSRIs are often ineffective and can induce agitation emotional blunting or even suicidal ideation especially in pediatric populations Autism Speaks acknowledges that large clinical trials have yet to demonstrate the effectiveness of SSRIs in treating autism symptoms While common side effects of SSRIs include diarrhea fatigue nausea and weight gain the medications also are

is well known and noted on each respective drug s package inserts significantly less information is known about potentially harmful adverse events that may result from interactions between multiple medications when taken together to treat autism related symptoms According to an article published last month in The Conversation polypharmacy has become more of an issue for autistic people in recent years Polypharmacy exacerbates these risks yet remains underregulated Lyons Weiler said Children are often on three four five or more psychoactive agents simultaneously without a single randomized control trial to guide those combinations When used in isolation these drugs already carry serious side effects When combined we enter an uncharted pharmacologic wilderness According to Lyons Weiler serious adverse events associated with polypharmacy of medications to treat autism symptoms include Cognitive stagnation including lowered processing ability Endocrine disruption including delayed puberty and suppressed testosterone Metabolic effects including insulin resistance cholesterol changes and rapid weight gain Neurological side effects including movement disorders and sedation Worsened behavior These outcomes are too often treated as unrelated comorbidities when in fact they may be iatrogenic Lyons Weiler said This is why polypharmacy without a systems based understanding of detoxification metabolism and neuroinflammation is dangerous It treats symptoms as siloed entities not as expressions of a larger disrupted system Lyons Weiler said only a small number of studies examining the effects of polypharmacy on autistic children exist A study published in the journal Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders in 2020 found that autistic youth in New Zealand were more

mortality risk more than double that of the general population Pharma reaps big profits from drug based treatments for autism According to Lyons Weiler while existing drug based treatment routes for autistic patients have proven problematic more successful treatments are being overlooked because these are not prescribable and thus they are not reimbursable and thus they are not mainstream Pharmaceutical interventions are easy to prescribe reimburse and codify into protocols he said What s neglected are the therapies that treat the child as a biological system not a behavioral problem

unearthed internal records reveal fossil fuel companies and the plastics industry peddled the myth of viable plastic recycling for over 50 years despite privately acknowledging that existing recycling methods were inadequate according to a new report from the Center for Climate Integrity You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Dana Drugmand Plastic makers and petrochemical industry players have engaged in a decades long fraud aimed at deceiving the public about plastic recycling according to a new report that spotlights freshly uncovered industry communications and internal documents The report comes as the global plastic waste crisis deepens and as environmental advocacy organizations are increasingly calling for major fossil fuel and petrochemical companies to be held responsible for plastic pollution that poses a threat to human and planetary health Despite their long standing knowledge that recycling plastic is neither technically nor economically viable petrochemical companies independently and through their industry trade associations and front groups have engaged in fraudulent marketing and public education campaigns designed to mislead the public about the viability of plastic recycling asserts the new report released by the Center for Climate Integrity CCI on Feb 15 In detailing the plastics industry s campaign of deception that dates back more than 50 years the report reveals how the industry deployed a familiar strategic playbook to push back on threats of regulation by promoting a misleading narrative and false claims about plastics and recycling despite knowing all along that plastics recyclability was more of a public relations message than an effective solution to the waste management problem This evidence shows that many of the same fossil fuel companies that knew and lied for decades about how their products cause climate change have also known and lied to the public about plastic recycling CCI President Richard Wiles said in a statement When corporations and trade groups know that their products pose grave risks to society and then lie to the public and policymakers about it they must be held accountable Long held secrets Plastics are derived from fossil fuels and many large oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil Shell and Occidental Petroleum have chemical divisions that produce plastics and plastic constituents Skyrocketing plastic production has led to a massive waste crisis especially for single use disposable plastic and conventional recycling methods that have been around for decades have not proven successful in fixing the mess Plastic recycling rates in the U S are only around 5 6 which is not surprising considering that most plastics are not designed to be recycled at any effective

lower quality further limiting plastic recycling s viability The plastics and petrochemical industries knew that recycling presented insurmountable challenges the new report demonstrates Among the revelations the report details how corporate and trade association representatives privately acknowledged plastic recycling s shortcomings decades ago Documents from the First National Conference on Packaging Wastes in 1969 for example show the industry grappling with plastic packaging s waste disposal problem stating that the vast quantities of different polymer mixes and additives in plastic make the materials virtually unrecoverable after use and admitting that the economics around recycling packaging waste are virtually hopeless The report highlights several industry communications A 1969 American Chemical Society document notes It is always possible that scientists and engineers will learn to recycle or dispose of wastes at a profit but that does not seem likely to happen soon on a broad basis A 1986 draft Solid Waste Fact Sheet from the Vinyl Institute as another example acknowledges in plain terms that recycling cannot be considered a permanent solid waste solution as it merely prolongs the time until an item is disposed of An Eastman Chemical Company employee in 1992 admitted that it is more likely that we will wake up and realize that we are not going to recycle our way out of the solid waste issue Discussing the industry s commitment to plastic recycling demonstration projects an Exxon employee told staffers at the American Plastics Council in 1994 We are committed to the activities but not committed to the results Yet the plastics industry successfully convinced the public including governments and the media as well as consumers broadly that recycling was a suitable solution to the plastic waste problem The largest resin producers including Exxon Mobil DuPont and Dow invested tens of millions of dollars into various aspects of plastic recycling including public relations efforts to shape consumer perception of recycling the report states It was part of a multi pronged effort to sell the false promise of plastic recycling in order to quash prospects of restrictive regulations or product bans According to the report the industry campaign included deploying trade associations and front groups to promote a pro recycling narrative

deception continues as petrochemical and plastic producers promote advanced recycling also known as chemical recycling as an enhanced version of mechanical recycling But as the CCI report and other research emphasize this purported waste management solution is neither advanced nor recycling as it has been around for decades and generally converts plastic into petrochemical based fuel rather than new plastic It faces similar economic and technical challenges that conventional recycling faces yet the industry continues to tout chemical recycling as a breakthrough fix A call for accountability The CCI report suggests that legal action against the industry is likely Based on the growing body of evidence municipalities and states are likely to pursue litigation which could put an end to the industry s deception make the companies pay for the devastating harms they have caused to communities and open the door to real solutions that are currently out of reach the report concludes Municipalities and states across the U S are already pursuing litigation against major oil and gas companies for allegedly lying about the climate crisis According to CCI these companies should also be held liable for their lies about plastic recycling which have exacerbated the plastic waste crisis The oil industry s lies are at the heart of the two most catastrophic pollution crises in human history Wiles said In response to the report the Plastics Industry Association said the report was based on outdated information and false claims This report was created by an activist anti recycling organization and disregards the incredible investments in recycling technologies made by our industry Matt Seaholm president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association said in a statement Instead of

Rebecca Miller farmers who produce raw milk may continue to sell raw milk outside the state while a lawsuit filed by the state against them moves through the courts The court s ruling upheld a March 2024 decision by a Lancaster County trial court which concluded that the Millers were not clearly violating Pennsylvania statutes by selling their raw milk products outside Pennsylvania That court previously issued a preliminary injunction that completely blocked the Millers from selling raw milk However the court later modified the injunction limiting it to blocking Millers raw sales only within Pennsylvania The Commonwealth Court also acknowledged that the Millers raised potentially meritorious constitutional challenges to Pennsylvania s Milk Sanitation Law These challenges involve the Commerce Clause the Supremacy Clause the right to travel and the fundamental right to purchase traditional foods directly from the producer of that food Robert Barnes the Millers attorney

buy the products or have the farm ship them Federal law bans raw milk sales across state lines However the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA also makes it clear that it does not prohibit people from purchasing raw milk and transporting it across state lines for personal consumption according to the National Agricultural Law Center Rules regarding raw milk sales within states vary from state

of customer complaints to any government agency for any food product of Amos Miller s is a big fat zero the highest known customer satisfaction rate of any farmer in America Yet the government sought

got the vaccine before age 36 months compared to after age 36 months This result was highly statistically significant Finally none of the studies considered in the Taylor et al meta analysis

that continued to mandate COVID 19 vaccines for students At the time 15 colleges and universities still mandated the vaccine Since then some programs within higher education have continued to mandate the shots for students studying to be healthcare practitioners from dental hygienists to doctors in part because the executive order didn t provide specific guidance on health sciences programs whose rules sometimes differ from the universities general rules Many other programs that don t mandate the shots for their students partner with hospitals clinics and other medical institutions for clinical practicums where students face COVID 19 vaccination requirements As a result of these two loopholes many health sciences students still face COVID 19 vaccine mandates In April Rep Mark

with the goal of reducing their methane emissions may put the animals health at risk and may also endanger the meat industry He said An additional concern is that cattle everywhere will develop serious gastrointestinal illnesses as their immune systems attack these naturally occurring methane producing non pathogenic organisms Entire vaccinated herds will become commercially unviable and the meat industry will be destroyed It is entirely reasonable to suspect this is the ultimate goal of this insane endeavor Some experts suggested that another potential impetus behind the push for climate change vaccines is the One Health concept championed by the World Health Organization WHO which promotes the idea that public health policies should view human health and also animal and environmental health as being interdependent Rose suggested that from the point of view of control the climate change vaccines may be connected to One Health Tips agreed calling One Health a particularly nefarious

last week ruled that Bill Gates must face seven people injured by COVID 19 vaccines in court in the Netherlands Other defendants include Albert Bourla CEO of Pfizer and the Dutch state You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A Netherlands judge last week ruled that Bill Gates must face seven people injured by COVID 19 vaccines in court in the Netherlands According to Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf the seven corona skeptics sued Gates last year along with former Dutch prime minister and newly appointed NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and several members of the Dutch government s COVID 19 Outbreak Management Team Other defendants include Albert Bourla Ph D CEO of Pfizer and the Dutch state Because Bill Gates foundation was involved in combating the corona pandemic he has also been summoned De Telegraaf reported According to Dutch independent news outlet Zebra Inspiratie the plaintiffs allege that Gates through his representatives deliberately misled them about the safety of the COVID 19 shots despite knowing that these injections were not safe and effective Dutch independent journalist Erica Krikke told The Defender that the seven plaintiffs whose names are redacted in the lawsuit s publicly available documents are ordinary Dutch people and they have been jabbed and after the jabs they got sick Krikke said that of the seven original plaintiffs one has since died leaving the other six plaintiffs to continue the lawsuit The lawsuit was filed in the District Court of Leeuwarden According to De Telegraaf Gates had objected because according to him the judges did not have jurisdiction Accordingly the court first had to rule in the so called incident procedure De Andere Krant reported Zebra Inspiratie reported that the hearing in this incident procedure took place on Sept 18 and that Gates representatives disputed jurisdiction but not the claim According to De Andere Krant Gates was represented by the Pels Rijcken law firm based in The Hague described as the largest and the premier litigation law firm in the Netherlands Gates did not appear at the Sept 18 hearing but attorneys for Gates argued that the court had no jurisdiction over him because he lives in the United States However in its Oct 16 ruling the Leeuwarden court ruled it does have jurisdiction over Gates De Andere Krant reported that the court found sufficient evidence that the claims against Gates and the other defendants are connected and based on the same complex of facts Other defendants who reside outside of the Netherlands including Bourla did not challenge

your name is Bill Gates you still have to go to court In remarks shared with De Andere Krant Arno van Kessel one of the plaintiffs attorneys welcomed the ruling In its verdict the court has clearly recorded the basis of our conclusions of claim van Kessel said Dutch attorney Meike Terhorst told The Defender it is quite interesting that the plaintiffs filed the lawsuit in Leeuwarden instead of The Hague where normally all cases against the government related to COVID 19 are filed In general COVID 19 court cases have been very unsuccessful in the Netherlands Terhorst said There is a slim chance it will be successful She added I think most judges support the COVID 19 vaccination agenda and will find it hard to believe the vaccinations have caused injuries So we have a long way to go regardless of the case Krikke shared a more optimistic outlook saying that the court sent a message that even if you are rich and your name is Bill Gates you still have to go to court New Zealand based independent journalist Penny Marie who has closely followed the proceedings in this case told The Defender she hopes the Oct 16 ruling will hopefully set a precedent and help plaintiffs in similar cases around the world regarding jurisdiction in cases where the defendant does not reside in the country of the plaintiff For parties who make claims against those involved in the implementation of the Great Reset and other international actions such as the COVID 19 emergency response initiated by the WEF World Economic Forum and imposed on all U N member nations I hope that this ruling provides an opportunity for others to follow suit Marie added Father of vaccine injured plaintiff made emotional plea to the court At the Sept 18 hearing plaintiffs also delivered statements According to Zebra Inspiratie One of the victims who is very ill was also given the opportunity to make a plea She was no longer able to speak and was represented by her father It was an emotional plea Krikke said the plaintiff s father told the court that his daughter who was previously healthy fell ill after getting the COVID 19 vaccine and could no longer speak telling the judge

when we made information available that people would want correct information According to CNBC Gates who spends a lot of his time and money trying to help solve some of the world s biggest problems said that unlike tackling diseases or promoting clean energy there is no clear path forward for solving what he views as the problem of misinformation Gates told CNBC any solution would involve rules for online speech but he said he isn t sure what form those rules would take or who would enforce them Similarly he told CNET systems and behaviors should be in place to target misinformation Is there

is not one of them History shows that censorship never works ultimately to repress the truth Other experts cited Gates questionable track record on free speech and issues such as vaccines Epidemiologist M Nathaniel Mead told The Defender Gates post 2020 track record on this issue is well documented Mead said He tried to sell us on the vaccine only solution to COVID by falsely claiming that the modified mRNA injections would avert infection and transmission thereby ending the pandemic He also openly urged media to disparage as conspiracy theorists or anyone who questioned mandates for masking social distancing lockdowns PCR testing and of course the so called vaccines Mead called this a rather blatant affront to the First Amendment Given his track record with public health communications Gates is being grotesquely disingenuous when he speaks about wanting to protect free speech Mead suggested Gates relies on control over narratives in the media to further his promotion of and investments in vaccines He said Bill Gates has a vested interest in ensuring that counternarrative information or what he calls misinformation is eliminated That s because it interferes with his Bio Pharma agenda and what appear to be authoritarian aspirations as well given his efforts to impose vaccine passport requirements internationally and to restrict free speech through his control of many news media channels having given over 300 million of his own funds in recent years to support independent media platforms such as NPR PBS and The Guardian Since the mass media relies heavily on Big Pharma advertising to maintain operations it has largely abandoned the traditional skepticism of government directives instead aiding in the suppression of dissenting viewpoints Anyone posing

attorney Greg Glaser told The Defender Catherine Austin Fitts founder and publisher of the Solari Report and former U S assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development cited a recent survey showing that a significant percentage of the population believes COVID 19 vaccines are deadly A recent Rassmussen survey published in June 2024 reported that 33 of American adults agree with the statement The COVID 19 vaccine is killing people and is killing large numbers of people Fitts said If Mr Gates wants to stop misinformation his first step should be to stop financing speaking or republishing misinformation that results in the poisoning of our children Fitts added For Seamus Bruner author of Controligarchs Exposing the Billionaire Class their Secret Deals and the Globalist Plot to Dominate Your Life Gates support for stopping misinformation is tied to his support for vaccines and digital ID Bruner director of research at the Government Accountability Institute argued that the systems and behaviors Gates advocated include a de facto digital ID system that would track and trace our precise digital footprint what we say and do online Bruner said Gates and the other controligarchs are pouring billions of dollars into digital ID efforts and they plan to use misinformation particularly related to vaccines to do it He wants to control what we put in our bodies Now he wants to control what we re allowed to put into our minds what we think by controlling what we are allowed to say The reason misinformation is a problem for controligarchs like Gates is simple They

support for censorship by eliciting an emotional response Calling attention to the cyber harassment of his daughter has less to do with misinformation than with predatory and abusive online behaviors Mead said But Gates seems to be getting desperate and his attempt to make this kind of illogical linkage is an emotional appeal to manipulate public opinion Mead said Gates used similar emotional tactics to equate questioning vaccines with inciting violence He said In the video clip teaser we hear Gates say we should have free speech and then attempt to obliquely link inciting violence with causing people not to take vaccines When he juxtaposes the incitement of violence with causing people not to take vaccines he s resorting to the most basic propaganda tactic that of emotional manipulation Such plays on emotion also represent a concerted effort to target young people in particular according to Glaser One of the most surprising things I ve learned from interviewing young people is they generally don t like to fact check Scrolling is way more fun They want verification processes done for them and they are content to rely on their peer group s perception of the

Buy borrow die Gates doesn t simply receive rent checks from his Nebraska farmland He s also using it to borrow staggering sums of money Three days before Christmas 2021 Mt Edna Farms filed paperwork with Dawson County clearing the path to use a part of Gates land as collateral Gates LLC then took out two loans against his Nebraska farmland The total of those loans 700 million The obvious question Why is Gates who Forbes deemed the world s richest man 18 different times between 1995 and 2017 using Nebraska farmland to take out a 700 million loan Using IRS data the news outlet ProPublica estimated Gates total average annual income between 2013 and 2018 was 2 85 billion with an average federal income tax rate of 18 4 That income primarily came from sales of Microsoft stock which is taxable But extremely high net worth individuals like Gates often use a strategy of borrowing against their assets like land if they want spendable money Selling those same assets would generate taxable income said Adam Thimmesch a University of Nebraska College of Law professor specializing in business and tax law If you can hold those assets until you die all of that taxable gain goes away so the ideal tax planning technique if you re wealthy enough to be able to do it is to invest in those appreciating assets Thimmesch said If certain conditions are met tax law allows someone to inherit the land and avoid paying taxes on the long term appreciated value if they sell it Thimmesch said In the meantime ultra rich Americans can borrow against their assets to fund their lifestyles

farmers and investors alike by providing crop irrigation Gaining access to groundwater is often a priority for potential farmland buyers If you own land in Nebraska you have the possibility of accessing the underlying groundwater but natural resource districts regulate how water is used I m sure that the NRD Natural Resources District is well aware of Gates and that every one of those wells is no doubt permitted and has associated certified acres and probably does some annual reporting to the NRD as well said Don Blankenau a lawyer who provides water related legal counsel to Nebraska

the use follows existing rules Blankenau said I ve heard over the decades I ve done this people are always concerned that somebody s gonna go out and buy a big tract of land in the Sandhills and then transport that water away Blankenau said That s nearly impossible he said because Nebraska has tight limitations on the transportation of groundwater especially outside of state borders or as a commodity An investor like Gates moving large quantities of groundwater via pipeline or trucking operation would attract the attention of neighbors and the local NRD If you extract groundwater out of the ground carbonate it and add sugar to it you ve got soda pop and you can move that all over the place Same thing with beer one of my law partners started brewing and I always tease him that he s exporting groundwater in the form of beer Blankenau said In Holt County Gates operation has gone mostly unnoticed by neighbors and county officials And the actual farming of that land has barely changed But Gates land buys still matter said Tielke chair of the Holt County board The purchases of any large outside investor limit the opportunities for small farmers to break into the industry I

of genetic engineering synthetic biology and gene editing They are the tools of choice for eugenicists and for those seeking to build the technocratic transhuman future championed by Gates and his Silicon Valley cronies Scientists use CRISPR technology to edit genes into an organism s chromosomes to reprogram DNA to switch off the normal rules of genetic inheritance and drive the artificially introduced trait through an entire population and spread it to all future generations Their capacity to permanently alter the genome of an entire species makes gene drives the biological instrument of ultimate power Gene editing technology could facilitate Gates schemes to create and patent new and improved species of plants and animals or to exterminate species of which he disapproves One of his aims is to use gene drives to insert suicide genes to eradicate entire mosquito species that spread Zika or malaria a goal of the Target Malaria Project in which the Gates Foundation has invested 40 million Dr Anthony Fauci a long time protégé and partner of Gates and an enthusiastic cheerleader for gene drive told StatNews Getting rid of them would be a blessing Critics argue that gene drives pose an existential biosecurity risk to humanity due to their capacity to change or eliminate entire species and to catastrophically alter ecosystems They are also the ultimate biological weapon the

food business which revolves around processing chemicals and extracts needed to produce these lab made foods on a global scale Fortified foods Synthetic and GMO foods tend to be low in the vital micronutrients that support human health Glyphosate for example functions as a chelator It kills weeds by leaching out the mineral building blocks of life Farm crops exposed to glyphosate have far less nutritional value than natural foods People eating Gates processed synthetic and GMO foods may have full stomachs while being clinically malnourished Gates is rushing to solve this problem by buying technologies and partnering with companies like Roche and Kraft that fortify foods artificially with minerals and vitamins He is simultaneously promoting laws in developing nations to mandate

of digital technologies for American farmers He s doing it for the same reasons he brought his technology to Indian farms to steal their knowledge and move them off the land Trent Loos a sixth generation Midwestern rancher and farm activist told me that farmers have a knee jerk reaction against billionaires playing Monopoly with American farmland It makes it difficult for young farmers or even those who have farmed for generations to compete with such deep pockets It certainly creates a barrier for them When people with this type of wealth start to buy farms it makes us wonder what they are really up to Nobody wants to rent land from Bill Gates or work as his sharecropper Westbrook says he believes Gates is pursuing a darker agenda Like Shiva Westbrook believes that Gates and the other robber barons are using the pretexts of climate biodiversity and the zoonotic pandemic threat to get human beings out of the ag business and off the farm And there is evidence to support him

Its Moonshot project is developing and testing a range of software and hardware prototypes based on breakthroughs in artificial intelligence simulation sensors robotics and more Within a year of purchasing Whole Foods Jeff Bezos Gates has a considerable investment in Amazon also invested heavily in robot controlled vertical farms that also minimize human involvement with farming Says Westbrook He wants to get the people off of the farms get the animals off and get us all eating his plant based meats and bug protein Gates talks about farming as an archaic quaint dirty dangerous

even use that word alternative agriculture Westbrook s view of the dystopian future of technocratic totalitarianism envisioned by Bill Gates sounds like a baseless conspiracy theory if one ignores all the evidence supporting him He predicts that we will very soon in months not years see engineered food shortages and pressures to empty and improve the rural landscapes by idling farmland and replacing farm jobs with robots and artificial intelligence Westbrook predicts government efforts to push populations toward mega cities and smart cities where businesses are closed jobs are scarce and most of us will rely on universal basic income paid in digital currencies revocable of course in cases of noncompliance and disobedience Westbrook predicts a scenario where the human cattle are

dutifully declared citing no specific evidence that vaccine hesitancy was one of the principal threats to global health The Gates Medical Cartel followed that statement with orchestrated campaigns in every U S state and in countries around the globe by pharma financed politicians introducing laws to mandate vaccines and end exemptions Two months later the powerful House Intelligence Committee

the major stakeholders in a public private partnership to make food systems inclusive climate adapted and resilient and support sustainable peace The UN Food Systems Summit effectively announced a parallel agenda to the one launched by the WEF when it hosted its Great Reset conference in June 2020 When Kalibata was appointed over 500 organizations sent two letters to Secretary General Guterres calling on him to revoke Kalibata from the leadership role due to her ties to corporate actors and expressing concern over the growing influence of transnational corporations at the UN In response to

to resuscitate his reputation after the Microsoft antitrust case exposed him as a lying cheating thieving manipulator intent on felonious monopoly control of global information conduits Gates has since invested 36 billion into the Gates Foundation which has a value of 46 9 billion over which he and his wife exercise total control The foundation has given away only 23 6 billion in charitable grants and these gifts include billions in tax deductible donations to companies in which Gates is invested like Merck GlaxoSmithKline Novartis Sanofi Gates brilliant mind devised this scheme to form a foundation that shelters his income and allows him to leverage taxpayer dollars by investing the foundation s earnings in projects that multiply his wealth and expand his power and public prestige while avoiding taxes Using this structure he can give tax deductible donations to companies he partly owns and reap personal and foundation profits while avoiding taxes and allowing him to hide his money in myriad ways It s a win win Gates has deployed his foundation as the embodiment of his base instincts for monopoly and control a vehicle for ruthless philanthrocapitalism that hijacks public

consequences and the risks associated with not regulating it sufficiently What is CRISPR CRISPR which stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats acts as a precise pair of molecular scissors that can cut a target DNA sequence directed by a customizable guide Put differently this technology allows scientists to edit sections of DNA by snipping specific portions of it and replacing it with new segments Gene editing is not a new concept but CRISPR technology is viewed as being cheaper and more accurate This stems from the 2012 discovery that RNA can guide a Cas protein nuclease to any targeted DNA sequence and to theoretically target only that one specific sequence Indeed CRISPR technology is often referred to as CRISPR Cas9 for this reason The Media and many scientists have expressed optimism about the technology Medlineplus gov for instance said CRISPR has generated a lot of excitement in the scientific community because it is faster cheaper more accurate and more efficient than other genome editing methods Wired in 2015 described CRISPR as revolutionary writing that it had already reversed mutations that cause blindness stopped cancer cells from multiplying and made cells impervious to the virus that causes AIDS The technology also made wheat invulnerable to killer fungi and altered yeast DNA so that it consumes plant matter and excretes ethanol according to Wired In the same article Wired wrote that Technical details aside CRISPR Cas9 makes it easy cheap and fast to move genes around any genes in any living thing from bacteria to

as fundamental as the transistor The discovery of CRISPR s gene editing applications was viewed as so significant that two scientists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry even as a patent dispute between Doudna and another scientist Feng Zhang also viewed as instrumental in CRISPR s development continues to this day Other scientists though do not share the same optimism about CRISPR A genetic modification procedure that is not precise and not breeding Robinson told The Defender that in general terms CRISPR is a gene editing tool that cuts the DNA across the double strand and can be targeted to a precise sequence in the genome CRISPR can be used with three potential aims Robinson said disrupting the function of a gene modifying the function of a gene or inserting entirely new genes According to Antoniou Gene editing has been around for far longer than the CRISPR Cas9 system has been It s been around for decades Antoniou described gene editing as A DNA manipulation method or methods with which the intended outcome is to make a very targeted change in the genetic material of the organism which could be anything from a bacterium a plant animal or human Gene editing I guess the operative word here is editing which implies an alteration in a very precise targeted way You re trying to make a very specific alteration in the genetic material of your target organism Robinson said that while CRISPR is said to be site specific it is actually sequence specific it will look for that particular sequence and cut the DNA at that point This has led many to tout CRISPR s precision breeding ability For Antoniou though It is clearly a genetic modification procedure It is not precise and it s not breeding Gene editing is often confused with gene therapy but Antoniou said they are two different things With gene therapy a normal functioning copy of a gene is added to existing cells he said However he added With gene editing you re not adding another gene You re trying to alter a gene that s already there in the DNA in order to either correct the defective gene directly or alter some other gene function that compensates for the

future of human evolution even touting CRISPR s potential applications in creating enhanced or designer human beings and declaring this is no longer science fiction She said Many scientists believe that genetic engineering is the future of our evolution It provides us with a chance to give ourselves any traits we want such as muscle mass or eye color Imagine that we could try to engineer humans that have enhanced properties such as stronger bones or less susceptibility to cardiovascular disease or even to have properties that we would consider maybe to be desirable like different eye color or to be taller Designer humans if you will Geo engineered humans are not with us yet But this is no longer science fiction Others in the scientific community expressed similar techno utopianism For instance Wired wrote that CRISPR could deliver anything from designer babies to species specific bioweapons In 2018 for instance a Chinese biophysicist announced that he and his team created the world s first gene edited babies An article last month in The Intercept noted that the CIA has invested in a biotechnology startup Colossal Biosciences along with Peter Thiel Paris Hilton and Tony Robbins that aims to use CRISPR technology to jumpstart nature s ancestral heartbeat by resurrecting extinct mammals even the woolly mammoth And the Financial Times reported that another biotech firm is backing a project to bring back the Tasmanian tiger from extinction For Antoniou The reason why CRISPR has captivated the imagination of scientists is its simplicity compared to the other gene editing tools I mentioned It s a very simple entity to construct and to deliver to the cells of your target organism to bring about the gene edit that you re after One realm in which CRISPR is promoted is medicine and the treatment of diseases For Wired the real money is in human therapeutics including target ing HIV directly According to Synthego a company that makes genome editing platforms CRISPR is

COVID diagnostics touted as weapon against pandemics CRISPR also has been promoted as a technology that is useful for the development of diagnostic tests and as a weapon against potential new pandemics During the COVID 19 pandemic for instance CRISPR was used as a therapeutic and diagnostic tool for the coronavirus via the Sherlock CRISPR SARS CoV 2 test kit which was granted an Emergency Use Authorization by the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA Sherlock Biosciences also developed a wearable COVID test in 2021 DETECTR and other COVID diagnostic methods also were developed during this period while similar diagnostics utilizing the search function of Cas9 have also been engineered to identify other diseases both infectious and genetic Feng Zhang embroiled in the patent dispute with Doudna wrote in 2020 that CRISPR is being used as a research tool by scientists who are working to better understand how SARS CoV 2 enters the human cells and to learn more about the biology of its pathogenesis Zhang who developed a new mRNA delivery system known as SEND that utilizes CRISPR technology added that scientists are working to harness CRISPR as natural viral defense properties to develop a novel antiviral effective against COVID 19 Messenger RNA mRNA technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID 19 vaccines also has been used to deliver CRISPR gene editing technology that

technologies to build this new generation of health solutions And in a 2018 Foreign Affairs article Gates wrote that ultimately eliminating the most persistent diseases and causes of poverty will require scientific discovery and technological innovations including CRISPR and other technologies for gene editing that could help humanity overcome some of the biggest and most persistent challenges in global health and development In the same article Gates listed some of the possibilities he foresaw for CRISPR including gene editing to make crops more abundant and resilient stating it could be a lifesaver on a massive scale He added that one of the most promising near term uses of gene editing involves research on malaria Gates who has long funded malaria research also promoted the potential applications of CRISPR for treating sickle cell disease cystic fibrosis beta thalassemia and malaria In 2018 Gates wrote It would be a tragedy to pass up the opportunity to use CRISPR gene drives as a

Quick inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in poor countries Monoclonal antibodies that target and kill pathogens causing malaria and AIDS Gates investments in CRISPR go beyond his joint project with the NIH For example he was an early investor in Editas Medicine which according to Business Insider was one of the first companies to attempt to use CRISPR technology to treat and eliminate human diseases and which is leading the way in using CRISPR to treat rare genetic eye diseases in addition to trials related to sickle cell disease The WEF named Editas a 2015 Technology Pioneer According

to several factors including the financialization of the economy Federal Reserve policies and the government s response to the pandemic According to Hudson the U S economy has become increasingly financialized with the banking sector focusing on creating debt rather than supporting productive industries Banks have united with the landlords and monopolies to create monopolies to finance an absentee ownership class he said on a Feb 9 podcast Hudson also contends that the Federal Reserve s money creation policies have primarily benefited the wealthy The corona virus did not create this shift but it catalyzed and accelerated the power grab not least by pushing public sector budgets into crisis he wrote The CARES Act passed in response to the pandemic primarily benefited the financial sector and large corporations rather than providing adequate support to state and local governments small businesses and ordinary Americans according to Hudson The act enabled the stock market to recover all of its 34 percent drop as measured by the S P 500 stocks by June 9 2020 even as the economy s GDP gross domestic product was still plunging What s the solution To address the growing wealth inequality in the U S Hudson has proposed several systemic solutions aimed at restructuring the economy and empowering average Americans One key proposal is a debt jubilee or some other version of a national and international debt forgiveness or write down Hudson argues that the current debt based system is unsustainable and that widespread debt cancellation is necessary to provide relief for working class Americans You want to free the economies from the legacy of feudalism he said on the podcast Banks want to restore a kind of feudal economy where the richest people live off interest off landlord rent and monopoly rent he said Hudson refers to this as rentier capitalism Hudson recommends establishing public banking and the nationalization of key utilities By bringing essential services under public control Hudson contends that the government can ensure that they serve the needs of the people rather than the interests of private corporations Hudson also argues that policies such as anti monopoly regulations and land value taxation can reduce the power of banks and keep prices down for essential goods and services The price of housing would be kept down the price of monopoly goods would be kept down the price of doing business would be kept down because this excess economic rent would not be paid to the banks as its major source of income he said By transferring

Toxic to Soil Organisms Two types of bioplastic fibers were more toxic to earthworms than were bits of conventional polyester according to a new study The findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that bioplastics derived from plant materials or other biological feedstocks are not necessarily safer than plastics that come from petroleum You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Douglas Main Bioplastics often considered a safer alternative to synthetic plastics may in some cases be toxic to soil organisms a worrisome finding that indicates a need for more thorough testing according to a new study The work adds to a growing body of research suggesting that bioplastics which are derived from plant materials or other biological feedstocks are not necessarily safer than plastics that come from petroleum The new study published on Nov 5 in Environmental Science and Technology found that two types of bioplastic fibers were more toxic to earthworms than were bits of conventional polyester While promoted as environmentally friendly the alternative materials actually may be more harmful in some ways than the conventional plastic the study determined We need more comprehensive testing of these materials before they are used as alternatives to plastics said Bangor University researcher Winnie Courtene Jones who is lead author of the study Bio based fibers like viscose and lyocell are used in clothing especially in fast fashion but also in wet wipes and a range of other products The study said more than 320 000 metric tons were produced in the textile industry in 2022 and that is expected to continue to climb When such clothes are washed they can shed fibers into wastewater Thousands of tons of sewage sludge are added to farmlands around the world which can directly transmit such fibers into the soil The study authors said they exposed worms to fibers from polyester as well as viscose and lyocell which are made from cellulose and used in natural fabrics They found that after three days 30 of the first group died while the death toll was 60 for viscose and 80 for lyocell The effects of various products on worms are important to study since these animals live throughout much of the world churning and aerating soil providing vital ecological services Moreover if worms are negatively affected the same is likely true for hundreds of other overlooking soil dwelling species In the study scientists also looked at the longer term impacts of all three fibers on worms at concentrations likely to be found in soils where such sludge is applied They found that worms exposed to the biobased materials had impaired fertility compared to animals in contact with polyester fibers This study shows us that the bio based fibers are not inherently better than synthetic fibers said Bethanie", "chunk_id":

fibers said Bethanie Carney Almroth an ecotoxicologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who wasn t involved in the paper In this paper the fibers were put into soils in the lab without any additives and the toxic effects seem to have something to do with the structural or chemical nature of the materials themselves Courtene Jones said Bioplastics can also leach toxic additives or breakdown products much like conventional plastics Bioplastics and so called biodegradable plastics do not necessarily break down quickly or at all in conditions found in soils or the environment Biodegradable and compostable plastics often have to be exposed to very specific conditions such as high heat to disintegrate In trying to reduce plastic pollution and make plastics safer we must be careful about not replacing petroleum based products with bio based ones that may be even worse in some cases Almroth said That will be particularly important to keep in mind at the last of five

former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield publicly described bird flu also known as H5N1 influenza A or avian influenza virus as the likely next pandemic predicting a laboratory leaked virus as the cause Meanwhile Deborah Birx aka the Scarf Lady of COVID 19 infamy was making the TV news promoting an unrealistic and excessive program of testing farm animals and humans for bird flu At present bird flu seems to have been put on the back burner by the authorities Monkeypox has since taken center stage with the World Health Organization declaring a state of emergency over that virus Furthermore the experts have trotted out numerous other viruses with which to terrify the public Examples include West Nile virus who no less than Dr Anthony Fauci himself supposedly contracted and even the exotic Sloth virus also known as Oropouche virus The first step in dealing with these continual reports of horrific pathogens is recognizing the vital importance of living in knowledge rather than in fear Fear porn is a real psychological weapon and one that is being used against us on a daily basis As we painfully learned during COVID 19 a terrified population is easily manipulated controlled and exploited As free citizens we must remain mindful and knowledgeable rather than fearful about the flood of information and propaganda that is hurled at us Regarding bird flu we should remain mindful of the following In its current iteration bird flu has caused no widespread human illness no human deaths and sporadic outbreaks in farm animal populations

concerns about the virus s potential to spark a human pandemic The research conducted by a team led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka DVM Ph D at the University of Wisconsin Madison found that the bovine H5N1 virus can spread systemically in mice and ferrets bind to human type receptors and shows limited respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets Kawaoka has been involved in bird flu gain of function

including for vaccine development Experts who spoke with The Defender said they worry the study was being used to foment unreasonable fear of the virus jumping to humans expand risky gain of function research push for the irresponsible development of bird flu vaccines and set the public up for new pandemic countermeasures that will further restrict human rights The study published July 8 in Nature marks the first comprehensive analysis of the H5N1 strain infecting dairy cattle in the U S since early 2024 While the virus has not yet shown efficient mammal to mammal transmission its ability to infect and spread in mammalian models raises questions about its pandemic potential and the effectiveness of current containment strategies The bovine H5N1 virus thus possesses features that may facilitate infection and transmission in mammals Kawaoka and his colleagues wrote The finding comes as public health officials grapple with a continuing outbreak of H5N1 in U S dairy herds and other animals and as five farm workers in Colorado reportedly tested positive for bird flu this past weekend all with mild symptoms bringing the total number of human infections in the U S to eight Key findings of the study The study examined the pathogenicity and transmissibility of an H5N1 virus isolated from infected cow milk in New Mexico In mice the virus spread systemically including to the mammary glands after both oral ingestion and intranasal infection Ferrets infected with the bovine H5N1 virus also showed systemic spread to multiple organs including the mammary glands and teats This

in 2021 Bright oversaw its gain of function research on H5N1 and holds patents on bird flu vaccines according to Hooker Vaccine researcher and biomathematics specialist Jessica Rose Ph D made a similar observation telling The Defender that the study is part of an intentional preparation for a new pandemic Rose alleged that the paper accepted for publication just 27 days after initial

lab accidents that could have led to release into the populace Hooker said Hooker said that implying the virus could naturally and easily mutate to become highly virulent and transmissible in humans

Vanden Bossche addressed the mainstream scientific concern about H5N1 s potential to adapt its surface proteins for better interaction with mammalian cells However he proposed an alternative theory linking COVID 19 vaccination to the spread of H5N1 Vanden Bossche suggested that highly vaccinated human populations acting as reservoirs for SARS CoV 2 SC 2 variants might indirectly influence the avian immune system He hypothesized that when birds are exposed to SC 2 from humans it could trigger a strong immune response in the birds particularly activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTLs which are immune cells that kill virus infected cells I don t have conclusive evidence to prove this but I don t rule out the possibility that highly C 19 vaccinated human populations could be the cause of a strong activation of CTLs in SC 2 exposed birds Vanden Bossche wrote This activated bird immune system Vanden Bossche theorized might react differently when exposed to H5N1 Instead of the typical immune response that would limit viral spread this primed immune system might inadvertently facilitate H5N1 infection and transmission Vanden Bossche further proposed that this immune system interaction could enable H5N1 to infect mammals including humans more easily Normally a virus needs to mutate significantly to jump between species However Vanden Bossche suggested that this altered

specifically causes innate immune suppression that would make humans more susceptible to infection by bird flu viruses Vanden Bossche also proposed a surprising potential outcome of this interplay between H5N1 and SARS CoV 2 suggesting that the bird flu panzootic might actually be accelerating the end of what he calls the SARS CoV 2 immune escape pandemic According to his theory the widespread presence of H5N1 could lead to increased activation of cross reactive immune responses in humans This enhanced immune activity might put additional pressure on SARS CoV 2 potentially forcing it to evolve in ways that could ultimately lead to its decline Enhanced reduction of SC 2 transmission in highly C 19 vaccinated populations would expedite the end of the SC 2 immune escape pandemic Vanden Bossche wrote He further hypothesized that the end of the SARS CoV 2 pandemic could in turn lead to a reduction in H5N1 transmission among birds potentially bringing the bird flu panzootic to an end Vanden Bossche strongly advised against vaccination for both bird flu and seasonal flu He argued that in the current context of the bird flu panzootic vaccination could have counterproductive effects and potentially expedite what he termed the disastrous evolutionary dynamics of the SC 2 immune escape pandemic People at higher risk of severe illness due to seasonal flu are better served by antiviral medications Vanden Bossche suggested", "chunk_id":

decade making it an attractive target for accelerating decarbonization This urgency has led to initiatives such as the Global Methane Pledge signed by 150 countries in September 2024 and policies such as Denmark s methane tax on livestock the first such tax to be implemented and the Reducing Methane from Organic Waste Declaration which was made at the 29th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference or COP29 designed to target methane from organic waste There s even a Global Methane Budget What is Bovaer The main active in Bovaer is 3 nitrooxypropanol or 3 NOP a synthetic organic

NOP a synthetic organic compound that is closely related to other nitrate esters that are widely used as explosives or propellants The formulation also includes propylene glycol and silicon dioxide Bovaer works by blocking the activity of an enzyme coenzyme M reductase or MCR which is crucial for methanogenesis the process by which ruminant animals like cows and sheep produce methane in their rumen the first and largest of their four specialized stomach compartments Methane which emanates largely from cows belching not as legend has it farting might be seen as problematic for humans concerned about climate change but it plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy rumen environment By inhibiting MCR Bovaer prevents the final step where hydrogen and CO2 are converted into methane Methane is the primary component of natural gas produced naturally deep underground or on the ocean floor and is exploited by humans for heating cooking and electricity generation But don t blame methane on cows and sheep It is also well known to seep naturally from reservoirs beneath the seafloor through volcanoes faults fractures and permeable rock layers and after earthquakes and landslides that disturb underground reservoirs Two big concerns we have about interfering with ruminants methane production are 1 Microbiome imbalance When these animals ferment tough plant material that humans can t digest in the oxygen free anaerobic environment of the rumen they produce volatile fatty acids as their primary energy source Hydrogen is the byproduct of this fermentation along with carbon dioxide and critically a group of gut microbes known as methanogens thrive on this hydrogen and are essential in breaking down pasture from which energy for the ruminants is then derived If the levels of hydrogen build up too much the fermentation process in the rumen is inhibited reducing the ability of the animals to get energy from their food 2 pH imbalance The second thing that methane does in the rumen is stabilize the pH acid alkaline balance and this balance is crucial for the microbes responsible for digestion These are issues that are under researched and consequently widely ignored Do

Reduced feed and water intake smaller ovaries and lower heart weight in cows Rat studies have raised red flags about fertility carcinogenicity and genotoxicity at doses higher than the recommended level for general use Handling the additive could also pose risks to farmers including skin irritation serious eye damage and possible fertility issues In one study a metabolite of Bovaer was detected in the milk of three out of four although it was dismissed due to its limited sample size That s before we take into account the fact that grass fed cattle present a completely different picture of the carbon cycle compared with feedlot grain fed cattle This can only be assessed using comprehensive life cycle analysis and recent studies here and here have shown that well managed grasslands and pastures have the capacity to absorb so much more carbon than feedlot systems both in the pasture and in the soil so offsetting methane production You also have to factor in that most of the grain feed e g maize wheat in feedlot systems is imported at great distances further increasing the carbon footprint Should we be surprised that Bovaer is being pushed as hard as it is Just when humans are

linked often tenuously to chronic health issues and more latterly climate change Questions arise around the focus on methane reducing additives linking to a powerful corporate driven agenda that undermines traditional regenerative farming in favor of industrial scale solutions Image source Beef Cattle Research Council Pressure from multiple but often nebulous quarters is increasing on farmers to turn their backs on traditional regenerative farming methods which work with natural carbon cycles All the while large swathes of agricultural land are bought up in ongoing land grabs In turn financial rewards are being offered to farmers to adopt methane reduction technologies in order to reduce their carbon footprints through the generation of carbon credits which can then be sold via the carbon markets The U S Department of Agriculture has also made substantial funding available to support farmers using methane reduction methods such as Bovaer making it very hard for smaller farmers to refuse to use such technologies in the long run Many schemes are being implemented to reduce meat consumption including the C40 Good Food Cities Accelerator scheme aims to get cities to reduce their climate impact by aligning with the EAT Lancet Planetary Diet This in turn pushes significant reductions in the consumption of animal products and thus methane However there are still a few influential mainstream research institutes that believe in agriculture The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Röckstrom for example has just published a report discussing unsustainable land use caused mainly by industrial agriculture and proposes to tackle it using regenerative agricultural practices The release of the report coincides with the start of COP16 Convention to Combat Desertification the main purpose of which is to Accelerate restoration of degraded land by 2030 and beyond giving hope that we can retreat from the brink of the environmental degradation wrought by humans currently miscategorized under the heading of climate change The alternative work with not against nature At the end of the day reducing methane isn t just about what goes into and comes out of

Although it s been more than five years since the start of the COVID 19 pandemic the resulting vaccine hesitancy still lingers to this day something Professor Margie Danchin is committed to helping solve A pediatrician at the Royal Children s Hospital in Melbourne Australia Danchin is also a vaccine expert at the Murdoch Children s Research Institute MCRI also in Melbourne Her biggest focus she told Fox News Digital is fighting the erosion of vaccine confidence at a time when technology is advancing and when the need for these advances to fight emerging and re emerging childhood diseases is growing One prime example of this technology according to Danchin is the new maternal vaccination against RSV respiratory syncytial virus and the RSV monoclonal antibody treatment for newborns called nirsevimab These are new and effective weapons against an illness that is a leading global cause of infant pneumonia and hospitalization of newborns Trump Demands Pharma Companies Slash Drug Prices in

seen too many horrible cases of periodontal disease gingivitis or anything like that nor have I had any patients really complaining about dry mouth she noted But definitely I have patients all the time that say Oh yeah I can tell I m dehydrated Defnet said she believes some of the serious oral health issues that have been reported are likely representative of more of a later stage issue with

antidepressant withdrawal effects written by academics many of whom have close ties to drug manufacturers risks underestimating the potential harms to long term antidepressant users by focusing on short term industry funded studies There is growing recognition that stopping antidepressants especially after long term use can cause severe and sometimes debilitating withdrawal symptoms and it is now acknowledged by the U K government as a public health issue One of the main reasons this issue took decades to recognize after the release of modern antidepressants onto the market is because

suggests a commonly used antibiotic for urinary tract infections UTIs may be tied to increased risk of congenital malformations when taken during the first trimester of pregnancy The study published today in JAMA Network Open found that exposure to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole TMP SMX during the first trimester was associated with increased risk of any malformation severe cardiac and other cardiac malformations and cleft lip and palate compared with beta lactam antibiotics No increased risk of congenital malformations was observed with nitrofurantoin which is also commonly used to treat UTIs The study partly substantiates the concerns of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG which has suggested that TMP SMX and nitrofurantoin be avoided during the first trimester when possible because of uncertainty about the risk of congenital malformations though studies to date have produced mixed results Despite the ACOG recommendation the two antibiotics still account for more than half of first trimester UTI prescriptions according to the study authors Chemotherapy May Help Cancer Spread New Study Shows Science reported Chemotherapy is the treatment of

You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A scientific review commissioned by the World Health Organization WHO claims it found no link between cellphone use and brain cancer The review was available online Aug 30 in Environmental International The publication which focused largely on brain cancer but also cancer risk in general is part of a WHO commissioned series of scientific reviews of the possible health risks of wireless radiation Joel Moskowitz Ph D director of the Center for Family and Community Health at the University of California Berkeley accused the review of being biased Moskowitz is a member of the International Commission on the Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields ICBE EMF a consortium of scientists doctors and related professionals who study radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation RF EMF and make recommendations for RF EMF exposure guidelines based on the best peer reviewed scientific research publications He has conducted and disseminated research related to wireless technology and public health since 2009 In a post published Tuesday on his Electromagnetic Radiation Safety website Moskowitz wrote The WHO selected scientists to conduct systematic literature reviews on the biologic and health risks of wireless radiation who had demonstrated their bias through prior publications by either not finding evidence of harm or dismissing any evidence they found The WHO s review reached very different conclusions than those reached by Moskowitz and his colleagues in a 2020 review of cellphone use and cancer tumor risk I believe that our 2020 review of cellphone use and tumor risk is less biased and will withstand the test of time better than the new review commissioned by the WHO Moskowitz wrote Miriam Eckenfels Garcia director of Children s Health Defense s CHD Electromagnetic Radiation EMR Wireless program told The Defender Unfortunately we are used to the WHO getting some really important things wrong She added The protection of human health should always be the priority and sadly this does not seem to be the case here The fact that the WHO handpicked scientists who are clearly biased to conduct such an important review and excluded scientific voices that reached different conclusions signals what we already know that the WHO is as captured by big industry as our own regulatory agencies WHO says cellphones don t increase risk of brain cancer For their review the WHO researchers looked at 5 060 study records published between 1994 and 2022 and then narrowed them down based on

meaning tumorous disease They concluded that RF radiation from cellphone use likely does not increase the risk of brain cancer Specifically they said there was moderate certainty evidence that RF EMF from cellphones held near the head does not increase the risk of glioma meningioma acoustic neuroma pituitary tumours and salivary gland tumours in adults or of paediatric brain tumours The WHO authors also said RF radiation from cell towers likely does not increase the risk of childhood cancer Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Independent researchers say otherwise Moskowitz and his co authors in their 2020 review of 46 studies found significant evidence linking cellular phone use to increased tumor risk especially among cell phone users with cumulative cell phone use of 1000 or more hours in their lifetime which corresponds to about 17 min per day over 10 years and especially among studies that employed high quality methods They recommended further studies be conducted to confirm their findings Moskowitz noted that the 2020 review differed in important ways from the WHO s review For instance the 2020 review looked at a different kind of study than the WHO review Our review examined only case control studies of tumor risk and cellphone use as we did not consider any occupational cohort or time trend studies to be of sufficient quality to warrant consideration he said Also Moskowitz and his co authors used different criteria for weeding out studies they thought might be biased Most importantly he added we employed a more conventional

radiation exposure limits produced by its own members their former students and close colleagues The wireless industry favors the ICNIRP limits because they re designed to protect people only from radiation levels high enough to generate heat meaning the limits turn a blind eye to the possible health effects from radiation levels lower than those needed to heat human tissue Moskowitz explained why it s problematic for ICNIRP members to conduct the WHO s reviews In 2019 investigative journalists from eight European countries published 22 articles in major news media that exposed conflicts of interest in this ICNIRP cartel The journalists argue that the cartel promotes the ICNIRP guidelines by conducting biased reviews of the scientific literature that minimize health risks from EMF electromagnetic field exposure By preserving the ICNIRP exposure guidelines favored by industry the cartel ensures that the cellular industry will continue to fund their research Even though a former ICNIRP member who served as editor in chief of the Bioelectromagnetics Society journal accused ICNIRP of groupthink in 2021 the WHO continues to promote the ICNIRP s guidelines which are similar to those adopted by the Federal Communications Commission in the U S Moskowitz explained The ICBE EMF in 2022 published a peer reviewed paper refuting the thermal only paradigm that insists that harmful biological effects only occur from radiation levels high enough to heat human tissue The preponderance of peer reviewed research finds non thermal effects Moskowitz said In July Moskowitz and other

nothing in the Communications Act grants regulatory jurisdiction over these companies in the capacity he is addressing them But I don t understand why he thinks the FCC in general or he in particular as an individual commissioner and future chair has any authority over the matter because they don t The demand for responses to him has no legal basis and is unenforceable The Federal Trade Commission FTC or the U S Department of Justice DOJ might be able to take regulatory action against the Big Tech firms McCollough said According to Inc Until now actions against big tech issues have mainly been

Carr could use the FCC chairperson role as a bully pulpit to pressure companies to achieve his goals including blocking mergers and acquisitions Inc added California based attorney Rick Jaffe told The

Vaccine During Clinical Trial Sues for Breach of Contract Brianne Dressen alleges that under her contract with AstraZeneca the vaccine maker promised to pay medical expenses for trial participants if the company s COVID 19 vaccine injured them You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A woman injured by the AstraZeneca vaccine she received in 2020 during a U S clinical trial is suing the vaccine maker in the first case of its kind challenging the legal liability shield for COVID 19 vaccine makers Brianne Dressen who since 2021 has advocated on behalf of vaccine injury victims filed suit Monday in the U S District Court for the District of Utah seeking compensation for injuries and disability she alleges resulted from the vaccine Under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act PREP Act AstraZeneca and other COVID 19 vaccine manufacturers cannot be held liable for injuries related to the vaccines However Dressen s lawsuit which also names the Salt Lake City based clinical trial site consolidator Velocity Clinical Research contends AstraZeneca can be sued for breach of contract According to the lawsuit the company agreed to cover the medical costs for any vaccine related injuries under a contract between AstraZeneca and clinical trial participants Dressen alleges that in her case the cost of her injuries and disability amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year Dressen who was 39 when she was vaccinated was previously a preschool teacher but is now unable to work Within hours of getting her first dose Dressen experienced tingling in her right arm a neurological condition known as paresthesia and blurred vision and vomiting In the weeks that followed her condition worsened with the paresthesia spreading to her legs resulting in disability and a diagnosis in 2021 by the National Institutes of Health NIH of post vaccine neuropathy The lawsuit seeks all available damages both economic and non economic Attorney Michael Connett of law firm Siri Glimstad LLP who is representing Dressen in her lawsuit told The Defender As far as we know this is the first case in the U S where a pharmaceutical company is being held financially responsible for the harms caused by the COVID vaccine Dressen told The Defender that her breach of contract claim is another first for the United States as PREP Act protections have been completely

injured by the AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccine and by the relatives of 12 people who died after getting the shot In documents AstraZeneca submitted to the U K High Court last month as part of that case the company admitted that its COVID 19 vaccine can in very rare cases cause TTS vaccine induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome which causes the body to produce life threatening blood clots Dressen s lawsuit comes just days after AstraZeneca announced the withdrawal of its COVID 19 vaccine globally though the company said it based its decision on the surplus of available updated vaccines leading to reduced demand for its vaccine The U S never granted emergency use authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccine citing safety concerns However the vaccine generated over 5 8 billion in sales globally with the help of the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation which funded and promoted the vaccine in other countries Several countries later stopped administering the AstraZeneca vaccine due to safety concerns Connett said AstraZeneca s decision to withdraw the vaccine really doesn t have a bearing on Dressen s lawsuit Ray Flores a health freedom rights attorney unconnected to the lawsuit agreed because the complaint is not based on product liability Flores said Around the country COVID 19 vaccine injury cases that alleged negligence battery of a minor fraud or emotional distress have all been unsuccessful due to the PREP Act while cases that allege negligence not involving a countermeasure have generally been successful What makes this case unique is that it alleges a breach of a written contract For a court to allow liability protection here would really stretch the extent of the law But on the other hand it would unequivocally etch the stench of the PREP Act in Americans minds but my money in this case is on the plaintiff AstraZeneca induced people to join trials by promising to pay for injuries According to Connett AstraZeneca induced people to join its clinical trial by promising to pay the medical expenses for any injuries that resulted from its COVID 19 vaccine This inducement this promise became a contractual obligation the moment study subjects rolled up

vaccination with paresthesia spreading to her right shoulder and left arm and later to her legs Within weeks she lost 20 pounds as a result of frequent vomiting while she also developed light sensitivity and became acutely sensitive to sound Dressen said her heart rate also would randomly spike leading to shortness of breath and feelings of fainting She described her experience in the lawsuit as feeling like a completely hollowed out version of who I once was Before her Nov 4 2020 vaccination Dressen filled out consent forms stating the company would cover the costs including but not limited to medical bills if she experienced a research injury Those forms Dressen said claimed the study doctor would provide treatment or referral in the event of injury noting that the study sponsor had the necessary insurance Sponsor will pay the costs of medical treatment for research injuries provided that the costs are reasonable and you did not cause the injury yourself the contract stated according to the lawsuit The lawsuit notes that two days after Dressen signed the consent form AstraZeneca amended the form to state that its vaccine may cause neurological disorders such as

a resident who preferred to remain anonymous told The Defender The resident a San Marcos mother who lives with her teenage daughter across the street from the proposed cell tower site said she first learned about Verizon s plans from a May 8 notification letter sent by the City of Carlsbad to residents Because of where city lines are drawn the tower fell under the jurisdiction of Carlsbad the mother said Only a few neighbors in my neighborhood were notified as by law the city only had to let people within 300 feet of the planned tower know about the project HOA didn t notify residents of its deal with Verizon The La Costa Oaks Community Association an HOA that manages 820 homes had been negotiating with Verizon since 2022 about renting out the land for the proposed tower But the HOA didn t inform homeowners of the proposed project Residents who learned of the proposed tower started a petition to alert other residents They circulated it on Nextdoor and Facebook According to the petition the La Costa Oaks HOA was considering signing a roughly 30 year lease with Verizon that likely would have generated 35 000 39 000 per year for the HOA resulting in a revenue stream of less

11 To make a long story short the mother said the city planner sided with Verizon The residents were told they had 10 days to appeal the decision The appeal fee was 900 The mother recalled So now we had to come up with 900 and we needed to file the appeal paperwork That was a legal document where we had to show proof that the city planner had made a mistake They gathered the funds and drafted the

the Aug 2 board meeting to voice their opposition to the tower The San Marcos mother said It was the power of these homeowners who demanded a vote right then and there from the board to cut ties with Verizon and to stop all negotiations And that was it The board of which two members were brand new and also had no clue about the planned project voted 4 1 to cancel all negotiations with Verizon And

California lawmakers on March 19 introduced the first U S bill that would phase out certain ultraprocessed foods from school meals If signed into law Assembly Bill 1264 AB 1264 would establish the first statutory definition of what qualifies as an ultraprocessed food and would direct state scientists to work with university experts to identify particularly harmful products which would then be removed from school cafeterias by 2032 We have not done enough to protect children from ultra processed foods and beverages that have far more in common with a cigarette than they do a fruit or vegetable Ashley Gearhardt a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan and director of the school s Food Addiction Science Treatment Lab said on a March 19 press call AB 1264 is a courageous step forward toward treating ultraprocessed foods like the serious health threats they are said Gearhardt To identify which ultraprocessed foods should be eliminated from school offerings scientists will consider whether a product includes additives that are banned elsewhere whether it has been linked to health harms whether it has been shown to contribute to food addiction and whether it contains excessive fat sugar or salt California Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel one of the lawmakers who introduced the bill said on the call The scientists will be required to publish a first report outlining this subcategory of especially harmful ultraprocessed foods by July 1 2026 said Gabriel and will be required to update the list every two years as research on these foods evolves The bill was embraced by both Democrat and Republican lawmakers added Gabriel Protecting our kids from harm is and always should be a bipartisan issue he said Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us In 2023 Gabriel introduced the California Food Safety Act or so called Skittles bill which is set to ban foods in the state containing brominated vegetable oil red dye No 3 and other toxic

typically undergone many industrial changes such as the addition of preservatives sweeteners and artificial flavors have been linked to 32 health conditions according to a 2024 review in The BMJ including heart disease diabetes mental health disorders and obesity About one in five U S children between the ages of 2 and 19 are obese Eating ultraprocessed foods has also been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD in children Some industry players have pushed back against the growing negative perception of ultraprocessed foods with General Mills reportedly arguing in a letter to the U S Department of Health and Human Services last year that Not all processed foods are nutritionally equivalent and do not have the same impact on health Processing is part of a complex food system that helps consumers meet nutritional needs within their abilities budget and preferences wrote General Mills Countries around the world have banned ingredients with concerning health effects that are still commonly used in U S foods including titanium dioxide brominated vegetable oil and artificial food dyes We hope that this bill will inspire food companies to tweak their

1976 1982 told The Defender she developed ovarian cancer at age 26 At 33 she had a hysterectomy Her mother developed breast cancer and had a double mastectomy Later genetic testing found no history of

U S Department of Justice DOJ urged the four federal judges overseeing the cases in the Eastern District of North Carolina to speed up the process of consolidating the cases The Department of Veterans Affairs VA has been receiving claims for years for 15 of the illnesses and conditions related to the Camp Lejeune water contamination But according to Van Arsdale progress has been slow They re

affecting more than 21 000 cases and resulting in a loss to veterans of nearly 14 million The majority of the denied claims were the result of the staff s failure to request additional evidence of injury Responding to these issues Congress passed the PACT Act A section of that law the Camp Lejeune Justice Act allows individuals who were exposed to toxic water at Camp Lejeune between 1953 and 1987 to file a claim for compensation Since the PACT Act was signed more than 90 000 administrative claims have been submitted to the Navy but few have been resolved The PACT Act does not set a

article Monday by Washington D C CBS affiliate WUSA9 claimants do not need a lawyer to file Under the PACT Act the deadline to file a claim is Aug 10 2024 for injuries diagnosed or treated before Aug 10 2022 for those who had exposure for not less than 30 days Holland told The Defender While Congress Camp Lejeune Justice Act is a step in the right direction it won t bring back the dead or restore the ill to robust health This was an avoidable tragedy A history of negligence Leaders at Camp Lejeune knew as early as 1980 that their water was contaminated according to court filings by DOJ attorneys Yet nothing was done In 1982 Camp Lejeune s water supplies were formally tested and found to be contaminated One of the owners of the lab that performed the tests Mike Hargett told NBC he

at Camp Lejeune came from leaking underground storage tanks waste disposal sites industrial area spills and an off base dry cleaning firm Three of the bases s eight water treatment facilities contained contaminants while serving mainside barracks and family housing at multiple locations A study published in Environmental Health in 2014 reported samples taken at Camp Lejeune between 1980 1985 primarily contained tetrachloroethylene also known as perchloroethylene or PCE trichloroethylene TCE and their breakdown products trans 1 2 dichloroethyline and vinyl chloride Benzene was also found in the water but at officially safe concentrations The highest contamination level for TCE was detected at 1400 µg micrograms L for PCE it was 250 µg L and for vinyl chloride 22 µg L The current U S maximum contaminant levels for TCE PCE are 5 µg L and for vinyl chloride 2 µg L TCE and PCE are commonly used as industrial degreasing solvents and are used in dry cleaning and in some refrigerants PCE is used to remove oil from fabrics as a carrier solvent and as a fabric finish or water repellent Both are known carcinogens TCE can smell sweet or be odorless and its vapors can be

Janssen Johnson Johnson vaccine and discovered residual DNA Rose said Buckhaults initially set out to prove McKernan wrong but instead ended up replicating his findings Plasmid DNA is used in the manufacturing of mRNA vaccines and is supposed to be removed to a level below a threshold set by health regulatory agencies before the final product is released for distribution The Epoch Times

and if it integrates into your genome you will produce its product forever Christof Plothe D O a member of the World Council for Health s steering committee told The Defender the presence of SV40 is problematic in terms of unwanted immunological reactions and potential integration into the genome with resulting DNA damage and alteration ability which can lead to cancer and many side effects This should not be in the vials as they pose the risk of integrating their genetic information into cells of our microbiome or any cell of our body Plothe said This can result in the newly programmed cell

about the harm these vaccines have been causing she told The Defender Sadly it seems we were quite accurate all along Patrick Provost Ph D professor of microbiology and immunology at Laval University in Canada told The Epoch Times All it takes is a single integration of SV40 at the wrong place in a single cell to initiate a cancerous process and kill a person SV40 all risk no reward McKernan told

the presence of the other two SV40 sequences What about the other two sequences No mention of them she said Every other scientist has found them Is Health Canada trying to downplay this Contamination can lead to cancer anaphylaxis and other severe reactions According to Bridle some potential problems involving DNA contamination include that it can be very long lasting has the potential to be incorporated into a person s chromosomes and can cause inflammation Rose told The Defender the contamination is problematic in terms of unwanted immunological reactions and potential integration DNA damage and alteration ability This is why we clean it and lipopolysaccharides out at the end of the modRNA synthesis workflow that utilizes the plasmid E coli system for DNA upscaling Speaking to CHD TV Wednesday Rose provided a further explanation saying that a plasmid E coli system was used to produce tons of DNA which is really good when you need to upscale a product and which was present in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID 19 vaccines made available to the public but not those used in clinical trials The problem was that at the end of the synthesis process of the modified mRNA apparently the residual DNA from the plasmids that were used to make this modified mRNA was not cleaned out properly she told CHD TV We re not supposed to have any relatively high levels of DNA at the end of the purification process This may have contributed to the high rate of adverse reactions Rose said This is an endotoxin if you inject endotoxin into a person as part of a product you can kill them What

19 vaccination including an epidemic of explosive cancers observing possible DNA plasmid and SV40 integration in promoting cancer development Similarly John Beaudoin Sr author of the forthcoming book The Real CdC COVID Facts for Regular People told The Defender Deaths involving secondary malignant cancers of lymph nodes are more than four times normal rates in 2023 Buckhaults however attempted to downplay the cancer risk noting that he was skeptical about the connection between turbo cancers and the COVID 19 vaccines Separately he wrote that SV40 is a standard bit of molecular biology engineering that has been used for decades However he acknowledged it poses a non zero future cancer risk Mark Johnson a spokesperson for Health Canada told The Epoch Times that current data do not show a connection between the vaccines and turbo cancers Lindsay took issue with this statement telling The Defender that several oncologists have come out to speak on this noting that we have seen an increase in the ICD codes that code for cancers and adding that there are all kinds of reports of fast acting cancers taking people out within days to months of diagnosis McKernan told The Epoch Times there is another cause for concern relating to the presence of SV40 in the COVID 19 vaccines namely the association of SV40 with polio vaccines which he said may be the reason Pfizer didn t disclose

manufacturers under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness PREP Act may also be called into question as a result of the revelations regarding contamination of the COVID 19 vaccines Ray Flores senior legal counsel to Children s Health Defense told The Defender that Until now it s been the Wild West when government officials and manufacturers assume the PREP Act permits them to operate under the assumption that anything goes Although courts have routinely barred battery and negligence claims it remains to be seen whether courts will find in favor of a defendant who has engaged in fraud he said With concrete evidence of fraud shareholder derivative suits that have so far been unsuccessful could finally win Flores said noting that Pfizer s stock is down over 39 this year The courts and public may not be so forgiving this time he added Bridle referenced a recent Michigan court ruling finding that the PREP Act does not apply to remdesivir a COVID 19 treatment administered under Emergency Use Authorization on the basis of negligent manufacture of the product The court ruled that a pharmaceutical company s legal indemnity was null and void for a contaminated version of the medical product Bridle wrote So it would follow that Pfizer s legal indemnity should be null and void for shots that contaminated with bacterial DNA that was not disclosed to regulatory agencies Rose

state s large agricultural use of pesticides Iowa has the second highest rate of new cancer cases in the U S and the fastest growing cancer rate Organizers against the Iowa bill are planning a rally at the state capitol on Feb 10 after the state senate voted Feb 5 to advance the measure The bill would bar people from suing pesticide manufacturers for failing to warn them of health risks as long as the product labels are approved by the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA Opponents say the legislation will rob farmers and others who use pesticides from holding companies accountable in

litigation has so far cost Bayer billions of dollars in settlements and jury verdicts favoring plaintiffs and more cases are pending The company says the pursuit of the legislative changes is necessary to protect its important investments and to ensure farmers don t lose access to Roundup The company says it has joined with more than 360 grower and industry groups to push the federal legislative changes and with the Modern Ag Alliance coalition of agricultural organizations to fight for the changes in state laws Bayer said the state laws would not prevent anyone from suing pesticide makers though they would ensure that any pesticide registered with the EPA and sold with an EPA approved label would satisfy requirements for health and safety warnings The company said the future of American farming depends on reliable science based regulation of important crop protection products determined safe for use by the EPA CropLife America which lobbies on behalf of Bayer and

bar any state labeling requirements that were inconsistent with the EPA s conclusions regarding the safety of a pesticide Statements or conclusions regarding the product s human health effects including the likelihood of causing cancer birth defects or reproductive harm that are different from EPA s findings and conclusions would be considered misbranding the proposed amendment states Like the proposed state laws the language would essentially bar legal claims against pesticide makers that accuse them of failing to warn a consumer of certain health risks if the EPA has not required those risks to be spelled out on a product label The EPA is accepting comments until Feb 20 Back in Iowa the bill is expected to pass the state Senate but is projected to face an uphill battle in the House chamber Despite a flood of online and newspaper advertising by proponents of the Iowa bill opposition is strong said Andrew Mertens executive director of the Iowa Association for Justice which

changes as possible contributing factors but some experts say that s only part of the story Dr Mike Varshavski a family medicine physician and health influencer told USA Today the factors are usually so complex and multifactorial but that one of the major drivers of cancers are the rising rates of obesity in the United States and across the globe However Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist at Children s Health Defense said the USA Today story dismantles its own solution because some doctors noted that their younger cancer patients were frequently healthy before their diagnosis The U S is ranked fourth in the world for age standardized incidence of cancer 367 per 100 000 and 19th for adult obesity 42 7 Jablonowski said The cancer epidemic is way beyond diet and exercise USA Today cited figures from an American Cancer Society ACS study published in The Lancet in August According to the study 17 types of cancer including breast colorectal liver gastric ovarian and pancreatic cancer are rising among younger adults Mortality trends connected to some cancers have also increased USA Today also listed celebrities with recent cancer diagnoses including Princess Kate Elle Macpherson Jenna Fischer and Olivia Munn all Gen Xers born between 1965 and 1980 or millennials born between 1981 and 1996 The article recommended younger adults be vigilant about their health Experts who spoke with The Defender welcomed this message However they criticized what they said was an attempt to normalize rising cancer rates among young adults while ignoring other possible underlying causes including vaccines If you normalize a disease you will alter the health behaviors addressing the disease Jablonowski said If you believe cancer is inevitable or occurs at random then you believe your health behavior has no impact on the chances of developing cancer Dr Margaret Christensen a clinical educator and co founder of the Carpathia Collaborative said USA Today s recommendations that younger people engage in fine tuning their diet and exercise routines stay up to date on cancer screenings and visit their doctor regularly are important But where is the

noted the timing of rising cancer rates among young adults Dr Angus Dalgleish professor of oncology at St George s University of London told The Defender Colorectal cancer has been slowly rising in young people for well over a decade and probably more However there has been an inflection in the rate of rise from mid 2021 This is worldwide John Beaudoin Sr author of The Real CdC and THE CDC MEMORANDUM told The Defender that while incidence rates for such cancers have risen for a decade the change in rate or rise is what decries a new issue introduced into society Beaudoin said that if the annual increase was 2 per year consistent with a 2 population increase that is understandable But if the rate then goes to a 4 annual increase then there is a major issue The rate doubled and is not consistent with population increase Dr Pierre Kory founder of the Leading Edge Clinic and president emeritus and co founder of the Front Line COVID 19 Critical Care Alliance FLCCC agreed He said the USA Today report and the study in The Lancet mark a sea change in the cancer message Childhood vaccination set the scene for rising young adult cancer rates According to USA Today there s no exact cause known for the rise in cancers among young people although researchers are trying to figure it out However the article suggested that environmental factors namely changes to our microbiome over time the environment air water etc may be partly responsible Christensen agreed at least in part The same factors environmental toxins in the food water air and many medications that cause insulin resistance and obesity are causing cancers she said However even in countries with lower rates of obesity we are still seeing increased levels of cancers in younger folks With environmental factors and obesity accounting only partially for the rising onset of cancer in younger adults experts told The Defender vaccines likely contribute significantly to this increase This has led me to look at childhood vaccines and I am afraid they have set the scene Dalgleish said There are now far too many The adjuvants alone correlate with autism and ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder The

added There is strong mechanistic data to explain how the jabs may lead to cancer This association is strong There does not appear to be another plausible explanation Obesity rates have increased slowly and cannot explain the massive increase in cancers noted recently Christensen said USA Today and organizations like the ACS are dancing around the elephant in the room by not wanting to make the connection to the vaccines while stating the obvious problems we can t ignore Mainstream media have been completely negligent in my view for not holding our concerns regarding the vaccines and cancer to account Dalgleish said Instead of ignoring the problem The concept of turbo cancer needs to be accepted Marik said More research is required to more precisely determine who is at risk what the incidence is and how to prevent and treat this disease The best way to stop the young person s cancer epidemic is to stop the cause Jablonowski said", "chunk_id":

article Sign Up By David Sella Villa J D Some unusual witnesses helped convict Alex Murdaugh of the murders of his wife Maggie and son Paul The first was Bubba Maggie s yellow Labrador retriever Prosecutors used a recording of Bubba to place Alex at the site of the murders Given Alex s presence at the crime scene other witnesses then revealed his movements tracked his speed and explained what he had in his hands Those other witnesses were a 2021 Chevy Suburban and Maggie Paul and Alex s cellphones which all provided data They re all part of the Internet of Things also known as IoT The privacy implications of devices connected to the internet are not often the most important consideration in solving a murder case But outside of criminal prosecution they affect people s privacy in ways that should give everyone pause The Internet of Things The IoT includes any object or device that automatically sends and receives data via the internet When you use your phone to message someone

people who interact with them and about other people around the devices As an assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina I have watched as new kinds of connected devices have entered the market New devices mean new ways to collect data about people Connected devices collect information from different contexts Take your refrigerator As a non IoT device your fridge generated no data about your kitchen your food or how often you peeked inside Your relationship with the fridge was effectively private Only you knew about that midnight snack or whether you ogled a co worker s lunch Now smart refrigerators can respond to voice commands show images of the items in your fridge track who opens it suggest recipes generate grocery lists and even contact your car to let you know

sleep patterns and stress levels you might have undergone a battery of tests at a hospital Specialized equipment in a controlled setting would have measured your body and make these parts of you visible to highly trained licensed professionals But now devices such as the Oura Ring track and analyze all that information continuously in non healthcare contexts Even if you don t mind sharing data with an IoT company there are privacy risks to using a device like this In the healthcare context a series of rules enforced by several groups make sure that connected equipment and the data the equipment generates have adequate cybersecurity protections Away from that context connected devices that perform similar functions don t have to meet the same cybersecurity standards The U S Cyber Trust Mark program administered by the Federal Communications Commission is developing cybersecurity standards for IoT devices But the program is voluntary In some states such as Washington state laws set standards for protecting health data from connected devices But these laws don t cover all data from all devices in all contexts This leaves the devices and the data they generate particularly vulnerable to unwanted access by hackers Your inability to control who sees the data that connected devices gather is another privacy risk It can give advertisers insights about potential customers Absent a mandated opt out each device provider can decide what it does with customer data Amazon for example recently removed the Do Not Send Voice Recordings option from the privacy settings of its popular smart speaker Alexa Some connected device providers participate in data markets selling your data to the highest bidder Sometimes those purchasers include government agencies So instead of needing a warrant to track your whereabouts or learn about activity in your home they can purchase or access IoT records A connected device can also compromise the data privacy of someone who just happens to be nearby Connected cars Cars have joined the ranks of the IoT The 2021 Chevy Suburban that helped convict Alex Murdaugh simply tracked information about the vehicle This included the

driving decisions they need data about the world around them They need to know the size speed and behavior of all the nearby vehicles on the roadway moment to moment They need to instantly identify the best way to avoid a pedestrian cyclist or other object entering the roadway If you and I are driving in separate cars on the same roadway it means my car is collecting information about you And if my vehicle is connected then data about you is being shared with other cars and car companies In other words if a Tesla had been present at the scene of the Murdaugh murders its outward facing cameras could have captured footage Bubba s testimony might not have been necessary Spillover data collection IoT devices generate data from similar situations in a highly structured way Therefore what data collectors learn about me from my connected device may also give them insights about someone else in a similar situation Take smart meters that share information with the water utility every 15 minutes Imagine a subdivision with a narrow range of house and yard sizes Water usage should be relatively comparable for each household Data from even just a couple of houses can give a good sense of what water use should be for everyone in the neighborhood Without actually collecting data from each house data from connected devices reveals potentially private information about similarly situated people Data from IoT devices can also fuel insights into people who never use or make contact with these devices Aggregated data from Oura rings for instance could contribute to decisions a health insurer makes about you Connected devices are also changing In addition to collecting data about the person using the device a growing number of sensors collect information about the environment

important to be more aware of the way connected devices may be affecting people s privacy The story of how vehicle data combined with cell data in the Murdaugh trial is a case in point At the start of the trial prosecutors came ready to show phone call logs and texts steps recorded apps asking for information GPS locations changes when the phone went from vertical portrait mode to horizontal landscape mode and back and key to the prosecution s case when the camera was activated But that was probably not enough to merit a conviction During the trial GM called and said something like oh wait we found something according to the prosecution That vehicle data combined with the cellphone data told a story that Alex Murdaugh could not deny There are at least two lessons from this story First not even GM fully realized all the data it had collected in its vehicles It s important to be aware of just how much information IoT devices are collecting Second combining data from different IoT devices revealed incontestable details of Alex Murdaugh s activities Away from criminal court combining data from multiple IoT devices can have a profound effect on people s privacy If people s

to worry about a central bank digital currency nothing like that is remotely close to happening anytime soon Powell said in his March 7 testimony before the Senate Banking Committee If we were to ever

really need to explore as a country The closing of the totalitarian circle The Atlantic Council a think tank that says it promotes constructive leadership and engagement in international affairs based on the Atlantic Community s central role in meeting global challenges defines a CBDC as virtual money backed and issued by a central bank According to the council In every country with an advanced retail CBDC project CBDCs are intermediated meaning they are distributed through banks financial institutions and payments service providers In China though there is also an option for a direct CBDC

choose to opt out Hinchliffe said Take a look at Nigeria for example A year after introducing the eNaira adoption was at 5 Then the Central Bank of Nigeria instructed private banks and financial institutions to put caps on cash withdrawals in order to pressure people to adopt the eNaira this was a major disruptor and there was a lot of backlash In 2012 Nigeria s Central Bank issued a statement on a cash less Nigeria that aimed to reduce but not eliminate the amount of physical cash in circulation Hinchliffe said But in January 2023 the Nigerian government said Nigeria will become a full non cash economy by March 1 2023 Fitts said another good example of the drive toward CBDCs is India where Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought in a lot of the larger cash notes pushing for a digital system In 2016 the two largest denominations of rupee notes were eliminated According to Reuters the ban disrupted the daily lives of hundreds of millions of Indians The BBC reported that the move damaged India s economy In January the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union which consists of eight countries shut down its CBDC project According to Reuters this occurred after problems left users unable to access digital wallets A January 2022 white paper by the Fed claims a U S CBDC would complement rather than replace current forms of money and methods for providing financial services Yet Fitts pointed to an October 2020 statement by Agustín Carstens general manager of the Bank of International Settlements who said general use of CBDCs would have a huge difference with cash For instance with cash we don t know who is using a 100 bill today Carstens said A key difference with the CBDC is the central bank", "chunk_id":

from the Bank of International Settlements proposes all assets such as private property be tokenised into digital assets on a programmable platform The ultimate goal is to eliminate cash in order to usher in programmable CBDCs tied to digital ID This allows for total surveillance and control over personal transactions Hinchliffe said citing a 2017 WEF article stating that the gradual obsolescence of paper currency is one of the characteristics of a well designed CBDC Speaking at Columbia University last year Neel Kashkari president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said If you want to impose negative interest rates if you want to directly tax customer accounts you can do that with a CBDC He added I get why China would be interested Why would the American people be for that Yet some countries continue to place restrictions on the use of cash Greece for instance prohibited cash transactions exceeding 500 euros 544 in December 2023 with fines of up to twice the value of the transaction In 2020 Greece required 30 of people s purchases to be made using a debit or credit card with fines for non compliance But some countries appear to be reversing this trend According to independent journalist Peter Imanuelsen Norway has proposed legislation that would require businesses to accept physical cash as a form of payment In January the Swedish government began exploring

the power to program CBDCs which may include restricting what you can buy where and when much like expirable coupons that only work in certain places Using geographic information system GIS data and merchant category codes MCC you can institute a system that can enforce the equivalent of the COVID 19 pandemic Fitts said Your money only works for permitted uses and can be turned off Still for now at least progress on CBDCs seems to have stalled in the U S Fitts said because of the First Amendment the 2nd Amendment and the constitutional powers of the states This is why there is so much effort

Trump s supposed goal to Make America Healthy Again MAHA his administration is moving to reregister dicamba a pesticide twice banned by federal courts for use on genetically engineered cotton and soybeans In response to legal challenges from the Center for Biological Diversity Center for Food Safety National Family Farm Coalition and the Pesticide Action Network courts ruled against the

EPA s proposed registration is now open for public comment until Aug 22 but supporters and critics are already weighing in While the pesticide companies welcomed the agency s attempt to allow dicamba

which makes vaccine related recommendations She was co leader of a group tasked with gathering information that would be presented at ACIP meetings In October 2022 ACIP members unanimously recommended adding COVID 19 vaccines for children as young as 6 months old to the CDC childhood schedule In October 2023 the committee recommended expanding the childhood and adult immunization schedules

just a personnel change it s a signal flare Dr Panagiotakopoulos helped shape the CDC s COVID 19 vaccine policy including its controversial push on pregnant women Her abrupt departure suggests internal fracture and quiet dissent Ji said A massive reversal of policy Panagiotakopoulos presented data at ACIP s April meeting on Moderna s COVID 19 vaccine and options for the 2025 26 vaccination schedule According to Reuters the working group had been leaning toward narrowing use of the vaccines but recommending broader use for certain at risk populations including very young children and pregnant women who are at high risk of COVID complications Last week HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr rejected these recommendations announcing that the COVID 19 vaccine would be removed from the CDC s recommended immunization schedule for children and pregnant women However as The Defender reported the CDC didn t remove the vaccine from the schedule Instead the agency added a note stating that instead of a universal recommendation that all children ages 6 months and older receive the COVID 19 shots the CDC now recommends shared clinical decision making between parents and providers for children ages 6 months to 17 years who are not moderately immunocompromised Reuters reported that this decision was a departure from the usual process in which ACIP experts meet and vote on changes to the immunization schedule or recommendations on who should get vaccines before the agency s director made a final call That s a massive reversal of policy And the fact that one of the CDC s own experts couldn t stand by and endorse it anymore should be setting off alarms Tapper said However experts who spoke with The Defender said ACIP is only an advisory committee and that the CDC director and HHS more generally aren t bound by ACIP s recommendations They can and sometimes do make independent decisions For example in October 2021 former CDC Director Rochelle Walensky overruled ACIP when she decided to recommend COVID 19 boosters for everyone age 16 and older ACIP recommended against the boosters citing the lack of safety and efficacy data on the vaccine for 16 and 17 year olds CBS

measles that year in a population of 5 1 million Math alert Hence if you lived in B C you had a 1 in 850 000 chance of catching measles that year There were no measles deaths What do we know about the six cases reported Of those six cases half were fully immunized with two shots one had one and one had a history of childhood vaccines So maybe one could conclude that four to five of those six had some level of measles immunization Hmmm What is going on A bit of history Those of us born before 1970 with personal experience pretty much all agree that measles is a big meh We all had it ourselves and so did our brothers sisters and school friends We also had chicken pox and mumps and typically got a few days off school The only side effect of those diseases was that my mom sighed heavily and called work to say she had to stay home to look after a kid with spots It s hard to find what the death rate from measles was in Canada before the measles vaccine was released in the early 1960s but if we take the U S as a proxy in 1955 there were 345 measles deaths in the U S population of 165 million Math alert that s a one in 478 000 chance of dying of measles in the pre vaccine era Lots of people got measles back then as did me and my brother and sisters but very few died Other reports note that the U S death rate from measles and pre vaccine was about 1 in 10 000 but this is likely to be an exaggeration because back then our parents who had a kid with a fever and a rash wouldn t have gone to the doctor or reported it to the government In other words the 1 in 10 000 number only refers to the ten thousand people sick enough to have their case reported to the government or hospitalized The true death rate in the entire population is likely much much lower How many of our moms

blasé about measles described as a self limiting condition of short duration moderate severity and low fatality In other words you got it it didn t last long it wasn t that bad and was very unlikely to kill you The best thing about getting it of course is the bonus to your immune system as getting the real thing sets you up for near lifelong and valuable immunity What has changed Thanks both to widespread vaccination and natural immunity by the early 2000s measles was essentially declared eradicated in the U S and Canada but still very much active in the developing world where lack of proper nutrition particularly vitamin A puts malnourished kids at risk of all kinds of diseases including measles In Canada and the U S even with upwards of 90 vaccination coverage among children there are still outbreaks mostly in middle and high schools This is not failure to vaccinate as the media will tell you it is vaccine failure The vaccine doesn t seem to work in some people At the same time there hasn t been a measles caused death in Canada or the U S for at least 20 years Let that sink in for a bit as you soak in the epidemic measles mongering we re currently experiencing Then there is the not often quoted fact that wild measles is different from the one we re all vaccinated against and this is not a bad thing Researchers have found that we should be glad that wild measles is still circulating in the community because it tends to boost people s immune systems even among the vaccinated when they come in contact with it An Italian study found that if you get measles your immunity is lifelong whereas your immunity after getting the two doses of the measles vaccine declines within 10 15 years This paper looked at the recent experience with measles in the U S 2002 2016 and

measles in the U S 2002 2016 and reported there were 1 018 measles hospitalizations over that 14 year period That is 73 hospitalizations per year There were a total of 34 deaths or about 2 4 deaths per year That is out of a population of 327 million people So your chances of dying from measles in the U S were about 1 in 136 million We are told that globally measles is a huge deal Like any disease it s certainly a bigger deal if you are poor and don t get enough to eat However in 2019 the World Health Organization reported 839 cases in 23 states comprising 328 million people thus making the rate about 1 in 391 000 It s true that kids in poor countries can die from measles yet they also die from everything else that kills poor malnourished people living in countries without clean water sanitation or functioning healthcare systems Many infectious diseases including measles attack the most immune compromised who also happen to be the poorest least robust people on the planet The minuscule numbers we re talking about in the developed world however suggest that the risk of death from measles is wildly overblown This question lingers for me why do public health people aided by the mainstream media feel they need to exaggerate distort and fear monger with this disease Perhaps the current set of public health officials isn t very good at reading the room in our post COVID 19 world where past obvious lies and distortions have seriously impacted our collective ability to trust public health advice Yet the campaign continues to try to scare the heck out of people claiming measles is a disease that represents a substantial and preventable health care burden with serious complications hospitalization and inpatient mortality Some might say Yes but how bad would the measles death rate be if we didn t have widespread measles vaccines available Now we re getting hypothetical here and no one can answer that definitively To me it s an unprovable straw man argument and no defense for the blatant use of fear distortion exaggeration and hype to scare people about a disease where the potential for harm for most of us is so remote as to be laughable What does this exaggeration do A recent Canadian survey found that opposition to mandatory vaccinations in children has grown from 24 before the pandemic to 38 2024 This is the collateral damage of forcing vaccines on people which we saw deployed with COVID 19 Again such actions just cause people to stop trusting official health advice and push back against coercive measures I have spent a lot of my professional

prescription drugs including those for high blood pressure cholesterol obesity or blood sugar conditions for which crass and pharma fuelled messages confuse consumers and drive them back and forth to the doctor for more tests and more pills A colleague of mine Dr Joel Lexchin from Toronto recently published a chapter on disease mongering in the Encyclopedia of Pharmacy Practice and Clinical Pharmacy He concluded Disease mongering promotes a view of people not as healthy autonomous beings but as vulnerable individuals always at risk from a threat just around the corner This is what is happening with measles Big media and government overhyping the nature of an illness which history has shown us can be a precursor to some very bad public health policies such as mandatory vaccination programs and other coercive measures Does it make sense to be measles mongering when the level of herd immunity obtained through natural immunity and vaccination is already pretty substantial Doing so is the equivalent of crying wolf or shouting fire in a crowded theatre You unnecessarily alarm people and thus down the road when you do need them to pay attention to something serious no one will trust you On a last note we haven t discussed the downsides My mantra is that any medicine that can help can also harm What do we know about the harms of the measles vaccine The honest answer is there are some serious gaps in our knowledge We can t deny that some people are regrettably hurt by vaccines In the case of the measles vaccine how many people have been hurt Pinning down an exact number is extremely hard to do as those numbers rely on vaccine adverse event reporting a notoriously unreliable data source The reporting of drug or vaccine adverse events to health authorities is so poor that maybe 1 in 100 adverse events ever get reported to a government agency That was the conclusion of the Harvard Pilgrim study on the rate of reporting to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS Math hint if you hear of a drug or vaccine that caused 1 000 reported adverse events then multiply that by up to 100 so the true number possibly suffering that adverse event could be about 100 000

could be about 100 000 people U S statistics drawn from a pool of people seeking compensation for injury or death caused by vaccines reported that between 1988 and 2023 there were 1 048 such reports linked to the MMR vaccine the one that contains measles vaccines made to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in the U S Next to the flu vaccine or the DPT shot the MMR vaccine had the third most number of people seeking compensation for injury If the 1 048 reports are only a tiny fraction of the people hurt by the vaccine the true number could be closer to 100 000 Remember this is a disease that caused 34 deaths over a 14 year period in the U S For a final comment to those who say the measles vaccine is incredibly safe I hope they are right but I would also ask what reliable research are they pointing to to support that conclusion A 2012 meta analysis from the Cochrane Collaboration which takes no money from the pharmaceutical industry examined all the data they could find around the globe on the safety of the MMR vaccine They found 57 clinical trials with a total of 14 7 million children who had received the MMR vaccine Cochrane s conclusion stated that the design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies both pre and post marketing are largely inadequate In other words As much as public people shout safe and effective from the rooftops and browbeat those who are hesitant the reality is that the safety studies done on that vaccine both before and after they were approved for sale are no help in answering the question of overall safety If anyone has a more comprehensive meta analysis of the overall safety of the MMR vaccine please let me know To conclude the current state of modern measles mongering is a leitmotif of post pandemic public health where the state and mainstream media measles mongering is actively telling the population to fear a disease that has an extremely remote chance of you getting it and an even more remote chance of you dying from it It predictably recommends everyone do whatever they can to protect their family ie get more measles shots which may or may not protect you And if you get the shot please

partnership with the CDC Foundation funded a toolkit to train community based organizations on how to hire influencers to combat vaccine myths in communities of color The CDC Foundation s donor list includes the World Health Organization the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation and vaccine makers including Pfizer Merck and Johnson Johnson The toolkit first rolled out in 2022 is part of a suite of resources created by the CDC s Partnering for Vaccine Equity Program P4VE which targets ethnic and racial minority communities to increase vaccine uptake by funding partnerships with the CDC P4VE s Vaccine Resource Hub is funded through a grant for over 80 million from the CDC and the U S Department of Health and Human Services It includes toolkits unbranded digital materials and messaging in over 50 languages Community organizations can use the Influencer Guide to help them contact influencers who can spread the organizations messages in the influencers own voices The guide suggests targeting mid level influencers those who aren t overly famous and who are preferably self made because they re often seen as more relatable and trusted than large brands or celebrities on social media These influencers can effectively act as messengers with a wide reach to promote vaccination in racial and ethnic minority communities To maximize their online influence the guide recommends community organizations first identify suitable candidates with a relevant background and who haven t made inappropriate posts in the past Once they ve identified the right influencers organizations can ask influencers to partner with them to spread their message about for example the safety of COVID 19 vaccines for people in marginalized communities The guide provides advice on how to negotiate fees with influencers On Instagram influencers with 1 000 10 000 followers typically get paid 10 100 per post with rates increasing as follower counts rise Instagram influencers with over a million followers typically receive 10 000 and up per post On TikTok rates start at 5 25 per post and can increase to 2 500 and up per post for people with over a million followers The guide recommends

administered by multiple nonprofits including the CDC Foundation and the Urban Institute which primarily distributed P4VE money to community based organizations In addition to running the P4VE Resource Hub which creates resources like the Influencer Guide the CDC Foundation s role in P4VE includes partnering with 31 community organizations to increase vaccine uptake in their communities It also collaborates with five unnamed digital marketing and media partners to combat misinformation about vaccines across social media channels and promote digital health literacy among communities experiencing disparities in immunization The CDC Foundation is an independent nonprofit organization created by Congress to funnel private sector resources into the CDC and CDC programs From its founding in 1995 through 2023 the foundation raised 2 2 billion from private and government donors for its domestic and international programs Programs range from health communications to increase confidence in public health institutions to data modernization to improve health surveillance in the U S as well as to global health security initiatives such as working with the Bill Melinda Gates

immunocompromised children There is no definition for moderately immunocompromised on the CDC website which states that immunocompromised means someone has a weakened immune system The CDC website does provide clarity on the shared clinical decision making recommendations in general It states For routine catch up and risk based recommendations the default decision should be to vaccinate the patient based on age group or other indication unless contraindicated For shared clinical decision making recommendations there is no default the decision about whether or not to vaccinate may be informed by the best available evidence of who may benefit from vaccination Commenting on the model Substack writer and COVID 19 vaccine expert Sasha Latypova said it is notable that parents aren t

views on COVID 19 including those of Dr Jay Bhattacharya now head of the National Institutes of Health It is not something I would do she said when pressed Paul also asked about U S public health agencies collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and about gain of function research during the pandemic and during her time at the CDC Monarez said she hadn t had the opportunity to look

The BMJ into the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System or VAERS found multiple deficiencies in the system including the revelation that the government runs two systems one for the public and a private back end system that contains all of the corrections and updates including deaths that occurred after an initial injury When Dr Robert Sullivan collapsed on his treadmill three weeks after his second COVID 19 vaccine in early 2021 he fell into a nightmare ordeal that he said exposed glaring deficiencies in the nation s vaccine safety monitoring system Diagnosed with sudden onset pulmonary

Sullivan s experience highlights the systemic problems with the U S adverse events monitoring system run jointly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the U S Food and Drug

interviewed by The BMJ Sullivan experienced limited follow up after submitting his VAERS report He received only a temporary report number months after his initial submission A physician named Helen

adverse events reports in VAERS were either not posted publicly or were deleted React19 is a nonprofit that collects stories of people injured by the mRNA vaccines According to The BMJ of those queried by React19 22 had never been given a permanent VAERS ID number and 12 had disappeared from the system entirely Benavides who publishes the VAERSAware dashboards documenting many of the

engagement these restrictive policies keep critical data hidden according to Benavides In 2007 the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS contracted with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care HPHC to review the VAERS system In 2010 HPHC filed its r report which determined that 1 in 39 people experienced vaccine injuries and that only around 1 of vaccine related injuries or deaths are ever reported to VAERS The CDC which operates under HHS scuttled the study refused to take calls from the researchers and declined to upgrade the VAERS system when a new much more effective system was developed Blind spots are self created VAERS collects reports of symptoms diagnoses hospital admissions and deaths after vaccination for the purpose of capturing post market safety signals according to The BMJ But the limited transparency of VAERS data presents barriers to proper analysis according to The BMJ s investigation and researchers like Benavides The public including doctors and other report submitters can access only incomplete initial reports not updates with vital details This means outcomes like death are often excluded if the initial report was for an injury and a subsequent death report was filed I made the false assumption that my conversation with VAERS would result in an adjustment to the publicly reported case Patrick Whelan M D Ph D told The BMJ Whelan a rheumatologist and researcher at the University of California Los Angeles in 2022 filed a report of a cardiac arrest in a 7 year old male patient after COVID 19 vaccination I assumed that since it was a catastrophic event the safety committee would want to hear about it right away Whelan said But nobody called him or requested an update after his submission There was no mechanism for updating it Whelan told The

over 1 7 million reports since the COVID 19 vaccine rollout staffing was not boosted accordingly according to statements the CDC made to The BMJ A Freedom of Information Act request by The BMJ revealed Pfizer has nearly 1 000 more full time employees working on vaccine surveillance than the CDC Records showed in 2021 Pfizer on boarded 600 additional full time employees to handle the volume of adverse reports and planned to hire 200 more Physician Helen in The BMJ article called for an end to the negative feedback loop whereby the FDA fails to list adverse reactions because passive surveillance systems like the FDA s don t display them while at the same time because of that lack of disclosure physicians are blinded to the adverse reactions in their patients and thus aren t

questions about the HPV vaccine safety claims by Merck and global regulators and about why truly independent safety studies have not been conducted for a vaccine that is being heavily promoted for every child globally EMA asks Merck to do safety analysis Concerns about adverse events from the HPV vaccine in Japan and Denmark prompted the Danish Health and Medicines Authority to ask the European Commission to investigate the safety of the HPV vaccine The commission launched an investigation Four months later it issued a report concluding there was no link between HPV vaccines and serious neurological adverse events and discouraging further research into the issue Rather than performing its own independent assessment the EMA asked Merck and GSK maker of the HPV vaccine Cervarix to evaluate the safety of their drugs The companies used their own post marketing data to do an analysis comparing the number of observed adverse events number of cases of that disease reported in pharmacovigilance systems related to a vaccine to the number of expected adverse events based on the background rate at which a disease occurs in the general population If the observed rate is significantly higher than the background rate there is a signal However in Merck s analysis for POTS Merck found the opposite the number of reports following vaccination was lower than the background rate Merck overestimated POTS rates in general population To get this outcome Merck underestimated the number of POTS adverse events and overestimated the background rates according to Tomljenovic s report And it did so with the EMA s endorsement When Merck did its analysis there were no published reports on incident rates for POTS so there was no good way to get a background rate from the published literature The company estimated its POTS background rates based on the background rates for chronic fatigue syndrome a different syndrome with different diagnostic criteria The vaccine

spontaneous adverse event reporting systems like MARRS or VAERS there is a very high rate of underreporting because only a small fraction of side effects are ever reported For example Researchers have found that the number of injuries reported to VAERS is less than 1 Underreporting rates of between 94 98 have been reported in other systems The quality of reports can also vary Since anyone can report adverse events the validity of the reports has to be assessed And often they are made by busy clinicians who don t have time to do highly detailed reporting There is an additional challenge with illnesses like POTS Because it s a poorly understood condition frequently missed or underdiagnosed it is more likely than other vaccine injuries to go unreported a fact Merck acknowledged in its response to the EMA There is no way that POTS is reported at high rates Tomljenovic said Tomljenovic s report showed that Merck ran its analysis estimating that reporting rates accounted for 1 10 20 and 100 of actual cases Only 1 was realistic according to Tomljenovic In addition to exaggerating POTS background rates and likely overestimating reporting rates for POTS cases Merck also greatly underestimated the number of observed POTS cases following Gardasil vaccination It did so by setting the requirements", "chunk_id":

by setting the requirements for what constituted a likely case of POTS to be extremely and unreasonably according to Tomljenkovic narrow The company identified 83 reports then eliminated 40 of them because they didn t satisfy the four diagnostic criteria for POTS Even if a physician confirmed the diagnosis if details of the basis for the diagnosis weren t included Merck threw out the report Danish authorities and other experts criticized Merck s exclusion and by default the EMA s exclusion of POTS case reports Danish dysautonomia clinician and specialist Dr Louise Brinth had cautioned the EMA that it is rare that any spontaneous report will meet diagnostic criteria She said physicians aren t expected to provide those details so eliminating cases on that basis is too limiting Ralph I Edwards former director of the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre in Sweden that accepts reports of suspected harms of vaccines and other drugs recommended instead including such cases in a transparent way accounting for a difference between cases confirmed with full information and other cases to protect patients from possible harm But Merck declined to do that Uppsala Monitoring Centre provided data to the EMA showing that POTS was reported 82 times more often for HPV vaccines than for other vaccines but the EMA ignored that data Using these flawed methods ensured that the observed count was less than the expected for all geographical regions and countries other than Denmark Merck concluded and the EMA concurred that the safety signal in Denmark was fake and the high number of reports was simply stimulated by the media which had given the topic a lot of coverage They also said the POTS cases reported were cherry picked in order to fit a pre specified hypothesis of vaccine induced injury On that basis the EMA said it was satisfied there was no safety signal and no evidence for causal association between the HPV vaccine and POTS or CRPS The agency also concluded there was no evidence of a signal which warrants further investigation even though it listed several uncertainties and limitations of the data in the same document Some key text of the EMA s final Article 20

Merck backs its claims that there is no link between Gardasil and POTS based on the EMA conclusions and on a 2017 study published by researchers from the CDC and the FDA which jointly administer the VAERS database The CDC s Dr Jorge Arana was the lead author and Dr Tom Shimabukuro who now leads the CDC s Immunization Safety Office responsible for tracking safety signals for the COVID 19 vaccines was a co author The authors analyzed the VAERS database for POTS using empirical Bayesian data mining which uses a statistical method to compare reports of POTS for the HPV vaccine with those related to most non HPV vaccines to identify safety signals The FDA and CDC concluded POTS is rarely reported following HPV vaccination and that there was no evidence to suggest a safety problem with POTS following HPV vaccination However Tomljenovic reports that like Merck the agencies used data analysis methods that minimized the number of POTS cases They estimated the frequency of POTS cases by counting the number of cases per number of vaccines distributed However the number of doses distributed is not the same as the number of doses administered and many people receive multiple shots This method underestimates the rate of POTS cases which the EMA pointed out to Merck during its 2015 analysis Then Tomljenovic said the FDA and CDC underestimated the number of actual POTS cases They identified 160 case reports in VAERS that had POTS symptoms Then like Merck in the EMA assessment they eliminated cases that didn t fully meet the POTS diagnostic criteria That left them with only 29 reports that fully met the criteria Pharmacovigilance expert Edwards recommended that the case reports should have been included in a separate sensitivity analysis that represents the worst case scenario which should be presented alongside the best case scenario that includes only verified POTS cases like the one the regulators did The analysts also failed to account for the fact that POTS is severely under and misdiagnosed and that non specialist clinicians often ascribe POTS symptoms to psychological conditions especially for people who think their symptoms were triggered by the HPV

Barabara Kuter asking the company to share its database analysis algorithm with the CDC Merck shared this information with the stipulation that the CDC handle this information as confidential The CDC ultimately used the same review strategy as Merck for suggestive cases the report said So much for regulatory independence Tomljenovic concluded noting that Merck s appeal to CDC s study to say there is no safety concern should not be deemed persuasive The Arana et al study was published in 2017 when Arana was an epidemiologist at the CDC a position he held for 10 years Months after the study was published Arana took a position as senior scientist leading the risk management division for vaccines at Merck In May 2023 he moved to Moderna according to his LinkedIn profile The CDC currently recommends a two dose regimen of Gardasil for all adolescents in the U S starting before their 15th birthday It recommends three doses for teens and young adults who start at age 15 or later There are more than 200 cases pending against Merck in federal court and many more in state court by people seriously injured by the Gardasil vaccine The first of these cases Robi v Merck which was suspended
