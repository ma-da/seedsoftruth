Italian-born Cristina Zenato, 47, who is known as 'the shark dancer' is often filmed on the ocean floor with 8ft sharks playing around her and nestling into her knees. **The conservationist, who lives on Grand Bahama, has perfected the technique of relaxing the sharks, which is part of her efforts to save them by removing hooks that are caught in their fins**. She induces the 'tonic' state in the shark using a little-known technique of rubbing the ampullae of Lorenzini - the name given to hundreds of jelly-filled pores around the animal's nose and mouth. A 'tonic' state is where a shark enters a natural state of paralysis, often by being turned upside down, for up to 15 minutes. The pores act as electroreceptors detecting prey moving in the electromagnetic field around the shark - but also for some reason rubbing them turns 'Jaws' into a sleeping baby. This gives Cristina the time she needs to remove the hooks. 'The first time I put a shark to sleep was my second dive with them,' Cristina [said]. 'This big female swam straight into my lap. The most amazing thing was this 8ft shark just swimming into me and resting her head on me. 'I started crying into my mask because it was so amazing, so unique.'** Over the years Cristina has collected more than 200 hooks that have been caught in sharks, **and has built up so much trust she's been able to put her whole arm into a shark's mouth to pull out a hook. **Note:** Don't miss this", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__remarkable-capacities-of-animals.txt:1:e21167961e90", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12021, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__remarkable-capacities-of-animals.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__remarkable-capacities-of-animals", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "swam straight into my lap.

The dolphins were still feeding in circle near shore, when suddenly, one individual changed direction heading out toward deeper water. A minute later, the rest of the school turned to follow. Seeing them abruptly leave a foraging ground and change direction came as a surprise to the research team. I decided to follow them. The dolphins increased their speed. **Somewhere near three miles offshore the dolphin group stopped, forming a sort of ring around a dark object in the water. \"Someone's in the water!\" yelled my assistant, standing up and pointing at the seemingly lifeless body of a girl. **As the boat neared, she feebly turned her head toward us, half-raising her hand as a weak sign for help. If we didn't act immediately, the girl would die. We [pulled] the frail and hypothermic body on board. \"She is cyanotic,\" said one of my researchers, also a lifeguard, after a cursory examination. \"She has severe hypothermia. We need to get her warm!\" We managed to get some of her wet garments off and wrap her in a blanket. We took turns keeping her warm by huddling with her under the blanket. A couple of hours later, we were all waiting outside the emergency room at the Marina del Rey hospital. The ER doctor came out to talk with us. The girl, it seems, would pull through, and he thanked us for our quick action. He tells us the girl was vacationing in L.A. from Germany and, as the letter found in her plastic bag explained, she was attempting suicide.

The organism, commonly called a \"superworm,\" could transform the way waste managers dispose of one of the most common components in landfills, researchers said, potentially slowing a mounting garbage crisis that is exacerbating climate change**. In a [paper](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000842) released last week in the journal of *Microbial Genomics*, scientists from the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, showed that the larvae of a darkling beetle, called zophobas morio, can survive solely on polystyrene, commonly called Styrofoam. The findings come amid a flurry of research on ways bacteria and other organisms can consume plastic materials, like Styrofoam and drinking bottles. Now, the researchers will study the enzymes that allow the superworm to digest Styrofoam, as they look to find a way to transform the finding into a commercial product. Industrial adoption offers a tantalizing scenario for waste managers: A natural way to dispose and recycle the Styrofoam trash that accounts for as much as 30 percent of landfill space worldwide. Among plastics, Styrofoam is particularly troublesome. The material is dense and takes up a lot of space, making it expensive to store at waste management facilities, industry experts said. The cups, plates and other materials made from it are also often contaminated with food and drink, making it hard to recycle. Polystyrene fills landfills, where it can often take 500 years to break down. **Note:** This article has been adapted from the book *[Dolphin Confidential: Confessions of a Field Biologist](http://www.amazon.com/Dolphin-Confidential-Confessions-Field-Biologist/dp/0226040151/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1401570009&sr=1-1&keywords=Dolphin+Confidential%3A+Confessions+of+a+Field+Biologist)*.

These tiny animals can detect markers of illness, such as cancer**. In fact, ants are just one of many creatures whose senses can register signs of human disease: dogs, rats, bees, and even tiny worms can as well. The silky ant, [*Formica fusca*](https://bugguide.net/node/view/1193578/bgpage), a common species found throughout Europe, can be taught to identify the scent of breast cancer in urine. Research from the University Sorbonne Paris Nord in France published this year in [*Proceedings of the Royal Society B*](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.1962) shows ants can learn to distinguish between the scent of urine derived from mice carrying human breast cancer tumors from that of healthy mice. Ants and other animals pick up signs of disease by perceiving various volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. These chemicals are produced in a variety of ways and can be found in exhaled breath, and in sweat, urine, and blood. Diseases can change the VOCs we emit, resulting in giving off a different odor. By placing a sugar reward near the cancer sample the ants learned to seek out that scent, a process called operant conditioning. Dogs can be trained to smell several types of cancers, including melanoma, breast and gastrointestinal cancers and some infectious diseases in humans, including malaria and Parkinson's disease. They can also smell infectious disease in other animals, including chronic wasting disease, which affects the brains of deer and can be fatal. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **How giant African rats are helping uncover deadly land mines in Cambodia** **September 10, 2019 PBS** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-how-giant-african-rats-helping-uncover-deadly-land-mines-cambodia) From Angola to the former Yugoslavia, land mines are a lethal legacy of wars over long ago. Cambodia is among the most affected countries, with millions of buried explosives that kill and maim people each year. Now, an organization is deploying an unexpected ally to find mines: the giant pouch rat, whose sharp sense of smell can detect explosives. Mark Shukuru is head rat trainer in Cambodia for the Belgian non-profit APOPO. He is from Tanzania, where this species is also native, and he learned early that they have some of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom.

But an unlikely savior is being trained up to help out: rats. **The project, conceived of by Belgian non-profit [APOPO](https://apopo.org/herorats/?v=69e1aafeccc5), is kitting out rodents with tiny, high-tech backpacks to help first responders search for survivors among rubble in disaster zones. \"Rats are typically quite curious and like to explore - and that is key for search and rescue,\" says Donna Kean**, a behavioral research scientist and leader of the project. In addition to their adventurous spirit, their small size and excellent sense of smell make rats perfect for locating things in tight spaces, says Kean. The rats are currently being trained to find survivors in a simulated disaster zone. They must first locate the target person in an empty room, pull a switch on their vest that triggers a beeper, and then return to base, where they are rewarded with a treat. While the rodents are still in the early stages of training, APOPO is collaborating with the Eindhoven University of Technology to develop a backpack, which is equipped with a video camera, two-way microphone, and location transmitter to help first responders communicate with survivors.

And while most rats step away from their active careers with little to no fanfare, this rodent is a bit different: he's directly responsible for saving the lives of untold numbers of men, women, and children. Magawa - who spent five years (2016-2021) sniffing out hazardous, [unexploded weapons](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a22852342/gulf-of-mexico-unexploded-bombs/) of war dotting the Cambodian countryside - is credited with leading his handlers to more than 100 buried explosive devices. This hero is a Gambian pouched rat. Like many rodents, Gambian rats have poor eyesight, but make up for it with an exceptional sense of smell. Magawa's trainers at the Belgian nonprofit APOPO taught him to sniff out military-grade explosives. The rat is essentially a living sensor, capable of detecting land mines, bombs, and other explosives. Minefields have proven especially deadly in postwar Cambodia. Experts believe that military forces left behind somewhere between 4 and 6 million idle land mines at the close of the Cambodian Civil War. Between 1979 and 2020, abandoned mines and other explosive devices [killed](https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2020/06/26/casualties-from-landmines-in-cambodia-down-42-per-cent) 19,789 Cambodians and injured or maimed 45,102 others. **Magawa completed his training in Africa, and then traveled to Cambodia, where he spent five years searching for whiffs of explosives. In his half-decade career, the big rat \"helped clear [over 225,000 square metres](https://www.apopo.org/en/latest/2021/06/PDSA-Gold-Medalist-Magawa-Retiring) of land,\" according to APOPO**.

Skow is the founder of [Pawsitive Change](https://www.marleysmutts.org/pawsitivechange/), a rehabilitation programme that pairs rescue dogs with inmates. He began a pilot programme at California City Correctional Facility in January 2016, teaching inmates to become dog trainers, and it's now been rolled out to four more California state prisons and one female juvenile correction centre. **To date more than 300 men have graduated from the programme and roughly 200 dogs from \"high-kill\" shelters have been rescued and adopted** as a result of the inmates' work with them (the shelters accept any animal [and] euthanise a certain percentage if they can't rehome them). Seventeen of the programme's human graduates have been paroled and so far none has returned to prison (at a time when the US recidivism rate stands at 43%). Working with the dogs and seeing what the animals are going through prompts the men to speak of their own experiences.

In exchange for care and a place to stay before being adopted, the cats at Pendleton offer inmates untampered, non-judgemental affection. Through the 5-year-old program, a select few incarcerated men are paid 20 cents an hour to spend their days caring for abandoned and abused cats, preparing them for adoption. Or, as some inmates will say, for a reason to get up in the morning. In partnership with the Animal Protection League of Indiana, the program removes cats from a traditional shelter and places them in the prison's \"cat sanctuary,\" a wide-open room with scratching posts, climbing structures and nooks to hide in. The program houses them with incarcerated caregivers, who, incidentally, gain skills such as empathy, responsibility and self-esteem. The caregivers spend their days cleaning the cat sanctuary, changing litter boxes, and feeding and giving water to the cats. Everything but medical care is under the inmates' purview. The work, albeit behind prison walls, is a full-time job. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **'Bees are sentient': inside the stunning brains of nature's hardest workers** **April 2, 2023,* The Guardian* (One of the UK's Leading Newspapers)** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-bees-sentient-inside-stunning-brains-natures-hardest-workers) When Stephen Buchmann finds a wayward bee on a window inside his Tucson, Arizona, home, he goes to great lengths to capture and release it unharmed.

The [book](https://www.amazon.com/What-Bee-Knows-Exploring-Personalities/dp/1642831247), *What a Bee Knows: Exploring the Thoughts, Memories and Personalities of Bees*, draws from his own research and dozens of other studies to paint a remarkable picture of bee behavior and psychology. It argues that **bees can demonstrate sophisticated emotions resembling optimism, frustration, playfulness and fear, traits more commonly associated with mammals. Experiments have shown bees can experience PTSD-like symptoms, recognize different human faces, process long-term memories while sleeping, and maybe even dream**. Approximately one-third of the American diet, including many fruits, vegetables and nuts, relies on bees for pollination. In the past, bee research has focused on their role in crop pollination, but the work being pioneered by Buchmann and his contemporaries could force an ethical reckoning with how the animals are treated. Can large-scale agriculture and scientific research continue without causing bees to suffer, and is the dominant western culture even capable of accepting that the tiniest of creatures have feelings, too? Buchmann hopes an ethical shift will happen as details about the emotional lives of invertebrates - especially bees - are shared with the public. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **Are we all psychic? Scientists believe that animals - including humans - have a collective consciousness** **November 19, 2013, *Daily Mail* (One of the UK's largest-circulation newspapers)** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--we-all-psychic-scientists-believe-animals--including-humans--have-collective-consciousness) Why do people think about someone right before they call, for example, or have a feeling something is about to happen before it does? It may be due to something called collective consciousness - a term used by certain scientists to describe the practice of humans, and animals, sharing behaviours and ideas with each other telepathically. The \"Hundredth Monkey Phenomenon\", for example, was an idea put forward by South African zoologist and ethologist Lyall Watson and his scientific author colleague Lawrence Blair in 1975. During the 1950s, macaques on the island of Koshima learned to wash sweet potatoes and explicitly passed this skill onto younger members of the group. This behaviour then spread and was observed on neighbouring islands among groups of macaques who had never [come] into contact with each other.

The actions of the bottlenose dolphin -- named Moko by residents who said it spends much of its time swimming playfully with humans at the beach -- amazed would-be rescuers and an expert who said they were evidence of the species' friendly nature. The two pygmy sperm whales, a mother and her calf, were found stranded on Mahia Beach, about 500 kilometers (300 miles) northeast of the capital of Wellington, said Conservation Department worker Malcolm Smith. Rescuers worked for more than one hour to get the whales back into the water, only to see them strand themselves four times on a sandbar slightly out to sea. It looked likely the whales would have to be euthanized to prevent them suffering a prolonged death, Smith said. \"They kept getting disorientated and stranding again,\" said Smith, who was among the rescuers. \"They obviously couldn't find their way back past (the sandbar) to the sea.\" Along came Moko, who approached the whales and led them 200 meters (yards) along the beach and through a channel out to the open sea. **\"Moko just came flying through the water and pushed in between us and the whales,\" Juanita Symes, another rescuer, told The Associated Press. \"She got them to head toward the hill, where the channel is. It was an amazing experience. The best day of my life.\"** Smith speculated that Moko responded after hearing the whales' distress calls. \"They had arched their backs and were calling to one another, but as soon as the dolphin turned up they submerged into the water and followed her.\" **Note:** To watch a video featuring Moko's rescue of the whales, [click here](http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/12/nz.whales.ap/#cnnSTCVideo). **About whales: Complex social behavior** **July 12, 2009, *New York Times*** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-about-whales-complex-social-behavior) Scientists have now documented behaviors like tool use and cooperative hunting strategies among whales.

Orcas, or killer whales, have been found to mourn their own dead. Just three years ago, researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York discovered, in the brains of a number of whale species, highly specialized neurons that are linked to, among other things, the use of language and were once thought to be the exclusive property of humans and a few other primates. Indeed, marine biologists are now revealing not only the dizzying variety of vocalizations among a number of whale species but also complex societal structures and cultures. Whales, we now know, teach and learn. They scheme. They cooperate, and they grieve. They recognize themselves and their friends. They know and fight back against their enemies. And perhaps most stunningly, given all of our transgressions against them, they may even, in certain circumstances, have learned to trust us.** For all of their inherent elusiveness, the gray whales of Baja baffle scientists for the opposite reason: They cant seem to get enough of us humans. The question of why present-day gray-whale mothers, some of whom still bear harpoon scars, would take to seeking us out and gently shepherding their young into our arms is a mystery** that now captivates whale researchers and watchers alike. There may be something far more compelling going on in the lagoons of Baja each winter and spring. Something, lets say, along the lines of that time-worn plot conceit behind many a film, in which the peaceable greetings of alien visitors are tragically rebuffed by human fear and ignorance. Except that in this particular rendition, the aliens keep coming back, trying, perhaps, to give us another chance. **Note:** For many important reports from reliable sources on the amazing capabilities of marine mammals, as well as serious threats to their well-being and survival from human activities, [click here](http://www.wanttoknow.info/dolphinswhalesnewsarticles). **Kindly support this work of love: [Donate here](https://www.peerservice.org/donations.php)** Explore the mind and heart expanding websites managed by the nonprofit PEERS network: [www.peerservice.org](https://www.peerservice.org) - PEERS websites: Spreading inspiration, education, & empowerment [www.momentoflove.org](https://www.momentoflove.org) - Every person in the world has a heart [www.personalgrowthcourses.net](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net) - Dynamic online courses powerfully expand your horizons [www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) - Reliable, verifiable information on major cover-ups [www.weboflove.org](https://www.weboflove.org) - Strengthening the Web of Love that interconnects us all Subscribe to the [PEERS email list of inspiration and education](https://www.momentoflove.org/subscribemol) (one email per week).

The secret obsession with sex by so many people causes innumerable problems, yet also brings huge profits in our world. As a primal urge of humans, why aren't we talking more about this most vital topic? You and I would not be here were it not for sex. Does it really have to be a dirty word spoken quietly under our breath, if at all? Might it actually be considered a sacred act to be honored? The below essay on sacred sexuality is from lesson 19 of our free online course, the [Insight Course](https://www.insightcourse.net). The lesson has drawn strong praise from many course participants.

For many people, sex is even more seductive than money. Our media, advertising, and entertainment industries are filled with subtle and not-so-subtle messages about sex. The underlying thrust is all about beauty, sexual desire, and how important it is to buy the products or operations which will make us popular, more attractive, and better lovers. And even though advertising and entertainment are filled with sexual innuendo, it is rare that you will find anything other than tabloids and women's magazines talking openly about both the joys and challenges of sex. In many communities, homes, and workplaces, serious discussion of sexuality is a taboo subject. It is also extremely rare that any of society's many sexual messages even hints at the spiritual dimensions of sex. To those who have succumbed to all of these subliminal and overt messages, sacred sexuality might even seem like a contradiction in terms. Considering all of this, **how can we transform sexual energy in our lives and in our world to better support the good of all of us? ** Almost the opposite of societal conditioning, many of the world's religions imprint negative beliefs of sexuality in their followers. For thousands of years, these religions have considered sex largely to be a base and vulgar act. Sexuality gets little mention in the sacred texts of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.

When it is mentioned, the suggestion is often to avoid it if possible in order to reach greater spiritual heights. Many monks and gurus also teach that we must refrain from sex in order to reach enlightenment. Yet none of us would be here without sex. There is virtually no spiritual instruction in how to deal with sexual urges other than to abstain. As a result, many people experience a split between sexuality and spirituality in their lives. For a powerful, yet deeply personal exploration of the sexual-spiritual split by a wonderful workshop facilitator who was willing to explore his own wounds with workshop participants, please read the engaging six-page story at the link below. [**www.personalgrowthcourses.net/stories/picucci...**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/stories/picucci.sexual_spiritual_split) The exciting news is that, as shown in the above essay, old paradigm beliefs and attitudes around sexuality are clearly changing. Homosexuality, bisexuality, and other sexual persuasions are gradually gaining more acceptance and support, even in the media. Yet common misperceptions around all forms of sexuality continue to exist in many people and places, and very few have even considered the possibility that sexuality can be used to enhance spiritual growth. While fully honoring and supporting those who choose to abstain from sex for spiritual reasons, for those who choose to include sexuality in their spiritual path, it is important to be open and real in discussing this powerful force and how it can be used to change our lives and world. **The term [sacred sexuality](http://www.theinstitute.org/sex.shtml) is now being heard with increasing frequency in certain circles.** Please read the below eye-opening article showing how old attitudes are gradually changing. **[www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=931](http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=931) - Sacred Sex** Sacred sexuality is often associated with tantra - a spiritual practice in which sexuality is used to achieve higher spiritual states.

At PEERS, we question any narrative that justifies war, or keeps us divided into us vs. them camps.

This film is part of a deeply moving series called [HUMAN](https://www.youtube.com/@HUMANthemovie2015) by filmmaker Yann Arthus-Bertrand, who spent three years collecting real-life stories from thousands of people in 60 countries. Their stories, although unique to them, speak to the human condition and the parts of life that unite us all: love, happiness, poverty, war, and the future of our planet. *There was a moment when he looked at me, and our eyes met. At that moment, everything else disappeared. There was no sound. There was just two people looking at each other in the eyes.

But once we do, they're very beneficial. We spoke with someone named Ali Abu Awad [who] is a Palestinian activist. He said he never had contact with an Israeli ... until he was in his 30s. And they were brought together into a group. This Israeli woman was crying, and he was crying. They were both grieving the loss of family members of the conflict. That moment of contact actually changed the whole direction of his life because he realized that this Israeli woman was human like he was. He ended up becoming an activist working toward a solution that humanizes Israelis and humanizes Palestinians at the same time. *- [The Power of Contact in the Rehumanization Process,*Waging Nonviolence*](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--power-contact-the-rehumanization-process) *The Shambhala Warrior, *a 1,200 year old Tibetan Buddhist prophecy, tells the story of regular people who bring about great change and healing through the powers of compassion and insight. In a time of rising barbarian powers, the Shambhala Warriors must dismantle their weapons. The warriors know they can dismantle them because the weapons are \"mind-made.\" Instead of these instruments of death coming from extraterrestrial forces or evil deities, these weapons arise from the deeply held beliefs and stories created about the world. These human stories of separation and fear drive the violence we see. And if it is mind-made, it can be unmade by the human mind. *[Compassion] provides us the fuel, it moves us out to act on behalf of other beings. But by itself it can burn us out. So we need the second as well, which is insight into the dependent co-arising of all things.** It lets us see that the battle is not between good people and bad people, for the line between good and evil runs through every human heart. *** - Edited excerpt from [*Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/643650/shambhala-the-sacred-path-of-the-warrior-by-chogyam-trungpa/#:~:text=About%20Shambhala%3A%20The%20Sacred%20Path%20of%20the%20Warrior,-The%20classic%20guide&text=of%20the%20warrior.-,The%20sacred%20warrior%20conquers%20the%20world%20not%20through%20violence%20or,peace%20and%20sanity%20of%20others.)

We feel the pain of our people, identify with their pain, and need to work together to uplift our shared humanity. The unfolding horror in Israel and Gaza is an escalation of decades of state-sanctioned violence by Israel against Palestinians. We condemn the horrific actions of Hamas against Israeli civilians. We likewise condemn Israel's unbridled bombing and cutting off access to all basic needs, including food, water, electricity, and medical care. Attacks on Palestinian and Israeli civilians are repugnant. Israeli violence against Palestinians has been intentionally hidden, slow, and steady. Contrary to what the media is reporting, this attack was not unprovoked. The Israeli and American governments have worked together to suppress and deny the inhumane acts against Palestinians that have led to this moment. There are Palestinians and Jews who have been raising red flags and warning about this inevitable outcome for decades, only to be dismissed and ignored. The world's failure to challenge Israel's ongoing occupation, apartheid, and unbridled violence by settlers and soldiers in the West Bank provides the context for what is happening now. The recent Israeli government's escalation of violence, encroachment of Al Aqsa Mosque, and its 16-year siege of Gaza has led to the current explosion. We repeat: the brutality of Hamas' attack on Israeli civilians is unjustified. As we watch the violent attacks and rallying of xenophobia on both sides, we are brokenhearted. Although it feels like a time to stand with \"our people,\" we know this is a time to come together. This is a time of great suffering for all; a time of painful emotions. It is only by recognizing our shared fears and our shared tears that we will find our way through this nightmare. It is a struggle we need to undertake jointly. When we fall back into our separate and distinct identities we risk becoming part of the problem, not the solution. Both peoples suffer from ongoing trauma. We are all on high alert. The fear is palpable. And it is easy for us to objectify the 'other.' We seek a third path that neither perpetuates a xenophobic response nor sustains an unjust status quo. This moment calls us to slow down, sit with the pain and complexity, and grapple with our discomfort. It is a moment for digging deep, seeing across differences, and remembering our deep yearning for peace and justice. It is only through compassion and empathy that we will find a different way.

She argues that approaches to activism are rooted in *overemphasizing* material goals like policy change, lawsuits, historical facts, and political jargon. Yet very little attention has been put on changing how we think and relate to each other and our environment. Instead, it is more common to see the shutting down of different perspectives and people treating others as mere disposable artifacts in the cultural economy. *In this society, there is no powerful discourse on love emerging either from politically progressive radicals or from the Left. The absence of a sustained focus on love in progressive circles arises from a collective failure to acknowledge the needs of the spirit and an overdetermined emphasis on material concerns. Without love, our efforts to liberate ourselves and our world community from oppression and exploitation are doomed.* ***Without an ethic of love shaping the direction of our political vision and our radical aspirations, we are often seduced, in one way or the other, into continued allegiance to systems of domination**. It has always puzzled me that women and men who spend a lifetime working to resist one form of domination can be systematically supporting another.... **(with) many of us motivated to move against domination solely when we feel our self-interest directly threatened. Often, then, the longing is not for a collective transformation of society, an end to politics of dominations, but rather simply for an end to what we feel is hurting us.*** *Until we are all able to accept the interlocking, interdependent nature of systems... we will continue to act in ways that undermine our individual quest for freedom and (the) collective liberation struggle. The **civil rights movement transformed society in the United States because it was fundamentally rooted in a love ethic.

No leader has emphasized this ethic more than Martin Luther King, Jr. King believed that love is \"ultimately the only answer\" to the problems facing this nation and the entire planet. I share that belief that it is in choosing love... as the ethical foundation for politics, that we are best positioned to transform society.* *Dominator culture has tried to keep us all afraid, to make us choose safety instead of risk, sameness instead of diversity. Moving through that fear, finding out what connects us, reveling in our differences; this is the process that brings us closer, that gives us a world of shared values, of meaningful community.* These challenging times call for nuance, [sensemaking](https://www.wanttoknow.info/g/using-sensemaking-to-navigate-the-media-landscape), and healing.

You may see it as a decline, and even an existential threat to the future of democracy. You may feel caught somewhere in between-seeing both the progress and the problems-embracing uncertainty rather than clinging to a narrative that only tells part of the story. Politics and media today thrive on division, leaving very little room for the power of our reason and hearts. We're told to fear the other side, to see them as the enemy, to never question our own beliefs. Yet from this increasingly dominant worldview, I believe we're losing something essential-our ability to truly see and hear each other. **Fear keeps us reactive. It shuts down curiosity. We extrapolate one aspect of who a person is and reduce them to labels-white supremacists, Nazis, woke left, sheeple, anti-vaxxers, anti-science crusaders, conspiracy theorists, racists, transphobes, misogynists, and countless others. We end up knowing less about each other, but assuming we know more.** Howard Thurman was a visionary theologian, educator, and spiritual guide whose work laid the foundation for the civil rights movement. His ideas on nonviolent resistance, radical empathy, and the search for common ground shaped leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and continue to challenge us today. Below is a profound excerpt from his 1980 sermon, *[The Sound of the Genuine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kkSDCvcvYI)*. It is a beautiful reminder to pause and reflect on what we really seek beneath all the societal noise-and what it means to truly listen, both to ourselves and to each other.

I asked her: \"What is the greatest disaster that your blindness has brought to you?\" She said, \"When I go places where there are people, I have a feeling that nobody knows that I'm here.

So you fight for your own life by finding some way to get along with them without killing them. There is something in you that waits and listens for the sound of the genuine in other people. And if you can't hear it, then you are reduced by that much. If I were to ask you what is the thing that you desire most in life, you would say ... things that I thought you ought to think that you should say. But I think that if you were stripped to whatever there is in you that is literal and irreducible, and you tried to answer that question, the answer may be something like this: **I want to feel that I am thoroughly and completely understood so that now and then I can take my guard down and look out around me and not feel that I will be destroyed with my defenses down. I want to feel completely vulnerable, completely naked, completely exposed and absolutely secure.** That I can run the risk of radical exposure and know that the eye that beholds my vulnerability will not step on me. That I can feel secure in my awareness of the active presence of my own idiom in me. So as I live my life then, this is what I'm trying to fulfill. It doesn't matter whether I become a doctor, lawyer, housewife, house husband. This is not my afternoon. That I'm secure because I hear the sound of the genuine in myself. And having learned to listen to that, I can become quiet enough, still enough, to hear the sound of the genuine in you.

Riding my bicycle the next day to [Bikram yoga class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikram_Yoga), the timeless soul connection with Zora still reverberates strongly in my body and soul. On my way to this intense, 90-minute session of 105 degree heat which I enjoy once a month, I remember how I love to set an intention for exploration each time I attend. I find that when I set a clear intention beforehand, I often have rich inspirations arise in class as we stretch beyond our comfort zones. I decide in today's class to explore what is awakening in me in my deepening connection with Zora. How can I bring what I'm learning with her to other parts of my life? How can I see into the eyes of others in the same way I see into Zora's? Yes, that's it! **How can I better see that vibrant divine essence, that universal core that I see so clearly in Zora in everyone I meet?** That's my intention for exploration in this session. After some warm up stretching, the intense heat begins to penetrate. My entire body loosens and opens as I begin to push the stretches to my limit. Before long, my heart is pounding and sweat pours from my body. It's a most strange and delicious kind of self torture that I actually love. Any thoughts but making it through this yoga posture vanish from my mind. When I stand up or raise my body, the blood rushes out of my head and at times I almost faint.

Opening to that swirling, blissful place of pure being as I finish one challenging pose, suddenly I get it! I get the answer to my question about seeing the divine essence in all. I'm thrilled to realize that I have two pairs of eyes! We all have two pairs of eyes!!! We have our physical eyes which see the three-dimensional world around us. Yet we also have another unseen pair of eyes. They are energetic or spiritual eyes. These eyes are grounded in the place deep within each of us which knows that we are all interconnected. **The spiritual eyes see beneath all physical matter to the place where everything in the universe is interconnected in a divine cosmic dance. ** Yes!!! In this instant, I see that though I've never before realized that I have these invisible, energetic eyes, I have been gradually developing my spiritual eyes for years. With these divine eyes, I am cultivating the ability to see profound depths and beautiful vibrance in every person I meet. I get it! These are the eyes within me that drank in pure bliss and sublime ecstasy upon gazing through Zora's physical eyes to connect with her divine essence. Gazing into her soul, these eyes saw my own soul reflected back to me in a most mysterious and magical way. When these spiritual eyes look out at the physical world, they see beneath solid form. They pierce the veil of separation to see the energetic manifestations emanating from the divine essence of all beings. They see a vast sea of energy flowing, of which each of us is an intimately interconnected part. All is received by these spiritual eyes simply and gloriously as it is. In this expanded awareness where the divine vibration is equally strong in all beings, the core energetic essence of everyone and everything magically shines through. **When two beings gaze into each other through these spiritual eyes, the mysteries of the universe become apparent.** The great wonder of the unknown is seen in its ever-changing form. That is why my gazing and diving with Zora was so intense, so intoxicating, so transformative in our time together yesterday. As I gaze deep into her with my spiritual eyes and she deep into me, the divine is given the opportunity to look at and explore itself through these eyes, and magic cannot help but happen.

Thank you One and thank you All. Near the end of the session as I stretch deep into camel pose - the most intense pose of the class - I nearly faint as my awareness again expands and soars. I feel so fully the exquisite depths of my being, of all beings merging with my expanded consciousness. **And then suddenly, I'm surprised to see yet another pair of energetic eyes! This time it's the sexual eyes. Wow!!! Now that's an entirely different ball game!** A soulful laugh echoes silently within as I acknowledge that yes, Zora is a vibrant, gorgeous woman and being. And I know this somehow plays a role in what I'm experiencing with her. I realize that the sexual eyes are quite different from both the physical and the spiritual eyes. These desiring eyes see and look for that which awakens the powerful love hormones in our bodies. Ever longing for rich, indescribable feelings of ecstatic union and connection, these passionate eyes completely bypass the mind and are connected to a part of our awareness which can be quite irrational. The intensity of feeling they bring can cause us to lose contact with both our rationality and our spirituality. When these sexual eyes see certain body shapes, facial features, or body parts which excite a hormonal response, all other eyes can become blind with the passionate desire to connect intimately that is such a core part of the human experience. Sex seems almost designed physiologically to entangle us in its web. It forces us into rich dramas where we are gifted with potent opportunities to learn more about ourselves and life through opening more deeply to another soul than we ever would without these powerful hormones raging inside us. Zora and I have not been connecting sexually in any physical way.

Together, they are opening universes filled with infinite possibilities for growth and expansion. ** Riding my bicycle back home from this most beautiful, most powerful Bikram session, I am thrilled with this newfound awareness of my energetic eyes. With my spiritual eyes, I see the physical world flowing gracefully past me. The colorful houses, trees, streets, and people passing through my field of vision all shimmer magnificently as I see beyond the three dimensions of my normal vision. The universe is dancing for me as it shows off the [divine energetic essence](https://www.weboflove.org/transformation#seeing) in everything around me. I see vibrance and resonance in everyone and everything, which reflects the divine sensations I feel welling up from deep within my soul. As I arrive home after this unbelievably rich journey, I sense a new beginning. I sense a new awakening - or is it really just a remembering - of who I am in this world, of who we are, and what we are doing here. Opening for the first time to the miraculous abilities of my spiritual eyes, I see so much more clearly now how I can use these eyes to dance with the radiant divine essence, with the resplendent universal core in everyone I meet. I now embrace more fully than ever the divine mystery that I Am, that We Are. I know that the more I choose to use my spiritual eyes, the more intimately I feel connected with each person around me, and the more I experience on a most profound level the interconnectedness of all beings in this divine cosmic dance of life. I make a conscious decision to use these eyes as often as I can now as I move through life. **I still don't know the answers to life's deepest mysteries, yet I know that when I see, express, and interact in harmony with the vision of my spiritual eyes, transformation flows and miracles happen.** *Written and gratefully experienced by [Fred Burks](https://www.weboflove.org/mostinspiringtransformational)* **Note:** Zora and I eventually went on to share a full year of profoundly transformative connection together.

Though I was very sad at the loss, I realized this was an opportunity to open more my energetic eyes with everyone I meet to what I saw (and still see) in Zora's eyes. And even though we connect very little now, Zora and I are both deeply grateful for the experience we shared together. **For more:** For a beautiful and most profound essay which helped me to open to this experience, [click here](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers).

Although her expertise has its roots in medicine and healthcare, the wisdom she shares with the world is for anyone who seeks to experience life in more direct and spiritual ways-opening up to mystery, awe, love, suffering, forgiveness, miracles, loss, and healing through human storytelling. Her creation of [The Healer's Art](https://www.rachelremen.com/learn) curriculum for medical students to explore these topics is now taught in more than half of American Medical schools and medical schools in 7 countries abroad.** Living well, she suggests, is not about eradicating our wounds and weaknesses but understanding how they complete our identity and equip us to help others:** *I think that we all feel that we're not enough to make a difference; that we need to be more, somehow, either wealthier or more educated or different than the people we are. People ask: how can I make a difference when I'm so wounded and feel so not-enough? I tell them that it's our very wounds that enable us to make a difference. We are the right people, just as we are. And to just wonder about that a little, what if we were exactly what's needed? What then? **How would I live if I was exactly what's needed for whatever I am stepping into?** * One of the core pioneers of integrative medicine and relationship-centered care, Dr. Remen has spent decades counseling hundreds of end-of-life people and those dealing with cancer. Her countless discoveries in this work have led her to see life as a powerful mystery, abundant with qualities and capacities that we cannot measure with our minds. *When I was an intern, first-year doctor ... we had a man come into the hospital to die. And people used to come into the hospital to die - there wasn't a hospice movement then. And this man came in riddled with cancer.

My work as a cancer therapist often means helping people to recognize this difference, to get off the treadmill of survival, and to refocus their lives. Of the many people who have confronted this issue, one of the most dramatic was an Asian woman of remarkable beauty and style. Through our work together I realized that some things which can never be fixed can still heal. She was about to begin a year of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, but this is not what she talked about in our first meeting. She began our work together by telling me she was a \"bad\" person, hard, uncaring, selfish, and unloving. She delivered this self-indictment with enormous poise and certainty. I watched the light play across her perfect skin and the polish of her long black hair and thought privately that I did not believe her. The people I had known who were truly selfish were", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__three-deeply-profound-stories-for-spiritual-living.txt:1:650feb494820", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12054, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__three-deeply-profound-stories-for-spiritual-living.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__three-deeply-profound-stories-for-spiritual-living", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, but this is not what she talked about in our first meeting.

I watched the light play across her perfect skin and the polish of her long black hair and thought privately that I did not believe her. The people I had known who were truly selfish were rarely aware of it-they simply put themselves first without doubt or hesitation. In a voice filled with shame, Ana began to tell me that she had no heart, and that her phenomenal success in business was a direct result of this ruthlessness. Most important, she felt that it was not possible for her to become well, as she had earned her cancer through her behavior. She questioned why she had come seeking help. There was a silence in which we took each other's measure. \"Why not start from the beginning?\" I said. It took her more than eight months to tell her story. She had not been born here. She had come to this country at ten, as an orphan. She had been adopted by a good family, a family that knew little about her past. With their support she had built a life for herself. In a voice I could barely hear, she began to speak of her experiences as a child in Vietnam during the war. She began with the death of her parents. She had been four years old the morning the Cong had come, small enough to hide in the wooden box that held the rice in the kitchen. The soldiers had not looked there after they had killed the others. When at last they had gone and she ventured from hiding she had seen that her family had been beheaded. That was the beginning. I was horrified. She continued on. It had been a time of brutality, a world without mercy. She was alone. She had starved. She had been brutalized. Hesitantly at first, and then with growing openness, she told story after story. She had become one of a pack of homeless children. She had stolen, she had betrayed, she had hated, she had helped kill. She had seen things beyond human endurance, done things beyond imagination. Like a spore, she had become what was needed to survive. As the weeks went by, there was little I could say. Over and over she would tell me that she was a bad person, \"a person of darkness.\" I was filled with horror and pity, wishing to ease her anguish, to offer comfort. Over and over a wall of silence and despair threatened to close us off from each other. Over and over I would beat it back, insisting that she tell me the worst.

Over and over a wall of silence and despair threatened to close us off from each other. Over and over I would beat it back, insisting that she tell me the worst. She would weep and say, \"I do not know if I can,\" and hoping that I would be able to hear it, I would tell her that she must. And she would begin another story. I often found myself not knowing how to respond, unable to do anything but stand with her here, one foot in this peaceful calm office on the water, the other in a world beyond imagination. I had never been orphaned, never been hunted, never missed a meal except by choice, never violently attacked another person. But I could recognize the whisper of my darkness in hers and I stood in that place in myself to listen to her, to try to understand. I wanted to jump in, I wanted to soothe, I wanted to make sense, yet none of this was possible. Once, in despair myself, I remember thinking, \"I am her first witness.\" Over and over she would cry out, \"I have such darkness in me.\" At such times it seemed to me that the cancer was actually helping her make sense of her life; offering the relief of a feared but long-awaited punishment. At the close of one of her stories, I was overwhelmed by the fact that she had actually managed to live with such memories. I told her this and added, \"I am in awe.\" We sat looking at each other. \"It helps me that you say that. I feel less alone.\" I nodded and we sat in silence. I was in awe of this woman and her ability to survive. In all the years of working with people with cancer, I had never met anyone like her. I ached for her. Like an animal in a trap that gnaws off its own leg, she had survived but only at a terrible cost. Gradually she began to shorten the time frame of her stories, to talk of more recent events: her ruthless business practices, how she used others, always serving her own self-interest. She began to talk about her contempt, her anger, her unkindness, her distrust of people, and her competitiveness. It seemed to me that she was completely alone. \"Nothing has really changed,\" I thought. Her whole life was still organized around her survival. **Once, at the close of a particularly painful session, I found myself reviewing my own day, noticing how much of the time I was focused on surviving", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__three-deeply-profound-stories-for-spiritual-living.txt:3:757ab9bfc45a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12056, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__three-deeply-profound-stories-for-spiritual-living.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__three-deeply-profound-stories-for-spiritual-living", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "business practices, how she used others, always serving her own self-interest.

I wondered if I too had become caught in survival. How much had I put off living today in order to do or say what was expedient? To get what I thought I needed. Could survival become a habit? Was it possible to live so defensively that you never got to live at all?** \"You have survived, Ana,\" I blurted out. \"Surely you can stop now.\" She looked at me, puzzled. But I had nothing further to say. One day, she walked in and said, \"I have no more stories to tell.\" \"Is it a relief?\" I asked her. To my surprise she answered, \"No, it feels empty.\" \"Tell me.\" She looked away. \"I am afraid I will not know how to survive now.\" Then she laughed. \"But could never forget,\" she said. A few weeks after this she brought in a dream, one of the first she could remember. In the dream, she had been looking in a mirror, seeing herself reflected there to the waist. It seemed to her that she could see through her clothes, through her shin, through to the very depths of her being. She saw that she was filled with darkness and felt a familiar shame, as intense as that she had felt on the first day she had come to my office. Yet the could not look away. Then it seemed to her as if she were moving, as if she had passed through into the mirror, into her own image, and was moving deeper and deeper into her darkness. She went forward blindly for a long time. Then, just as she was certain that there was no end, no bottom, that surely this would go on and on, she seemed to see a tiny spot far ahead. As she moved closer to it, she was able to recognize what it was. It was a rose. A single, perfect rosebud on a long stem. For the first time in eight months she began to cry softly, without pain. \"It's very beautiful,\" she told me. \"I can see it very clearly, the stem with its leaves and its thorns. It is just beginning to open. And its color is indescribable: the softest, most tender, most exquisite shade of pink.\" I asked her what this dream meant to her and she began to sob. \"It's mine,\" she said. \"It is still", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__three-deeply-profound-stories-for-spiritual-living.txt:4:67a60a0ddde1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12057, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__three-deeply-profound-stories-for-spiritual-living.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__three-deeply-profound-stories-for-spiritual-living", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "rosebud on a long stem.

All this time it is still there. It has waited for me to come back for it.\" The rose is one of the oldest archetypical symbols for the heart, It appears in both the Christian and the Hindu traditions and in many fairy tales. It presented itself now to Ana even though she had never read these fairy tales or heard of these traditions. For most of her life, she had held her darkness close to her, had used it as her protection, had even defined herself through it. Now, finally, she had been able to remember. There was a part she had hidden even from herself. A part she had kept safe. A part that had not been touched. Even more than our experiences, our beliefs become our prisons. But we carry our healing with us even into the darkest of our inner places. A Course in Miracles says, **\"When I have forgiven myself and remembered who I am, I will bless everyone and everything I see.\" The way to freedom often lies through the open heart.** ** The Holy Shadow ** There is a Sufi story about a man who is so good that the angels ask God to give him the gift of miracles. God wisely tells them to ask him if that is what he would wish. So the angels visit this good man and offer him first the gift of healing by hands, then the gift of conversion of souls, and lastly the gift of virtue. He refuses them all. They insist that he choose a gift or they will choose one for him. \"Very well,\" he replies. \"I ask that I may do a great deal of good without ever knowing it.\" The story ends this way: The angels were perplexed. They took counsel and resolved upon the following plan: Every time the saint's shadow fell behind him it would have the power to cure disease, soothe pain, and comfort sorrow.

One of my own personal healers is probably completely unaware of the difference she made in my life. In fact, I do not know even her name and I am sure she has long forgotten mine. At twenty-nine, much of my intestine was removed surgically and I was left with an ileostomy. A loop of bowel opens on my abdomen and an ingeniously designed plastic appliance, which I remove and replace every few days, covers it. Not an easy thing for a young woman to live with. While this surgery had given me back much of my vitality, the appliance and the profound change in my body made me feel hopelessly different, permanently shut out of the world of femininity and elegance. At the beginning, before I could change my appliance myself, it was changed for me by nurse specialists called enterostomal therapists. These white-coated professionals would enter my hospital room, put on an apron, a mask and gloves and then remove and replace my appliance. The task completed, they would strip off all this protective clothing. Then they would carefully wash their hands. This elaborate ritual made things harder for me. I felt shamed. One day a woman about my age came to do this task. It was late in the day and she was not dressed in a white coat, but in a silk dress, heels, and stockings. In a friendly way she asked if I was ready to have my appliance changed. When I nodded, she pulled back the covers, produced a new appliance, and in the most simple and natural way imaginable removed my old one and replaced it, without putting on gloves. I remember watching her hands. She had washed them carefully before she touched me. They were soft and gentle and beautifully cared for. She was wearing a pale pink nail polish and her rings were gold. I doubt that she ever knew what her willingness to touch me in such a natural way meant to me. In ten minutes she not only tended my body, but healed my wounds and gave me hope. What is most professional is not always what is most healing.

In the past few years a great deal of attention has been paid to angels and many people have become more aware of the possibility that insight and guidance may be offered at surprising times and in surprising ways. Books have been written about meetings with such celestial messengers and the help and healing they have offered. **What is not so commonly recognized is that it is not only angels that carry divine messages of healing and guidance; any one of us may be used in this same way. We are messengers for each other. The difference between us and the folks with the wings is that we often carry these messages without knowing. Like the Holy Shadow.** It has been my experience and the experience of many other therapists that when I am facing a difficult personal issue or a painful decision or am struggling with some recalcitrant and stubborn part of my self, a very peculiar thing will happen. Many of my clients will spontaneously bring in the same issue. Completely unaware of the personal importance of the issue to me, they will work on some aspect of it as it pertains to them, all the while offering me, through their own work, guidance and perspective on the issue for my healing. Sometimes they work on the very issue or sometimes in the process of working on something else they will offer a single sentence or thought that cuts through my confusion and frees me. I have many examples of this, but one stands out in my mind. It was a time when I discovered that a friend had incorporated some of my ideas and exercises into her best-selling book without acknowledging where she had learned them. I felt hurt and betrayed by this until my third client of the day sat down and pleasantly remarked, \"You know, you can get a lot of good done in this world if you don't care who gets the credit.\" Astonished, I asked her what had made her think of this. \"Oh,\" she said, \"it was on the bumper sticker of the car that just pulled out of my parking spot.\" Perhaps the world is one big healing community and we are a healers of each other.

Being in them may remind us of our strength and our value in ways that many other places we may pass through do not. My medical partner, who had never been ill a day in his life, died suddenly of a massive heart attack at fifty-six. He was a consummate healer and a magnificent friend and he left both his colleagues and his patients bereft. For weeks we numbly went through papers and made referrals for the many people who called in, many of them weeping. Finally, the last details were attended to and we settled down to a future without Hal. Then the patients started coming. For almost a year afterwards, several times a week I would open the door of my office and find one of Hal's patients sitting in the common waiting room. At first I would worry that they didn't know about Hal and would have to tell them, but they all knew. They had just come to the place where they had experienced his listening, his special way of seeing and valuing them, just to sit there for a bit, perhaps to think about difficult decisions which currently faced them. Many patients came. It was terribly, terribly moving. It made me angry with Hal for tending every life so impeccably except his own. Another colleague, who is the head of the department of family medicine at one of the East Coast's outstanding medical schools, tells a story about one of Hal's patients. The patient was a homeless woman whose possessions fit into two shopping carts. Once a month she would bring these up the steep hill to his clinic by lashing them alternately to the parking meters with a belt. First she would tie one, then wheel the other to the next meter uphill, tie it, go back for the first one, untie it, and wheel it to the meter above the second until both she and the two carts were at the clinic's front door. He saw her once a month on a Wednesday. Her speech was sometimes rambling and her clothing was filthy and eccentric. This deeply kind and respectful man was not troubled by this. With his usual grave courtesy he welcomed her into his consulting room, listened to the details of her difficult life, and did what he could to ease her burden.

After he had been seeing her for some time, he became aware that she sometimes came to the hospital on days when he was not there. The clinic nurses were puzzled by this at first, as she seemed to know in some mysterious way that it was not her day to see the doctor. After talking with her, they determined that she simply wanted to go to his consulting room. Once there she would stand on the threshold and slowly and deliberately place her right foot inside the empty room and then withdraw it again and again. After a while she would be satisfied and go away again. ** The places in which we are seen and heard are holy places. They remind us of our value as human beings. They give us the strength to go on.

Ross's Antidote to Cancel Culture** ***Atmos*** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-calling-loretta-j-rosss-antidote-cancel-culture) What does it take to have a challenging conversation in the era of cancel culture? For MacArthur Fellow Loretta J. Ross, the answer lies in calling in: a communicative strategy rooted in compassion, accountability, and restorative justice. Cancel culture [is] a phenomenon whereby people deemed to be moral transgressors are publicly discredited on social media platforms, and in some instances, punished through cultural, social, and professional ostracism. Professor Ross thinks this readiness to cancel a person on the basis of their beliefs is toxic. Instead, she espouses empathy and stresses the importance of context in challenging conversations. Calling in is not what you do for other people-it's what you do for yourself. It gives you a chance to offer love, grace, and respect, and to showcase one's own integrity and one's own ability to hold nuance and depth. People mistakenly think that you're doing it because you're trying to change somebody else. That's not possible. And since we don't have the power to control and change others, the only power we're left with is self-empowerment.** In this sense, calling in is a conscious decision to not make the world crueler than it needs to be. We're all capable of using a technique I call \"the mental parking lot\" where you temporarily put aside any visceral reactions you have to what others are saying. It's a technique that requires", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__top-inspiring-stories-of-2023.txt:0:1f9a777d6a53", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12063, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__top-inspiring-stories-of-2023.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__top-inspiring-stories-of-2023", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "to change somebody else.

Today the hundreds of thousands of people who carried out those killings live among their victims. Journalist and author Philip Gourevitch has witnessed the unique way Rwandans have defined and navigated forgiveness after the massacre. There was a lot of agency in the local level. And the experience of the genocide was extremely localized. People were killed by neighbors. It was intimate. They knew each other. And to simply ignore that wouldn't work. In order to navigate the aftermath of the genocide, the Rwandan government set up this nationwide reconciliation process. So they set up a system of community courts - without lawyers - to sort of repurpose a system that really had only been used for small claims mitigation in traditional Rwanda, called gacaca, and have open, communal - what we might call a town hall - format for trials. And then the idea was to hold people accountable and have a system of punishment. And this system banked very heavily on encouraging confession and rewarding it. But the confessions were supposed to be also verified by the community.** The motto of the gacaca courts was, truth heals. Forgiveness doesn't require trust. Forgiveness simply means letting go of the idea of getting even, forgoing the idea of revenge. Right? Now, even that's a big ask. But it means accepting coexistence. There's never been as comprehensive a reckoning with such communal violence or mass atrocity**. It was an ongoing, multi-year confrontation with the past in the communities. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **Want Safer Streets?

Cover Them in Art** ***Reasons to be Cheerful*** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-want-safer-streets-cover-them-art) Crosswalks don't work. According to various [studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001457598000268?via%3Dihub), only between five and fifteen percent of drivers slow down at pedestrian crossings. The vast majority of drivers simply [don't pay attention](https://www.advocatemagazine.com/article/2019-april/dangerous-crosswalks) to them. America's deadly streetscape is the subject of The Street Project, a new PBS documentary about citizen-led efforts to make streets safer. When filmmaker Jennifer Boyd started making it, she assumed distracted driving must be behind the alarming rise in pedestrian deaths. But as she soon learned, digital screens are less of a culprit than most people realize. \"Less than one percent of pedestrian deaths involved portable electronic devices,\" she found. Instead, she discovered that two of the biggest factors are speeding and bigger cars. If speeding and visibility are the problem and crosswalks can't stop it, color might. The [Asphalt Art Initiative](https://asphaltart.bloomberg.org/), a program funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, provides grants to create art to modify dangerous streets. One of these projects is in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where artists and residents transformed a high-traffic commercial thoroughfare with a block-long [asphalt mural](https://asphaltart.bloomberg.org/projects/chattanooga-tennessee-usa-creating-a-community-designed-gathering-space/), while students marked safe walking paths in the area with stencils and wheat paste. **Overall, according to the Initiative, \"the data showed a 50 percent drop in crashes involving pedestrians or cyclists and a 37 percent drop in crashes leading to injuries.

To counter this, [Marine veteran Chris] Velazquez became a community developer for [Gamers for Peace (GFP)](https://www.veteransforpeace.org/take-action/gamers-peace), the first peace organization formed to mirror the military's online recruiting practices: **While streaming popular games like Halo and Rocket League, its members-many of them veterans-offer career advice and mentorship to teens, talk politics, and discuss the realities of war**. They also share information about online military recruitment tactics at in-person gaming conventions such as PAX Unplugged. These initiatives, members say, give prospective recruits the tools and knowledge to see other options and reconsider enlisting. The group has already accrued nearly 600 Twitch followers as well as 400 members on the popular messaging service Discord. **Note:** The latest US Air Force [recruitment tool](https://www.mintpressnews.com/us-air-force-video-game-airman-challenge-drone-recruitment/264490/) is a [video game](https://www.airforce.com/airmanchallenge/) that allows players to receive in-game medals and achievements for drone bombing Iraqis and Afghans.

What If They Were Public Banks?** ***Vice*** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-private-banks-in-crisis-what-if-they-were-public-banks) Public banks are typically operated by government or tribal authorities and, in theory, would be chartered to achieve social good and invest in communities. Only two public banks currently operate in the United States: the Bank of North Dakota, founded in 1919, and the Territorial Bank of American Samoa, founded in 2018. Organizations pushing for a public banking option exist in 37 states, according to the Public Banking Institute. **In contrast to private banks, which are responsible to their shareholders, public banks are responsible to their boards and are chartered to invest in public needs**.

The modern movement to invest in public banks grew out of the 2008 financial crisis and was galvanized during the pandemic, fueled by a populist distrust of the banking and finance sectors. In October 2020, Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib introduced the federal [Public Banking Act](https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/media/press-releases/tlaib-ocasio-cortez-introduce-legislation-enabling-creation-public-banks), which would allow state and local governments across the country to create public banks. In the first two months of 2021 there were sixteen bills across the country designed to pave the way for public banks. Supporters of public banks are hoping that any deposits from state and local governments can be used to fund community-based projects that have trouble getting funded by private banks. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **How Taiwan's 'civic hackers' helped find a new way to run the country** ***The Guardian* (One of UK's Leading Newspapers)** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-how-taiwans-civic-hackers-helped-find-new-way-run-country) It came to be known as the [Sunflower movement](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/08/taiwan-protesters-end-occupation-legislature-china-trade), a sudden three-week stand-off in 2014 between the government and Taiwanese protesters.

Inside, city authorities have installed 40 two-way electric vehicle chargers that are connected to solar panels and a pioneering battery energy storage system, which will together power a number of on-site facilities and a fleet of 200 municipal vehicles. Each day Nottingham will send a combination of solar-generated energy - and whatever is left in the vehicles after the day's use - from its storage devices into the national grid. What makes the project truly circular is the battery technology itself. Funded by the European Union's [Interreg North-West Europe Programme](https://www.nweurope.eu/), the energy storage system, [E-STOR](https://connected-energy.co.uk/battery-energy-storage/), is made out of used EV batteries by the British company Connected Energy. After around a decade, an EV battery no longer provides sufficient performance for car journeys. However, they still can retain up to 80 percent of their original capacity, and with this great remaining power comes great reusability. **\"As the batteries degrade, they lose their usefulness for vehicles,\" says Matthew Lumsden, chairman of Connected Energy. \"But batteries can be used for so many other things, and to not do so results in waste and more mining of natural resources.\"** One study ... calculated that a second life battery system saved 450 tons of CO2 per MWh over its lifetime. **Note:** Learn more about the [amazing world of marine mammals](http://www.wanttoknow.info/dolphinswhalesnewsarticles). **How mud boosts your immune system** **BBC** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-how-mud-boosts-your-immune-system) \"Don't get dirty!\" was once a constant family refrain, as parents despairingly watched their children spoil their best clothes.

The rare condition happens when a person's own immune system attacks their body's motor nerves, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. But when Ian was transferred to Sue Ryder Neurological Care Centre, a state-of-the-art care unit in Lancashire, England, clinicians used music therapy techniques to overcome 'near total paralysis of his body'. **His specialist, Clare, taught him mindfulness techniques using his favorite records-and he began listening to The Carpenters each night.

Their white canes folded and held aside, they speak to a packed hall of students and teachers about their work as Medical Tactile Examiners (MTEs). \"We assist doctors in detecting the early signs of breast cancer in women,\" Banu speaks into the mic. \"Using the first two fingers of both hands, we examine women's breasts for abnormalities.\" She explains that blind women like herself and Noorunnisa are especially well-suited to this profession because of the \"high tactile sense in our fingertips, which helps us find tiny lumps in the breast.\" Tactile breast examinations, or TBEs, are clinical breast examinations specially designed for blind women trained as MTEs. Employing MTEs for routine breast cancer screening - and reaching women in their communities and workplaces - could help in the early detection of cancer and save lives, says Dr. Poovamma CU, the breast specialist under whom Banu and Noorunnisa work. [Studies prove](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173064) that in the absence of sight, blind people's brains can develop a heightened sense of touch, as well as hearing.

Women are physiologically better suited than men to endurance efforts such as running marathons. This advantage bears on questions about hunting because a prominent hypothesis contends that early humans are thought to have pursued prey on foot over long distances until the animals were exhausted. Furthermore, the fossil and archaeological records, as well as ethnographic studies of modern-day hunter-gatherers, indicate that women have a long history of hunting game. Females are ... dominating ultraendurance events such as the more than 260-mile Montane Spine foot race through England and Scotland, the 21-mile swim across the English Channel and the 4,300-mile Trans Am cycling race. **In 2018 English runner Sophie Power ran the 105-mile Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc race in the Alps while still breastfeeding her three-month-old at rest stations. Observations of recent and contemporary foraging societies provide direct evidence of women participating in hunting**. The most cited examples come from the Agta people of the Philippines. Agta women hunt while menstruating, pregnant and breastfeeding, and they have the same hunting success as Agta men. They are hardly alone. A [recent study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287101) of ethnographic data spanning the past 100 years ... found that women from a wide range of cultures hunt animals for food. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **'It's a beautiful thing': how one Paris district rediscovered conviviality** ***The Guardian *(One of the UK's most popular newspapers)** [read on WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-its-beautiful-thing-how-one-paris-district-rediscovered-conviviality) A 215-metre-long banquet table, lined with 648 chairs and laden with a home cooked produce, was set up along the Rue de l'Aude and those in attendance were urged to openly utter the most subversive of words: *bonjour*.

These include our family unit, religious background, country of origin, ethnicity, etc. **The tribal mentality effectively indoctrinates an individual into the tribe's beliefs, ensuring that all believe the same. ** The structure of reality - what is and is not possible for the members of the group - is thus agreed upon and maintained by the tribe. While the tribal mentality has definite benefits in terms of establishing common ground and ensuring group survival, it is not a conscious agreement. We are born into it. Yet at a certain stage, both personally and collectively, the tribal mentality must be challenged. People can then begin to recognize the need for a *personal* honor code independent of the tribe. If humanity is to progress, we need to learn how to treat everyone - regardless of tribal affiliation - with honor and respect. Every one of us is plugged into the tribal mind. We support tribal belief patterns by directing a percentage of our life force into maintaining our affiliation with the tribe. This involves an implicit agreement to think like the tribe thinks, to evaluate situations and people the way the tribe does, and to believe in right and wrong according to tribal values and ambitions. **As long as the tribal mentality within us remains unexamined, we unwittingly subject others to our tribal laws. ** When we are plugged into tribal thought forms, we can easily believe in nonsensical prejudices held by the tribe. Tribal mentality allows us to hold harsh, judgmental positions or attitudes about an entire group of people: \"All fat people are lazy,\" or \"all Irish are drunks,\" or \"all Muslims are terrorists\" for example. A rigid tribal thought form may have little truth to it, but individuals hold to such beliefs because that perspective is what the tribe has agreed to believe. Innocent children, born into the hatred and prejudice of their parents and ancestors, grow up inside a tribal mentality that sponsors an endless march toward war against the tribe's perceived enemies. People grow up hating other people - people they have never seen - based on group affiliation. This is the shadow side of the tribe. Inevitably, some among us come to a point where we want to break out of the inflexible tribal mentality. **At some point, these individuals want to explore, develop, and manage their own consciousness without the judgments and limitations of the tribal mind.** It is easy to spot these mavericks when they start to question and unplug from tribal mentality - they hang out on the periphery looking bored and restless, or whimsical and dreamy.

Others may act out the agitated hot-head as they challenge tribal ways. The unspoken assumption of the tribal mind is that everybody loves being part of the tribe. And in many ways, we do. Knowing where and to whom we \"belong\" is crucial to our self-concept and sense of safety in the world. **Yet when we begin the real deep journey of questioning, \"What do *I *believe?\" and start to individuate from the tribe, we often enter a dark night of the soul. **It is, by necessity, a passage we take alone. It's one thing to reject what we don't want to believe anymore. It's quite another to begin to explore what we *do* believe. All we know as we enter the dark night is that we can't go back - even when the tribe is the only world we've ever known. At this critical point in our development, the tribe doesn't feel right anymore. It no longer offers us comfort. Previous feelings of security and familiarity begin to feel like a trap constraining our individuality and hampering our efforts to discover deeper levels of who we really are. This dark night passage pushes us to look at our false gods - the tribal belief patterns in which we've become invested and to which we've given our allegiance. **The Language of Wounds ** For a large segment of the population, the language of wounds has become the new tribal language of intimacy. Prior to the current age of personal therapy - which only really took off in the 1960s and 70s - the tribal language of intimacy largely involved the sharing of only superficial personal and family data. Deeper matters such as family secrets like sexual abuse or a mad aunt or uncle were shared with exceedingly few, if any. Divorce and financial information were also considered very intimate. People would almost never talk about such matters, or about their inner life and emotions. They talked only about the details of what was going on in their external lives. **The tribal mentality at the time kept people from revealing intimate matters or deep wounds or traumas even with their family and close friends. ** The current age of personal therapy has brought about a very different situation.

Let me give an example of how this phenomenon plays itself out. I was in an Indian restaurant in Scotland talking with two men friends when the woman friend I was to meet for dinner walked up and greeted the three of us. After I had introduced her, another man walked over and asked if she was free on June 8th, as he thought she might like to attend a lecture on that date. The question required little more than a 'yes' or a 'no' answer. Instead of a simple answer, she began an elaborate discussion about June 8th. \"Did you say June 8th? No, no. Any other day would be fine, but not June 8th. That's the day my incest survivor group meets and I have to be there because we never let each other down.\" She went on and on for at least a full minute with this. Later, I asked her, \"Do you realize that in that brief introduction, you told two men whom you have never met before that 1) you had experienced incest, 2) you were still in therapy about it, 3) you were angry about it, 4) you were angry at men, and 5) you needed to determine the course of the conversation - all in one minute?\" She replied, \"Well, I am a victim of incest.\" To which I replied, \"I know that. Why did you have to let them know that?\" She was operating from a tribal mentality. The group mind within the incest survivor community has a belief about how this particular wound should be healed. The tribe says, \"You need a group.\" The tribe says, \"You have a right to be angry.\" People now get together in support group tribes that function within many of the same rigid frameworks of ethnic, national, or family tribes. **Some feel that the comfort and security of belonging to a group or tribe is more important than venturing alone in the direction of real healing. ** **Tribalism in Relationships ** The tendency toward tribalism can keep us stuck in repeating negative cycles in our intimate relationships, and can wreak havoc when a relationship is ripe for transition. Tribal mentality often teaches a righteous stance in relationships: an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. When we feel violated, the first thought is vengeance, rather than forgiveness.

Tribal mentality often teaches a righteous stance in relationships: an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. When we feel violated, the first thought is vengeance, rather than forgiveness. Tribal mentality even has gender-specific undercurrents - women do vengeance differently than men. Yet for both genders, what rules the day is the tribal mentality that holds \"breaking up is painful\" or \"betrayal warrants retaliation.\" Healing revolves around this crucial question: \"Do you want to make different choices?\" Are we willing to let go of old, constricting tribal patterns? Sadly, the answer quite often is \"No.\" Being healthy isn't always the most appealing option. Quite frankly, in many cases, it's not appealing at all. What is most appealing is being out of pain. Old patterns are difficult to relinquish because they do serve to relieve pain, even if it is only in the short run. **Change is terrifying for many precisely because short-term pain relief must be given up. Deep healing requires learning to tolerate the pain that comes with change.** Fortunately, the growing pains that come with new behavior - with making the choices that will change your life - are often short-lived. Thought alone doesn't heal. Nor does action without thought. For deep healing to occur, we need the chemistry of conscious thought and direct action combined. Every thought or attitude we have - whether consciously chosen or unconsciously adopted through the tribal mind - invests a part of our life-force into that thought or attitude. This is true whether the thought is one of betrayal and vengeance, or of understanding and forgiveness. **What matters is that a whole system of consciousness - the old tribal mentality - no longer holds us enthralled. We no longer have faith in those limiting patterns of thought. Through this transformation we learn a whole new level of trust. We break the habit of telling tribal lies which bring short-term comfort but long-term pain. We develop a new sense of self-worth and of trust and honor. ** In spite of all the heavy tribal conditioning, we now have hope because tribal mentality the world over is going through a vast transformation. And each one of us can play a vital role in this transformation. With increasing numbers of individuals changing and transcending limiting tribal beliefs, the codes of the tribe are being affected. As we collectively change and evolve, the tribes around us gradually change and evolve with us. Yet ultimately, the journey upon which we are embarking is an incredible solo flight of transcending the tribe to find our own trust, honor, and new sense of self-worth and meaning in life. **Note:** Caroline Myss ([http://www.myss.com](http://www.myss.com)) is a medical intuitive, and author of [numerous books", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__transcending_tribal_mentality.txt:3:b36697a7ab1c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12078, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__transcending_tribal_mentality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__transcending_tribal_mentality", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "increasing numbers of individuals changing and transcending limiting tribal beliefs, the codes of the tribe are being affected.

Questioning our own beliefs creates room for personal growth and deeper understanding. Do you really know who you are? Do I really know who I am? How much is our thinking around this and other deep questions shaped by our beliefs and our upbringing. Read on to explore further into the depths of this mystery and open to a more expanded awareness of who we are. With best wishes, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for the [PEERS empowerment websites](https://www.peerservice.org) **Who am I?** The question is an eternal one. **If you don't answer it, you may never be able to distinguish between what your essential self wants and what other people manipulate you to want.** Each of us may do best to answer it for himself or herself. Yet the answers given by others do affect the way we approach (or avoid) this question. Several general types of answers have been offered. The most traditional answer in Western culture is that you are a creature, a creation of God, a creation that is flawed in vital ways. Conceived and born in original sin, you are someone who must continually struggle to obey the rules laid down by that God, lest you be damned. It is an answer that appears depressing in some ways. One the one hand, it can lead to low self-worth and the expectation of failure. On the other, it can lead to the rigid arrogance of being one of the \"elect.\" Further, this view doesn't much encourage you to think about who you really are, as the answer has already been given from a \"higher\" source. The more modern answer to \"Who am I?\" is that you are a meaningless accident. Contemporary science is largely associated with a view of reality that sees the entire universe as totally material, governed only by fixed physical laws and blind chance. **It just happened that, in a huge universe, the right chemicals came together under the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__who_am_i.txt:0:b95807b617df", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12082, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspiration__who_am_i.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspiration__who_am_i", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "view doesn't much encourage you to think about who you really are, as the answer has already been given from a \"higher\" source.

Contemporary science is largely associated with a view of reality that sees the entire universe as totally material, governed only by fixed physical laws and blind chance. **It just happened that, in a huge universe, the right chemicals came together under the right conditions so that the chemical reaction we call life formed and eventually evolved into you.** But there's no inherent meaning in that accident, no spiritual side to existence. I believe that this view is not really good science, but rather what we *believe* to be scientific and factual. More important, it's a view that has strong psychological consequences. After all, if you're just a mixture of meaningless chemicals, your ultimate fate - death and nonexistence - is clear. Don't worry too much about other people, as they are just meaningless mixtures of chemicals, too. In this view, it doesn't really matter if you think about who you really are - whatever conclusions you arrive at are just subjective fantasies, of no particular relevance in the real physical world. Psychologically speaking, this materialist view of our ultimate nature leaves as much to be desired as does the born-into-original-sin view. As a psychologist, I stress the psychological consequences of these two views of your ultimate identity, because your beliefs play an important role in shaping your reality. **Modern research has shown that, in many ways, [what we believe](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#beliefsystems) affects the way our brain constructs the world we experience.** Some of these beliefs are conscious. You know you have them. Yet many are implicit - you act on them, but don't even know you have them. If you think life in general is a meaningless accident, your perceptions of the complex world around you will likely be biased toward seeing the meaningless and absurd. Seeing this will in turn reinforce your belief in the meaninglessness of things. If you believe in original sin and the great difficulties of finding salvation, your perceptions will likely be biased toward seeing your own and others' failures, again reinforcing your belief in a self-fulfilling prophecy. Our beliefs about who we are and what our world is like are not mere beliefs - they strongly control our perceptions. So we can gain more control by finding out what we believe and how those beliefs affect us. Between the traditional religious and materialistic views of who you are, there are a variety of ideas that embrace elements of each which include rich possibilities for personal and social growth. The common element in these other views is that life and the universe do have some meaning and that [each of us shares in some form of spiritual nature](https://www.momentoflove.org/).

The common element in these other views is that life and the universe do have some meaning and that [each of us shares in some form of spiritual nature](https://www.momentoflove.org/). Yet they also recognize that something has gone wrong somewhere. We have \"temporarily\" lost our way. We have forgotten the [essential divine element](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#seeing) within us and have become psychologically locked into a narrow, traditional, religious or materialist views. There is an old Eastern teaching story that illustrates this - the story of the Mad King. Although he is actually the ruler of vast dominions, the Mad King has forgotten this. Years ago he descended into the pits of the dankest cellar of his great palace, where he lives in the dark amongst rags and rats, continually brooding on his many misfortunes. The king's ministers try valiantly to persuade him to come upstairs into the light, where life is beautiful. But the Mad King is convinced these are madmen and will not listen. He will not be taken in by fairy tales of noble kings and beautiful palaces! We have a lot of evidence in modern psychology to show how little of our natural potential we use and how much of our suffering is self-created, clasped tightly to our bosoms in crazed fear and ignorance. Yet the ministers do carry a light with them when they come down into the cellar, and they do bring the food which keeps the king alive. Even in his madness, he must sometimes notice this. In the real world, events keep occurring that don't fit into our narrow views, no matter how tightly we may hold them, and sometimes these events catch our attention. **So-called [psychic phenomena](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/remote_viewing_video_documentary) are like that. They certainly don't fit a materialistic view, just as they challenge the traditional religious view held by many that this kind of phenomena only happened thousands of years ago, and are thus to be believed, but not pondered. ** Psychic phenomena are disturbing to both the traditional religious and materialistic views of who we are. It is one thing to consider abstractly that our true identity may be more than we conceive, or that our universe may be populated with other non-material intelligences. It is quite another thing, with channeling for instance, when the ordinary looking person sitting across from you seems to go to sleep, but suddenly begins speaking to you in a different voice, announcing that he is a spiritual entity who has temporarily taken over the channel's body to teach you something!

Now you have to really look at what's going on. Who is that so-called \"entity?\" Who is that person who channels? If someone else can have his or her apparent identity change so drastically, do we really know who they are? Can I even be sure about who I am? If you have been conditioned to believe that who you are is meaningless or inherently bad or sinful, you might not welcome this stimulation that the phenomena of channeling gives to the question \"Who am I?\" **We have many ways of psychologically defending ourselves against dealing with things that don't fit into our organized and defended world.** You could just say, \"This person is crazy, or maybe even deliberately faking this stuff.\" It's a good defense, for of course there are some people known as channels who are probably just crazy or deliberately faking it. The best lies usually contain a very high proportion of truth. You could also just naively accept whatever the ostensible channeled entity says. \"Yes, you are Master Shananangans from the 17th planet of the central divine galaxy Ottenwelt. Teach me Master, I hear and obey.\" This overenthusiastic acceptance can be just as much of a defense against deeper thinking and questioning as overenthusiastic rejection. **Channeling and other psychic phenomena are having a great impact on our culture today. We can use this impact for personal and social growth if we are willing to think about the deeper implications, and examine the things we take for granted about our inherent nature.** If we just believe or disbelieve without really looking, this opportunity will be lost. Read, reflect, examine your own beliefs, argue, go meet some psychics or channels. Perhaps you will decide that they are \"real.\" Perhaps you will decide they are not \"real\" in the ordinary sense of the word, but are somehow psychologically or spiritually real or important. Perhaps you will decide that some (or most or all) of this stuff is really crazy. But in the process, you will learn a lot about who you are, and who we are. **Note:** The above essay is an edited version of Charles Tart's foreword to Jon Klimo's well researched and intriguing book titled *[Channeling](http://www.amazon.com/Channeling-Investigations-Receiving-Information-Paranormal/dp/1556432488)*.

While far-right extremism is undoubtedly a concerning reality, political violence is actually very rare-representing [just over 1% of violent hate crimes](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2116870119) in the United States. In a [recent poll](https://www.vice.com/en/article/republican-voters-white-supremacy/), the majority of Republicans identified white supremacist extremism as a \"problem,\" yet mainstream media continues to [portray Republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/27/opinion/republicans-extreme-abortion.html) in general as extremists. A groundbreaking [2022 study](https://perceptiongap.us/) by More in Common revealed that Americans significantly overestimated the extremity of the beliefs held by those with differing viewpoints, with Democrats and Republicans each \"overestimating the proportion of their political opponents holding immoderate views by about 20 percentage points or more.\" Contrary to fearful mainstream media narratives, these are a few of many examples that show [we're not as divided and polarized as we are led to believe](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/how-elections-and-both-political). \"We call this the \"perception gap\" in American politics,\" [the More in Common study says](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/opinions/perception-gap-republican-democrat-yudkin/index.html), \"the yawning chasm between Americans' suspicions and reality.\" The reality may be more complex than we think, and the threat of political violence may be overblown. Going deeper, who's really behind the rise of far-right extremism? We're all familiar with the MAGA effect, but could there be deeper forces at work? Can we exclusively fear far-right political violence without acknowledging the historic role that the American empire has played in fueling right-wing extremism? Below, we take a look at the systems of power that have long manipulated and fueled the very extremism we're now being told to fear. Through [Operation Paperclip](https://www.wanttoknow.info/military-intelligence-corruption-information#paperclip), the CIA, NASA, and many other branches of government provided aliases for top Nazi officers and scientists to enter and be employed by the US after World War II. More than 1,500 Nazis were secretly embedded in the US scientific community and intelligence establishment. A top watchdog at the Social Security Administration even found that the agency [paid $20.2 million](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ex-nazis-got-20-million-social-security-watchdog-says) in social security benefits to more than 130 suspected Nazi war criminals. While attempting to stop the spread of communism during the Cold War, in an operation dubbed [Gladio](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-evolution-europe-italy-discloses-its-web-cold-war-guerrillas), NATO and the CIA worked with far-right extremists throughout Western Europe, arming and equipping fascist groups that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:inspiration__whos-really-behind-far-right-extremism-inspiring.txt:0:817e00a180af", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12087, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "inspirational.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "inspirational", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Inspiration Center Inspiration Center Our work at WantToKnow.info explores a key question facing humanity: What brings out the worst in us, and what brings out the best in us? **Most news is about what we fear.** The recurrence of human failures, war, terror, tragedy, and who's to blame contribute to a cycle of cynicism and disengagement. When society is polarized, we lose touch with what brings out the best in humanity: collaboration, creativity, openness to nuance and complexity, social-emotional intelligence, and shared purpose. Where's the empowering news that highlights these qualities? **Just as our negativity bias has helped us to survive, we need to know what is going right and well in the world, and that new ways of seeing and understanding the world are possible.** Emerging neuroscience shows that the brain is designed to change and rewire itself. Every time we take in the good and hold it in our minds and bodies, we're literally strengthening neural connections associated with these positive experiences, which has far-reaching healing potential. Most importantly, our inspiring work [cultivates a vision of love](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspiration/beyond-cultural-political-wars-ethic-of-love-for-activism). Specifically, a type of love rooted in the Greek word *agape*, a moral imperative defined by Martin Luther King Jr. as the creative, redeeming, and understanding goodwill for all people. *Agape* is the willingness to go to any length to restore community, across our differences and divides. **[Love brings the best of heart intelligence](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspiration/love-in-action-inspiring-story) to all aspects of our lives.** And [through science](https://www.heartmath.org/research/science-of-the-heart/), we know that the heart has its own electromagnetic field that affects others around us. It sends more information to the brain than the brain does to the heart. Numerous studies have even shown that heart rhythms stood out as the most reflective indicator of one's well-being. We've documented some of the best insights, resources, and thousands of inspiring news articles on solutions to the world's most pressing problems, mysterious explorations into consciousness and spirituality, and incredible stories of human goodness and resilience. **[Read our latest inspiring articles on Substack.](https://peerservice.substack.com/t/inspiring)** [Explore our archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/medianewsarticles#inspiration) of inspiring messages and essays we send to our email list. **Enter the [PEERS Inspirational News Database](https://www.wanttoknow.info/db-public/artwtk?aq=&cat=5)** Latest Inspiring News [Explore more inspiring news articles.](/inspirationalnewsstories) \"If we carry intergenerational trauma, then we also carry intergenerational wisdom.

Holeman](http://awakenvisions.com) **We are all interconnected. The Web of Love is an energetic web which connects the sacred essence of all beings in our world.** In the deepest part of ourselves, there is in each of us a beautiful, [divine essence](https://www.weboflove.org/transformation#seeing) which wants nothing more than [to love and be loved](https://www.momentoflove.org). The Web of Love, though invisible to our eyes, interconnects all of us through that deepest essence. It literally surrounds and envelops our planet and all who live here. We are all interconnected through sacred love. It is up to each of us how much we choose to be aware of this connection. We are all capable of giving and receiving limitless amounts of love. Many of us have forgotten this and ended up feeling alone or uncared for in our lives. **The Web of Love reminds us of our true nature. It reminds us of our deeper interconnectedness. The Web of Love is a call to join together in sharing the abundance of sacred love that flows within and between us all** through consciously feeling our interconnectedness with the web. **Breathing Our Interconnectedness** **Breathing the Web.** Here is a simple, yet powerful way of opening to our interconnectedness using breath. Close your eyes for a minute and imagine a sparkling, colorful web of love connecting the deepest essence of all people in the world. You can place your hands over your heart or the center of your chest as you do this. Take a few deep breaths as you open to this beautiful image. Now, while taking a slow, very deep inhale, silently say to yourself: **Your sacred love flows in to me. **Then slowly exhale fully while thinking and feeling: **My sacred love flows out to you.** Repeat this a few times while opening your heart to all the love present. Make sure to fill your lungs completely on the in breath and to exhale fully on breathing out. Breathing sacred love like this for just a minute or less can powerfully shift you into a more open and loving space allowing you to feel our interconnectedness. Try it now, and invite yourself to really let the love flow. The \"you\" in these sacred love statements can be all people in our world, or any individual you choose. For some, it might be easier to start by imagining the one to whom you feel closest in your life. Breathe the web with that special someone in mind and let the love flow between you. Then with each following breath, envision other people in your life and do the same. When you are ready, envision groups with which you are involved and eventually all people who share our world. This simple breathing exercise can be deeply meaningful in either a personal or a global context.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:interconnectedness.txt:0:6fed882383ab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12115, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "interconnectedness.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "interconnectedness", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "to start by imagining the one to whom you feel closest in your life.

This simple breathing exercise can be deeply meaningful in either a personal or a global context. There may be times when you want to breathe the web, but can't remember the words used above. \"Love to me, love to you,\" is all you need to feel the web as you breathe. You can create your own sayings, too, with words that are more meaningful to you. **The most important element is your intention to interconnect with all people on this beautiful planet through the Web of Love.** **Sharing This Interconnectedness With the World** If you are ready to powerfully transform your life, consider taking the Web of Love into your every day world. You might start your day upon awakening and end your day before sleeping with the above exercise. As you start your work, or whenever you feel stressed, take a minute to stop and deeply breathe in the ever present sacred love of the web and of everyone around you. Then on the exhale, fully breathe your sacred love out to all. You can do it with your eyes open or closed. Silently breathe the web while waiting at a traffic stoplight, with the checker at the store, or as you pass someone on the street. As you do this, realize that literally thousands of people around the world are joining you in breathing sacred love. Invite that beautiful collective love to flow deep into your being. Each time you open to this heart connection, you strengthen the love both in yourself and in our world. **This simple exercise can be done in less than a minute, yet as you practice it more, don't be surprised if you find your life transforming in big ways. ** **Breathing Interconnectedness With Friends** Once you are comfortable with this exercise on your own, consider going to greater depth by inviting one or more special friends to join you in opening to this feeling of interconnectedness. Choosing either to gaze into each other's eyes or to keep your eyes closed, feel the love while breathing deeply together: Your sacred love flows in to me. My sacred love flows out to you. It doesn't matter that you might be breathing love in or out at the same time. Just let it flow in whatever way feels best. Once you feel complete, don't forget to take a minute to join in sharing the sacred love you've just generated with all beings on the planet.

Tenet yesterday called for new security measures to guard against attacks on the United States that use the Internet, which he called \"a potential Achilles' heel.\" \"I know that these actions will be controversial in this age when we still think the Internet is a free and open society with no control or accountability,\" he told an information-technology security conference in Washington, \"but ultimately the Wild West must give way to governance and control.\" The former CIA director said telecommunications - and specifically the Internet - are a back door through which terrorists and other enemies of the United States could attack the country, even though great strides have been made in securing the physical infrastructure. The Internet \"represents a potential Achilles' heel for our financial stability and physical security if the networks we are creating are not protected,\" Mr. Tenet said. He said known adversaries, including \"intelligence services, military organizations and non-state actors,\" are researching information attacks against the United States. Within the federal government, the Department of Homeland Security has the lead role in protecting the Internet from terrorism. But the department's head of cyber-security recently quit amid reports that he had clashed with his superiors. Mr. Tenet, who retired in July as director of the CIA after seven years, warned that al Qaeda remains a sophisticated group, even though its first-tier leadership largely has been destroyed. It is \"undoubtedly mapping vulnerabilities and weaknesses in our telecommunications networks,\" he said. Mr. Tenet pointed out that the modernization of key industries in the United States is making them more vulnerable by connecting them with an Internet that is open to attack. The way the Internet was built might be part of the problem, he said. Its open architecture allows Web surfing, but", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:internetaccess.txt:0:b4e8187ef5ba", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12118, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "internetaccess.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "internetaccess", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "that al Qaeda remains a sophisticated group, even though its first-tier leadership largely has been destroyed.

Its open architecture allows Web surfing, but that openness makes the system vulnerable, Mr. Tenet said. **Access to networks like the World Wide Web might need to be limited to those who can show they take security seriously, he said.** Mr. Tenet called for industry to lead the way by \"establishing and enforcing\" security standards. Products need to be delivered to government and private-sector customers \"with a new level of security and risk management already built in.\" **The national press, including United Press International (UPI), were excluded from yesterday's event, at Mr. Tenet's request, organizers said.** Your tax-deductible donations, however large or small, help greatly to support this important work.

The culture and information wars playing out in the media have generated ferocious argument, yet very little clarity about how we can engage with each other across the vast differences in the news we consume. Real corruptions and cover-ups remain hidden from public awareness, largely due to the special interests driving our corporate media systems telling us what to believe and not to believe. Yet what if we *can* have a nuanced, nonpartisan conversation about the very controversial issues shaping our lives? Meet Tony Brasunas, a committed independent media activist who has researched and wrote extensively about censorship, propaganda, free speech, and media literacy in America for a number of years. **Associate Director Amber Yang for PEERS and WantToKnow.info recently hosted an interview with Brasunas, where he shares about his recent book, *[Red White & Blind: The Truth about Disinformation and the Path to Media Consciousness](https://www.redwhiteandblind.com/)*.** You can find the link to the interview below, or go [directly to our Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OSq8pPZRkg) to watch. Utilizing a storytelling approach in his book, Brasunas takes people on a journey to explore the relationship between the media and core issues of our times.** COVID, Jeffrey Epstein, and the events that transpired on January 6 are few of the many examples he uses to explore how the media covertly shapes public opinion, largely by inciting social division.** He also explores issues once discredited as \"conspiracy theories,\" yet have now turned out to be valid or worthy of consideration. He calls for the cultivation of *media consciousness*, a state of awareness that supports people in navigating the manipulative noise of the media landscape. In the interview, he discusses his experiences being censored as a journalist, as well as the [corruption he encountered](https://tonybrasunas.medium.com/the-great-recognition-of-2016-nixon-level-corruption-in-the-dnc-means-its-time-to-build-a-new-29cb9dd83001#.n6hfdkii2) at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. We also explore the history and origins of media manipulation, the different forms of media biases, and media literacy skills that anyone can adopt to build what he calls a \"balanced media diet.\" As a young blogger for *The San Francisco Chronicle* during the buildup to the Iraq war, Brasunas covered an appearance by senator Joe Biden at a downtown hotel. Brasunas wrote that Biden was advocating for an invasion, yet didn't mention the grave impacts this will have on Iraqi people and the environment. When his piece was published, he was disturbed that his critique on Biden's call for war was omitted.

I noticed censorship and propaganda distorting virtually every major story in the corporate media, and it inspired me to look more deeply. **I learned to distinguish everyday editorial decision-making-which is not censorship-from imperiously silencing viewpoints or entire stories on account of systemic or nefarious bias, which is indeed censorship.*** - Excerpt from* [Red White & Blind](https://www.redwhiteandblind.com/)* In 2016, Brasunas was also censored by *Huffington Post *for [writing about](https://tonybrasunas.medium.com/the-deeper-reason-independents-and-progressives-will-not-support-hillary-clinton-db79a10b23c7) the manipulation of media coverage for Bernie Sanders' campaign. This led him down a meaningful path to making sense of the vast corruption and media manipulation on both sides of the political aisle. *The media began counting superdelegates in October as if they'd already voted even though today they still haven't; the DNC performed something shockingly similar to money laundering for the Clinton campaign to circumvent donation maximums and [funnel millions to her campaign](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670); the debates were reduced, canceled, or scheduled at times few people would watch, which prevented Bernie Sanders from becoming better known earlier in the primary; and the primary rules as a whole were [written and rewritten](https://web.archive.org/web/20160718185823/https://www.usuncut.com/politics/debbie-wasserman-schultz-hillary-clinton/) by DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who happens to be a longtime Clinton friend and ally*. - Excerpt from [Brasunas' censored article](https://tonybrasunas.medium.com/the-deeper-reason-independents-and-progressives-will-not-support-hillary-clinton-db79a10b23c7) for *Huffington Post* Despite the challenging problems we face in our media systems, Brasunas carries a positive vision for our collective future. He emphasizes that for the first time in human history, we can interact and share our experiences with each other directly and quickly through the digital world. *A media awakening is unfolding all over the country. Media censorship and propaganda are increasing but so is awareness of this distortion. This isn't the first book on this, and it won't be the last. It has become cliché lately to say a battle is being fought for the minds of Americans, but that's because it's true. This battle is part of a larger war going on all across the world in this era of accelerating technology, globalization, and wealth inequality.* *This war is between, on the one hand, reactionaries who seek greater centralization of power into the hands of national and global governing bodies, something that the internet and globalization enable. Opposing them are those whom I call progressives who seek decentralization of power and a return of sovereignty to smaller communities and individuals, things that the internet also enables in a way never before", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:interview-media-activist-tony-brasunas-red-white-blind.txt:1:48c549c60736", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12121, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "interview-media-activist-tony-brasunas-red-white-blind.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "interview-media-activist-tony-brasunas-red-white-blind", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "on all across the world in this era of accelerating technology, globalization, and wealth inequality.* *This war is between, on the one hand, reactionaries who seek greater centralization of power into the hands of national and global governing bodies, something that the internet and globalization enable.

The latter, however, could establish a new decentralized world of smaller, freer, more autonomous communities and nations. The presence or absence of Free Speech and a Free Press will in part determine the outcome of this great power struggle. *- Excerpt from *[Red White & Blind](https://www.redwhiteandblind.com/)* Check out [Tony Brasunas' website](http://tonybrasunas.com/) and his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tonybrasunas), and consider supporting him and his excellent book *[Red White & Blind](https://www.redwhiteandblind.com/)*.

Any link, dissemination, discussion is much appreciated. First, a bit on myself, just FYI: I've testified before both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives at two of the four congressional hearings which my award-winning journalism directly caused. And I've published in Slate, MSNBC, Salon, The Village Voice, Rolling Stone, Reason, The Nation.com, TomPaine.com, Newsday, Alternet, Wired News, New York Press and The Progressive Review. Though I'm a freelancer, I ended up appearing on ABC, FOX, CNN, the BBC and NPR, and actually helping to curtail a covert, federal propaganda program. This followed my disclosure in Salon that the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) provided hundreds of thousands of dollars of financial incentives per episode to the TV networks for government-dictated anti-drug scripts. The networks' total haul was over $22 million. I quoted named consultants who promulgated specific changes in specific shows at the government's behest. My disclosures prompted more than 100 articles and broadcasts, including next-day, front-page coverage nationwide, and editorials condemning the practice I outlined. Below are the initial few paragraphs and URL to a national scoop I hope you can feature on your site. This proves that the Dept. of Homeland Security delayed launching $226 million in advertising until a month before bombs fell on Baghdad. Shrouded in a public health message, the campaign was four times bigger than its largest non-government, non-state security competitor for donated time and space. It featured Tom Ridge instructing the public that every family in the land is at risk of attack, and that every American needs to be engaged in supporting the coming war on terrorism. Though Americans were at risk throughout 2002, the ads only appeared just before the Iraq invasion. This article can be found at: [http://www.antiwar.com/forbes/?articleid=2679](http://www.antiwar.com/forbes/?articleid=2679) $226 Million in Govt Ads Helped Pave the Way for War by Daniel Forbes \"*To ultimately be the victor in the war against terrorism, we need all Americans to be engaged*.\"- DHS Secretary, Tom Ridge **D**epartment of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge found this exhortation so fine, he used it in two of the radio and television ads that American broadcasters donated in 2003 to DHS for its ostensible terrorism preparedness campaign.

Whether tardy or oh so timely, at $226 million last year, this bellicose DHS campaign received more than twice as much donated time and space as the largest nonprofit ad campaign the year before. Bellicose? Wasn't this the \"Ready\" campaign much beloved by Leno and Letterman for pushing duct tape on a scornful public? Yet, consider another line that Ridge liked so much he repeated it in two of the ads: \"*Terrorism forces us to make a choice: We can be afraid, or we can be ready*.\" One short ad featuring this statement from Ridge included little else. Stock up on water and batteries sure. But don't just stand there quivering in fear, somebody do something - something preemptive. Ridge also informed us that, \"*Every family in America should prepare itself for terrorist attack*.\" If indeed every family is vulnerable - and if Saddam was linked to the terrorists, as the administration maintained - then surely our government must do something proactive, something involving jets and tanks. Well, wait a scant month America, for as Bush's designated terror czar promised: \"*We're asking America to be ready - and we will be ready*.\" Be ready, for time was short. Though the ads were planned as far back as at least May 2002 - and they employed simple public health maxims of long-standing - there was no perceived need to rush them out despite every reason to fear another attack throughout 2002. Instead, under the overall direction of Bush cabinet official Tom Ridge, the ads were always scheduled for early 2003, as was, apparently, the start of the war on Iraq. Two private entities and an agency George W. Bush created in the Executive Office of the President joined forces creating the campaign. The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation contributed both advice and between $3 and $4 million to the effort. The Ad Council helped shepherd it on to the nations' airwaves, as it's done for nonprofit advertising campaigns since WWII. Sloan's president, Ralph Gomory, said that OHS (Office of Homeland Security - predecessor to the DHS), Sloan and the Ad Council agreed to the effort in May 2002 and planned to hit the airwaves in January 2003.

The first article, from the respected British newspaper *The Guardian*, describes how the highly successful U.N. WMD inspector had his position threatened, and the shady reasons behind it. The following article, from the *New York Times*, gives the final result - the inspector was removed by a UN vote with almost as many abstentions as votes in favor. Notice how the *Times* article avoids going into any depth about what really happened. The American media is clearly part of the war propaganda machine. Thanks for caring, and have a great day!

It has been planned for a month. It will be executed quietly, and most of us won't know what is happening until it's too late. It is seeking to overthrow 60 years of multilateralism in favour of a global regime built on force. **The coup begins with its attempt, in five days' time, to unseat the man in charge of ridding the world of chemical weapons. If it succeeds, this will be the first time that the head of a multilateral agency will have been deposed in this manner. Every other international body will then become vulnerable to attack. The coup will also shut down the peaceful options for dealing with the chemical weapons Iraq may possess, helping to ensure that war then becomes the only means of destroying them. ** The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) enforces the chemical weapons convention. It inspects labs and factories and arsenals and oversees the destruction of the weapons they contain. Its director-general is a workaholic Brazilian diplomat called Jose Bustani. He has, arguably, done more in the past five years to promote world peace than anyone else on earth. His inspectors have overseen the destruction of 2 million chemical weapons and two-thirds of the world's chemical weapon facilities. He has so successfully cajoled reluctant nations that the number of signatories to the convention has risen from 87 to 145 in the past five years: the fastest growth rate of any multilateral body in recent times. **In May 2000, as a tribute to his extraordinary record, Bustani was re-elected unanimously by the member states for a second five-year", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:iraqwarsetup.txt:0:5c2c7773c063", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12127, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "iraqwarsetup.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "iraqwarsetup", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "on earth.

He has so successfully cajoled reluctant nations that the number of signatories to the convention has risen from 87 to 145 in the past five years: the fastest growth rate of any multilateral body in recent times. **In May 2000, as a tribute to his extraordinary record, Bustani was re-elected unanimously by the member states for a second five-year term, even though he had yet to complete his first one. Last year Colin Powell wrote to him to thank him for his \"very impressive\" work. But now everything has changed. The man celebrated for his achievements has been denounced as an enemy of the people. ** In January, with no prior warning or explanation, the US state department asked the Brazilian government to recall him, on the grounds that it did not like his \"management style\". This request directly contravenes the chemical weapons convention, which states \"the director-general ... shall not seek or receive instructions from any government\". Brazil refused. In March the US government accused Bustani of \"financial mismanagement\", \"demoralisation\" of his staff, \"bias\" and \"ill-considered initiatives\". It warned that if he wanted to avoid damage to his reputation, he must resign. Again, the US was trampling the convention, which insists that member states shall \"not seek to influence\" the staff. He refused to go. On March 19 the US proposed a vote of no confidence in Bustani. It lost. So it then did something unprecedented in the history of multi lateral diplomacy. It called a \"special session\" of the member states to oust him. The session begins on Sunday. And this time the US is likely to get what it wants. Since losing the vote last month, the United States, which is supposed to be the organisation's biggest donor, has been twisting the arms of weaker nations, refusing to pay its dues unless they support it, with the result that the OPCW could go under. Last week Bustani told me, \"the Europeans are so afraid that the US will abandon the convention that they are prepared to sacrifice my post to keep it on board\". His last hope is that the United Kingdom, whose record of support for the organisation has so far been exemplary, will make a stand. The meeting on Sunday will present Tony Blair's government with one of the clearest choices it has yet faced between multilateralism and the \"special relationship\". The US has not sought to substantiate the charges it has made against Bustani. The OPCW is certainly suffering from a financial crisis, but that is largely because the US unilaterally capped its budget and then failed to pay what it owed. The organisation's accounts have just been audited and found to be perfectly sound. Staff morale is higher than any organisation as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:iraqwarsetup.txt:1:57de985ebbb7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12128, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "iraqwarsetup.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "iraqwarsetup", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "government with one of the clearest choices it has yet faced between multilateralism and the \"special relationship\".

The organisation's accounts have just been audited and found to be perfectly sound. Staff morale is higher than any organisation as underfunded as the OPCW could reasonably expect. Bustani's real crimes are contained in the last two charges, of \"bias\" and \"ill-considered initiatives\". The charge of bias arises precisely because the OPCW is not biased. It has sought to examine facilities in the United States with the same rigour with which it examines facilities anywhere else. But, just like Iraq, the US has refused to accept weapons inspectors from countries it regards as hostile to its interests, and has told those who have been allowed in which parts of a site they may and may not inspect. It has also passed special legislation permitting the president to block unannounced inspections, and banning inspectors from removing samples of its chemicals. \"Ill-considered initiatives\" is code for the attempts Bustani has made, in line with his mandate, to persuade Saddam Hussein to sign the chemical weapons convention. If Iraq agrees, it will then be subject to the same inspections - both routine and unannounced - as any other member state (with the exception, of course, of the United States). Bustani has so far been unsuccessful, but only because, he believes, he has not yet received the backing of the UN security council, with the result that Saddam knows he would have little to gain from signing. Bustani has suggested that if the security council were to support the OPCW's bid to persuade Iraq to sign, this would provide the US with an alternative to war. It is hard to see why Saddam Hussein would accept weapons inspectors from Unmovic - the organisation backed by the security council - after its predecessor, Unscom, was found to be stuffed with spies planted by the US government. It is much easier to see why he might accept inspectors from an organisation which has remained scrupulously even-handed. Indeed, when Unscom was thrown out of Iraq in 1998, the OPCW was allowed in to complete the destruction of the weapons it had found. Bustani has to go because he has proposed the solution to a problem the US does not want solved. \"What the Americans are doing,\" Bustani says, \"is a coup d'etat. They are using brute force to amend the convention and unseat the director-general.\" As the chemical weapons convention has no provisions permitting these measures, the US is simply ripping up the rules. If it wins, then the OPCW, like Unscom, will be fatally compromised.

If it wins, then the OPCW, like Unscom, will be fatally compromised. Success for the United States on Sunday would threaten the independence of every multilateral body. This is, then, one of those rare occasions on which our government could make a massive difference to the way the world is run. It could choose to support its closest ally, wrecking multilateralism and shutting down the alternatives to war. Or it could defy the United States in defence of world peace and international law. It will take that principled stand only if we, the people from whom it draws its power, make so much noise that it must listen. We have five days in which to stop the US from bullying its way to war.

Bustani, a Brazilian diplomat who was unanimously re-elected last year as the director general of the 145-nation Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, was voted out of office today after refusing repeated demands by the United States that he step down because of his \"management style.\" No successor has been selected. ** \"I clearly made some people in Washington very uncomfortable because I was too independent,\" Mr. Bustani said afterward. \"They want somebody more obedient.\" The American motion to fire Mr. Bustani was approved by 48 nations, while 7 voted against and 43 abstained. Most European nations voted with the United States, except for France, which abstained. Mexico, one of the countries that voted no, called the maneuver \"illegal\" because there was no provision in the rules to dismiss the director general. Diplomats said the many abstentions reflected the unease of a number of countries over the action. They said it had opened the door further for other international bodies to come under attack. **The United States, which is responsible for 22 percent of the agency's budget, had threatened to cut off funding until Mr. Bustani left.** \"I think a lot of people swallowed this because they thought it was better for Bustani", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:iraqwarsetup.txt:3:ddad5c6df438", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12130, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "iraqwarsetup.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "iraqwarsetup", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "provision in the rules to dismiss the director general.

Several weeks later, the State Department circulated a lengthy paper among members of the group and dispatched envoys to a number of capitals to secure enough votes to fire Mr. Bustani. The paper accuses him of confrontational and abrasive conduct and poor administrative and financial management. American officials also said Mr. Bustani had taken some \"ill-considered initiatives,\" without consulting with the United States and others. \"An effective director general needs to consult with member states, instead of launching initiatives,\" said an American official.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:iraqwarsetup.txt:4:f8d688069f42", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12131, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "itk__0-template-insider.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "itk__0-template-insider", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "X\n\nXXX\n\nXXX\n\nHey wonderful 'In the Know' friends,\n\nI thought\n\nWishing you and all of us abundant love, inspiration, and joy,\n\nFred\n\nJune 21, 2013\n\n**Note:** To find this message online, click here.

First, let me give you more information on this network.** I ask you to at least skim through the essay I've posted online at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/sexabuse/australian-network). **In that essay, you will find solid, reliable information on a network of pedophiles that involves top Australian entertainers, politicians, and even the very police squad specifically designated to investigate pedophile crimes. You can find links to articles in top Australian media proving much of what is claimed at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/sexabuse/australian-network-all-media.shtml). This case is somewhat similar to the [Jimmy Savile pedophile case](https://www.WantToKnow.info//a.php?q=british-oversight-unit-says-police-failed-pursue-sex-accusations-against-savile) which is implicating top figures throughout England lately. Sadly, this case is not beng exposed like the Savile case in England. The key people once involved in exposing this Australian network were threatened sufficiently (one couple I know was even thrown in jail), that the investigation came to a halt back in 2006 despite huge amounts of indisputable evidence of the network. Powerful forces were able to shut this investigation down through intimidation and more. The courageous woman who wrote the essay at the link above and who spearheaded the investigation, Dr. Reina Michaelson, went into seclusion after serious threats and disruptions to her life. She now lives a quiet life in the countryside to avoid being in the crosshairs of those involved with this powerful network.

Yet if any of you feel that you could actually do something with this list, I'd be happy to send it to you.** So what can we do about this? That's one of the main reasons I'm writing you. I'd love to have a conversation with any interested from the \"In the Know\" group in our new private online forum about this. Let us heartstorm together about the best way to expose such information that will cause the least disruption in our lives, yet have a powerful impact in stopping all of the abuse. I particularly invite any Australian friends on this list to get involved. **If you choose not to join the conversation, I would ask that you at least spend a few minutes sending energetic support for what we are doing.** My deepest intention is to do everything possible to stop the destructive behavior, yet also to send love to the souls of those involved even as we do all we can to stop them. Remember that we are all interconnected and in our deepest core every one of us is divine and playing our role in this grand play. By remembering and strengthening the heart connection we share with all beings, we can create powerful transformation on our planet even as we do our very best to stop destructive behavior.

Less than a week after the last message I sent in November, I went over the handlebars of my motorcycle on the freeway and was very lucky to walk away with only a broken collar bone. This caused me to slow down for a while. And as I am increasingly prioritizing creating quality time for myself, I've had to drop a number of things like posts to this list to create the spaciousness I so value. Yet I still enjoy occasionally sending you some truly amazing material like that below when I get the chance. First, **I want to recommend a truly profound [20-minute video](http://www.launchmoxie.com/jv/admissions-film/delivery-565784jl234aw/) on heaven, hell, and the power of forgiveness. This is one of the most penetrating videos I've seen in years. And speaking of great videos, check out the [20 most popular TED Talks](http://blog.ted.com/2013/12/16/the-most-popular-20-ted-talks-2013) of all time.** I've slowly been moving through the list and am deeply impressed with the profound insights and moving ideas presented which have inspired me to step even more fully into my magnificence. I highly recommend finding the time to watch some of these unforgettable presentations. I also recommend exploring the excellent effort to rally people around the world to move beyond war on the inspiring website at [http://www.worldbeyondwar.org](http://www.worldbeyondwar.org). And please sign the pledge there to help bring an end to war in our world. Finally, I invite you to read the most profound and provocative essay below about how different cultures make a distinction between being crazy and being a healer. The article focuses on the work of shamanic healer and transformation agent Malidoma Somé, who I've had the privilege of meeting. Malidoma's warm presence and ability to penetrate to the core of a subject deeply impressed me. His autobiography [*Of Water and the Spirit*](http://www.amazon.com/Of-Water-Spirit-Initiation-African/dp/0140194967/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1403802448&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=Malidoma+Some+Of+Earth%2C+Water%2C+and+Spirit) also inspired me greatly. I invite you to read the mind-bending essay below and see if you don't come out changed as a result. Take care.

Thus, mental disorders are spiritual emergencies, spiritual crises, and need to be regarded as such to aid the healer in being born. **What those in the West view as mental illness, the Dagara people regard as \"good news from the other world.\" The person going through the crisis has been chosen as a medium for a message to the community that needs to be communicated from the spirit realm.** \"Mental disorder, behavioral disorder of all kinds, signal the fact that two obviously incompatible energies have merged into the same field,\" says Dr. Somé. These disturbances result when the person does not get assistance in dealing with the presence of the energy from the spirit realm. One of the things Dr. Somé encountered when he first came to the United States in 1980 for graduate study was how this country deals with mental illness. When a fellow student was sent to a mental institute due to \"nervous depression,\" Dr. Somé went to visit him. \"I was so shocked. That was the first time I was brought face to face with what is done here to people exhibiting the same symptoms I've seen in my village.\" What struck Dr. Somé was that the attention given to such symptoms was based on pathology, on the idea that the condition is something that needs to stop. This was in complete opposition to the way his culture views such a situation. As he looked around the stark ward at the patients, some in straitjackets, some zoned out on medications, others screaming, he observed to himself, \"So this is how the healers who are attempting to be born are treated in this culture. What a loss! What a loss that a person who is finally being aligned with a power from the other world is just being wasted.\" Another way to say this, which may make more sense to the Western mind, is that **we in the West are not trained in how to deal or even taught to acknowledge the existence of psychic phenomena, the spiritual world. In fact, psychic abilities are denigrated.** When energies from the spiritual world emerge in a Western psyche, that individual is completely unequipped to integrate them or even recognize what is happening. The result can be terrifying. Without the proper context for and assistance in dealing with the breakthrough from another level of reality, for all practical purposes, the person is insane. **Heavy dosing with anti-psychotic drugs compounds the problem and prevents the integration that could lead", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:itk__13__crazy-healer.txt:1:2ca0f189aa05", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12138, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "itk__13__crazy-healer.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "itk__13__crazy-healer", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "phenomena, the spiritual world.

Without the proper context for and assistance in dealing with the breakthrough from another level of reality, for all practical purposes, the person is insane. **Heavy dosing with anti-psychotic drugs compounds the problem and prevents the integration that could lead to soul development and growth in the individual who has received these energies.** On the mental ward, Dr Somé saw a lot of \"beings\" hanging around the patients, \"entities\" that are invisible to most people but that shamans and psychics are able to see. \"They were causing the crisis in these people,\" he says. It appeared to him that these beings were trying to get the medications and their effects out of the bodies of the people the beings were trying to merge with, and were increasing the patients' pain in the process. \"The beings were acting almost like some kind of excavator in the energy field of people. They were really fierce about that. The people they were doing that to were just screaming and yelling,\" he said. He couldn't stay in that environment and had to leave. **In the Dagara tradition, the community helps the person reconcile the energies of both worlds - \"the world of the spirit that he or she is merged with, and the village and community.\" That person is able then to serve as a bridge between the worlds and help the living with information and healing they need.** Thus, the spiritual crisis ends with the birth of another healer. \"The other world's relationship with our world is one of sponsorship,\" Dr. Somé explains. \"More often than not, the knowledge and skills that arise from this kind of merger are a knowledge or a skill that is provided directly from the other world.\" The beings who were increasing the pain of the inmates on the mental hospital ward were actually attempting to merge with the inmates in order to get messages through to this world. The people they had chosen to merge with were getting no assistance in learning how to be a bridge between the worlds and the beings' attempts to merge were thwarted. The result was the sustaining of the initial disorder of energy and the aborting of the birth of a healer. \"The Western culture has consistently ignored the birth of the healer,\" states Dr. Somé. \"Consequently, there will be a tendency from the other world to keep trying as many people as possible in an attempt to get somebody's attention. They have to try harder.\" The spirits are drawn to people whose senses have not been anesthetized. \"The sensitivity is pretty much read as an invitation to come in,\" he", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:itk__13__crazy-healer.txt:2:0e057c543aac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12139, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "itk__13__crazy-healer.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "itk__13__crazy-healer", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "of energy and the aborting of the birth of a healer. \"The Western culture has consistently ignored the birth of the healer,\" states Dr. Somé. \"Consequently, there will be a tendency from the other world to keep trying as many people as possible in an attempt to get somebody's attention. They have to try harder.\" The spirits are drawn to people whose senses have not been anesthetized. \"The sensitivity is pretty much read as an invitation to come in,\" he notes. **Those who develop so-called mental disorders are those who are sensitive, which is viewed in Western culture as oversensitivity. Indigenous cultures don't see it that way and, as a result, sensitive people don't experience themselves as overly sensitive.** In the West, \"it is the overload of the culture they're in that is just wrecking them,\" observes Dr. Somé. The frenetic pace, the bombardment of the senses, and the violent energy that characterize Western culture can overwhelm sensitive people. **Schizophrenia and Foreign Energy** With schizophrenia, there is a special \"receptivity to a flow of images and information, which cannot be controlled,\" stated Dr. Somé. \"When this kind of rush occurs at a time that is not personally chosen, and particularly when it comes with images that are scary and contradictory, the person goes into a frenzy.\" What is required in this situation is first to separate the person's energy from the extraneous foreign energies, by using shamanic practice (what is known as a \"sweep\") to clear the latter out of the individual's aura. With the clearing of their energy field, the person no longer picks up a flood of information and so no longer has a reason to be scared and disturbed, explains Dr. Somé. Then it is possible to help the person align with the energy of the spirit being attempting to come through from the other world and give birth to the healer. The blockage of that emergence is what creates problems. \"The energy of the healer is a high-voltage energy,\" he observes. \"When it is blocked, it just burns up the person. It's like a short-circuit. Fuses are blowing. This is why it can be really scary, and I understand why this culture prefers to confine these people. Here they are yelling and screaming, and they're put into a straitjacket. That's a sad image.\" Again, the shamanic approach is to work on aligning the energies so there is no blockage, \"fuses\" aren't blowing, and the person can become the healer they are meant to be. It needs to be noted at this point, however, that **not all of the spirit beings that enter a person's energetic field are there for the purposes of promoting healing. There are negative energies as well, which are undesirable presences in the aura.** In those cases, the shamanic approach is to remove them from the aura, rather than work to align the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:itk__13__crazy-healer.txt:3:00ef6424df5b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12140, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "itk__13__crazy-healer.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "itk__13__crazy-healer", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "is no blockage, \"fuses\" aren't blowing, and the person can become the healer they are meant to be.

He was in a mental hospital and had been given a lot of drugs, but nothing was helping. \"The parents had done everything - unsuccessfully,\" says Dr. Somé. \"They didn't know what else to do.\" **With their permission, Dr. Somé took their son to Africa. \"After eight months there, Alex had become quite normal, Dr. Somé reports. He was even able to participate with healers in the business of healing;** sitting with them all day long and helping them, assisting them in what they were doing with their clients. He spent about four years in my village.\" Alex stayed by choice, not because he needed more healing. He felt, \"much safer in the village than in America.\" To bring his energy and that of the being from the spiritual realm into alignment, Alex went through a shamanic ritual designed for that purpose, although it was slightly different from the one used with the Dagara people. \"He wasn't born in the village, so something else applied. But the result was similar, even though the ritual was not literally the same,\" explains Dr. Somé. The fact that aligning the energy worked to heal Alex demonstrated to Dr. Somé that the connection between other beings and mental illness is indeed universal. After the ritual, Alex began to share the messages that the spirit being had for this world. Unfortunately, the people he was talking to didn't speak English (Dr. Somé was away at that point). The whole experience led, however, to Alex's going to college to study psychology. He returned to the United States after four years because \"he discovered that all the things that he needed to do had been done, and he could then move on with his life.\" **The last that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:itk__13__crazy-healer.txt:4:c220782117e2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12141, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "itk__13__crazy-healer.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "itk__13__crazy-healer", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "Alex began to share the messages that the spirit being had for this world.

He returned to the United States after four years because \"he discovered that all the things that he needed to do had been done, and he could then move on with his life.\" **The last that Dr. Somé heard was that Alex was in graduate school in psychology at Harvard. No one had thought he would ever be able to complete undergraduate studies, much less get an advanced degree.** Dr. Somé sums up what Alex's mental illness was all about: \"He was reaching out. It was an emergency call. His job and his purpose was to be a healer. He said no one was paying attention to that.\" After seeing how well the shamanic approach worked for Alex, Dr. Somé concluded that spirit beings are just as much an issue in the West as in his community in Africa. \"Yet the question still remains, the answer to this problem must be found here, instead of having to go all the way overseas to seek the answer. There has to be a way in which a little bit of attention beyond the pathology of this whole experience leads to the possibility of coming up with the proper ritual to help people.\" **Longing for Spiritual Connection** A common thread that Dr. Somé has noticed in \"mental\" disorders in the West is \"a very ancient ancestral energy that has been placed in stasis, that finally is coming out in the person.\" His job then is to trace it back, to go back in time to discover what that spirit is. In most cases, the spirit is connected to nature, especially with mountains or big rivers, he says. In the case of mountains, as an example to explain the phenomenon, \"it's a spirit of the mountain that is walking side by side with the person and, as a result, creating a time-space distortion that is affecting the person caught in it.\" What is needed is a merger or alignment of the two energies, \"so the person and the mountain spirit become one.\" Again, the shaman conducts a specific ritual to bring about this alignment. Dr. Somé believes that he encounters this situation so often in the United States because** \"most of the fabric of this country is made up of the energy of the machine, and the result of that is the disconnection and the severing of the past. You can run from the past, but you can't hide from it.\" **The ancestral spirit of the natural world comes visiting. \"It's not so much what the spirit wants as it is what the person wants,\" he says. \"The spirit sees", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:itk__13__crazy-healer.txt:5:7aff6afc1284", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12142, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "itk__13__crazy-healer.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "itk__13__crazy-healer", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "this situation so often in the United States because** \"most of the fabric of this country is made up of the energy of the machine, and the result of that is the disconnection and the severing of the past. You can run from the past, but you can't hide from it.\" **The ancestral spirit of the natural world comes visiting. \"It's not so much what the spirit wants as it is what the person wants,\" he says. \"The spirit sees in us a call for something grand, something that will make life meaningful, and so the spirit is responding to that.\" That call, which we don't even know we are making, reflects \"a strong longing for a profound connection, a connection that transcends materialism and possession of things and moves into a tangible cosmic dimension. Most of this longing is unconscious, but for spirits, conscious or unconscious doesn't make any difference.\" They respond to either. As part of the ritual to merge the mountain and human energy, those who are receiving the \"mountain energy\" are sent to a mountain area of their choice, where they pick up a stone that calls to them. They bring that stone back for the rest of the ritual and then keep it as a companion; some even carry it around with them. \"The presence of the stone does a lot in tuning the perceptive ability of the person,\" notes Dr. Somé. \"They receive all kinds of information that they can make use of, so it's like they get some tangible guidance from the other world as to how to live their life.\" When it is the \"river energy,\" those being called go to the river and, after speaking to the river spirit, find a water stone to bring back for the same kind of ritual as with the mountain spirit. **\"People think something extraordinary must be done in an extraordinary situation like this,\" he says. That's not usually the case. Sometimes it is as simple as carrying a stone.** **A Sacred Ritual Approach to Mental Illness** **One of the gifts a shaman can bring to the Western world is to help people rediscover ritual, which is so sadly lacking.** \"The abandonment of ritual can be devastating. From the spiritual view, ritual is inevitable and necessary if one is to live,\" Dr. Somé writes in *[Ritual: Power, Healing, and Community](http://www.amazon.com/Ritual-Power-Healing-Community-Compass/dp/0140195580/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1403805066&sr=1-3&keywords=malidoma+some).* \"To say that ritual is needed in the industrialized world is an understatement. We have seen in my own people that it is probably impossible to live a sane life without it.\" Dr. Somé did not feel that the rituals from his traditional village could simply be transferred to the West, so over his years of shamanic work here, he has designed rituals that meet the very different needs of this culture. Although the rituals change according to the individual or the group involved, he", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:itk__13__crazy-healer.txt:6:48ba87f4c7cb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12143, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "itk__13__crazy-healer.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "itk__13__crazy-healer", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "needed in the industrialized world is an understatement.

Although the rituals change according to the individual or the group involved, he finds that there is a need for certain rituals in general. One of these involves helping people discover that their distress is coming from the fact that they are \"called by beings from the other world to cooperate with them in doing healing work.\" Ritual allows them to move out of the distress and accept that calling. Another ritual need relates to initiation. In indigenous cultures all over the world, young people are initiated into adulthood when they reach a certain age. **The lack of such initiation in the West is part of the crisis that people are in here,** says Dr. Somé. He urges communities to bring together \"the creative juices of people who have had this kind of experience, in an attempt to come up with some kind of an alternative ritual that would at least begin to put a dent in this kind of crisis.\" Another ritual that repeatedly speaks to the needs of those coming to him for help entails making a bonfire, and then putting into the bonfire \"items that are symbolic of issues carried inside the individuals. It might be the issues of anger and frustration against an ancestor who has left a legacy of murder and enslavement or anything, things that the descendant has to live with,\" he explains. \"If these are approached as things that are blocking the human imagination, the person's life purpose, and even the person's view of life as something that can improve, then it makes sense to begin thinking in terms of how to turn that blockage into a roadway that can lead to something more creative and more fulfilling.\" The example of issues with an ancestors touches on rituals designed by Dr. Somé that address a serious dysfunction in Western society and in the process \"trigger enlightenment\" in participants. These are ancestral rituals, and the dysfunction they are aimed at is the mass turning-of-the-back on ancestors. Some of the spirits trying to come through, as described earlier, may be \"ancestors who want to merge with a descendant in an attempt to heal what they weren't able to do while in their physical body.\" **\"Unless the relationship between the living and the dead is in balance, chaos ensues,\"** he says. \"The Dagara believe that, if such an imbalance exists, it is the duty of the living to heal their ancestors.

If these ancestors are not healed, their sick energy will haunt the souls and psyches of those who are responsible for helping them.\" The rituals focus on healing the relationship with our ancestors, both specific issues of an individual ancestor and the larger cultural issues contained in our past. Dr. Somé has seen extraordinary healing occur at these rituals. Taking a sacred ritual approach to mental illness rather than regarding the person as a pathological case gives the person affected - and indeed the community at large - the opportunity to begin looking at it from that vantage point too, which leads to \"a whole plethora of opportunities and ritual initiative that can be very, very beneficial to everyone present,\" states. Dr. Somé. ** Note: **The above essay was copied from [this webpage](http://earthweareone.com/what-a-shaman-sees-in-a-mental-hospital/).

My life has been even more full and busy than normal. My best buddy died in January, my dad nearly died a few months later, I've met an amazing woman with whom I'll be working together, and much, much more. Because of all this, though I've thought many times about sending messages to this list, I have not found the time to do it. I'm sorry that I'm only now getting to this, and that even this message will be short. **The great book I want to most highly recommend is *Journey of Souls* by Michael Newton. **In this book, master hypnotherapist Michael Newton explains how initially he was skeptical of past lives. Yet after having numerous clients spontaneously revert to past lives in ways that not only were most vivid and moving, but more importantly that led to deep healing, Newton had to acknowledge reincarnation as a near certainty. He then discovered that the time between lives was often most fertile to understanding how souls prepared for each sojourn of incarnation on planet Earth. For over 30 years now, Newton has been intently exploring this amazing phenomenon of life between lives. It is by far the best book I've seen on the topic and helped me tremendously to understand things about myself, about life on the other side of the veil, and about my role here on Earth. If you have any interest in this topic, I think you will greatly appreciate Newton's huge contribution to this field of study. You can order a copy of his great book at [this link](http://www.amazon.com/Journey-Souls-Studies-Between-Lives/dp/1567184855/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1382671057&sr=8-1&keywords=journey+of+souls+by+michael+newton). **Two other books I've found to be incredibly profound and inspiring are Anita Moorjani's description of her powerfully transformative near-death experience in *[Dying to Be Me](http://www.amazon.com/Dying-Be-Me-Journey-Healing/dp/1401937519/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1382671341&sr=1-1&keywords=dying+to+be+me)*, and Robert Monroe's descriptions of his amazing discoveries during out of body experiences in *[Far Journeys](http://www.amazon.com/Far-Journeys-Robert-Monroe/dp/0385231822/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1382671379&sr=1-1&keywords=far+journeys+robert+monroe)*.

On top of that a trusted Internet contact I've known for years sent me some powerful information on a very high level Australian network of pedophiles. I continue to be very optimistic about our future, yet clearly I/we still have lots to learn and grow both individually and as a planet. I also have a special invitation only for this \"In the Know\" group. **With the most capable help of our Internet genious Andrey, we've set up a secure online forum designed so that only members of this group can join and communicate with others in complete privacy. **This may be particularly useful now, as I'd love to heartstorm with you how we can most effectively work together to expose and stop the Australian pedophile network I mentioned and transform the dark energy around this. First, let me give you more information on this network.** I ask you to at least skim through the essay I've posted online at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/sexabuse/australian-network). **In that essay, you will find solid, reliable information on a network of pedophiles that involves top Australian entertainers, politicians, and even the very police squad specifically designated to investigate pedophile crimes. You can find links to articles in top Australian media proving much of what is claimed at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/sexabuse/australian-network-all-media.shtml). This case is somewhat similar to the [Jimmy Savile pedophile case](https://www.WantToKnow.info//a.php?q=british-oversight-unit-says-police-failed-pursue-sex-accusations-against-savile) which is implicating top figures throughout England lately. Sadly, this case is not beng exposed like the Savile case in England. The key people once involved in exposing this Australian network were threatened sufficiently (one couple I know was even thrown in jail), that the investigation came to a halt back in 2006 despite huge amounts of indisputable evidence of the network. Powerful forces were able to shut this investigation down through intimidation and more. The courageous woman who wrote the essay at the link above and who spearheaded the investigation, Dr. Reina Michaelson, went into seclusion after serious threats and disruptions to her life. She now lives a quiet life in the countryside to avoid being in the crosshairs of those involved with this powerful network. So it's up to people like us to find a way to move this forward. If you read Dr. Michaelson's essay at the first link I mentioned above, you will see that pseudonyms were given for the real names in order to avoid libel lawsuits which put some of her friends in jail. **Through my network, I've been given the list of real names of top personalities involved in this ring.

I'd love to have a conversation with any interested from the \"In the Know\" group in our new private online forum about this. Let us heartstorm together about the best way to expose such information that will cause the least disruption in our lives, yet have a powerful impact in stopping all of the abuse. I particularly invite any Australian friends on this list to get involved. **If you choose not to join the conversation, I only ask that you at least spend a few minutes sending energetic support for what we are doing.** My deepest intention is to do everything possible to stop the destructive behavior, yet also to send love to the souls of those involved even as we do all we can to stop the abuse of children. Remember that we are all interconnected, and in our deepest core every one of us is divine and playing our role in this grand play. By remembering and strengthening the heart connection we share with all beings, we can create powerful transformation on our planet even as we do our very best to stop destructive behavior. If it feels right, you can even join me in inviting the souls of those involved in this network to open to how we might work with them to expose this in a way that is most empowering to all involved. No one is the enemy here, yet part of transforming our world here involves exposing and stopping destructive behavior like this whenever we can.

I very much enjoy exploring the many ways like Bikram that I have found help me get to a beautiful state of greater awareness where I can viscerally feel my interconnectedness with all beings. Enjoy this thought-provoking exploration. Wishing you and all of us abundant love, inspiration, and joy, Fred March 23, 2013 ** On Consciousness, the Universal Field, and the Veil Between the Worlds** The consciousness of each one of us is a unique, yet integral part of an infinite field of interconnected vibration. Each of us is playing a distinct and vital role in the ever-expanding exploration of all that is possible as part of this universal field of vibration in this forever unfolding moment of now. Though we may at times feel separate from all that is around us, the more we open to our connection with this mystical field of limitless possibility, the more we can embrace our infinite potential as magnificent, creative expressions of the universe. The collective intelligence of the universe appears to have created a veil which serves to greatly limit the awareness of our individuated consciousness on incarnating into this time-space world. On passing through the veil and taking on a human body, we forget who we are. We lose awareness that on the most expanded levels we are always connected with everything around us. We forget the limitless potential that is always available both within and outside of ourselves. **Yet even though we may have forgotten our magnificence, our incarnation into this physical reality and the accompanying loss of awareness of our divine heritage serves a greater purpose. By becoming unconscious of our greater role and our interconnectedness with All That Is, we are able to explore realms which might not otherwise be accessible. ** This deeper purpose can be quite difficult to comprehend while our consciousness is housed here in limited physical bodies which focus our awareness largely on only three dimensions and five senses out of the limitless possibilities available. Due to this veiling process, our thinking and experience of life on Earth tends to be consumed with the more limited realities immediately surrounding us. Yet when we die and our consciousness is released from the body and this physical plane, we pass back to the other side of the veil where it is possible to view the Earthly lives we just lived from a [highly expanded vantage point](https://www.WantToKnow.info/neardeathexperience). With the veil removed, our awareness expands far beyond the confines of this time-space world and suddenly everything in the lives we", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:itk__13__veil_consciousness_universal_field.txt:0:f0a5bc783527", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12152, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "itk__13__veil_consciousness_universal_field.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "itk__13__veil_consciousness_universal_field", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "on Earth tends to be consumed with the more limited realities immediately surrounding us.

With the veil removed, our awareness expands far beyond the confines of this time-space world and suddenly everything in the lives we just lived makes sense. This side of the veil seems to function in such a way that the external is a reflection of the internal. There is an ever-unfolding perfect balance between the two. That said, it appears there may be a time lag between a shift in internal awareness and its reflection on the outside likely due to the linear quality of time here. **The more conscious we choose to become of [the mirroring](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#gratitude) of the internal and external worlds, the more easily we are able to surrender to the deeper meaning and realities of life and from that place do our part in [bringing heaven down here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/consciousnessparadigms#descent). ** **Thoughts and Feelings Matter** **Every thought and emotion that arises within us radiates both inward and outward as a distinct energy form.** In other words, every thought and every feeling we have emanates out to the world and into ourselves as an energetic vibration. These energy forms then interact with those around us and with the entire field of collective consciousness. On some level, we are also picking up on the combined thought and feeling forms or vibrations of everyone and all that is around us. Yet [we always have choice](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/ttcourse03a) in how we respond to what enters our energetic space and awareness. When an energetic form from outside of us enters our space, if there is no resonance with anything in our energetic field, it simply passes through us. We don't notice it and go on unchanged from the state of consciousness we were in before it passed through. When, however, there is some resonance (or resistance) in our energetic field, this form then affects us. The amount we are affected depends on the strength of the form and how much our energetic field is in resonance or in resistance to this energetic form. Most people are constantly affected by thought and emotion forms from outside of themselves. When someone walking down the street gives us a dirty look, an energy form is created and enters our awareness. When we perceive this, if we are super busy or feeling very confident of ourselves, we might hardly notice it. Yet someone who has deep inferiority issues might take that same energy form in and interpret it as further proof that they are inferior. **[How we interpret](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/victim_or_creator_vs) and respond to the energy forms that enter our space makes all the difference", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:itk__13__veil_consciousness_universal_field.txt:1:f0100af0be0d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12153, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "itk__13__veil_consciousness_universal_field.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "itk__13__veil_consciousness_universal_field", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "someone walking down the street gives us a dirty look, an energy form is created and enters our awareness.

Yet on an energetic level they are manifestations of collective thought forms. Take a car for example. Any car you see once started as a creative thought form in someone's mind. This thought form was shared with others. A team of people then added their thoughts to further refine the original thought form. This collective design process eventually refined that original thought form of the car until it became a completed model or blueprint on paper. The blueprint was then sent to a factory where this inscribed collective thought form was actually produced to become the physical form that you see out on the street. And for every car out there, the person who bought it felt an internal resonance with both the style and price of the car which caused them to eventually buy it. This is an example of how every car is the physical manifestation of a collective of thought forms. **Could it be that in the same way, thought forms create everything in physical reality on this side of the veil? **Consider that the Earth itself may be an expression or creation of the combined thought forms of humanity and all beings involved with the planet. And each of us may on an energetic level be a co-creation resulting from the thought forms of all around us interacting with our unique consciousness. **Could it be that through this energetic process of manifestation, we all co-create each other through our projections and interpretations of ourselves and each other?** I suspect that the more conscious we become of this divine co-creative process, the more easy it is to surrender to the divine mystery of life, and from that place of surrender to powerfully create into the unknown. **My Journey Into the Mystery** I love opening to the fluid state of energetic interconnectedness I feel beneath this three-dimensional physical reality. On opening to the flowing sacred vibrations which connect all of us in that state, I feel rejuvenated.

When this happens, I can see your individuated, physical body on the outside while at the same time I feel beneath the physical form our interconnectedness with each other and with all of existence. In that place, I experience no physical separation between us. **The veil creates apparent separation on the outside, yet as I explore these mysteries from this side of the veil, I'm finding I am increasingly able to come back to that place deep inside where I know without doubt that we are all always connected. This very much helps to keep everything in a greater perspective in my life.** For my entire adult life, I've had an unwavering commitment to [what's best for all beings](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#whatsbest). I've also had a strong [desire to know](https://www.WantToKnow.info/) how life works on all levels. I feel that it is thanks to both of these that I've been privileged to see and experience some of the incredible mysteries of the deepest levels of the universe, and to explore how individuated consciousness interacts with collective consciousness and the infinite fields of energy which make up our universe. For this, I am incredibly grateful. And I'm more than happy to share what I've discovered with any who are interested, and to learn from you and others about your explorations into life and the universe. I so enjoy learning, growing, and co-creating with you and with all of us in this grand divine mystery. **Co-creating a Map of Transformation Beyond the Veil** When I'm fully experiencing the other side of the veil, my interconnectedness with the universe is very clear and unquestioned. Yet on my journeys there, I have also seen other souls from this planet consciously exploring these realms. They, too, were finding ways to pierce the veil and enter a state of multidimensional interconnectedness. And we saw each other there and were excited to feel our conscious connection beyond the veil. I have no doubt that an ever increasing number of us exploring those realms are consciously co-creating a [web of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:itk__13__veil_consciousness_universal_field.txt:3:629b06fd2959", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12155, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "itk__13__veil_consciousness_universal_field.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "itk__13__veil_consciousness_universal_field", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "interconnectedness with the universe is very clear and unquestioned.

The more of us who join in doing this, the more that beautiful web crystallizes. And the more it crystallizes, the more it's brilliance and allure can reach those mired in the veil back home. It's as if we're weaving this web together to create a map of transformation that anyone can use to find their way to these expanded states of bliss. Ever more souls are choosing to reach beyond the veil and experience interconnectedness on a soul level. We are gradually discovering that our true home can be right here and right now. And we are creating and crystalizing a growing network of individuals who are present in this three-dimensional world, yet fully conscious of our interdependence and interconnectedness. We are laying down paths that anyone can follow to journey beyond the veil and connect up with this awesome network of expanded consciousness. **This is the map of transformation that we are co-creating. The paths are there, and all are invited. It's up to each one of us whether or not we accept the invitation, and how far down this path we want to travel. I invite you to come play with us in this beautiful and expanded state, where we fully know and experience our divine interconnectedness, and then to bring that state back into our normal lives.

I have been incredibly busy with managing and upgrading the websites, personal relationships, a motorcycle accident, Tod's death, and so much more. It's been frustrating being so busy, yet life has also been quite rich, so in the big picture I am still grateful for everything that happens in my life. I still have a lot to learn about managing busyness. I apologize for not having a few more messages for you, and at the same time, as I continue to be so busy now, I cannot say how long it will be before I send another to you. For today, I want to share some intriguing explorations I've written down related to the formless and formful aspects of consciousness, and how the veil plays a key role in all of this. I know that on some level this is simply mental musing, yet I suspect that for some of you, like me, this stuff is endlessly fascinating and meaningful. Once a year I do what I call a sleep fast, where I don't sleep at all for two nights. I find this puts me into an altered state which is both fascinating and opens me to greater awareness than normal. I wrote the below essay on consciousness and the veil on May 16th this year, the morning after I finally slept for 12 hours after my two-day sleep fast. Take what works for you and leave the rest. And thanks so much for all your support of my work. Wishing you and all of us abundant love, inspiration, and joy, Fred Burks June 6, 2015 **Note:** To find this message online, click here.

Both the universe and each of us have a formless and a formful aspect. The form we humans inhabit is a physical body composed of trillions of cells which all function together to support the formless individuated consciousness which gives life to our bodies. The form through which the universe expresses is this three-dimensional reality collectively composed of gazillions of physical beings and things which all function together to support the formless aspect of the universe - the collective consciousness of All That is, which can also be called God or the Divine. Each of us inhabits the form of a physical body, which is like one cell within the physical expression of the divine. Yet we are also a formless consciousness, which in some mysterious way is like one cell within", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:itk__veil-consciousness.txt:0:a2a7b43c5744", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12159, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "itk__veil-consciousness.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "itk__veil-consciousness", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "this three-dimensional reality collectively composed of gazillions of physical beings and things which all function together to support the formless aspect of the universe - the collective consciousness of All That is, which can also be called God or the Divine.

Yet we are also a formless consciousness, which in some mysterious way is like one cell within the greater consciousness of All That Is within this grand cosmic play of life. \"The soul is a composite of forms and the formless that is unified in one energy, one consciousness. When the fragments are aligned and interconnected, the soul becomes the instrument that facilitates this divine expansion. Thus, the soul does not ascend from the physical world, but rather coalesces into a state of wholeness whereby its transformed expression can assist in the expansion, or in a different context, the descent of the Divine into the world.\" ~~ [WingMakers](https://www.WantToKnow.info/consciousnessparadigms#descent) Our formless consciousness controls the major movements of our physical body. Simply by willing it, we can turn our head to the left or right or move our arm to scratch our nose. Yet countless unconscious processes are transpiring each moment to keep our body alive and functioning - to keep our heart beating, our liver functioning, and to feed each cell what it needs in order to play its role in keeping our bodies alive and healthy. It's as if all these unconscious processes are conspiring (con+spire=breathing together) to keep us alive. The plethora of unconscious processes transpiring every moment in our formful bodies are continually conspiring to support our formless conscious selves so that we can function in this physical world in which we find ourselves immersed. Breathing is one of the few bodily processes that is naturally regulated by unconscious functions, yet over which we also have conscious control. Though we cannot stop our hearts from beating or our liver or kidney from functioning, simply by an act of will we can stop, slow down, or speed up our breathing. Yet we can only hold our breath so long before unconscious processes force us to start breathing again. Could this be a key reason why breathing practices are used in many spiritual traditions to achieve expanded states of consciousness? Could it be that in the beginning, the formless Divine (aka God) in its initial explorations of the possibilities of existence somehow divided itself to create individuated cells of consciousness? At first, all of these cells were in constant and direct communication with each other and with the greater consciousness from which they were created. Yet to explore more deeply into all the infinite possibilities of being, the Divine at some point created a great number of cells with amnesic barriers so that they could have greater", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:itk__veil-consciousness.txt:1:77b73450a896", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12160, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "itk__veil-consciousness.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "itk__veil-consciousness", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the formless Divine (aka God) in its initial explorations of the possibilities of existence somehow divided itself to create individuated cells of consciousness?

Yet to explore more deeply into all the infinite possibilities of being, the Divine at some point created a great number of cells with amnesic barriers so that they could have greater autonomy and free will to choose independent of its will. Collectively, the amnesic barrier for all of these cells is like a veil of unconsciousness that created the possibility of formless consciousness inhabiting a formful physical world which appears for most conscious beings living in it to be divorced from the realms of the divine. In a few of my most profound sacred medicine experiences where I have completely left this physical reality, I have experienced a profound fear that if I allow the veil or amnesic barrier to completely dissolve, the whole game of physical reality that was created will collapse on itself and lose it's beautiful quality of creating real drama which allows for deep exploration of realms which would never otherwise be possible. Yet at the same time, I have an unquenchable desire to know and understand the divine realms and how they interface with the physical realm in which my waking consciousness resides as I write this. What I've come to realize from these experiences of greatly expanded consciousness is that I continue to very much want to grow and expand in wisdom by thinning the veils of unconsciousness which appear to keep me separate from the more expanded divine realms. Yet I'm not ready for this to go too fast. I'm not ready for the instant enlightenment offered to me in those most expanded realms which both tantalizes and terrifies me. I am very clear that I want my formless consciousness to enjoy each moment of this experience of inhabiting this physical realm as I continually move with the intention of opening to ever more understanding and ever more expanded awareness of All That Is. Yet I also want to find the right and best pace for this mysterious process of piercing the veil. What I know is that I trust the divine and spiritual beings and forces much more expanded than my own limited consciousness in guiding me to whatever best serves all of us. I continually surrender to the mysteries of life even as I use my will and wisdom to powerfully create into the unknown.

But this is where we are first greeted outside Kohei Minato's workshop by Nobue Minato, the wife of the inventor and co-director of the family firm. The workshop itself is like a Hollywood set of an inventor's garage. Electrical machines, wires, measuring instruments and batteries are strewn everywhere. Along the diagram-covered walls are drill presses, racks of spare coils, Perspex plating and other paraphernalia. And seated in the back, head bowed in thought, is the 58-year-old techno maestro himself. Minato is no newcomer to the limelight. In fact, he has been an entertainer for most of his life, making music and producing his daughter's singing career in the US. He posseses an oversized presence, with a booming voice and a long ponytail. In short, you can easily imagine him onstage or in a convertible cruising down the coast of California -- not hunched over a mass of wires and coils in Tokyo's cramped backstreets. Joining us are a middle-aged banker and his entourage from Osaka and accounting and finance consultant Yukio Funai. The banker is doing a quick review for an investment, while the rest of us just want to see if Minato's magnetic motors really work. A prototype car air conditioner cooler sitting on a bench looks like it would fit into a Toyota Corolla and quickly catches our attention. **Seeing is believing ** Nobue then takes us through the functions and operations of each of the machines, starting off with a simple explanation of the laws of magnetism and repulsion. She demonstrates the \"Minato Wheel\" by kicking a magnet-lined rotor into action with a magnetic wand. Looking carefully at the rotor, we see that it has over 16 magnets embedded on a slant -- apparently to make Minato's machines work, the positioning and angle of the magnets is critical. After she kicks the wheel into life, it keeps spinning, proving at least that the design doesn't suffer from magnetic lockup. She then moves us to the next device, a weighty machine connected to a tiny battery.

Suddenly, a power source of 16 watts or so is driving a device that should be drawing at least 200 to 300 watts.

He worked directly with the heads of the World Bank, IMF, and other global financial institutions. He quit this work in the 1980s because morally and ethically, he felt it was wrong to play such a key role in creating world empire at the expense of the less advantaged around the world. After being persuaded and even bribed not to write a book about his experiences, Perkins states, \"When 9/11 struck, I had a change of heart.\" The book, *Confessions of an Economic Hitman*, spent many weeks on amazon.com's bestseller list and has been widely acclaimed. Below is a summary of this landmark book and ideas on how you can help to build a brighter future for us all. **Note: **Watch an excellent, engaging two-minute [video summary](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/economic_hitman) of Perkins' story. **General Overview** *Confessions of an Economic Hit Man* is John Perkins' fast-paced autobiography, which reveals his career as an economist for an international consulting firm. **Perkins says he was actually an \"Economic Hit Man.\" His job was to convince countries that are strategically important to the United States to accept enormous loans for infrastructure development and to make sure that the lucrative projects were contracted to U.S. corporations.** Perkins takes the reader through his career and explains how he created economic projections for countries to accept billions of dollars in loans they surely couldn't afford. He shares his battle with his conscience over these actions and offers advice for how Americans can work to end these practices which have directly resulted in terrorist attacks and animosity towards the United States. **What Is An Economic Hit Man?** **Perkins defines economic hit men as \"highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars. They funnel money from the World Bank, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other foreign 'aid' organizations into the coffers of huge corporations and the pockets of a few wealthy families who control the planet's natural resources. ** Their tools include fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortion, sex, and murder. They play a game as old as empire, but one that has taken on new and terrifying dimensions during this time of globalization.\" In Perkins' case, he was hired as an economist for the international consulting firm of [Chas. T. Main](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chas._T._Main), Inc. (MAIN). He was told in confidential meetings with \"special consultant\" to the company Claudine Martin that he had two primary objectives: He was supposed to justify huge loans for countries. These loans would be for major engineering and construction projects, which were to be", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:johnperkinseconomichitman.txt:0:49f7f6af8de2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12166, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "johnperkinseconomichitman.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "johnperkinseconomichitman", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "as empire, but one that has taken on new and terrifying dimensions during this time of globalization.\" In Perkins' case, he was hired as an economist for the international consulting firm of [Chas. T. Main](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chas._T._Main), Inc. (MAIN). He was told in confidential meetings with \"special consultant\" to the company Claudine Martin that he had two primary objectives: He was supposed to justify huge loans for countries. These loans would be for major engineering and construction projects, which were to be carried out by MAIN and other U.S. companies such as Bechtel, Halliburton, Stone & Webster and Brown & Root. He was supposed to help bankrupt the countries that received these loans after the U.S. companies involved had been paid. This would make sure that these countries would remain in debt to their creditors and would then be easy targets when the U.S. needed favors such as military bases, UN votes and access to natural resources like oil. Perkins' job was to produce economic growth projections that would make the case for a variety of major projects. If the U.S. decided to lend a country money, Perkins would compare the economic benefits of different projects such as power plants or telecommunications systems. He would then produce reports that showed the economic growth the country would experience due to these projects. These economic growth projections needed to be high enough to justify the loans. Otherwise, the loans would be denied. The gross national product (GNP) was always the most important factor in these economic projections. The project expected to increase the GNP the most would be chosen. In the cases where there was only one project under consideration, it needed to be shown that the project would greatly benefit the GNP. **Luckily for the economic hit man, GNP figures can be quite deceptive. \"For instance, the growth of GNP may result even when it profits only one person, such as an individual who owns a utility company, while the majority of the population is burdened with debt.\"** All of these projects were meant to make huge profits for the contractors. The U.S. engineering and construction companies involved would be assured of great wealth. At the same time, a few wealthy families and influential leaders in the receiving countries would become very happy and very rich thanks to these loans. The leaders of these countries would also have bolstered political power because they were credited with bringing industrial parks, power plants and airports to their people. **The problem is that these countries simply cannot handle the debt of these loans and their poorest citizens are deprived of health, education and other social services for several decades as these countries struggle economically to overcome their huge debts.** Meanwhile, the huge American media conglomerates portray these projects as favors being provided by the United States. American citizens in general have no trouble believing these messages,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:johnperkinseconomichitman.txt:1:1ced268c7f06", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12167, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "johnperkinseconomichitman.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "johnperkinseconomichitman", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "were credited with bringing industrial parks, power plants and airports to their people. **The problem is that these countries simply cannot handle the debt of these loans and their poorest citizens are deprived of health, education and other social services for several decades as these countries struggle economically to overcome their huge debts.** Meanwhile, the huge American media conglomerates portray these projects as favors being provided by the United States. American citizens in general have no trouble believing these messages, and in fact are led to perceive that these actions are unselfish acts of international goodwill. Ultimately, due to the large debts, the U.S. is able to draw on these countries for political, economic and military favors whenever desired. And of course, the U.S. corporations involved with the expensive projects become extremely wealthy. **The U.S. Government's Role ** Economic hit men [EHM] don't actually work for a United States government organization such as the Central Intelligence Agency. The risk with such a direct association is obvious. For example, if an EHM was working to put a country in debt to the U.S. with the main reason being for favorable military and political positions against the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union would be quite likely to take military action against the U.S. if that EHM were found to be working for the U.S. government. In the 1960s, America found a way to use economic hitmen without directly implicating Washington. It was during the 1960s that we saw the empowerment of international corporations and multinational organizations such as the World Bank. This allowed for governments, corporations and multinational organizations to form mutually beneficial relationships. United States intelligence agencies were able to use these relationships to their advantage. Government organizations such as the National Security Agency (NSA) were now able to screen for potential economic hitmen (as they did with Perkins) and then have them hired by international corporations such as MAIN. **\"These economic hitmen would never be paid by the government; instead, they would draw their salaries from the private sector. As a result, their dirty work, if exposed, would be chalked up to corporate greed rather than to government policy.** In addition, the corporations that hired them, although paid by government agencies and their multinational banking counterparts (with taxpayer money), would be insulated from congressional oversight and public scrutiny, shielded by a growing body of legal initiatives, including trademark, international trade, and Freedom of Information laws.\" **Perkins' Story of Being Recruited as an Economic Hit Man ** Perkins married a former college classmate in 1967. A good friend of her father's, referred to as \"Uncle Frank\", was a top-echelon executive at the NSA. Uncle Frank immediately took a liking to Perkins and informed him that a job with the NSA would make him eligible for draft deferment, meaning he could avoid fighting in the Vietnam War.

A good friend of her father's, referred to as \"Uncle Frank\", was a top-echelon executive at the NSA. Uncle Frank immediately took a liking to Perkins and informed him that a job with the NSA would make him eligible for draft deferment, meaning he could avoid fighting in the Vietnam War. After extensive interviews with the NSA, Perkins was offered a job, but declined it to instead join the Peace Corps. Surprisingly, Uncle Frank supported this decision, largely because it meant that Perkins would have the opportunity to go to Ecuador and live with the indigenous people of the Amazon region. It was with the Peace Corps in Ecuador when a vice president of Chas. T. Main, Inc. approached Perkins about working for MAIN. The man explained that he sometimes acted as an NSA liaison, which made this job opportunity a perfect fit for Perkins, who had intended on accepting the NSA job when his Peace Corps tour was over. Upon returning to the U.S., Perkins was hired as an economist for MAIN. He was told that MAIN's primary business was engineering, but that their biggest client, the World Bank, had insisted that the company keep economists employed in order to produce the \"critical economic forecasts used to determine the feasibility and magnitude of engineering projects.\" Shortly after being hired, Perkins was trained confidentially by Claudine Martin, a special consultant to MAIN. It was Martin who explained to Perkins what his real job was. It was Martin who explained that he was now an \"Economic Hit Man\" and that once he accepted this job, he could never leave it. **Indonesia ** Perkins' first assignment took him took to Indonesia. Indonesia was an oil-rich country and had been described as \"the most heavily populated piece of real estate on the planet.\" Perkins' job was to produce very optimistic economic forecasts for the country, showing that by building new power plants and distribution lines, the country's economy would explode. These projections would allow USAID and international banks to justify huge loans for the country, which would then be paid to U.S. corporations to build the projects. In 1971, Indonesia had become even more important to the U.S. in its battle against Communism. Potential withdrawl from Vietnam had the U.S. worried about a domino effect of one country after another falling under Communist rule. Indonesia was viewed as the key. **If the U.S. could gain control of Indonesia (with the debts that would incur thanks to the loans for these huge projects), they believed it would help ensure American dominance in Southeast Asia. ** While spending three months in Indonesia to conduct interviews and study the economic potential for the country, Perkins was exposed to the drastic discrepancy between", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:johnperkinseconomichitman.txt:3:85902c565822", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12169, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "johnperkinseconomichitman.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "johnperkinseconomichitman", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "U.S. worried about a domino effect of one country after another falling under Communist rule. Indonesia was viewed as the key. **If the U.S. could gain control of Indonesia (with the debts that would incur thanks to the loans for these huge projects), they believed it would help ensure American dominance in Southeast Asia. ** While spending three months in Indonesia to conduct interviews and study the economic potential for the country, Perkins was exposed to the drastic discrepancy between the wealthy and the extremely poor in Indonesia. While there were certainly signs of a striving economy with first-class hotels and mansions, Perkins also personally saw the tragic side of Indonesia where women and children bathed in wretched, sewer-filled water and beggars packed the streets. He also met some of the country's native citizens and learned of their resentment of American greed and extravagance in the face of their starving children. These close encounters with the Indonesians created a struggle of conscience for Perkins. He wondered if American capitalism was really the answer for the people of Indonesia. He wondered if the population as a whole would really benefit from the infrastructures the U.S. wanted to build in Indonesia, or would it only be a wealthy few who became even wealthier while the rest of the country became more entrenched in poverty and became even more anti-American? While conducting his studies in Indonesia, Perkins was encouraged by his superiors to create strong forecasts for economic growth. He was told that growth rates of 17 percent per annum were expected. Also providing economic forecasts for MAIN was an older employee named Howard Parker. Parker told Perkins not to be pressured by his superiors, he told him not to buy into the game, not to create unrealistic projections. He told Perkins that the electrification project could not create economic growth rates of more than 7-9 percent. Conversations with Parker led to more conscience battles for Perkins. Ultimately, he told himself that the decision wasn't really his to make, it would be up to his bosses and they could simply choose between his high economic forecast and Parker's lower forecast. **When the final projections were presented to the executives at MAIN, Perkins' figures pleased his bosses with 17-20 percent growth rate projections while Parker's forecast came in at eight percent. Parker was promptly fired and Perkins was promoted to Chief Economist at MAIN and received a nice raise.** **Panama ** In 1972, Perkins was sent to Panama to close the deal on MAIN's master development plan with the country. \"This plan would create a justification for World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and USAID investment of billions of dollars in the energy, transportation, and agricultural sectors of this tiny and very crucial country. **It was, of course, a subterfuge, a means of making Panama forever indebted and thereby returning to its puppet status.\" **", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:johnperkinseconomichitman.txt:4:f9e0e650e743", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12170, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "johnperkinseconomichitman.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "johnperkinseconomichitman", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "and received a nice raise.** **Panama ** In 1972, Perkins was sent to Panama to close the deal on MAIN's master development plan with the country. \"This plan would create a justification for World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and USAID investment of billions of dollars in the energy, transportation, and agricultural sectors of this tiny and very crucial country. **It was, of course, a subterfuge, a means of making Panama forever indebted and thereby returning to its puppet status.\" ** Again, Perkins experienced the enormous differences between the wealthy and the poor. However, in Panama, the differences were most extreme in one area, the Canal Zone. In the Canal Zone, Americans lived in beautiful homes and enjoyed golf courses and first class shopping. Just outside of the Canal Zone, Panamanians lived in wooden shacks and among overflowing sewage. These harsh differences created high levels of animosity between the Americans living in the Canal Zone and the natives of Panama. It was not uncommon to see graffiti messages demanding that the U.S. leave Panama. On his trip, Perkins met with Panama's president and charismatic leader, Omar Torrijos. Perkins was very impressed with Torrijos and became friends with the leader. Torrijos was well aware of the EHM practices and knew fully how the game was played. He knew that he could become a very wealthy man by cooperating with the U.S. companies that wanted to build their projects in his country, but he worried about Panama losing its independence and not taking care of its many citizens living in poverty. Torrijos made a peculiar deal with Perkins and MAIN. He wanted Panama to take back control of the Panama Canal and in doing so he wanted to build a more efficient canal, a sea-level one without locks that would allow for bigger ships. The Japanese, the Canal's biggest clients, would be interested in financing this construction, which would anger Bechtel Group, Inc. Bechtel was a company closely connected to Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush. Omar Torrijos was concerned that these actions might send the wrong signals internationally. He wanted to make sure that Panama was recognized as an independent country and was not dictated by Russia, China or Cuba. He did not want Panama to be perceived as against the United States. Instead, he wanted it known that they were simply protecting the rights of the poor. Torrijos did want to invest in huge advancement projects in electricity, transportation and communications for Panama, but he wanted to make certain that these projects benefited his entire country, including those living in extreme poverty. To do so would require huge amounts of money from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. Torrijos worried that his commitment to taking back the Canal would anger the top people at Bechtel so much that it would make it nearly impossible to achieve his", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:johnperkinseconomichitman.txt:5:d14a677460be", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12171, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "johnperkinseconomichitman.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "johnperkinseconomichitman", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "want to invest in huge advancement projects in electricity, transportation and communications for Panama, but he wanted to make certain that these projects benefited his entire country, including those living in extreme poverty.

Torrijos worried that his commitment to taking back the Canal would anger the top people at Bechtel so much that it would make it nearly impossible to achieve his plans for these projects. So, Torrijos made a deal with Perkins and MAIN. He told Perkins that if he could secure the financing for these projects, MAIN could have all the work they wanted on this master development plan. Perkins agreed to the deal and would do Torrijos' bidding. **Saudi Arabia ** In response to the power of the international oil companies, which collaborated to hold down petroleum prices, a group of oil-producing countries formed OPEC in the 1960s. The huge impact OPEC was capable of became evident to the world with the 1973 oil embargo. This embargo was a result of the United States' support of Israel when Egypt and Syria launched attacks on the country. As the U.S. provided Israel with more financial aid, Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil producing countries imposed a total embargo on oil shipments to the U.S. While the embargo was short-lived, its impact was huge as Saudi oil prices jumped from $1.39 per barrel on January 1, 1970 to $8.32 on January 1, 1974. As a result, Wall Street and Washington became obsessed with protecting American oil supplies and the U.S. was forced to recognize Saudi Arabia's importance to its economy. \"For Saudi Arabia, the additional oil income resulting from the price hikes was a mixed blessing.\" Suddenly, the country's conservative religious beliefs were being replaced with a sense of materialism. Washington recognized this movement and negotiated with Saudi Arabia for assurance that there would never again be an oil embargo from the country. The result of these negotiations was the United States-Saudi Arabian Joint Economic Commission, known as JECOR. **The unprecedented agreement was the opposite of the norm, where countries had to borrow from the U.S. until it could never get out of that debt. Instead, this agreement relied on Saudi Arabia's own money to hire American firms to build up the country. ** The U.S. wanted Saudi Arabia to guarantee to maintain oil supplies at prices that would be acceptable to the U.S. and its allies. Due to Saudi Arabia's vast petroleum supplies, this guarantee would protect the U.S. even if other countries threatened oil embargos. **In exchange for the guarantee, the U.S. offered the House of Saud a commitment to provide complete political and military support (this would guarantee that the royal family would continue to rule in Saudi Arabia).** The condition would be that the Saudis buy U.S.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:johnperkinseconomichitman.txt:6:ce1a9d3a6a49", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12172, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "johnperkinseconomichitman.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "johnperkinseconomichitman", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "to maintain oil supplies at prices that would be acceptable to the U.S. and its allies.

Perkins was brought in as an adviser in the early stages of these negotiations. His job was \"to develop forecasts of what might happen in Saudi Arabia if vast amounts of money were invested in its infrastructure, and to map out scenarios for spending that money.\" He was told that not only would this job result in huge profits for MAIN, but that it was also a matter of national security. This job was different for Perkins as the final objective was not to burden Saudi Arabia with debts it could never repay, but instead to \"assure that a large portion of petrodollars found their way back to the United States.\" Basically, MAIN and other U.S. corporations needed to convince Saudi Arabia of the importance and benefits of transforming their country to a more modern nation. This would ultimately make Saudi Arabia more dependent on U.S. corporations and make U.S. corporations extremely wealthy. For his part, Perkins convinced a key player within the House of Saud, a man he calls Prince W., that these projects would benefit his country as well as him personally. Perkins was able to eventually persuade Prince W. by arranging for a beautiful prostitute to live with him. **By arranging for the prostitute to live with Prince W., Perkins was able to gain his trust and eventually convinced him of the value of the deal. **The entire package was finally approved by the royal family of Saudi Arabia and MAIN was rewarded with one of the first highly lucrative contracts, which was actually administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. **\"The deal between the United States and Saudi Arabia transformed the kingdom practically overnight.\" It also marked the beginning of an ongoing relationship between the House of Saud, [the bin Laden family and the Bush family](https://www.WantToKnow.info/030316post), which benefited greatly from a financial standpoint thanks to the deal. ** **Struggling with His Conscience** Perkins saw his career take off as he was promoted again and became the youngest partner in the history of MAIN. He would go on to head major projects all over the world while taking home a huge salary.

However, Perkins could not stop struggling with his conscience over the negative outcomes he believed he was causing as an EHM. In 1978 and 1979, the consequences of EHM empire building became clear to Perkins by what he saw happen in Iran. While the U.S. had supported the shah, the results had led to class wars and passionate animosity towards the \"corporatocracy\" being implemented in Iran. Perkins had seen this hostility first-hand in several of the countries where he had helped to create similar situations with his EHM practices. Citizens of these countries hated U.S. policy and blamed it for their corrupt leaders and despotic government. In Iran, the situation escalated and led to the shah fleeing the country for his own safety and Iranians storming the U.S. Embassy and taking 52 hostages. It was then that Perkins fully realized that \"the United States is a nation laboring to deny the truth about its imperialist role in the world\" and he became overwhelmed with guilt over his role in this global movement. **Perkins sank into a depression and quit his job at MAIN in 1980.** **The Impact of the Economic Hit man Continues** Perkins would continue to be haunted by the impact of economic hitmen even as he started his own company (a company that committed to producing environmentally friendly electricity), did special consulting for MAIN and other corporations, and became involved with nonprofit organizations and their efforts to work with and help indigenous people in Latin America. In 1981, Perkins became deeply disturbed by the death of his friend and the leader of Panama, Omar Torrijos. **Perkins believes that his friend Torrijos' death in a plane crash was a CIA assassination because of his positions on the Panama Canal (Torrijos had achieved his goal of taking back the Canal) and his unwillingness to cooperate with American corporations.** Torrijos was replaced by Manuel Noriega, who \"became a symbol of corruption and decadence.\" Eventually, in 1989, the United States attacked Panama. The reigns of power were returned to the pre-Torrijos oligarchy, which had served as U.S. puppets from the time when Panama was torn from Columbia until Torrijos took over. Perkins also watched closely throughout the '80s and '90s as the U.S. tried to get Iraq and Saddam Hussein to buy into the EHM scenario as Saudi Arabia had done before. Hussein refused and when he invaded Kuwait, the U.S. wasted little time and attacked Iraq.

Hussein refused and when he invaded Kuwait, the U.S. wasted little time and attacked Iraq. The economic hitmen failed again in their efforts following the invasion of Iraq and in 2003, the U.S. invaded Iraq once again. Perkins began to write *Confessions of an Economic Hit Man* on several occasions, but stopped due to bribes or threats. But after 9/11, Perkins knew he could no longer wait and felt he had to expose these practices and the devastating consequences they create. **What to Do Now** **Perkins now spends his life trying to educate people about the role of the economic hit man and how we can end their practices and achieve more global peace and prosperity by transforming our institutions.** He believes \"we have convinced ourselves that all economic growth benefits humankind, and that the greater the growth, the more widespread the benefits.\" We must realize that the American capitalism we are trying to push on other countries may not be what's best for the rest of the world. We can't just blame this movement on a conspiracy. \"The empire depends on the efficacy of big banks, corporations, and governments - the corporatocracy. This corporatocracy is ourselves - we make it happen - which, of course, is why most of us find it difficult to stand up and oppose it. We cannot bring ourselves to bite the hand of the master who feeds us.\" ** Perkins offers several ways to help stop \"the corporatocracy and to end this insane and self-destructive march to global empire.\" ** Read between the lines of each and every media report and help others do the same.

How can I help our children understand that people who live gluttonous, unbalanced lives should be pitied but never, ever emulated, even if those people present themselves, through the media they control, as cultural icons and try to convince us that penthouses and yachts bring happiness?

My brother Kevin thinks God lives under his bed. At least that's what I heard him say one night. He was praying out loud in his dark bedroom, and I stopped outside his closed door to listen. \"Are you there, God?\" he said. \"Where are you? Oh, I see. Under the bed.\" I giggled softly and tiptoed off to my own room. Kevin's unique perspectives are often a source of amusement. But that night something else lingered long after the humor. I realized for the first time the very different world Kevin lives in. Kevin was born 30 years ago, mentally disabled as a result of difficulties during labor. Apart from his size (6-foot-2), there are few ways in which he is an adult. He reasons and communicates with the capabilities of a 7-year-old, and he always will. He will probably always believe that God lives under his bed, that Santa Claus is the one who fills the space under our tree every Christmas, and that airplanes stay up in the sky because angels carry them. I remember wondering if Kevin realizes he is different. Is he ever dissatisfied with his monotonous life? Up before dawn each day, off to work at a workshop for the disabled, home to walk our cocker spaniel, return to eat his favorite macaroni-and-cheese for dinner, and later to bed. The only variation in the entire scheme is laundry, when he hovers excitedly over the washing machine like a mother with her newborn child. Kevin does not seem dissatisfied. He lopes out to the bus every morning at 7:05, eager for a day of simple work. He wrings his hands excitedly while the water boils on the stove before dinner, and he stays up late twice a week to gather our dirty laundry for his next day's laundry chores. And Saturdays-oh, the bliss of Saturdays! That's the day my Dad takes Kevin to the airport to have a soft drink, watch the planes land, and speculate loudly on the destination of each passenger inside. \"That one's goin' to Chi-car-go!\" Kevin shouts as he claps his hands. His anticipation is so great he can hardly sleep on Friday nights. And so goes his world of daily rituals and weekend field trips. He doesn't know what it means to be discontent. His life is simple. He will never know the entanglements of wealth or power, and he does not care what brand of clothing he wears or what kind of food he eats. His needs have always been met, and he never worries that one day they may not be. His hands are diligent. Kevin is never so happy as when he is working. When he unloads the dishwasher or vacuums the carpet, his heart is completely in it.

His needs have always been met, and he never worries that one day they may not be. His hands are diligent. Kevin is never so happy as when he is working. When he unloads the dishwasher or vacuums the carpet, his heart is completely in it. He does not shrink from a job when it is begun, nor does he leave a job until it is finished. But when his tasks are done, Kevin knows how to relax. Kevin is not obsessed with his work or the work of others. His heart is pure. He still believes everyone tells the truth, promises must be kept, and when you are wrong, you apologize instead of argue. Free from pride and unconcerned with appearances, Kevin is not afraid to cry when he is hurt, angry or sorry. He is always transparent, always sincere. And he trusts God. Not confined by intellectual reasoning, he approaches his faith as a child. Kevin seems to know God - to really be friends with Him in a way that is difficult for an \"educated\" person to grasp. God seems like his closest companion. In my moments of doubt and frustrations with my Christianity, I envy the security Kevin has in his simple faith. It is then that I am most willing to admit that he has some divine knowledge that rises above my mortal questions. It is then I realize that perhaps Kevin is not the one with the handicap - I am. My obligations, my fear, my pride, my circumstances - they all become disabilities when I don't trust them to God's care. Who knows if Kevin comprehends things I can never learn? After all, he has spent his whole life in that kind of innocence, praying after dark and soaking up the goodness and love of God. And one day, when the mysteries of heaven are opened, and we are all amazed at how close God really is to our hearts, I'll realize that God heard the simple prayers of a boy who believed that God lived under his bed. Kevin won't be surprised at all!

Pierre Salinger announced on Nov. 8, 1996, that he'd received documents proving that a US Navy missile had accidentally downed TWA flight 800. That same day, FBI's Jim Kallstrom called a press conference. At one point, a man raised his hand and asked why the Navy was involved in the investigation while a possible suspect. \"Remove him!\" Kallstrom yelled. Two men leapt over to the questioner and grabbed him by the arms. There was a momentary chill in the air after the guy had been dragged out of the room. Kallstrom and entourage acted as if nothing had happened. Jim Kallstrom was later hired by CBS. **Jane Akre-Fox News***. *After our struggle to air an honest report on hormones in your milk, Fox fired the general manager of our station. The new general manager said that if we didn't agree to changes that the lawyers were insisting upon, we'd be fired for insubordination. We pleaded with him to look at the facts we'd uncovered. His reply: \"We paid $3 billion dollars for these TV stations. We'll tell *you* what the news is. The news is what *we *say it is!\" After we refused, Fox's general manager presented us an agreement that would give us a full year of salary, and benefits worth close to $200,000 in \"consulting jobs,\" but with strings attached: no mention of how Fox covered up the story and no opportunity to ever expose the facts. After declining, we were fired. **Monika Jensen-Stevenson-Emmy-winning producer for *60 minutes***. Robert Garwood-14 years a prisoner of the Vietnamese-was found guilty in the longest court-martial in US history. At the end of the court-martial, there seemed no question that he was a monstrous traitor. In 1985, Garwood was speaking publicly about something that had never made the news during his court-martial. He knew of other American prisoners in Vietnam long after the war was over. My sources included outstanding experts like former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency General Tighe and returned POWs like Captain McDaniel, who held the Navy's top award for bravery. With such advocates, it was hard not to consider the possibility that prisoners (some 3,500) had in fact been kept by the Vietnamese as hostages to make sure the US would pay the more than $3 billion in war reparations. ** Gary Webb-*San", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:leadingjournalists.txt:0:4fbbf245a458", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12181, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "leadingjournalists.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "leadingjournalists", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "in Vietnam long after the war was over.

The cocaine that flooded in helped spark a crack explosion in urban America. The story developed a momentum all of its own, despite a virtual news blackout from the major media. Ultimately, it was public pressure that forced the national newspapers into the fray. The *Washington Post*, the *New York Times*, and the *Los Angeles Times* published stories, but spent little time exploring the CIA's activities. Instead, my reporting and I became the focus of their scrutiny. It was remarkable that the four *Washington Post* reporters assigned to debunk the series could not find a single significant factual error. A few months later, the *Mercury News,* under intense CIA pressure, backed away from the story, publishing a long column apologizing for \"shortcomings\" in the series. The *New York Times* splashed the apology on their front page, the first time the series had ever been mentioned there. I quit the *Mercury News* not long after that.

Below are a number of useful resources to help you on this path of discovery. This information is provided to inspire you to be all that you can be and to lead an ever richer, fuller life. A great way to start exploring your life purpose and intentions is to stop for a moment and ask yourself these two key questions: **What is most important to me in my life?** **What are my deepest values and beliefs?** Give yourself time to explore these important questions and notice what touches and inspires you most deeply. Write down any answers or thoughts that come to you as you ponder these questions. Then use what you've written as a basis upon which to craft your life purpose and intentions. Consider also inviting divine guidance and your own inner wisdom to help you with this. Below are some inspiring examples of life purpose, intentions, and mission statements. You can use one or more of these examples as a template or model for developing your own.

Your life purpose is generally a single statement related to the overall reason that you feel you are here. What is the greater purpose behind your being alive? Why are you here in the world? Life intentions are any number of profound statements about the way you want to live your life. How do you want to be and act in the world right now and in each moment? When you are confronted with major challenges, on what core principles do you want to base your decisions and actions?

But it does help run a breathtakingly big part of it.** Over the last decade, Lockheed, the nation's largest military contractor, has built a formidable information-technology empire that now stretches from the Pentagon to the post office. It sorts your mail and totals your taxes. It cuts Social Security checks and counts the United States census. It runs space flights and monitors air traffic. To make all that happen, Lockheed writes more computer code than Microsoft. Of course, Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Md., is best known for its weapons, which are the heart of America's arsenal. It builds most of the nation's warplanes. It creates rockets for nuclear missiles, sensors for spy satellites and scores of other military and intelligence systems. The Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency might have difficulty functioning without the contractor's expertise. **But in the post-9/11 world, Lockheed has become more than just the biggest corporate cog in what Dwight D. Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex. It is increasingly putting its stamp on the nation's military policies, too.** Lockheed stands at \"the intersection of policy and technology,\" and that \"is really a very interesting place to me,\" said its new chief executive, Robert J. Stevens, a tightly wound former Marine. \"We are deployed entirely in developing daunting technology,\" he said, and that requires \"thinking through the policy dimensions of national security as well as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:lockheedmonopoly.txt:0:2b64fbb25df8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12187, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "lockheedmonopoly.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "lockheedmonopoly", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "biggest corporate cog in what Dwight D.

Stevens, a tightly wound former Marine. \"We are deployed entirely in developing daunting technology,\" he said, and that requires \"thinking through the policy dimensions of national security as well as technological dimensions.\" To critics, however, Lockheed's deep ties with the Pentagon raise some questions. \"It's impossible to tell where the government ends and Lockheed begins,\" said Danielle Brian of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit group in Washington that monitors government contracts. \"The fox isn't guarding the henhouse. He lives there.\" No contractor is in a better position than Lockheed to do business in Washington. Nearly 80 percent of its revenue comes from the United States government. Most of the rest comes from foreign military sales, many financed with tax dollars. And **former Lockheed executives, lobbyists and lawyers hold crucial posts at the White House and the Pentagon, picking weapons and setting policies.** Obviously, war and crisis have been good for business. The Pentagon's budget for buying new weapons rose by about a third over the last three years, to $81 billion in fiscal 2004, up from $60 billion in 2001. Lockheed's sales also rose by about a third, to nearly $32 billion in the 2003 calendar year, from $24 billion in 2001. **It was the No. 1 recipient of Pentagon primary contracts, with $21.9 billion in fiscal 2003.** Boeing had $17.3 billion, Northrop Grumman had $11.1 billion and General Dynamics had $8.2 billion. LOCKHEED also has many tens of billions of dollars in future orders on its books. **The company's stock has tripled in the last four years, to just under $60.** **\"It used to be just an airplane company,\" said John Pike, a longtime military analyst and director of GlobalSecurity.org, a research organization in Alexandria, Va. \"Now it's a warfare company. It's an integrated solution provider. It's a one-stop shop. Anything you need to kill the enemy, they will sell you.\"** As its influence grows, Lockheed is not just seeking to solve the problems of national security. It is framing the questions as well: Are there too few soldiers to secure the farthest reaches of Iraq? **Lockheed is creating robot soldiers and neural software - \"intelligent agents\" - to do their work.** \"We've now created policy options where you can elect to put a human in or you can elect to put an intelligent agent in place,\" Mr. Stevens said. Does the Department of Homeland Security have the best tools to protect the nation? Lockheed has a host of military and intelligence technologies to offer. **\"What they do for the military in downtown Falluja, they can do", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:lockheedmonopoly.txt:1:ca57347853f9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12188, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "lockheedmonopoly.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "lockheedmonopoly", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "is creating robot soldiers and neural software - \"intelligent agents\" - to do their work.** \"We've now created policy options where you can elect to put a human in or you can elect to put an intelligent agent in place,\" Mr. Stevens said. Does the Department of Homeland Security have the best tools to protect the nation? Lockheed has a host of military and intelligence technologies to offer. **\"What they do for the military in downtown Falluja, they can do for the police in downtown Reno,\" **said Jondavid Black of the company's Horizontal Integration Vision division. Lockheed is also building a huge high-altitude airship, 25 times bigger than the Goodyear blimp, intended to help the Pentagon with the unsolved problem of protecting the nation from ballistic missiles. The airship, with two tons of surveillance sensors, could be used by the Department of Homeland Security to stare down at the United States, Lockheed officials said. In a pilot program for the department, Lockheed has set up spy cameras and sensors on the U.S.S. New Jersey, anchored in the Delaware River, providing 24-hour surveillance of the ports of Philadelphia and Camden, N.J. The program grew out of the Aegis weapons and surveillance systems for Navy ships, and it soon may spread throughout the United States. The melding of military and intelligence programs, information-technology and domestic security spending began in earnest after the Sept. 11 attacks. Lockheed was perfectly positioned to take advantage of the shift. **When the United States government decided a decade ago to let corporate America handle federal information technology, Lockheed leapt at the opportunity. **Its information-technology sales have quadrupled since 1995, and, for all those years, Lockheed has been the No. 1 supplier to the federal government, which now outsources 83 percent of its I.T. work. **Lockheed has taken over the job of making data flow throughout the government,** from the F.B.I.'s long-dysfunctional computer networks to the Department of Health and Human Services system for tracking child support. The company just won a $525 million contract to fix the Social Security Administration's information systems. It has an $87 million contract to make computers communicate and secrets stream throughout the Department of Homeland Security. On top of all that, the company is helping to rebuild the United States Coast Guard - a $17 billion program - and to supply, under the Patriot Act, biometric identity cards for six million Americans who work in transportation. Lockheed is also the strongest corporate force driving the Pentagon's plans for \"net-centric warfare\": the big idea of fusing military, intelligence and weapons programs through a new military Internet, called the Global Information Grid, to give American soldiers throughout the world an instant picture of the battlefield around them. **\"We want to know what's going on anytime, anyplace on the planet,\" said Lorraine M. Martin, vice president and deputy of the company's Joint Command, Control and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:lockheedmonopoly.txt:2:eba6c8b596d2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12189, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "lockheedmonopoly.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "lockheedmonopoly", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "who work in transportation.

Martin, vice president and deputy of the company's Joint Command, Control and Communications System division.** Lockheed's global reach is also growing. Its \"critical mass\" of salesmanship lets it \"produce global products for a global marketplace,\" said Robert H. Trice Jr., the senior vice president for corporate business development. With its dominant position in fighter jets, missiles, rockets and other weapons, Lockheed's technology will drive the security spending for many American allies in coming decades. Lockheed now sells aircraft and weapons to more than 40 countries. **The American taxpayer is financing many of those sales. For example, Israel spends much of the $1.8 billion in annual military aid from the United States to buy F-16 warplanes from Lockheed.** Twenty-four nations are flying the F-16, or will be soon. Lockheed's factory in Fort Worth is building 10 for Chile. Oman will receive a dozen next year. Poland will get 48 in 2006; the United States Treasury will cover the cost through a $3.8 billion loan. In the future, Lockheed hopes to build and sell hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of the next generation of warplanes, the F-35, to the United States Army, Navy and Air Force, and to dozens of United States allies. Three years ago, Lockheed won the competition to be the prime contractor for this aircraft, known as the Joint Strike Fighter. \"It's a terrific opportunity for us,\" said Bob Elrod, a senior Lockheed manager for the F-35 program. \"It could be a tremendous success, at the level of the F-16 - 4,000-plus and growing.\" That would represent \"world domination\" for Lockheed, he said. In the United States, where national security spending now surpasses $500 billion a year, Lockheed's dominance is growing. **Its own executives say the concentration of power among military contractors is more intense than in any other sector of business outside banking.** **Three or four major companies - Lockheed, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and arguably Boeing - rule the industry.** They often work like general contractors building customized houses, farming out the painting, the floors and the cabinets to smaller subcontractors and taking their own share of the money. **AND, after 9/11, cost is hardly the most important variable for Pentagon planners.** Lockheed has now won approval to build as many F-22's as possible. The current price, $258 million apiece, easily makes the F-22 the most expensive fighter jet in history. Mr. Stevens, whose compensation last year as Lockheed's chief operating officer was more than $9.5 million, says", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:lockheedmonopoly.txt:3:567f2e632aa0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12190, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "lockheedmonopoly.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "lockheedmonopoly", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "houses, farming out the painting, the floors and the cabinets to smaller subcontractors and taking their own share of the money. **AND, after 9/11, cost is hardly the most important variable for Pentagon planners.** Lockheed has now won approval to build as many F-22's as possible.

Mr. Stevens, whose compensation last year as Lockheed's chief operating officer was more than $9.5 million, says **cost is essentially irrelevant when national security is at stake**. \"Some folks might think, well, here's a fighter that costs a lot,\" he said. \"This is not a business where in the purest economical sense there's a broad market of supply and demand and price and value can be determined in that exchange. It's more challenging to define its value.\" **Lockheed says it has transformed its corporate culture. In the 1970's, it was discovered that the company had paid millions of dollars to foreign officials around the world in order to sell its planes.** In one case, Kakuei Tanaka, who had been the prime minister of Japan, was convicted of accepting bribes. Mr. Trice, Lockheed's senior vice president for business development, says the company cleaned up its act at home and overseas since the last of the series of major mergers and acquisitions that gave the corporation its present shape in March 1995. **\"You simply have to look people in the eye and say 'we don't do business that way,' \"** he said. There really is no need to do business that way any more - not in a world where so much of Lockheed's wealth flows directly from the Treasury, where competition for foreign markets is both controlled and subsidized by the White House and Congress, and where Lockheed's influence runs so deep. Men who have worked, lobbied and lawyered for Lockheed hold the posts of secretary of the Navy, secretary of transportation, director of the national nuclear weapons complex and director of the national spy satellite agency. The list also includes Stephen J. Hadley, who has been named the next national security adviser to the president, succeeding Condoleezza Rice. **Former Lockheed executives serve on the Defense Policy Board, the Defense Science Board and the Homeland Security Advisory Council, which help make military and intelligence policy and pick weapons for future battles.** Lockheed's board includes E. C. Aldridge Jr., who, as the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, gave the go-ahead to build the F-22. **None of those posts and positions violate the Pentagon's rules about the \"revolving door\" between industry and government.** Lockheed has stayed clear of the kind of conflict-of-interest cases that have afflicted its competitor, Boeing, and the Air Force in recent months. \"We need to be politically aware and astute,\" Mr. Stevens said. \"We work with the Congress. We work with the executive branch.\" In these dialogues,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:lockheedmonopoly.txt:4:679f51278ffe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12191, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "lockheedmonopoly.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "lockheedmonopoly", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "who, as the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, gave the go-ahead to build the F-22. **None of those posts and positions violate the Pentagon's rules about the \"revolving door\" between industry and government.** Lockheed has stayed clear of the kind of conflict-of-interest cases that have afflicted its competitor, Boeing, and the Air Force in recent months. \"We need to be politically aware and astute,\" Mr. Stevens said. \"We work with the Congress. We work with the executive branch.\" In these dialogues, he said, Lockheed's end of the conversation is \"saying we think this is feasible, we think this is possible, we think we might have invented a new approach.\" Lockheed makes about $1 million a year in campaign contributions through political action committees, singling out members of the Congressional committees controlling the Pentagon's budget, and spends many millions more on lobbying. Its connections give Lockheed a \"tremendous opportunity to influence contracts flowing to the company,\" said Ms. Brian of the Project on Government Oversight. \"More subtly valuable is the ability of the company to benefit from their eyes and ears inside the government, to know what's on the horizon, what are the best bets for the government's future technology needs.\" SO who serves as the overseer for the biggest military contractors and their costly weapons? Usually, the customer itself: the Pentagon. \"Because you have so few contractors, you don't get the level of attention that the average citizen would think would be devoted to a program costing billions of dollars,\" he said. \"With this massive agglomeration into a very small number of companies, you get far less visibility as to whether the subcontractors are effectively managed. Problems accumulate.\" Mr. Stevens [Lockheed's CEO] sees a far grander vision. Lockheed, he said, is promising to transform the very nature of war. **During the cold war, when Lockheed and its component parts built an empire of nuclear weapons, Mr. Stevens said, the watchword was: \"Be more fearful. 'Deterrence,' isn't that Latin? 'Deterrere.' Induce fear. Terrorize.\"** Today, Lockheed is building weapons so smart that they can change the world by virtue of their precision, he said; they aim to wage war without the death of innocents, without weapons misfiring, without fatal miscalculation. \"I know the fog of war exists,\" Mr. Stevens said, adding that it could be lifted. \"We envision a world where you don't have any more fratricide,\" no more friendly fire, he said. \"With technology we've been able to make ourselves more secure and more humane. \"And we aren't there yet - but we sure have pioneered the kind of work that is taking us well along that trajectory.

One of the many miracles that has happened is that about once a year I am asked to interpret for the president. This Tuesday (Sep 23) at 3:30 - 4:00 PM Eastern Time in the US (12:30 - 1:00PM Pacific time), I'll be sitting in a room with President Bush and President Megawati of Indonesia helping them to communicate with each other by interpreting. Several other top government leaders from the US and Indonesia will be present. What I like to do in these meetings whenever I'm not interpreting is to channel divine love to everyone present. I know that this is the reason this work has been given to me. It's wonderful to channel love on my own, yet it's much more powerful when I have friends supporting me. I'd like to invite you at the time mentioned above to join me in sending out divine love to all present at this meeting. I will be energetically inviting Bush, Megawati, and everyone present to open to the love and divinity that they/we already are, but have forgotten in some ways. Everyone of you who chooses to join in sending this intention Tuesday strengthens this energetic invitation exponentially. I'd love to have you join me in this special opportunity to transform the world through bombarding our leaders with love ;o) Just so you know, in these meetings I rarely have any personal communication with those involved other than the pleasantries of hello, thank you, etc. Even so, I know that the energetic presence I/we bring has a significant impact. For anyone who is interested in all of the little miracles that brought me to interpret for presidents, I've written a one-page essay on that inspiring story which you can find at [www.inspiringcommunity.org/inspiringstories](https://www.inspiringcommunity.org/inspiringstories). Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the very first issue for the story \"Little Miracles Lead Me to Interpret for the President.\" It's the second story in that issue. If for whatever reason you can't send energy at the appointed time, I invite you to take a moment right now and send energy to Bush and all world leaders that they and we might focus on what's best for all on this planet, and that they/we invite in more love and harmony around the globe. Thanks for joining me in this. And thanks for all that you are doing to create a better world and for being the amazing divine being that you are!

After much consideration, I've decided to install LOVE. Can you guide me through the process? Tech Support: Yes, I can help you. Are you ready to proceed? Customer: Well, I'm not very technical, but I think I'm ready to install it now. What do I do? Tech Support: The first step is to open your HEART. Have you located your HEART? Customer: Yes, I have, but there are several other programs running right now. Is it okay to install while they are running? Tech Support: What programs are running? Customer: Let's see... I have PAST-HURT.EXE, LOW-ESTEEM.EXE, GRUDGE.EXE, and RESENTMENT.EXE running now. Tech Support: No problem. LOVE will gradually erase PAST-HURT.EXE from your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt other programs. LOVE will eventually overwrite LOW-ESTEEM.EXE with a module of its own called HIGH-ESTEEM.EXE. However, you have to completely turn off GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.EXE. Those programs prevent LOVE from being properly installed. Can you turn those off? Customer: I don't know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how? Tech Support: My pleasure. Go to your Start menu and invoke FORGIVENESS.EXE. Do this as many times as necessary until it's erased the programs you don't want. Customer: Okay, now LOVE has started installing itself automatically. Is that normal? Tech Support: Yes. You should receive a message that says it will stay installed for the life of your HEART. Do you see that message? Customer: Yes, I do. Is it completely installed? Tech Support: Yes, but remember that you have only the base program. You need to begin connecting to other HEARTs in order to get the upgrades. Customer: Oops. I have an error message already. What should I do? Tech Support: What does the message say? Customer: It says, \"ERROR 412-PROGRAM NOT RUN ON INTERNAL COMPONENTS.\" What does that mean? Tech Support: Don't worry, that's a common problem. It means that the LOVE program is set up to run on external HEARTs but has not yet been run on your HEART. It is one of those complicated programming things, but in non-technical terms it means you have to \"LOVE\" your own machine before it can \"LOVE\" others. Customer: So what should I do? Tech Support: Can you pull down the directory called \"SELF-ACCEPTANCE\"? Customer: Yes, I have it. Tech Support: Excellent. You're getting good at this. Now, click on the following files and then copy them to the \"MYHEART\" directory: FORGIVE-SELF.DOC, REALIZE-WORTH.TXT, and ACKNOWLEDGE-LIMITATIONS.DOC. The system will overwrite any conflicting files and begin patching any faulty programming.

My HEART is filling up with new files. SMILE.MP3 is playing on my monitor right now and it shows that PEACE.EXE, and CONTENTMENT.EXE are copying themselves all over my HEART. Is this normal? Tech Support: Sometimes. For others it takes a while, but eventually everything gets downloaded at the proper time. So, LOVE is installed and running. You should be able to handle it from here. Ah, one more thing. Customer: Yes? Tech Support: LOVE is freeware. Be sure to give it and its various modules to everybody you meet.

As a result, the term Manchurian Candidate now signifies a person who has had their personality split into \"alters\" which commit murder or other acts without conscious knowledge of what they've done. **The CIA has declassified over 18,000 pages of documents on extensive mind control programs carried out since the early 1950s. These documents prove that the government developed a Manchurian Candidate program which was quite real. ** Through the Freedom of Information Act, you can [order these documents](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol10pg#ciadocs) in the form of three CDs directly from the US government for only $10.

These documents and quotes show that the riveting book and [film](http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/the_manchurian_candidate/manchurian_large.html) ***Manchurian Candidate*** are more fact than fiction. First, a declassified CIA document dated Jan. 7, 1953 describes the experimental creation of alter personalities in two 19-year-old girls: ** **\"These subjects have clearly demonstrated that they can pass from a fully awake state to a deep hypnotic state by telephone, by receiving written matter, or by the use of code, signal, or words, and that control of those hypnotized can be passed from one individual to another without great difficulty. It has also been shown by experimentation with these girls that they can act as unwilling couriers for information purposes.\" (CIA Mori ID 190684)** **An online copy of the declassified CIA document with the quote above is [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/foia_mind_control/190684.4_hypnosis_mind_control_girls). A second document dated Feb. 10, 1954 describes an experiment on creating unsuspecting assassins:** **\"Miss [deleted] was instructed (having previously expressed a fear of firearms) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken miss [deleted] (now in a deep hypnotic sleep). Failing this, she would pick up a pistol and fire it at Miss [deleted]. She was instructed that her rage would be so great that she would not hesitate to 'kill' [deleted]. Miss [deleted] carried out these suggestions including firing the (unloaded) gun at [deleted], and then proceeded to fall into a deep sleep. After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened.

During WWII, I worked this technique with a Marine lieutenant I'll call Jones. I split his personality into Jones A and Jones B. Jones A, once a 'normal' working Marine, became entirely different. He talked communist doctrine and meant it. He was welcomed enthusiastically by communist cells, and was deliberately given a dishonorable discharge. Jones B was the deeper personality, knew all the thoughts of Jones A, and was 'imprinted' to say nothing during conscious phases. ****All I had to do was hypnotize him, get in touch with Jones B, and I had a pipeline straight into the Communist camp.\"**** (*Science Digest, April 1971, pp. 44-50)*** Read the [full article here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/mind_control_articles/estabrooks_hypnosis).

As my captain and I explained the dive procedures, I noticed the wind line moving into Molokini, a small, crescent-shaped island that harbors a large reef. I slid through the briefing, then prompted my divers to gear up, careful to do everything right so the divers would feel confident with me, the dive leader. The dive went pretty close to how I had described it: The garden eels performed their underwater ballet, the parrot fish grazed on the coral, and the ever-elusive male flame wrasse flared their colors to defend their territory. Near the last level of the dive, two couples in my group signaled they were going to ascend. **As luck would have it, the remaining divers were two European brothers, who were obviously troubled by the idea of a \"woman\" dive master and had ignored me for the entire dive.** The three of us caught the current and drifted along the outside of the reef, slowly beginning our ascent until, far below, something caught my eye. After a few moments, I made out the white shoulder patches of a manta ray in about one hundred and twenty feet of water. Manta rays are one of my greatest loves, but very little is known about them. They feed on plankton, which makes them more delicate than an aquarium can handle. They travel the oceans and are therefore a mystery. **Mantas can be identified by the distinctive pattern on their belly, with no two rays alike. **In 1992, I had been identifying the manta rays that were seen at Molokini and found that some were known, but many more were sighted only once, and then gone. So there I was: a beautiful, very large ray beneath me and my skeptical divers behind. I reminded myself that I was still trying to win their confidence, and a bounce to see this manta wouldn't help my case. So I started calling through my regulator, \"Hey, come up and see me!\" I had tried this before to attract the attention of whales and dolphins, who are very chatty underwater and will come sometimes just to see what the noise is about.

My divers were just as puzzled by my actions, but continued to try to ignore me. There was another dive group ahead of us. The leader, who was a friend of mine and knew me to be fairly sane, stopped to see what I was doing. I kept calling to the ray, and when she shifted in the water column, I took that as a sign that she was curious. So I started waving my arms, calling her up to me. After a minute, she lifted away from where she had been riding the current and began to make a wide circular glide until she was closer to me. I kept watching as she slowly moved back and forth, rising higher, until she was directly beneath the two Europeans and me. I looked at them and was pleased to see them smiling. Now they liked me. After all, I could call up a manta ray! Looking back to the ray, I realized she was much bigger than what we were used to around Molokini - a good fifteen feet from wing tip to wing tip, and not a familiar-looking ray. I had not seen this animal before. There was something else odd about her. I just couldn't figure out what it was. Once my brain clicked in and I was able to concentrate, I saw deep V-shaped marks of her flesh missing from her backside. Other marks ran up and down her body. At first I thought a boat had hit her. As she came closer, now with only ten feet separating us, I realized what was wrong. **She had fishing hooks embedded in her head by her eye, with very thick fishing line running to her tail. She had rolled with the line and was wrapped head to tail about five or six times. The line had torn into her body at the back, and those were the V-shaped chunks that were missing.** I felt sick and, for a moment, paralyzed. I knew wild animals in pain would never tolerate a human to inflict more pain. But I had to do something. Forgetting about my air, my divers and where I was, I went to the manta. I moved very slowly and talked to her the whole time, like she was one of the horses I had grown up with. When I touched her, her whole body quivered, like my horse would.

I moved very slowly and talked to her the whole time, like she was one of the horses I had grown up with. When I touched her, her whole body quivered, like my horse would. I put both of my hands on her, then my entire body, talking to her the whole time. I knew that she could knock me off at any time with one flick of her great wing. When she had steadied, I took out the knife that I carry on my inflator hose and lifted one of the lines. It was tight and difficult to get my finger under, almost like a guitar string. She shook, which told me to be gentle. It was obvious that the slightest pressure was painful. **As I cut through the first line, it pulled into her wounds. With one beat of her mighty wings, she dumped me and bolted away.** I figured that she was gone and was amazed when she turned and came right back to me, gliding under my body. I went to work. She seemed to know it would hurt, and somehow, she also knew that I could help. Imagine the intelligence of that creature, to come for help and to trust! I cut through one line and into the next until she had all she could take of me and would move away, only to return in a moment or two. I never chased her. I would never chase any animal. I never grabbed her. I allowed her to be in charge, and she always came back. When all the lines were cut on top, on her next pass, I went under her to pull the lines through the wounds at the back of her body. The tissue had started to grow around them, and they were difficult to get loose. I held myself against her body, with my hand on her lower jaw. She held as motionless as she could. When it was all loose, I let her go and watched her swim in a circle. She could have gone then, and it would have all fallen away. She came back, and I went back on top of her. **The fishing hooks were still in her. One was barely hanging on, which I removed easily. The other was buried by her eye at least two inches past the barb.** Carefully, I began to take it out, hoping I wasn't damaging anything. She did open and close her eye while I worked on her, and finally, it was out.

I could have stayed there forever! I was totally oblivious to everything but that moment.** I loved this manta. I was so moved that she would allow me to do this to her. But reality came screaming down on me. With my air running out, I reluctantly came to my senses and pushed myself away.** At first, she stayed below me. And then, when she realized that she was free, she came to life like I never would have imagined she could. I thought she was sick and weak, since her mouth had been tied closed, and she hadn't been able to feed for however long the lines had been on her. I thought wrong! With two beats of those powerful wings, she rocketed along the wall of Molokini and then directly out to sea! I lost view of her and, remembering my divers, turned to look for them. Remarkably, we hadn't traveled very far. My divers were right above me and had witnessed the whole event, thankfully! No one would have believed me alone. It seemed too amazing to have really happened. But as I looked at the hooks and line in my hands and felt the torn calluses from her rough skin, I knew that, yes, it really had happened. I kicked in the direction of my divers, whose eyes were still wide from the encounter, only to have them signal me to stop and turn around. Until this moment, the whole experience had been phenomenal, but I could explain it. Now, the moment turned magical. I turned and saw her slowly gliding toward me. **With barely an effort, she approached me and stopped, her wing just touching my head. I looked into her round, dark eye, and she looked deeply into me. I felt a rush of something that so overpowered me, I have yet to find the words to describe it, except a warm and loving flow of energy from her into me.** She stayed with me for a moment. I don't know if it was a second or an hour. Then, as sweetly as she came back, she lifted her wing over my head and was gone. A manta thank-you. I hung in midwater, using the safety-stop excuse, and tried to make sense of what I had experienced.

I hung in midwater, using the safety-stop excuse, and tried to make sense of what I had experienced. Eventually, collecting myself, I surfaced and was greeted by an ecstatic group of divers and a curious captain. They all gave me time to get my heart started and to begin to breathe. Sadly, I have not seen her since that day, and I am still looking. For the longest time, though my wetsuit was tattered and torn, I would not change it because I thought she wouldn't recognize me. I call to every manta I see, and they almost always acknowledge me in some way. One day, though, it will be her. She'll hear me and pause, remembering the giant cleaner that she trusted to relieve her pain, and she'll come. At least that is how it happens in my dreams.

Over One Million Iraqi Deaths Caused by US Occupation?** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/1-over-one-million-iraqi-deaths-caused-by-us-occupation/)) Nobody knows exactly how many lives the Iraq War has claimed. But even more astounding is that so few journalists have mentioned the issue or cited the top estimate: 1.2 million. During August and September 2007, a British polling group surveyed 2,414 adults in 15 of 18 Iraqi provinces and found that more than 20 percent had experienced at least one war-related death since March 2003. Using common statistical study methods, it determined that as many as 1.2 million people had been killed since the war began. Estimates range wildly and are based on a variety of sources. In October 2006, the British medical journal *Lancet* published a Johns Hopkins University study vetted by four independent sources that counted 655,000 dead. In January 2008, the World Health Organization and the Iraqi government did door-to-door surveys of nearly 10,000 households and put the number of dead at 151,000. The 1.2 million figure is out there, too, which is higher than the Rwandan genocide death toll and closing in on the 1.7 million who perished in Cambodia's killing fields. It raises questions about the real number of deaths from US aerial bombings and house raids, and challenges the common assumption that this is a war in which", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__2008_press_censorship.txt:0:8ee4db3a6ae5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12207, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__2008_press_censorship.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__2008_press_censorship", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "World Health Organization and the Iraqi government did door-to-door surveys of nearly 10,000 households and put the number of dead at 151,000.

It raises questions about the real number of deaths from US aerial bombings and house raids, and challenges the common assumption that this is a war in which Iraqis are killing Iraqis. The Brookings Institute has reported that **US troops have, over the past four years, conducted about 100 house raids a day. Brutality during these house searches has been documented (See #9 below). The aggressive \"element of surprise\" tactics employed by soldiers is likely resulting in several thousands of deaths a day that either go unreported or are categorized as insurgent casualties. ** **Sources:** \"Is the United States killing 10,000 Iraqis every month?

Security and Prosperity Partnership: Militarized NAFTA** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/2-security-and-prosperity-partnership-militarized-nafta/)) Coupling the perennial issue of security with Wall Street's measures of prosperity, the leaders of the three North American nations convened the Security and Prosperity Partnership. The White House-led initiative - launched at a March 23, 2005, meeting of President Bush, Mexico's then-president Vicente Fox, and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin - joins beefed-up commerce with coordinated military operations to promote what it calls \"borderless unity.\"** Critics call it \"NAFTA on steroids.\" However, unlike NAFTA, the SPP was formed in secret, without public input. \"The SPP is not a law, or a treaty, or even a signed agreement,\"** Laura Carlsen wrote in a report for the Center for International Policy. \"All these would require public debate and participation of Congress, both of which the SPP has scrupulously avoided.\" Instead the SPP has a special workgroup: the North American Competitiveness Council [NACC]. It's a coalition of private companies that are, according to the [SPP website](http://www.spp.gov/), \"adding [high-level business input](http://www.spp.gov/factsheet.asp) [that] will assist governments in enhancing North America's competitive position and engage the private sector as partners in finding solutions.\" The NACC includes the Chevron Corporation, Ford Motor Company, General Electric, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Merck, Procter & Gamble Co., and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. **A look at NAFTA's unpopularity among citizens in all three nations is evidence of why its expansion would need to be disguised.** \"It's a scheme to create a borderless North American Union under US control without barriers to trade and capital flows for corporate giants, mainly US ones,\" wrote Steven Lendman in *Global Research*.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__2008_press_censorship.txt:1:78a35ead0a06", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12208, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__2008_press_censorship.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__2008_press_censorship", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "in finding solutions.\" The NACC includes the Chevron Corporation, Ford Motor Company, General Electric, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Merck, Procter & Gamble Co., and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. **A look at NAFTA's unpopularity among citizens in all three nations is evidence of why its expansion would need to be disguised.** \"It's a scheme to create a borderless North American Union under US control without barriers to trade and capital flows for corporate giants, mainly US ones,\" wrote Steven Lendman in *Global Research*. **Sources:** \"Deep Integration,\" Laura Carlsen, [Center for International Policy, May 30, 2007](http://americas.irc-online.org/am/4276); \"The Militarization and Annexation of North America,\" Stephen Lendman, [Global Research, July 19, 2007](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=6359); \"The North American Union,\" Constance Fogal, [Global Research, Aug. 2, 2007](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=6456). **3. InfraGard: The FBI Deputizes Business** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/3-infragard-the-fbi-deputizes-business/)) The FBI and Department of Homeland Security have effectively deputized 23,000 members of the business community, asking them to tip off the feds in exchange for preferential treatment in the event of a crisis. \"The members of this rapidly growing group, called InfraGard, receive secret warnings of terrorist threats before the public does - and, at least on one occasion, before elected officials,\" Matthew Rothschild wrote in the [March 2008 issue](http://www.progressive.org/mag_rothschild0308) of *The* *Progressive.* InfraGard was created in 1996. **Membership now includes 350 of the nation's Fortune 500 companies. The group's 86 chapters coordinate with 56 FBI field offices nationwide.** While FBI Director Robert Mueller has said he considers this segment of the private sector \"the first line of defense,\" the American Civil Liberties Union issued [a grave warning](http://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/surveillance_report.pdf) about the potential for abuse. \"There is evidence that InfraGard may be closer to a corporate TIPS program, turning private-sector corporations ... into surrogate eyes and ears for the FBI. The FBI should not be creating a privileged class of Americans who get special treatment,\" stated Jay Stanley, public education director of the ACLU's technology and liberty program. And they are privileged: a DHS spokesperson told Rothschild that** InfraGard members receive special training and readiness exercises. They're also privy to protected information that is usually shielded from disclosure** under the trade secrets provision of the Freedom of Information Act. The information they have may be of critical importance to the general public, but first it goes to the privileged membership **Source:** \"The FBI deputizes business,\" Matthew Rothschild, [*The Progressive*, Feb. 7, 2008](http://www.progressive.org/mag_rothschild0308). **4. ILEA: Is the US Restarting Dirty Wars in Latin America?** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/4-ilea-is-the-us-restarting-dirty-wars-in-latin-america/)) The [School of the Americas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_the_Americas) [SOA] earned an unsavory reputation in Latin America after many graduates of the Fort Benning, Ga., facility turned into counterinsurgency death squad leaders.

The International Law Enforcement Academy recently installed by the Unites States in El Salvador - which looks, acts, and smells like the SOA - is also drawing scorn. The school is funded with $3.6 million from the US Treasury and staffed with instructors from the DEA, ICE, and FBI. It's tasked with training 1,500 police officers, judges, prosecutors, and other law enforcement agents in counterterrorism techniques per year. **It's stated purpose is to make Latin America \"safe for foreign investment\" **by \"providing regional security and economic stability and combating crime.\" ILEAs aren't new, but past schools located in Hungary, Thailand, Botswana, and Roswell, N.M., haven't been terribly controversial. ** Salvadoran human rights organizers take issue with the fact that, in true SOA fashion, the ILEA releases neither information about its curriculum nor a list of students and graduates.** Additionally, the way the school slipped into existence without public oversight has raised ire. As Wes Enzinna noted in a North American Congress on Latin America report, \"Members of the US Congress were not briefed about the academy, nor was the main opposition party in El Salvador.\" Now, after more than three years in operation, critics point out that Salvadoran police, who account for 25 percent of the graduates, have become more violent. A May 2007 report by Tutela Legal implicated Salvadoran National Police (PNC) officers in eight death squad-style assassinations in 2006. **Sources:** \"Exporting US 'Criminal Justice' to Latin America,\" \"Community in Solidarity with the people of El Salvador,\"[Upside Down World, June 14, 2007](http://upsidedownworld.org/main/content/view/774/1/); \"Another SOA?\" Wes Enzinna, [NACLA Report on the Americas, March/April 2008](http://nacla.org/node/4364?editionnid=4362&issuename=Guns:%2520The%2520Small%2520Arms%2520Trade%2520in%2520the%2520Americas&issuenum=2&volume=041&issuemonth=March/April&issueyear=2008&lilimage=); \"ILEA funding approved by Salvadoran right wing legislators,\"[CISPES, March 15, 2007](http://www.cispes.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=178); \"Is George Bush restarting Latin America's 'dirty wars?'\" Benjamin Dangl, [AlterNet, Aug. 31, 200](http://www.alternet.org/audits/58605/)7. **5. Seizing War Protesters' Assets** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/5-seizing-war-protesters-assets/)) Protesting war could get you into big trouble, according to a critical read of two executive orders recently signed by President Bush. [The first](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/07/20070717-3.html), issued July 17, 2007, and titled, \"Blocking property of certain persons who threaten stabilization efforts in Iraq,\" allows the feds to seize assets from anyone who \"directly or indirectly\" poses a risk to the US war in Iraq. And, citing the modern technological ease of transferring funds and assets, the order states that no prior notice is necessary before the raid. On Aug. 1, Bush signed [another order](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080730-4.html), similar but directed toward anyone undermining the \"sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic processes and institutions.\" In this case, the Secretary of the Treasury can seize the assets of anyone perceived as posing a risk of violence, as well as the assets of their spouses and dependents, and bans them from receiving any humanitarian aid. Critics", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__2008_press_censorship.txt:3:78f4cdf0a7e3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12210, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__2008_press_censorship.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__2008_press_censorship", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "of transferring funds and assets, the order states that no prior notice is necessary before the raid.

Critics say the orders bypass the right to due process and the vague language makes manipulation and abuse possible. **Protesting the war could be perceived as undermining or threatening US efforts in Iraq. \"This is so sweeping, it's staggering,\" said Bruce Fein, a former Reagan administration official in the Justice Department** who editorialized against it in the* Washington Times*. \"It expands beyond terrorism, beyond seeking to use violence or the threat of violence to cower or intimidate a population.\" **Sources:** \"Bush executive order: Criminalizing the antiwar movement,\" Michel Chossudovsky, [Global Research, July 2007](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=6377); \"Bush's executive order even worse than the one on Iraq,\" Matthew Rothschild, [*The Progressive*, August 2007](http://www.progressive.org/mag_wx080307). **6. The Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/6-the-homegrown-terrorism-prevention-act/)) On Oct. 23, 2007, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed - by a vote of 404-6 - the \"Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act,\" designed to root out the causes of radicalization in Americans. With an estimated four-year cost of $22 million, the act establishes a 10-member National Commission on the Prevention of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism. The bill's author, Rep. Jane Harman (D-Los Angeles) said, \"Free speech, espousing even very radical beliefs, is protected by our Constitution. But violent behavior is not.\" In a later press release Harman stated: \"the National Commission [will] propose to both Congress and [DHS Secretary Michael] Chertoff initiatives to intercede before radicalized individuals turn violent.\" Which could be when they're speaking, writing, and organizing in ways that are protected by the First Amendment. **This redefines civil disobedience as terrorism, say civil rights experts, and the wording is too vague.** \"What is an extremist belief system? Who defines this? These are broad definitions that encompass so much. It is criminalizing thought and ideology,\" said Alejandro Queral, executive director of the Northwest Constitutional Rights Center in Portland, Ore. **The story didn't make it onto the CNN ticker, but enough independent sources reported on it that the equivalent Senate Bill 1959 has since stalled.** After introducing the bill, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Me.), later joined forces with Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) on a report criticizing the Internet as a tool for violent Islamic extremism. **Sources:** \"Bringing the war on terrorism home,\" Jessica Lee, [Indypendent, Nov. 16, 200](http://www.indypendent.org/2007/11/19/homegrown-terrorism/)7; \"Examining the Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act,\" Lindsay Beyerstein, [*In These Times*, Nov. 2007](http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3388/examining_the_homegrown_terrorism_prevention_act/); \"The Violent Radicalization Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007,\" Matt Renner, [Truthout, Nov. 20, 2007](http://www.truthout.org/article/the-violent-radicalization-homegrown-terrorism-prevention-act-2007). **7.

Guest Workers Inc.: Fraud and Human Trafficking** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/7-guest-workers-inc-fraud-and-human-trafficking/)) Every year, about 121,000 people legally enter the United States to work with H-2 visas, a program legislators are touting as part of future immigration reform. **Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) called this guest worker program \"the closest thing I've ever seen to slavery.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center likened it to \"modern day indentured servitude.\"** They interviewed thousands of guest workers and reviewed legal cases for [a report](http://www.splcenter.org/pdf/static/SPLCguestworker.pdf) released in March 2007, which concluded \"Unlike US citizens, guest workers do not enjoy the most fundamental protection of a competitive labor market - the ability to change jobs if they are mistreated. If guest workers complain about abuses, they face deportation, blacklisting, or other retaliation.\" When visas expire, workers must leave the country, hardly making this the path to permanent citizenship legislators are looking for. Still, Mexicans are literally lining up for H-2B status, the stark details of which were reported by Felicia Mello in *The Nation*. Furthermore, thousands of illegal immigrants are employed throughout the country, providing cheap, unprotected labor and further undermining the scant provisions of the laws. Labor contractors who connect immigrants with employers are stuffing their pockets with cash, while the workers return home with very little money. The Southern Poverty Law Center outlined a list of comprehensive changes needed in the program, concluding, \"For too long, our country has benefited from the labor provided by guest workers but has failed to provide a fair system that respects their human rights and upholds the most basic values of our democracy. The time has come for Congress to overhaul our shamefully abusive guest worker system.\" **Sources:** \"Close to Slavery,\" Mary Bauer and Sarah Reynolds, [Southern Poverty Law Center, March 2007](http://www.splcenter.org/pdf/static/SPLCguestworker.pdf); \"Coming to America,\" Felicia Mello, [*The Nation*, June 25, 2007](http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070625/mello); \"Trafficking racket,\" Chidanand Rajghatta, [*Times of India*, March 10, 2008](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Trafficking_racket_Indian_workers_file_case_against_US_employer/articleshow/2852060.cms). **8.

I tell the Department of Justice what the law is.\"** The issue arose within the context of the Protect America Act, which expands government surveillance powers and gives telecom companies legal immunity for helping. Whitehouse, a former US Attorney, legal counsel to Rhode Island's governor, and Rhode Island Attorney General who took office in 2006, went on to point out that *Marbury vs. Madison*, written by Chief Justice John Marshall in 1803, established that it is \"emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\" **Sources:** \"In [FISA Speech](http://whitehouse.senate.gov/newsroom/speeches/speech/?id=f7196551-2160-44a9-81a5-e6340daf769e), Whitehouse sharply criticizes Bush Administration's assertion of executive power,\" [Sheldon Whitehouse, Dec. 7, 2007](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFWIHbf50EI); \"Down the Rabbit Hole,\" Marcy Wheeler, [*The Guardian*(UK), Dec. 26, 2007](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/dec/26/downtherabbithole). **9. Iraq and Afghanistan Vets Testify** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/9-iraq-and-afghanistan-vets-testify/)) Hearing soldiers recount their war experiences is the closest many people come to understanding the real horror, pain, and confusion of combat. One would think that might make compelling copy or powerful footage for a news outlet. But in March, **when more than 300 veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan convened for four days of public testimony on the war, they were largely ignored by the media. Winter Soldier was designed to give soldiers a public forum to air some of the atrocities they witnessed.** Winter Soldier was originally convened by Vietnam Vets Against the War in January 1971 when more than 100 Vietnam veterans described their war experiences, including rapes, torture, brutalities, and killing of non-combatants. The testimony was entered into the *Congressional Record* and shown at the Cannes Film Festival. Iraq Veterans Against the War hosted the 2008 reprise of the 1971 hearings. Former Marine Cpl.

Jason Washburn said, \"his commanders encouraged lawless behavior. 'We were encouraged to bring 'drop weapons.' In case we accidentally shot a civilian, we could drop the weapon on the body and pretend they were an insurgent.'\" Interviews with 50 Iraq war veterans also revealed a general disregard for the traditional rules of war. Though most major news outlets sent staff to cover New York's Fashion Week, few made it to the Winter Soldier hearings. Fortunately, KPFA and Pacifica Radio broadcast the testimonies live. They were \"deluged with phone calls, e-mails, and blog posts from service members, veterans, and military families thanking us for breaking a cultural norm of silence about the reality of war.\" Testimonies can be heard at [www.ivaw.org](http://www.ivaw.org). **Sources:** \"Winter Soldier: Iraq & Afghanistan eyewitness accounts of the occupation,\"[Iraq Veterans Against the War, March 13-16, 2008](http://ivaw.org/store); \"War comes home,\" Aaron Glantz, Aimee Allison, and Esther Manilla, [Pacifica Radio, March 14-16, 2008](http://warcomeshome.org/wintersoldier2008); \"US Soldiers testify about war crimes,\" Aaron Glantz, [One World, March 19, 2008](http://us.oneworld.net/node/158957); \"The Other War,\" Chris Hedges and Laila Al-Arian, [*The Nation*, July 30, 2007](http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070730/hedges). **10. American Psychological Association Complicit in CIA Torture** ([Full story here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/10-apa-complicit-in-cia-torture/)) **Psychologists have been assisting the CIA and US military with interrogation and torture of Guantánamo detainees - which the American Psychological Association [APA] has said is fine, despite objections from many of its 148,000 members.** A 10-member APA task force was convened on the divisive issue in July 2005 and found that assistance from psychologists was making the interrogations safe. **The task force was criticized by APA members for deliberating in secret, and later it was revealed that six of the 10 participants had ties to the armed services.** Not only that, but as Katherine Eban reported in *Vanity Fair*, \"Psychologists, working in secrecy, had actually designed the tactics and trained interrogators in them while on contract to the CIA.\" In particular, psychologists honed a classified military training program known as SERE [Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape] that teaches soldiers how to tough out torture if captured by enemies. Eban's story outlined how SERE tactics were spun as \"science\" despite a lack of data and the critique that building rapport works better than blows to the head. It's been misreported that CIA torture techniques got Al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah to talk, when it was actually FBI rapport-building. In spite of this, SERE techniques became standards in interrogation manuals that eventually made their way to US officers guarding Abu", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__2008_press_censorship.txt:7:dc885f69753b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12214, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__2008_press_censorship.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__2008_press_censorship", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "soldiers how to tough out torture if captured by enemies.

In spite of this, SERE techniques became standards in interrogation manuals that eventually made their way to US officers guarding Abu Ghraib. Ongoing uproar within the APA resulted in a petition to make an official policy limiting psychologists' involvement in interrogations. **Sources:** \"The CIA's torture teachers,\" Mark Benjamin, [*Salon*, June 21, 2007](http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/06/21/cia_sere/); \"Rorschach and awe,\" Katherine Eban, [*Vanity Fair*, July 17, 2007](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2007/07/torture200707).

El Salvador's Water Privatization and the Global War on Terror** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/11-el-salvadors-water-privatization-and-the-global-war-on-terror/)) El Salvador's new Anti-terrorism Law - based on the USA PATRIOT Act - criminalizes political expression and social protest. Close range shooting of rubber bullets and tear gas was used against community members for protesting the rising cost, and diminishing access and quality, of local water under privatization. Fourteen were arrested and charged with terrorism, a charge that can hold a 60-year prison sentence under the new Anti-Terrorism Law. **12. Bush Profiteers Collect Billions from No Child Left Behind** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/12-bush-profiteers-collect-billions-from-no-child-left-behind/)) No Child Left Behind has consistently proven disastrous in the realm of education. Yet the architect, President Bush's first senior education advisor Sandy Kress, has turned the program into a huge success in the realm of corporate profiteering. **13. Tracking Billions of Dollars Lost in Iraq** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/13-tracking-billions-of-dollars-lost-in-iraq/)) Starting one month after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and continuing for over a year, the United States Federal Reserve shipped a total of $12 billion in U.S. currency to Iraq. The U.S. military delivered the bank notes to the Coalition Provisional Authority to be dispensed for Iraqi reconstruction. At least $9 billion of that amount is unaccounted for due to a complete lack of oversight. **14. Mainstreaming Nuclear Waste** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/14-mainstreaming-nuclear-waste/)) Radioactive materials from nuclear weapons production sites are being dumped into regular public landfills and being used as recycled metals. The Nuclear Information and Resource Service has tracked the Department of Energy's (DOE) release of radioactive scrap to unaware and unprepared recipients such as landfills, businesses and recreation areas. Under the current system, the DOE releases contaminated materials directly, sells them at auctions or sends the materials to processors who can release them from radioactive controls. **15.

Worldwide Slavery** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/15-worldwide-slavery/)) Twenty-seven million slaves exist in the world today, more than at any time in human history. Globalization, poverty, violence and greed facilitate the growth of slavery, not only in the Third World, but in the most developed countries as well. Behind the façade in any major town or city in the world today, one is likely to find a thriving commerce in human beings. **16. Annual Survey on Trade Union Rights** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/16-annual-survey-on-trade-union-rights/)) The first Annual Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights to be published by the year-old International Trade Union Confederation documents enormous challenges to workers' rights around the world. The 2007 edition of the survey, covering 138 countries, shows an alarming rise in the number of people killed as a result of their trade union activities, from 115 in 2005 to 144 in 2006. Many more trade unionists around the world were abducted or \"disappeared.\" **17. UN's Empty Declaration of Indigenous Rights** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/17-uns-empty-declaration-of-indigenous-rights/)) In September 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The resolution called for recognition of the world's 370 million indigenous peoples' right to self-determination and control over their lands and resources. Three months following the passage of the Universal Declaration, a delegation of indigenous peoples were forcibly barred from entering the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bali, despite the fact that the delegation was invited to attend. **18. Cruelty and Death in Juvenile Detention Centers** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/18-cruelty-and-death-in-juvenile-detention-centers/)) In states across the U.S., child advocates have harshly condemned conditions under which young offenders are housed - conditions that involve sexual abuse, physical abuse and even death. The U.S. Justice Department has filed lawsuits against facilities in 11 states for supervision that is either abusive or harmfully negligent. **19. Indigenous Herders & Small Farmers Fight Livestock Extinction** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/19-indigenous-herders-and-small-farmers-fight-livestock-extinction/)) The industrial model of livestock production is causing the worldwide destruction of animal diversity.

CARE Rejects US Food Aid** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/22-care-rejects-us-food-aid/)) In August 2007, one of the biggest and best-known American charity organizations, CARE, announced it was turning down $45 million a year in food aid from the United States government. CARE claims the way U.S. aid is structured causes rather than reduces hunger in the countries where it is received. **23. FDA Complicit in Pushing Pharmaceutical Drugs** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/23-fda-complicit-in-pushing-pharmaceutical-drugs/)) While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) turns a blind eye, drug companies are making false, unsubstantiated and misleading claims in their advertising, often withholding mandated disclosure of dangerous side effects. Though companies are required to submit their advertisements to the FDA, the agency does not review them before they are released to the public.

U.S. Military Forces Deployed in 70 Percent of World's Nations ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/1-us-military-forces-deployed-seventy-percent-worlds-nations/)) According to a spokesperson for Special Operations Command (SOCOM), **in 2015 Special Operations Forces (SOF) deployed in 147 of the world's 195 recognized nations, an increase of eighty percent since 2010**. The SOCOM budget has more than tripled since 2001. By 2015, SOCOM funding had risen to nearly ten billion dollars. Additional funding from specific military branches amounted to another eight billion dollars annually. Between 2012-2014, Special Operations Forces carried out 500 Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET) missions in as many as sixty-seven countries per year. In addition to training, Special Operations Forces also engage in \"direct action.\" Counterterrorism missions, including \"low-profile drone assassinations and kill/capture raids by muscled-up, high-octane operators,\" are the specific domains of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) forces, such as the Navy's SEAL Team 6 and the Army's Delta Force. Africa has seen the greatest increase in SOCOM deployments since 2006. This has gone all but completely unreported by the corporate press. **Sources:** Turse, Nick, \"[A Secret War in 135 Countries](http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176048/),\" [*Tomdispatch*](http://www.tomdispatch.com/), Sept. 24, 2015.

Crisis in Evidence-Based Medicine ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/2-crisis-evidence-based-medicine/)) In April 2015, the *Lancet's* editor, Richard Horton, wrote, \"Something has gone fundamentally wrong with one of our greatest human creations.\" Horton summarized the \"case against science\": \"**Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue.\" Horton is not the first editor of a prominent medical journal to raise these concerns**. In 2009, [Marcia Angell](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies), a former editor of the *New England Journal of Medicine*, made comparable claims: \"It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines.\" Study 329, a now notorious clinical trial published in 2001 epitomizes the corruption and conflicts of interest noted by insider critics like Angell and Horton. Study 329 reported that paroxetine - marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK as Paxil in the US and as Seroxat in the UK - was safe and effective for treating depressed children and adolescents. A 2015 reanalysis of Study 329 found that paroxetine's beneficial effects were far less, and its harmful effects far greater, than the original study reported. **Sources:** [*Lancet 385*, No. 9976](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60696-1/fulltext), April 11, 2015.

That is a metaphor for what rising CO2 levels will do to the key group of ocean bacteria known as Trichodesmium**, according to a study published in the September 2015 issue of *Nature Communications*. The process of \"nitrogen fixation\" makes Trichodesmium \"the fertilising agent of the open ocean.\" The study tested the effects of elevated levels of carbon dioxide by subjecting hundreds of generations of Trichodesmium bred over a five-year period to CO2 levels predicted for the year 2100. Responding to increased ocean acidification, the bacteria went into \"reproductive overdrive,\" evolving to grow faster and to produce 50 percent more nitrogen.

Search Engine Algorithms and Electronic Voting Machines Could Swing Elections** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/4-search-engine-algorithms-electronic-voting-machines-swing-2016-election/)) Technology provides opportunities for manipulation of voters and their votes. Half of US presidential elections have been won by margins under 7.6 percent. These narrow but consequential victory margins underscore the importance of understanding how secret, proprietary technologies potentially swing election results. The latest research focuses on the powerful role played by the secret algorithms (including Google's PageRank and Facebook's EdgeRank) that determine the contents of our Internet search results and social media news feeds. It showed that **biased search rankings \"could shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by 20% or more**.\" The effect \"could be masked so that people show no awareness of the manipulation.\" Hidden algorithms shape online content in significantly different ways from more widely recognized concerns about editorial censorship. Electronic voting machines present similar challenges. In 2016, about 80 percent of the US electorate voted using outdated electronic voting machines that rely on proprietary software, which prevents the public from getting access to the actual vote count. **Sources:** Goldman, David, \"[Google could 'rig the 2016 election,' researcher says,](http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/20/technology/google-2016-election)\" CNN, Aug. 20, 2015 Epstein, Robert, \"[How Google Could Rig the 2016 Election](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/how-google-could-rig-the-2016-election-121548),\" [*Politico*](http://www.politico.com/), 2015.

Corporate Exploitation of Global Refugee Crisis Masked as Humanitarianism ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/5-corporate-exploitation-global-refugee-crisis-masked-humanitarianism/)) According to a June 2015 [United Nations report](http://unhcr.org/556725e69.html), sixty million people worldwide are now refugees due to conflict in their home nations. While Syrian refugees account for the largest number (an estimated 11.5 million people), other places such as Colombia, parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia also have large refugee populations.

According to the *Journal*, private equity groups across Europe were pursuing a new investment opportunity with \"promising ... growth potential,\" the management of camps and services for refugees. **Sources:** Lazare, Sarah, \"[World Bank Woos Western Corporations to Profit from Labor of Stranded Syrian Refugees](http://www.alternet.org/labor/world-bank-woos-western-corporations-profit-labor-stranded-syrian-refugees),\" [*AlterNet*](http://www.alternet.org/), 2016. \"[Turkey and Europe: Human Trafficking on a Scale Not Seen Since the Atlantic Slave Trade](http://www.blackagendareport.com/turkey_europe_human_trafficking),\" *[Black Agenda Radio](http://blackagendaradio.podbean.com/), [Black Agenda Report](http://www.blackagendareport.com/)*, 2016. **6. Over 1.5 Million American Families Live on Two Dollars Per Person Per Day ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/6-over-1-5-million-american-families-live-on-two-dollars-per-person-per-day/)) According to Kathryn J. Edin and H. Luke Shaefer, sociologists and authors of the book [*$2.00 per Day: Living on Almost Nothing in America*](https://www.amazon.com/2-00-Day-Living-Nothing-America/dp/0544303180/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1479422466&sr=8-1&keywords=%242.00+per+Day%3A+Living+on+Almost+Nothing+in+America), in 2011 more than 1.5 million US families - including three million children - lived on as little as two dollars per person per day in any given month. US media often neglect the experiences of the poor, making the findings \"startling for many.\" Edin and Shaefer documented family households living \"from crisis to crisis.\" In addition to providing a vivid account of what it's like to live in extreme poverty, Edin and Shaefer's research also offers a policy critique that highlights the long-term consequences of President Bill Clinton's 1996 welfare reform initiative. Since then, the number of families living on less than two dollars per person per day has more than doubled.** A \"huge flaw\" in welfare reform is the \"insistence on work without regard to job availability.\"** The rise of such absolute poverty since the passage of welfare reform belies all the categorical talk about opportunity and the American dream. **Sources:** Green, Marcus Harrison, \"[1.5 Million American Families Live on $2 a Day-These Authors Spent Years Finding Out Why](http://www.yesmagazine.org/commonomics/13-million-american-families-live-on-2-a-day-these-authors-spent-years-finding-out-why-20150924),\" [*YES!

Experts continue warning officials and the public that this problem is not going away. Although the Fukushima plant has been offline since the disaster, uncontrolled fission continues to generate heat and require cooling. The cooling process has produced \"hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of tons\" of highly radioactive water. TEPCO has no backup safety systems or proactive plan for dealing with the accumulation of contaminated water, so much of it is released into the Pacific Ocean. The Japanese government has kept its citizens \"in the dark\" from the start of the disaster about high radiation levels and dangers to health. **Government policy is to tell the Japanese people that everything is all right, despite medical or scientific evidence to the contrary.** US corporate media coverage consistently reported the disaster to be of little consequence. **Sources:** Jamail, Dahr, \"[Radioactive Water from Fukushima is Leaking into the Pacific](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/34565-radioactive-water-from-fukushima-isleaking-into-the-pacific),\" [*Truthout*](http://www.truth-out.org/), 2016.

Syria's War Spurred by Contest for Gas Delivery to Europe, Not Muslim Sectarianism ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/8-syrias-war-spurred-contest-gas-delivery-europe-not-muslim-sectarianism/)) In 2011-12, after Syrian president Bashar al-Assad refused to cooperate with Turkey's proposal to create a natural gas pipeline between Qatar and Turkey through Syria, Turkey and its allies became \"the major architects of Syria's 'civil war.'\" The proposed pipeline would have bypassed Russia to reach European markets currently dominated by Russian gas giant Gazprom. In 2012, the US, UK, France, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, along with Turkey, began to organize, arm, and finance rebels to form the Free Syrian Army, consistent with long-standing US plans to destabilize Syria. **Access to oil and gas - not sectarian differences - is the underlying cause of the violent conflict and humanitarian disaster in Syria**. Foreign meddling in Syria began several years before the Syrian revolt erupted. **US State Department cables from 2006 revealed by WikiLeaks documented plans to instigate civil strife that would lead to the overthrow of Assad's government. **The leaks revealed the United States partnering with nations including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, and Egypt to fuel Sunni-Shiite sectarianism to divide Syria. **Source:** [Refugee Crisis & Syria War Fueled by Competing Gas Pipelines,](http://www.mintpressnews.com/migrant-crisis-syria-war-fueled-bycompeting-gas-pipelines/209294/)\"[*MintPress News*](http://www.mintpressnews.com/), 2015. **9.

Big Pharma Political Lobbying Not Limited to Presidential Campaigns ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/9-big-pharma-political-lobbying-not-limited-presidential-campaigns/)) Large pharmaceutical companies made over $51 million in campaign donations during the 2012 presidential election and nearly $32 million in the 2014 elections. During the 2014 elections, Pfizer led drug companies with $1.5 million in federal campaign donations, followed by Amgen ($1.3 million) and McKesson ($1.1 million). **Campaign donations by large pharmaceutical companies pale in comparison to how much they spent on lobbying politicians and influencing policies outside of elections**. According to data gathered on the 2014 election, the industry spent seven dollars on lobbying for every dollar spent on the election. The $229 million spent by drug companies and their lobbying groups that year was down from a peak of $273 million in 2009, the year that Congress debated the Affordable Care Act. Lobbying allows Big Pharma to take advantage of Washington's revolving door and directly influence legislation. Collectively, pharmaceutical and health product lobbying for the first months of 2016 (through April 25) totaled over $63.1 million. **Source:** [\"How Much of Big Pharma's Massive Profits are Used to Influence Politicians?](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/33010-how-much-of-bigpharma-s-massive-profits-are-used-to-influence-politicians),\" [*Truthout*](http://www.truth-out.org/), 2015. **10. CISA: The Internet Surveillance Act No One is Discussing ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/10-cisa-internet-surveillance-act-no-one-discussing/)) **On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) into law as part of a 2,000 page omnibus spending bill**. The act authorized the creation of a system for corporate informants to provide customers' data to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which, in turn, would share this information with other federal agencies, including the Departments of Commerce, Defense (which includes the NSA), Energy, Justice (which includes the FBI), the Treasury (which oversees the IRS), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Congress used the omnibus spending bill to advance some of the legislation's \"most invasive\" components. In July 2015, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had attempted to attach the bill as an amendment to the annual National Defense Authorization Act, but the Senate blocked this by a vote of 56-40. **The final Senate version of the bill removed personal information protections that privacy advocates had fought successfully to have included in a previous version**. **Sources:** Greenberg, Andy, \"[Congress Slips CISA into a Budget Bill That's Sure to Pass](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/congress-slips-cisa-into-omnibus-bill-thats-sure-to-pass/),\" *[Wired](https://www.wired.com/),* 2015.

CIA Warned Bush Administration of Terrorist Attack Prior to 9/11 ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/11-cia-warned-bush-administration-terrorist-attack-prior-911/)) Based on new interviews with Cofer Black, the former director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center, and George Tenet, the former director of the CIA, the George W. Bush administration ignored CIA warnings in the months before 9/11. Starting in spring 2001, the CIA \"repeatedly and urgently\" warned the White House that an attack was imminent. Tenet testified about the warnings before the 9/11 Commission, but this was not included in the Commission's final report. **12. Why Our Lives Depend on Keeping 80 Percent of Fossil Fuels in the Ground** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/12-lives-depend-keeping-80-percent-fossil-fuels-ground/)) The world's remaining concentrations of fossil fuels can be understood as \"money pits\"-untapped coal, gas, and oil could be worth $20 trillion-or as \"carbon bombs,\" which will wreck the planet if they are used. A scientific report published in the journal *Nature* found that 80 percent of coal reserves, half of gas, and one-third of oil reserves should not be used if the world is to avoid global temperatures rising more than two degrees Celsius. **13. US \"Vaccine Court\" Has Paid over Three Billion Dollars to Vaccine-Injured Families ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/13-us-vaccine-court-paid-three-billion-dollars-vaccine-injured-families/)) Since 1988, the US government has paid $3.2 billion to 4,150 individuals and families for injuries and deaths attributed to shots for flu, diphtheria, whooping cough, and other conditions. In the 1980s, drug companies threatened to stop producing vaccines for the US market because litigation risks were too great unless the government provided them with \"no-fault\" protection. In 1986, Congress established the little-known Office of Special Masters of the US Court of Federal Claims (known informally as the vaccine court) to \"shield the vaccine makers from liability. **14. FBI's New Plan to Spy on High School Students across the Country ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/14-fbis-new-plan-spy-high-school-students-across-country/)) Under new guidelines issued in January 2016, the FBI is instructing high schools across the country to report students who criticize government policies and \"western corruption\" as potential future terrorists. The FBI's \"Preventing Violent Extremism in Schools\" guidelines encourage school officials to identify students who \"engage in communications indicating support for extreme ideologies\" or who are \"curious about\" subject matter that could be deemed extreme. **15.

Understanding Climate Change and Gender Inequality ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/15-understanding-climate-change-gender-inequality/)) Climate change has different impacts on men and women, based on preexisting social and economic inequalities. Because most international efforts to address climate change do not include women, the resulting policies do not take into account the particular challenges that climate change poses for women and girls. This is ironic because, according to a 2014 European Union study, women are more likely than men to be concerned about climate change, and are \"uniquely placed\" to share knowledge about climate impacts and to implement solutions. **16. Over Three-Quarters of Freedom of Information Act Requests Not Fully Answered ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/16-three-quarters-freedom-information-act-requests-not-fully-answered/)) On his election, President Obama promised greater governmental transparency to the American people. In practice, the Obama administration has set a record for failures to find and produce government documents in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. People who asked for records under the law received censored files or nothing in 77 percent of requests. Censorship and refusal to disclose are only two parts of a three-piece puzzle. The procedures federal workers use to retrieve requested files also contribute to the problem. **17. Deadly Medical Neglect for Immigrants in Privatized US Jails** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/17-deadly-medical-neglect-immigrants-privatized-us-jails/)) Over one hundred inmates in privatized, immigrant-only prisons have died, many in disturbing circumstances involving negligent medical and mental health care. In twenty-five cases, multiple reviewers found evidence of inadequate care that likely contributed to an inmate's premature death. By contrast, in just thirty-nine cases did the reviewers find that care had likely been in accordance with recognized medical standards. Seven of the thirteen privatized facilities were not compliant with the standards for adequate mental health care. **18. Women's Movements Offer Global Paradigm Shift toward Social Justice ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/18-womens-movements-offer-global-paradigm-shift-toward-social-justice/)) From LGBTQ movements and indigenous farming struggles to Black Lives Matter and efforts to create sustainable development, women around the world are leading the way toward greater social justice. Women-led movements have redefined leadership and development models, connected the dots between issues and oppression, prioritized collective power and movement-building, and critically examined how issues of gender, race, caste, class, sexuality, and ability disproportionately exclude and marginalize. **19. Global Epidemic of Electronic Waste ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/19-global-epidemic-electronic-waste/)) Consumers in the US generate an estimated 3.14 million tons of electronic waste annually, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.

About 40 percent of this goes to be recycled. A 2016 study by the Basel Action Network (BAN), a nonprofit that aims to end the global trade in toxic electronic waste, found that nearly one-third of these devices is exported to developing countries, where the low-tech dismantling of the recycled equipment contaminates the environment and endangers workers, many of whom are children. **20. The Walmarting of American Education ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/20-walmarting-american-education/)) In January 2016, Walmart publicized a plan to close 269 of its retail stores. At the same time, the Walton Family Foundation (WFF) announced a five-year strategic plan to spend a billion dollars to support and expand charter schools in thirteen US cities and states. WFF's commitment to charter schools is a product of the Walton family having been \"fully inculcated\" in the educational philosophy of libertarian economist Milton Friedman. Central to Friedman's ideology was that schools should be thought of as businesses, and their students understood as customers. **21. Little Guantanamos: Secretive \"Communication Management Units\" in the US ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/21-little-guantanamos-secretive-communication-management-units-us/)) In March 2016, inmates from two highly secretive US prisons, known as Communication Management Units (CMUs), appealed a previous summary judgment for the government in their case against the Federal Bureau of Prisons. CMUs have strict regulations against outside communication. Beginning in 2006, the Federal Bureau of Prisons created CMUs without any written conditions or procedures. Journalist Will Potter, who has visited a CMU, revealed that CMUs are effectively \"political prisons for political prisoners.\" **22. Department of Education Cooperates with ALEC to Privatize Education ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/22-department-education-cooperates-alec-privatize-education/)) The Department of Education and school districts throughout the US are working with billionaire families such as the Waltons and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings to undermine public education. Instead of defending public education in pursuit of equity for all students, the Department of Education (DoE) is working with organizations like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)-an alliance of corporate lobbyists and state legislators-as well as local chambers of commerce to encourage the conversion of public institutions into private charter schools. **23. Modern-Day Child Slavery: Sex Trafficking of Underage Girls in the US ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/23-modern-day-child-slavery-sex-trafficking-underage-girls-us/)) Sex trafficking in the US is pervasive.

According to the US Department of Justice, human trafficking is the second-fastest-growing criminal enterprise after drug trafficking, with minors constituting roughly half the victims in the US. In 2015, over 4,100 of the 5,544 trafficking cases reported to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center's hotline involved sex trafficking. While safe harbor laws, which criminalize adults who purchase sex with a minor, have been passed in thirty-four states, these laws leave many girls treated as criminals rather than as victims. **24. India's Solar Plans Blocked by US Interests, WTO ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/24-indias-solar-plans-blocked-us-interests-wto/)) The United Nations Conference on Climate Change, held in December 2015 in Paris, featured lofty rhetoric about international cooperation to tackle climate change. However, in February 2016, the WTO ruled against India's Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission. In a case initiated by the US in 2013, the WTO found that India's solar initiative, which required that 10 percent of solar cells be produced locally, violated international trade laws. The WTO ruling sets a dangerous precedent for countries wanting to support homegrown renewable energy initiatives. **25. NYPD Editing Wikipedia on Police Brutality** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/25-nypd-editing-wikipedia-police-brutality/)) Computers operating at One Police Plaza, the headquarters of the New York Police Department (NYPD), have been used to alter Wikipedia pages containing details of alleged police brutality\" including the entries for Eric Garner, Sean Bell, and Amadou Diallo. The pages have been edited to cast the NYPD in a more favorable light. Revisions and counter-revisions are typical of Wikipedia's self-policing user community. However, those made with NYPD IP addresses seemed to violate Wikipedia's conflict of interest policy. **Note: ** If you are feeling depressed or overwhelmed by this information, consider treating yourself to summaries of some of the most inspiring major media articles ever published on [this webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles). **Important: Top 20 Articles Ever Published Revealing Media Censorship** For concise summaries of the top 20 most revealing articles ever published in the major media with links to the full articles on their media websites, see [www.WantToKnow.info/newsarticles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newsarticles).

Global Decline in Rule of Law as Basic Human Rights Diminish ** (For full story, [click here](https://projectcensored.org/1-global-decline-in-rule-of-law-as-basic-human-rights-diminish/)) A 2018 survey conducted in response to global concerns about rising authoritarianism and nationalism shows a major decrease in nations adhering to basic human rights. The World Justice Project (WJP)'s \"[Rule of Law Index 2017-2018](https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/wjp-rule-law-index/wjp-rule-law-index-2017%E2%80%932018)\" examined legal systems around the world. **Since 2016 overall rule of law scores declined in 38 countries, with the greatest declines occurring in the category of fundamental rights**, which measures absence of discrimination, right to life and security, due process, freedom of expression and religion, right to privacy, freedom of association, and labor rights.

The world's richest people have seen their share of the globe's total wealth increase from 42.5% at the height of the 2008 financial crisis to 50.1% in 2017. This concentrated wealth amounts to $140 trillion. The number of millionaires in the world is now nearly three times greater than in 2000. This staggering concentration of wealth comes at an extreme cost. The world's 3.5 billion poorest adults each have assets of less than $10,000. Collectively these people, who account for 70% of the world's working age population, account for just 2.7% of global wealth. Those with low wealth tend to be disproportionately found among the younger age groups, who have had little chance to accumulate assets. Millennials face particularly challenging circumstances. Tremendous concentration of wealth and the extreme poverty that results from it are problems that affect everyone in the world. **Source:** Rupert Neate, \"[Richest 1% Own Half the World's Wealth, Study Finds](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/nov/14/worlds-richest-wealth-credit-suisse),\" *The Guardian*, November 14, 2017. **4.

Regenerative Agriculture as \"Next Stage\" of Civilization** (For full story, [click here](https://projectcensored.org/7-regenerative-agriculture-as-next-stage-of-civilization/)) Regenerative agriculture represents not only an alternative food production strategy but a fundamental shift in our culture's relationship to nature. Climate disruption, diminishing supplies of clean water, polluted air and soil, rising obesity, malnutrition and chronic disease, food insecurity, and food waste can all be traced back to modern food production. Regenerative agriculture is designed to address these problems from the ground up. **Regenerative farming could potentially draw a critical mass of 200-250 billion tons of carbon from the earth's atmosphere over the next 25 years, mitigating or even reversing key aspects of global warming**. Regenerative agricultural techniques allow carbon to be stored in soils and living plants, where it can increase food production and quality while reducing soil erosion and the damaging runoff of pesticides and fertilizers. Industrial farming systems effectively \"mine\" soils, decarbonizing them and, in the process, destroying forests and releasing an estimated 44 to 57 percent of all climate-destabilizing greenhouse gases. **Source:** Ronnie Cummins, \"[Regeneration: The Next Stage of Organic Food and Farming - and Civilization](https://www.organicconsumers.org/essays/regeneration-next-stage-organic-food-and-farming%25E2%2580%2594and-civilization),\" Organic Consumers Association, May 28, 2017. **8.

In 2017, the Firstpost news outlet [reported on](https://www.firstpost.com/india/child-trafficking-manufactured-orphans-the-dark-underbelly-of-inter-country-adoption-in-india-4000837.html) a \"kidnap-for-adoption\" racket in India in which an adoption agency was found guilty of \"stealing babies from impoverished unwed mothers, rape survivors and marginalised families.\" The United States is a source and transit country and is also considered one of the top destination points for victims of child trafficking. **19. People Bussed across US to Cut Cities' Homeless Populations** (For full story, [click here](https://projectcensored.org/19-people-bussed-across-us-to-cut-cities-homeless-populations/)) An investigative report by the *Guardian* studied homeless relocation plans in major cities and counties across the United States. The investigation recorded 34,240 journeys made by homeless people participating in a variety of city and county relocation programs between 2011 and 2017. Relocation programs provide people who are homeless with free one-way bus or plane tickets, [and] \"serve the interests of cities, which view free bus tickets as a cheap and effective way of cutting their homeless populations.\" **20. Extravagant Hospital Waste of Unused Medical Supplies** (For full story, [click here](https://projectcensored.org/20-extravagant-hospital-waste-of-unused-medical-supplies/)) Hospitals in the United States are wasting millions of dollars' worth of sterile and unused medical supplies. The type of equipment that gets thrown away ranges from simple items like surgical masks to more expensive equipment such as $4,000 infant warmers or even $25,000 ultrasound machines. This kind of waste occurs all over the country, despite the existence of nonprofit organizations that accept unused medical supplies while poorer hospitals in rural areas of the United States are unable to afford the high-quality medical supplies that big hospitals are discarding. **21.

Big Pharma's Biostitutes: Corporate Media Ignore Root Cause of Opioid Crisis** (For full story, [click here](https://projectcensored.org/22-big-pharmas-biostitutes-corporate-media-ignore-root-cause-of-opioid-crisis/)) At least 64,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2016, with more than 80 percent of those deaths attributed to opioid drugs. The beginning of the opioid crisis goes back to drug manufacturing companies hiring \"biostitutes,\" a derogatory term for biological scientists hired to misrepresent research or commit fraud. Purdue Pharma, which manufactures OxyContin, and McKesson, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen, which distribute that drug and other opioids, suppressed research and began to push doctors to write more prescriptions. **23. New Restrictions on Prisoners' First Amendment Rights** (For full story, [click here](https://projectcensored.org/23-new-restrictions-on-prisoners-first-amendment-rights/)) On November 1, 2017, the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) implemented strict changes to its prison mail policy that discouraged inmates, their families, and friends from using the US Postal Service. As Rand Gould reported for the *San Francisco Bay View*, the policy will actually \"stop prisoners, their families and friends from sending mail via the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and force them into buying email 'stamps' from JPay,\" allowing JPay and the MDOC to \"rake in profits\" and closely monitor all mail. **24. More Than 80,000 Stolen Guns Worsen Crime in Florida** (For full story, [click here](https://projectcensored.org/24-more-than-80000-stolen-guns-worsen-crime-in-florida/)) Over the past ten years, more than 82,000 guns stolen in Florida remain missing. In Tampa Bay alone at least 9,000 stolen guns have not been recovered. In 2016, on average, at least one gun was reported stolen every hour. Those guns turn up in the hands of drug dealers and felons. Burglaries of cars and of gun stores account for the great majority of stolen guns. A Jacksonville Sheriff's Office detective, Tom Martin, said criminals are not buying guns: \"They're stealing them.\" **25.

Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls** ([Full story here](https://www.projectcensored.org/1-missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women-and-girls/)) Indigenous women and girls face physical violence - including murder, kidnapping, sexual trafficking, and rape - with a \"shocking regularity\" that amounts to an \"epidemic\" of violence. From tribal reservations and rural communities to urban areas, the scope of the problem is \"almost impossible to put into context,\" the *Guardian* reported in May 2019, because no single federal government database consistently tracks how many Native women and girls go missing each year. The Urban Indian Health Institute (UIHI) [found](https://www.uihi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Missing-and-Murdered-Indigenous-Women-and-Girls-Report.pdf) 5712 reports of murdered or missing Native women and girls throughout the United States in 2016 - but only 116 of these were logged in the Department of Justice's database. **According to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) data, Native Americans disappear at twice the per capita rate of white Americans**. On some tribal lands Indigenous women were murdered at more than ten times the national average. **Sources:** Hallie Golden, \"['Sister, Where Did You Go?': The Native American Women Disappearing from US Cities](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/30/missing-native-american-women-alyssa-mclemore),\" *The Guardian*, May 1, 2019.

Monsanto \"Intelligence Center\" Targeted Journalists and Activists** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/2-monsanto-intelligence-center-targeted-journalists-and-activists/)) The agricultural giant Monsanto - which the German pharmaceutical corporation Bayer acquired in 2018 - created an \"intelligence fusion center\" in order to \"monitor and discredit\" journalists and activists. **Monsanto \"adopted a multi-pronged strategy\" to target Carey Gillam, a Reuters journalist who had reported on the likelihood of Monsanto's Roundup weed killer causing cance**r. Monsanto also monitored a nonprofit organization focused on the food industry, US Right to Know. Monsanto's internal communications documented how the company planned a series of \"actions\" to attack the credibility of Gillam's 2017 book, *Whitewash: The Story of a Weed Killer, Cancer, and the Corruption of Science*. Bayer \"has continued to assert that glyphosate is safe,\" but three US court cases, in 2018 and 2019, resulted in verdicts against Monsanto, holding the company liable for plaintiffs' non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer. **Source:** Sam Levin, \"[Revealed: How Monsanto's 'Intelligence Center' Targeted Journalists and Activists](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/07/monsanto-fusion-center-journalists-roundup-neil-young),\" *The Guardian*, August 8, 2019. **3. US Military-A Massive, Hidden Contributor to Climate Crisis** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/3-us-military-a-massive-hidden-contributor-to-climate-crisis/)) The US military is \"one of the largest polluters in history, consuming more liquid fuels and emitting more climate-changing gases than most medium-sized countries,\" Benjamin Neimark, Oliver Belcher, and Patrick Bigger reported for *The Conversation*. By burning fossil fuels, the US military emitted more than 25,000 kilotons of carbon dioxide in 2017. **If the US military were a country ... its fuel usage would make it \"the 47th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world**.\" Noting that studies of greenhouse gas emissions usually focus on how much energy and fuel civilians use, Neimark, Belcher, and Bigger wrote that US military emissions \"tend to be overlooked in climate change studies.\" Nevertheless, they reported, \"Significant reductions to the Pentagon's budget and shrinking its capacity to wage war would cause a huge drop in demand from the biggest consumer of liquid fuels in the world.\" **Source:** Benjamin Neimark, Oliver Belcher, and Patrick Bigger, \"[US Military is a Bigger Polluter Than as Many as 140 Countries-Shrinking This War Machine is a Must](https://theconversation.com/us-military-is-a-bigger-polluter-than-as-many-as-140-countries-shrinking-this-war-machine-is-a-must-119269),\" *The Conversation*, June 24, 2019. **4.

Congressional Investments and Conflicts of Interest** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/4-congressional-investments-and-conflicts-of-interest/)) The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which granted corporations a 14 percent reduction in taxes, also helped Republicans in Congress who own shares in those corporations reap huge financial rewards. **Although Republicans \"sold the bill as a package of business and middle-class tax cuts that would not help the wealthy, the cuts likely saved members of Congress hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes collectively**, while the corporate tax cut hiked the value of their holdings,\" Peter Cary of the Center for Public Integrity reported. Democrats in Congress also benefited, but none of them voted for the legislation. Adding to the congressional Republicans' windfall was ... the Act's \"crown jewel,\" a newly created 20 percent deduction for income from \"pass-through\" businesses, or smaller, single-owner corporations. At least 22 of the 47 members of the House and Senate tax-writing committees have investments in pass-through businesses. **Sources:** Peter Cary, \"[Republicans Passed Tax Cuts-Then Profited](https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/taxes/trumps-tax-cuts/republicans-profit-congress/),\" Center for Public Integrity, January 24, 2020.

As documented in several recent research studies, some of those social determinants can be clearly discerned in the links between income inequality and life expectancy and between racial segregation and premature mortality. **An August 2019 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report concluded that poor Americans are nearly twice as likely as their rich counterparts to die before reaching old age**. The poorest Americans are also more likely than their rich counterparts to face illness or premature death due to the inherent dangers of low-wage work. From delivery drivers to home care providers, low-paid workers face increasing pressures to work faster and longer, making their jobs more stressful-and, ultimately, deadly. **Sources:** Fernando De Maio, \"[We Must Address the Roots of Inequality to Keep It from Killing Us](https://truthout.org/articles/we-must-address-the-roots-of-inequality-to-keep-it-from-killing-us),\" Truthout, December 21, 2019.

The sites' privacy policies pages indicated that they were all operated by Locality Labs. Locality Labs ran similar networks of sites in Illinois and Maryland. Based on *CJR*'s network analysis ...

Public banks like the Bank of North Dakota, which was established in 1919, provide a robust alternative to the big for-profit banks that the government uses to invest public money into Wall Street, rather than local communities. Public banks will provide \"public agencies access to loans at interest rates much lower than they could find at private banks,\" the *Guardian* reported. **Run like nonprofits, public banks are not legally obligated to maximize profits, as private banks are; instead, public banks are mandated to serve their communities**. After California legislators enacted the state's Public Banking Act, the cities of [Los Angeles](https://www.dailynews.com/2019/10/07/la-city-council-president-to-propose-citys-first-public-bank) and [San Francisco](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2019/11/13/san-francisco-sets-timeline-for-launching-public.html) announced plans to establish public banks.

The report reveals that global elites have been abusing their intimidating legal and financial powers by targeting reporters with defamation lawsuits, \"cease and desist\" letters, social media smear campaigns, trolling, verbal harassment, and even occasionally physical violence. **The harassment faced by investigative journalists looking into financial crimes has a chilling effect on reporting about corruption**. The report found that wealthy individuals and corporations involved in financial corruption often resort to legal action against underfunded investigative journalists as a tactic to thwart their research into corruption. These frivolous suits, known as \"strategic lawsuits against public participation,\" or SLAPPs, are said to \"create a similar chilling effect on media freedom to more overt violence or attack.\" **Sources:** Spencer Woodman, \"[Threats, Violence, Trolling, and Frivolous Lawsuits Used to Silence Journalists Investigating Financial Crimes, Survey Finds](https://www.icij.org/inside-icij/2020/11/threats-violence-trolling-and-frivolous-lawsuits-used-to-silence-journalists-investigating-financial-crimes-survey-finds/),\" International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, November 2, 2020.

Historic Wave of Wildcat Strikes for Workers' Rights** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/3-historic-wave-of-wildcat-strikes-for-workers-rights/)) After the United States went into lockdown in spring 2020, millions of people were designated 'essential workers'-individuals who were expected to continue laboring at their jobs as meatpackers, teachers, janitors, delivery drivers, nurses, or grocery store clerks, at the potential cost of their lives. In response, thousands of wildcat strikes erupted to challenge dangerous working conditions and confront chronically low wages for these essential positions. **This wave of wildcat strikes has reached remarkable levels. A continuously updated COVID-19 Strike Wave Interactive Map had identified 1,100 wildcat strikes as of March 24, 2021**, many of which the corporate media have chosen to ignore.

The [*Lancet*study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30196-0/fulltext) found that the world's richest, most industrialized nations - including the United States, Canada, members of the European Union, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan - are responsible for 92 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, while the Global South is responsible for only 8 percent. The biggest climate debtors include the United States (responsible for 40 percent of global overshoots), Russia and Germany (8 percent each), the United Kingdom (7 percent), and Japan (5 percent). The results show that **the countries of the Global North have 'stolen' a big chunk of the atmospheric fair-shares of poorer countries, and on top of that are responsible for the vast majority of excess emissions**. **Source:** Sarah Lazare, \"['Colonizing the Atmosphere': How Rich, Western Nations Drive the Climate Crisis](https://inthesetimes.com/article/climate-change-wealthy-western-nations-global-north-south-fires-west),\" *In These Times*, September 14, 2020. **5.

According to a [July 2020 study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c00228) published in the scholarly *journal Environmental Science & Technology*, PFAS - a family of potentially harmful chemicals used in a range of products including carpets, furniture, clothing, food packaging, and nonstick coatings - have now been found in the Arctic Ocean. **This discovery worries scientists because it means that PFAS can reach any body of water anywhere in the world and that such chemicals are likely present in our water supply**.

It instills a powerful sense of fear and paranoia**.\" Although conservatives decry the development of \"cancel culture\" and alleged progressive intolerance, \"when it comes to Israel-Palestine, full-blown authoritarian coercion, like the blacklisting carried out by Canary Mission, is already well entrenched,\" Hussain wrote.

Google has adamantly denied allegations that it engaged in personal data collection on employees to prevent their organizing, arguing that it enlisted consulting firms for a host of reasons and not for the purposes of union-busting.

Pfizer Bullies South American Governments over COVID-19 Vaccine ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/8-pfizer-bullies-south-american-governments-over-covid-19-vaccine/)) In February 2021, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) reported that Pfizer has essentially held Latin American governments to ransom for access to its lifesaving COVID-19 vaccine. In negotiations with Argentina and Brazil, **Pfizer demanded that the nations offer sovereign assets - such as federal bank reserves, military bases, and embassy buildings - as collateral for any liability resulting from future legal cases**. Officials from several Latin American countries spoke with the BIJ on condition of anonymity, due to confidentiality agreements that Pfizer has required. One national official who participated in negotiations with Pfizer described its demands as \"high-level bullying\" that \"held to ransom\" the government attempting to access the vaccines. Consequently, legal experts expressed concern that Pfizer's demands \"amount to an abuse of power,\" the BIJ reported. **Sources:** Madlen Davies, Rosa Furneaux, Iván Ruiz, and Jill Langlois, \"['Held to Ransom': Pfizer Demands Governments Gamble with State Assets to Secure Vaccine Deal](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2021-02-23/held-to-ransom-pfizer-demands-governments-gamble-with-state-assets-to-secure-vaccine-deal),\" Bureau of Investigative Journalism, February 23, 2021.

Later that night, Malott became one of the approximately 3,600 Americans per year sent to the emergency room for severe bite injuries sustained during altercations with police K-9s. Although men and women of just about every age and ethnicity in all fifty states have been subjected to violent K-9 incidents, a series of 13 linked reports suggests Black men have been inordinately targeted.

The majority of individuals subjected to forced sterilization at the hands of the government have been people of color, inmates of jails, prisons, or institutions for people with mental illness or disabilities, and members of other marginalized and disempowered groups. Forced sterilization continues in the United States today. **In 2001 alone, 148 women in California prisons underwent tubal ligation or total hysterectomies without their knowledge, and between 1997 and 2010 some 1,400 California women prisoners underwent unwanted sterilizations**. *YES!

Grave Threats to Amazon Rainforest from Domestic Industries and Global Capital** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/12-grave-threats-to-amazon-rainforest-from-domestic-industries-and-global-capital/)) A 2020 report from Amazon Watch, entitled \"[Complicity in Destruction III](https://amazonwatch.org/assets/files/2020-complicity-in-destruction-3.pdf),\" shows how global corporations contribute to Indigenous rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon. The report identifies threats including deforestation, land grabbing, and illegal fires, which, taken together, severely threaten the rights and survival of Brazil's Indigenous people. Companies in mining, agribusiness, and energy are \"directly or indirectly involved in conflicts affecting Indigenous peoples.\" **13. Corporate Media Sideline Health Experts during Pandemic ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/13-corporate-media-sideline-health-experts-during-pandemic/)) Many prominent commercial TV news networks failed to provide much needed coverage by excluding the voices of independent health officials in their coverage of, and discussion panels about, the pandemic. The networks' disregard for health experts and public interest advocates raises serious ethical concerns, as it exacerbated the risks posed by the spread of COVID-19 to the health and well-being of those watching. **14. US Factory Farming a Breeding Ground for Next Pandemic ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/14-us-factory-farming-a-breeding-ground-for-next-pandemic/)) Over the past fifty years, meat production has increased about 260 percent, mostly in the form of so-called factory farms or confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) that fulfill the US and global demand for producing cheap and plentiful animal protein. 99 percent of US meat comes from factory farms where \"poor conditions and stress on the animals means that disease can emerge on the farms and spread through the herd at lightning speed.\" **15. Thousands of 5G Satellites Pose Risk of Future Space Wars ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/15-thousands-of-5g-satellites-pose-risk-of-future-space-wars/)) The prospect of *Star Wars*-esque battles in space has become much more likely with the rollout of fifth generation (5G) wireless technology, powered by tens of thousands of satellites approved by the Federal Communications Commission and on track to be launched into space. 5G wireless technology is a major factor in the weaponization of space. On October 8, 2020 the Department of Defense (DOD) [announced](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2376743/dod-announces-600-million-for-5g-experimentation-and-testing-at-five-installati/) $600 million in awards to advance its 5G capabilities. **16.

A November 2020 report from the UK-based nonprofit Femicide Census spanning nearly a decade found that, on average, \"a woman was killed by a male partner or ex-partner every four days,\" with that number increasing to every three days when the focus is expanded to include killings outside romantic relationships. These killings are typically treated as isolated incidents by law enforcement and legislators. **17. New Wave of Independent News Sources Demonetized by Google-Owned YouTube** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/17-new-wave-of-independent-news-sources-demonetized-by-google-owned-youtube/)) In February 2021 independent news sources such as Progressive Soapbox, The Convo Couch, Franc Analysis, and Hannah Reloaded were demonetized by YouTube, the latest instance of YouTube penalizing independent and alternative voices by removing entire channels or videos with no explanation, raising concerns over censorship on the platform. The demonetized videos and channels were made ineligible to receive advertising revenue. **18. \"Collision of Crises\" for Black and Brown Survivors of Sexual Violence during COVID-19 ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/18-collision-of-crises-for-black-and-brown-survivors-of-sexual-violence-during-covid-19/)) [This study](https://metoomvmt.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MeTooFreeFrom_CovidImpactReport2020.pdf) titled, \"Measuring the Economic Impact of COVID-19 on Survivors of Color,\" conducted by the organizations \"me too\" and FreeFrom examined the \"compounding socioeconomic effects\" of structural racism and COVID-19 on survivors of sexual violence. The study's findings revealed a \"collision of crises,\" involving the intersection of systemic racial inequality with unemployment or unsafe work, food and housing insecurity, economic precarity, and lack of healthcare. **19. European Demand for Biomass Energy Propels Destruction of US Forests ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/19-european-demand-for-biomass-energy-propels-destruction-of-us-forests/)) Driven by demand in European Union countries, the southern United States is now the world's largest producer and exporter of the wood pellets used to produce biomass energy. Despite popular beliefs that solar and wind power are its main sources of renewable energy, the European Union (EU) sources nearly 60 percent of its renewable energy from biomass. The true costs of biomass energy are not widely understood. **20. Proposed Domestic Terrorism Legislation Imperils Civil Liberties ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/20-proposed-domestic-terrorism-legislation-imperils-civil-liberties/)) The violent insurrection of January 6th, 2021, when supporters of Donald Trump unlawfully occupied the US Capitol building, threatened members of Congress, and temporarily derailed certification of the presidential election, has prompted a new wave of federal anti-terrorism statutes. The proposed legislation is unnecessary, because existing laws already cover domestic terrorism, and is especially dangerous given that new laws could be used to repress legitimate political protest. **21.

Sources directly familiar with Dataminr's work said that Dataminr has \"relied on prejudice-prone tropes and hunches to determine who, where, and what looks dangerous.\" Dataminr's \"domain experts\" lacked training, creating a powerful but untrustworthy monitoring system made in the image of their own prejudices. **23. Coastal Darkening Threatens Ocean Food Chains ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/23-coastal-darkening-threatens-ocean-food-chains/)) Researchers have been investigating how pollution and runoff alter the color and clarity of coastal waters and assessing the degree to which this darkening jeopardizes the health of ocean ecosystems. The research shows that coastal darkening has \"the potential to cause huge problems for the ocean and its inhabitants.\" Changes in ocean ecosystems could eventually lead to shortages of fish not only for humans, but also for other species. **24. Juvenile Justice Reform Remains Elusive ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/24-juvenile-justice-reform-remains-elusive/)) According to the Children's Defense Fund's [2020 report](https://www.childrensdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-State-Of-Americas-Children-2020.pdf), \"76,000 children are prosecuted, sentenced or incarcerated as adults annually,\" with nearly ten times that number arrested nationally in a single year, and with children of color being \"overcriminalized and overrepresented at every point-from arrests to post-adjudication placements.\" Children of color are nearly twice as likely to be arrested in comparison to white children. **25. Abusers Benefiting from International Anti-Abduction Treaty** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/25-abusers-benefiting-from-international-anti-abduction-treaty/)) The Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction was created to protect children from being abducted and taken away from their home countries. But abusers are now using this treaty as a way to manipulate the courts and regain custody of their children. An analysis of Hague cases found \"that an overwhelming number of 'abductors' were really mothers escaping abuse-and that the majority of them were forced to return their children\" to abusive partners. **Note: ** If you are feeling depressed or overwhelmed by this information, consider treating yourself to summaries of some of the most inspiring major media articles ever published on [this webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles). **Important: Top 20 Articles Ever Published Revealing Media Censorship** For concise summaries of the top 20 most revealing articles ever published in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-21.txt:8:c7cc0b95cdca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12263, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-21.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-21", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "cases found \"that an overwhelming number of 'abductors' were really mothers escaping abuse-and that the majority of them were forced to return their children\" to abusive partners. **Note: ** If you are feeling depressed or overwhelmed by this information, consider treating yourself to summaries of some of the most inspiring major media articles ever published on [this webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles). **Important: Top 20 Articles Ever Published Revealing Media Censorship** For concise summaries of the top 20 most revealing articles ever published in the major media with links to the full articles on their media websites, see [www.WantToKnow.info/newsarticles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newsarticles).

Fossil Fuel Industry Subsidized at Rate of $11 Million per Minute ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/1-fossil-fuel-industry-subsidized-at-rate-of-11-million-per-minute/)) A comprehensive study of 191 nations, published by the International Monetary Fund in September 2021, found that globally the fossil fuel industry receives subsidies of $11 million per minute. **Fossil fuel companies received $5.9 trillion in subsidies in 2020, with support projected to rise to $6.4 trillion by 2025, **according to the [IMF report](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2021/09/23/Still-Not-Getting-Energy-Prices-Right-A-Global-and-Country-Update-of-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-466004). Just five countries-the United States, Russia, India, China, and Japan-are responsible for two-thirds of global fossil fuel subsidies. In the United States, the IMF estimated that the US government provided $730 billion in direct and indirect subsidies to fossil fuel companies in 2020. According to a July 2021 [study](https://www.sei.org/about-sei/press-room/us-subsidies-boost-profits-oil-gas-fields/) by the Stockholm Environment Institute and Earth Track, continued US subsidies and exemptions \"could increase the profitability of new oil and gas fields by more than 50% over the next decade,\" with nearly all of the subsidies serving to increase companies' profits. Ending fossil fuel subsidies would \"prevent nearly a million deaths a year from dirty air and raise trillions of dollars for governments.\" **Sources:** Damian Carrington, [Fossil Fuel Industry Gets Subsidies of $11m a Minute, IMF finds](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/06/fossil-fuel-industry-subsidies-of-11m-dollars-a-minute-imf-finds), *The Guardian*, October 6, 2021, Eduardo Garcia, [Fossil Fuel Companies Receive $11 Million a Minute in Subsidies, New Report Reveals](https://www.treehugger.com/imf-fossil-fuel-companies-subsidies-massive-5206472), Treehugger, October 21,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-22.txt:0:2e5987ccb78c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12265, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-22.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-22", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "gas fields by more than 50% over the next decade,\" with nearly all of the subsidies serving to increase companies' profits.

Wage Theft: US Businesses Suffer Few Consequences for Stealing Millions from Workers Every Year ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/2-wage-theft-us-businesses-suffer-few-consequences-for-stealing-millions-from-workers-every-year/)) Thousands of US companies illegally underpay workers yet are seldom punished for doing so. An Economic Policy Institute [study](https://www.epi.org/publication/employers-steal-billions-from-workers-paychecks-each-year/) from 2017 found that just one form of wage theft-minimum wage violations-costs US workers an estimated $15 billion annually and impacts an estimated 17 percent of low-wage workers. Based on their independent analysis of fifteen years of reports from the US Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, Campbell and Yerardi concluded that **companies engaging in wage theft \"have little incentive to follow the law.\"** **In 2019 alone, the Department of Labor cited more than 8,500 employers for stealing approximately $287 million from workers. **Insufficient federal enforcement is \"especially problematic\" for workers in states that lack their own enforcement agencies: some fourteen states \"lack the capacity to investigate wage theft claims or lack the ability to file lawsuits on behalf of victims,\" according to the 2017 Economic Policy Institute report. **Source:** Alexia Fernández Campbell and Joe Yerardi, [Ripping Off Workers Without Consequences](https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/workers-rights/cheated-at-work/ripping-off-workers-with-no-consequences/), Center for Public Integrity, May 4, 2021. **3. EPA Withheld Reports on Dangerous Chemicals** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/3-epa-withheld-reports-on-dangerous-chemicals/)) Since January 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has received more than 1,200 legally required disclosures about chemicals that present a \"substantial risk of injury to health or the environment.\" **All but one of EPA's reports on these chemicals have been withheld from the public.** The undisclosed reports documented \"serious harms, including eye corrosion, damage to the brain and nervous system, chronic toxicity to honeybees, and cancer in both people and animals\" as well as environmental risks. The reports include notifications about highly toxic polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemical compounds that are known as \"forever chemicals\" because they build up in our bodies and never break down in the environment. The [Environmental Working Group](https://www.ewg.org/what-are-pfas-chemicals) explains that \"very small doses of PFAS have been linked to cancer, reproductive and immune system harm, and other diseases. For decades, chemical companies covered up evidence of PFAS' health hazards.\" As Eve Gartner ... stated, \"It is not easy to keep selling your chemicals when people know they likely cause cancer or other serious disease.\" **Sources:** Sharon Lerner, \"[EPA Withheld Reports of Substantial Risk Posed by 1,240 Chemicals](https://theintercept.com/2021/11/01/epa-toxic-chemicals-reports-withheld/),\" *The Intercept, *November 1, 2021, E.

At Least 128 Members of Congress Invested in Fossil Fuel Industry** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/4-at-least-128-members-of-congress-invested-in-fossil-fuel-industry/)) **A series of Sludge articles written by David Moore in November and December of 2021 reported that at least 100 US Representatives and twenty-eight US Senators have financial interests in the fossil fuel industry. **According to Moore, some seventy-four Republicans, fifty-nine Democrats, and one Independent have interests in the fossil fuel industry. Additionally, Senate Democrats own up to $8,604,000 in fossil fuel assets, more than double the Senate Republicans' $3,994,126 in fossil fuel assets. Many of these congressional leaders hold seats on influential energy-related committees. Nine of the twenty-two Republican members of the Energy and Commerce Committee are invested in the fossil fuel industry. According to [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/industries/summary?cycle=2021&id=E01.), the oil and gas industries spent $119.3 million on lobbying in 2021. During the 2020 election cycle, the fossil fuel industry gave more than $40 million to congressional candidates, including $8.7 million to Democrats and $30.8 million to Republicans according to another OpenSecrets [report](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=E01&recipdetail=A&sortorder=U&mem=Y&cycle=2020). **Sources:** David Moore, \"[Senators Cling to Fossil Fuel Stocks as World Heats Up](https://readsludge.com/2021/11/05/senators-cling-to-fossil-fuel-investments-as-world-heats-up/),\" Sludge, November 5, 2021, David Moore, \"[GOP Rep Picks up Millions in Pipeline Stock](https://readsludge.com/2021/12/10/gop-rep-picks-up-millions-in-pipeline-stock/),\" Sludge, December 10, 2021, David Moore, \"[At Least 100 House Members Are Invested in Fossil Fuels](https://readsludge.com/2021/12/29/at-least-100-house-members-are-invested-in-fossil-fuels/),\" Sludge, December 29, 2021, Julia Rock and Andrew Perez, \"[Lauren Boebert's Anti-Climate Legislation Is a Self-Enrichment Scheme](https://jacobin.com/2021/09/lauren-boebert-anti-climate-fossil-fuels-husband-jayson),\" Jacobin, September 13, 2021. **5. Dark Money Interference in US Politics Undermines Democracy ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/5-dark-money-interference-in-us-politics-undermines-democracy/)) The influence of dark money-political spending by organizations that are not required to disclose their donors-presents a major challenge to the swift functioning of the judicial nomination and confirmation process, and the US government as a whole.

This sort of \"surveillance advertising\" has become a ubiquitous and extremely profitable practice. The Biden administration's Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is now seeking to regulate the collection of user data. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), a trade group that represents media outlets utilizing digital advertising, has strenuously opposed FTC efforts to restrict the collection and monetization of user data. The IAB represents CNN, the New York Times, NBC, the Washington Post, Fox News, and \"dozens of other media companies.\" The IAB argues that targeted advertising-and, by extension, the siphoning of user data-has become necessary due to declining revenues from print sales and subscriptions. **Non-digital advertising revenue decreased from $124.8 billion in 2011 to $89.8 billion in 2020, while digital advertising revenue rose from $31.9 billion to $152.2 billion in the same period.** **Sources:** Lee Fang, \"[Major Media Outlets That Use Invasive User Tracking Are Lobbying Against Regulation](https://theintercept.com/2022/02/01/surveillance-data-collection-ads-news-media/),\" The Intercept, February 1, 2022. **More of the Top 25 Media Censorship Stories of 2022** **11.

The impoverished half of the global population accounted for less than 6 percent of all emissions in that period.

The Act would establish a national commission to develop best practices for the elimination of child sex-abuse material (CSAM). The EARN IT Act could significantly impact freedom of expression on the internet far beyond its stated aim of policing child pornography. The act will result in companies overzealously censoring lots of perfectly legal user speech just in case anything that could potentially be deemed CSAM might be lurking in there. **16.

The lack of infrastructure and financial resources available to these areas contribute to this digital divide. Access gaps and allocation issues are some of the long-lasting impacts from depression-era federal housing policies denying mortgage guarantees to majority-Black neighborhoods by classifying them as \"high risk,\" a practice known as redlining. **20.

The number of approved applications for access to TANF funding has been cut in half since 2010 as guidelines to qualify become increasingly exclusionary, while reserved TANF funds have more than doubled in the same time period. **21.

Since 1990, the urban roadway system has grown by nearly 70 percent. At the same time, public transportation systems have accumulated an estimated $90-$176 billion in maintenance and repair backlogs. **23. Federal Safety Agency Underreports Deaths of Offshore Oil and Gas Workers ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/23-federal-safety-agency-underreports-deaths-of-offshore-oil-and-gas-workers/)) The US Department of Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) underreported offshore oil and gas worker fatalities from 2005 to 2019. BSEE's narrow reporting criteria excluded nearly half the offshore deaths that occurred, grossly distorting the level of danger inherent to the job. More alarming is the fact that the fatality rate appears to be rising. **24. Indigenous Communities Using Data Sovereignty to Address Food Insecurity ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/24-indigenous-communities-using-data-sovereignty-to-address-food-insecurity/)) The pandemic has compounded a host of systemic issues in the United States, including food insecurity.

Maryland maintains nine separate prerelease and minimum-security facilities for men, but none for women. Although one in ten women at the Maryland Correctional Institution for Women is qualified for prerelease, as many as 30 percent of these women have not been assigned work opportunities. **Note: ** If you are feeling depressed or overwhelmed by this information, consider treating yourself to summaries of some of the most inspiring major media articles ever published on [this webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles). **Important: Top 20 Articles Ever Published Revealing Media Censorship** For concise summaries of the top 20 most revealing articles ever published in the major media with links to the full articles on their media websites, see [www.WantToKnow.info/newsarticles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newsarticles).

Dear WantToKnow.info friends, Our readers may have noticed that we started incorporating an Independent News section in our [weekly news summary newsletters](https://www.wanttoknow.info/medianewsarticles#summaries) that go out on Tuesday. When a small handful of powerful corporations control 90 percent of what we see, hear, and read, the narratives that dominate the mainstream airwaves tend to be in service of commercial, elite interests. Independent media platforms, on the other hand, aren't owned or influenced by corporate interests and often provide ample opportunities to access a diverse spectrum of perspectives and voices. **Each year, Project Censored specializes in covering top stories from independent media which were subjected to press censorship, either by being ignored or downplayed by corporate media.** [Project Censored](http://www.projectcensored.org) is a research team composed of more than 300 university faculty, students, and community experts who annually review many hundreds of news story submissions for coverage, content, reliability of sources, and national significance. The top 25 stories selected are submitted to a distinguished panel of judges who then rank them in order of importance. The results are published each year in an excellent book available for purchase at [their website](http://www.projectcensored.org/store/), [amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=project+censored&x=11&y=22), and most major book stores. **A summary of the top 25 media censorship stories of 2023 is provided below.** Each summary has a link for those who want to read the entire article. **Note:** To find all of these stories and their sources on the Project Censored website, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/top-25-censored-news-stories-of-2023/). The stories below cover a 12-month period spanning 2022 and 2023. **Top 25 Stories of 2023 Subjected to Press Censorship** **1. \"Forever Chemicals\" in Rainwater a Global Threat to Human Health** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/forever-chemicals-rainwater-threat-health/)) **Environmental scientists have found hazardous levels of manufactured chemicals in rainwater, leading to the dramatic conclusion that rainwater is \"no longer safe to drink anywhere on Earth,\"** according to an August 2022 report from *Insider*. A [global study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c02765) of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) ... concluded that \"in many areas inhabited by humans,\" PFAS contamination levels in rainwater, surface water, and soil \"often greatly exceed\" the strictest international guidelines for acceptable levels of perfluoroalkyl acids. The PFAS the researchers examined are known informally as \"forever chemicals\" because they take a long time to break down. [Prior research](https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas) has linked these chemicals to prostate, kidney, and testicular cancer and additional health risks, including developmental delays in children, decreased fertility in women and men, reduced vaccine efficacy, and high cholesterol.

Hiring of Former CIA Employees and Ex-Israeli Agents \"Blurs Line\" Between Big Tech and Big Brother** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/cia-employees-ex-israeli-agents-big-tech/)) Former employees of US and Israeli intelligence agencies now hold senior positions at Google, Meta, Microsoft, and other tech giants, where these individuals influence policy and control programs that regulate internet users' access to information. Google has hired former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employees to fill sensitive positions, affording them significant influence over the operation of the world's most used search engine and other Google products that encompass online communication, commerce, and information gathering. Elizabeth Murray, a retired intelligence agent who worked as a CIA analyst, noted that **the close relationship between the CIA and Google \"threatens individual rights to privacy, free speech, freedom of expression.\"** Hundreds of former agents of Unit 8200, an Israeli intelligence organization, comparable to the United States National Security Agency (NSA), hold influential positions at the world's biggest tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon. **Sources:** Alan MacLeod, \"[National Security Search Engine: Google's Ranks Are Filled With CIA Agents](https://www.mintpressnews.com/national-security-search-engine-google-ranks-cia-agents/281490/),\" *MintPress News*, July 25, 2022.

Toxic Chemicals Continue to Go Unregulated in the United States** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/chemicals-go-unregulated-united-states/)) The United States consistently fails to ban and regulate harmful chemicals. Although the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) gave the EPA regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of chemicals that pose serious health risks, the chemical industry's involvement in drafting the bill was so extensive that one EPA administrator joked that the law \"should have been named after the DuPont executive who went over the text line by line,\" ProPublica reported. **The law required the EPA \"to always choose regulations that were the 'least burdensome' to companies**. Over sixty thousand chemicals remained on the market for years without being vetted for health risks. Some toxins that were originally exempted from regulation include asbestos and trichloroethylene (TCE). Each chemical must undergo a lengthy assessment protocol, but the underfunded EPA cannot keep pace, especially in the face of industry resistance. \"The whole regulatory process is designed to be slow and to be slowed down by those opposed to regulation,\" said Joel Tickner, a leading expert on chemical policy. **Source:** Neil Bedi, Sharon Lerner, and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-23.txt:1:72fa8047f64b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12276, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-23.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-23", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "on the market for years without being vetted for health risks.

Stalkerware Could Be Used to Incriminate People Violating Abortion Bans** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/stalkerware-incriminate-abortion-bans/)) Stalkerware-surveillance apps that secretly record and upload cellphone activities-could become a significant legal threat to people seeking abortions, according to a pair of articles published in the wake of the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion. University of Virginia law professor Danielle Keats Citron ... explained that cyberstalking software provides users with \"real-time access to everything that we do and say with our phones. To do this, they only need our phones (and passwords) for a few minutes. Once installed, cyberstalking apps silently record and upload phones' activities to their servers. **They enable privacy invaders to see our photos, videos, texts, calls, voice mails, searches, social media activities, locations-nothing is out of reach**. From anywhere, individuals can activate a phone's mic to listen to conversations within 15 feet of the phone.\" Stalkerware is technically illegal to sell for the purpose of monitoring adults but nonetheless is readily available. **Sources:** Rae Hodge, \"[With Roe v.

Danielle Keats Citron, \"[Abortion Bans Are Going to Make Stalkerware Even More Dangerous](https://slate.com/technology/2022/07/stalkerware-abortion-bans-privacy.html),\" *Slate*, July 5, 2022. **5. Certified Rainforest Carbon Offsets Mostly \"Worthless\"** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/certified-rainforest-carbon-offsets/)) About 90 percent of rainforest carbon offsets certified by Verra, the world's largest offset certifier, do not reflect real reductions in emissions. Where Verra claimed to have certified 94.9 million credits-each of which is supposed to represent a one-metric ton reduction of carbon emissions-the actual benefits of the projects validated by Verra amounted to a much more modest 5.5 million credits. Several internationally renowned corporations-including Disney, Shell, Gucci, Salesforce, Netflix, and United Airlines, among others-have purchased Verra rainforest carbon credits. **Because Verra sets the standards for offset programs and profits from them, it has an incentive to overstate the climate benefits of carbon offsets**. A reforestation project in the Republic of the Congo, promoted by the French energy company TotalEnergies, displaced more than four hundred local farmers, some of whom told reporters they received the equivalent of as little as one dollar per hectare in compensation, or nothing at all in some cases, for their land, undermining their livelihoods and local food security in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-23.txt:2:7513ab0b7fd1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12277, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-23.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-23", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "standards for offset programs and profits from them, it has an incentive to overstate the climate benefits of carbon offsets**.

Unions Won More Than 70 Percent of Their Elections in 2022, and Their Victories Are Being Driven by Workers of Color** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/unions-won-70-percent-elections-2022/)) Unions won more than 70 percent of their certification elections in 2022. In fiscal year 2022, 2,510 petitions for union representation were [filed](https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/election-petitions-up-53-board-continues-to-reduce-case-processing-time-in) with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) between October 1, 2021, and September 30, 2022. This figure is up 53 percent from FY 2021 when 1,638 petitions were filed. **One business that saw large-scale union activity was Starbucks, with workers holding union elections at 354 stores nationwide, more than a quarter of all US union elections held in 2022**. Workers at Starbucks prevailed in four out of every five elections. Workers at Chipotle, Trader Joe's, and Apple unionized for the first time, while workers at Microsoft and Wells Fargo also had wins. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recorded a substantial rise of two hundred thousand unionized workers in the United States from 2021 to 2022, most of whom are workers of color. According to BLS, unionized workers of color increased by 231,000 last year, while White unionized workers decreased by thirty-one thousand. **Sources:** Mike Elk, \"[Workers of Color Accounted for 100% of Union Growth in 2022](https://paydayreport.com/workers-of-color-accounted-for-100-of-union-growth-in-2022/),\" Payday Report, March 28, 2023.

In 2017, France's environmental minister at the time, Nicolas Hulot, drafted a law to end fossil fuel extraction by 2040. In response, the Canadian oil company [Vermilion] threatened to use an \"investor-state dispute settlement\" (ISDS) to sue the French government, thus taking advantage of a provision that allows investors to sue governments for treaty violations. Due to the ISDS, Hulot's climate change bill was diluted, enabling oil and gas companies to continue extraction after the originally approved 2040 deadline. One of the most concerning aspects of the ISDS is that it offers foreign companies a loophole allowing them to avoid local courts--which frequently operate under stricter regulations. Instead, suits brought by companies against countries in which they have investments are decided by international arbitration tribunals. **Sources:** Rishika Pardikar, \"[Big Oil Is Suing Countries to Block Climate Action](https://www.levernews.com/fossil-fuel-interests-are-suing-countries-for-taking-climate-action-and-winning/),\" The Lever, June 8, 2022.

Proximity to Oil and Gas Extraction Sites Linked to Maternal Health Risks and Childhood Leukemia** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/proximity-oil-and-gas-sites-health-risk/)) Living near oil and gas extraction sites is hazardous to human health, especially for pregnant mothers and children. Researchers from Oregon State University ... found that pregnant women living within one kilometer (~0.6 miles) of a drilling site had a 5 percent greater likelihood of gestational hypertension and a 26 percent higher risk of eclampsia, a rare but serious condition where high blood pressure results in seizures during pregnancy, than pregnant mothers living further from drilling sites. A Yale University study ... found that children who resided in areas bordering fracking sites were two to three times more likely to develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a type of blood cancer. The study, [published](https://www.projectcensored.org/proximity-oil-and-gas-sites-health-risk/) in the journal *Environmental Health Perspectives*, involved 405 children aged 2-7 diagnosed with ALL in Pennsylvania between 2009-2017, who were compared with an additional 2,080 children, matched on birth year, who did not have leukemia. **The researchers found that children residing less than two kilometers (approximately 1.2 miles) from a fracking site were much more likely to develop leukemia**. **Sources:** Nick Cunningham, \"[Living Close to Oil and Gas Drilling Linked to Higher Risk of Pregnancy Complications, New Study Finds](https://www.desmog.com/2022/01/11/proximity-oil-gas-drilling-hypertension-pregnancy-willis/),\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-23.txt:4:755908b8bf2a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12279, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-23.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__censored__censored-news-stories-23", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "[published](https://www.projectcensored.org/proximity-oil-and-gas-sites-health-risk/) in the journal *Environmental Health Perspectives*, involved 405 children aged 2-7 diagnosed with ALL in Pennsylvania between 2009-2017, who were compared with an additional 2,080 children, matched on birth year, who did not have leukemia. **The researchers found that children residing less than two kilometers (approximately 1.2 miles) from a fracking site were much more likely to develop leukemia**. **Sources:** Nick Cunningham, \"[Living Close to Oil and Gas Drilling Linked to Higher Risk of Pregnancy Complications, New Study Finds](https://www.desmog.com/2022/01/11/proximity-oil-gas-drilling-hypertension-pregnancy-willis/),\" DeSmog, January 11, 2022.

The killing of environmental activists has been concentrated in the Global South, with 68 percent occurring in Latin America. Three-hundred-forty-two killings occurred in Brazil, 322 in Colombia, 154 in Mexico, 177 in Honduras, and eighty in Guatemala. Outside Latin America, the Philippines accounted for 270 killings and India accounted for seventy-nine. 39 percent of those killed were from Indigenous communities, despite that group constituting only 5 percent of the global population. In Brazil, about a third of those killed were Indigenous or Afro-descendants, and in the Philippines, that number was about 40 percent.

Tribal Towns Forced to Relocate Due to Climate Crisis** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/tribal-towns-relocate-climate-crisis/)) Many coastal areas in the Pacific Northwest lose up to seventy feet of their land annually due to erosion caused by climate change, disproportionately impacting the region's Indigenous communities. The Biden administration has already paid $25 million apiece to three Native American villages in Alaska and Washington to move away from the encroaching waters. However, the aid that has been allocated will not even cover the cost of building new schools. **12. Fossil Fuel Money Skews University Climate and Energy Research** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/fossil-fuel-money-climate-energy-research/)) Even as Princeton University announced in September 2022 that it would divest from fossil fuels, dozens of universities in the United States continue to accept millions of dollars from ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Shell, ConocoPhillips, and allied interests, such as Koch Industries, to fund climate and energy research. Fossil-fuel firms have purposely sought to 'colonize' academia with industry-friendly science, rather than seed overt climate denial. **13.

Study Exposes Electric Utilities' Climate Disinformation Campaigns** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/electric-utilities-climate-disinformation/)) Electric utility companies have been knowingly spreading disinformation about climate change for decades. Companies such as PG&E and Commonwealth Edison were perfectly aware of the threats posed by climate change but disregarded them. In fact, electric utility representatives went so far as to dismiss action to reduce carbon emissions as \"premature at best.\" The main reason for the many years of apparent deceit surrounding the climate crisis was financial profit. **15.

The NRE study analyzed 3,200 exonerations for the above crimes, dating back to 1989. Fifty-three percent of those exonerated were Black, even though Black Americans make up only 13.6 percent of the general population. Only 33 percent of those exonerated were White. **16.

Activism Targets Outdated State Laws That Criminalize HIV** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/activism-outdated-laws-criminalize-hiv/)) Existing HIV laws are at odds with current scientific understanding and medical treatment of HIV. For example, [eight states criminalize](https://www.theregreview.org/2022/02/24/mangold-viral-injustice-hiv-criminalization/) the act of exposing another person to HIV through spitting, even though saliva does not transmit HIV. One group seeking legal reform of outdated HIV laws is the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation. The Foundation's \"HIV Is Not a Crime\" campaign aims to bring laws \"up to date with contemporary science.\" **Note: ** We believe in finding balance in what we read.

Bradley Manning and the Failure of Corporate Media ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/1-bradley-manning-failure-corporate-media/)) Untold stories of Iraqi civilian deaths by American soldiers, US diplomats pushing aircraft sales on foreign royalty, uninvestigated abuse by Iraqi allies, the perils of the rise in private war contractors - this is what Manning exposed. They were stories that challenge the US political elite, and they were only made possible by a sacrifice. Manning got a 35-year prison sentence for the revelation of state secrets to WikiLeaks. The failure of our media was not in the lack of coverage of Manning, but in its focus. Though *The New York Time*s partnered with WikiLeaks to release stories based on the documents, news from the leaks have now slowed to a trickle - a waste of over 700,000 pieces of classified intelligence giving unparalleled ground level views of America's costly wars. The media quickly took a scathing indictment of US military policy and spun it into a story about Manning's politics and patriotism.

Richest Global 1 Percent Hide Billions in Tax Havens ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/2-richest-global-1-percent-hide-trillions-tax-havens/)) Global corporate fatcats hold $21-32 trillion in offshore havens, money hidden from government taxation that would benefit people around the world, according to findings by James S. Henry, the former chief economist of the global management firm McKinsey & Company. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists obtained a leak in April 2013, revealing how widespread the buy-in was to these tax havens. The findings were damning: government officials in Canada, Russia, and other countries have embraced offshore accounts, the world's top banks (including Deutsche Bank) have worked to maintain them, and the tax havens are used in Ponzi schemes. Moving money offshore has implications that ripped through the world economy. Part of Greece's economic collapse was due to these tax havens. **US Senator Carl Levin, D-Michigan, introduced legislation to combat the practice, SB1533, The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, but so far the bill has had little play in the media. **This hidden wealth is a huge black hole in the world economy that has never been measured, and which could generate income tax revenues between $190-280 billion a year. **Sources:** Carl Herman, \"1% Hide $21 Trillion and US Big Banks Hide $10 Trillion; Ending World poverty: $3 Trillion,\" Washington's Blog, July 24, 2012, [available here](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/07/1-hide-21-trillion-us-big-banks-hide-10-trillion-ending-world-poverty-3-trillion.html).

The trade watch group investigated the TPP and is the main advocate in opposition of its policies. The AFL-CIO, Sierra Club, and other organizations have also had growing concerns about the level of access granted to corporations in these agreements. With extra powers granted to foreign firms, the possibility that companies would continue moving offshore could grow. But even with the risks of outsized corporate influence, the US has a strong interest in the TPP in order to maintain trade agreements with Asia. **Source:** Kevin Zeese, \"Obama's ...

Obama's War on Whistleblowers** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/4-obamas-war-whistleblowers/)) President Obama has invoked the Espionage Act of 1917 more than every other president combined. Seven times, Obama has pursued leakers with the act, against Thomas Drake, Shamai Leibowitz, Bradley Manning, Stephen Kim, Jeffrey Sterling, John Kiriakou and most recently, Edward Snowden. All had ties to the State Department, FBI, CIA, or NSA, and all of them leaked to journalists. Neither party is raising hell over this. This is the sort of story that sort of slips through the cracks. And when the politicians don't raise a fuss, neither does the media. Pro Publica covered the issue, constructing timelines and mapping out the various arrests and indictments. **The lack of coverage is in Obama's hypocrisy - only a year before, he signed The Whistleblower Protection Act.** \"Certain provisions in the Act threaten to interfere with my constitutional duty to supervise the executive branch,\" Obama said. \"I will interpret those sections consistent with my authority.\" **Sources:** Dana Liebelson, \"Why Is Obama Bashing a Whistleblower Law He Already Signed?,\" *Mother Jones*, Jan. 10, 2013, [available here](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/obama-whistleblower-protections-signing-statement).

Hate Groups, Antigovernment Groups on Rise across US ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/5-hate-groups-antigovernment-groups-rise-across-us/)) Hate groups in the US are on the rise, according to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center. There are 1,007 known hate groups operating across the country, it wrote, including neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan, white nationalists, neo-Confederates, racist skinheads, black separatists, border vigilantes, and others. Since 2000, those groups have grown by over half, and there was a \"powerful resurgence\" of Patriot groups, the likes of which were involved in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. Worst of all, the huge growth in armed militias seems to have conspicuous timing with Obama's election. **\"The number of Patriot groups, including armed militias, has grown 813 percent since Obama was elected - from 149 in 2008 to 1,360 in 2012,\" the SPLC reported. ** **Sources:** Brian Levin, \"U.S. Hate and Extremist Groups Hit Record Levels,\" Huffington Post, March 8, 2012, [available here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-levin-jd/hate-groups-splc_b_1331318.html).

Billionaires' Rising Wealth Intensifies Poverty, Inequality ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/6-billionaires-rising-wealth-intensifies-poverty-inequality/)) The world's billionaires added $241 billion to their collective net worth in 2012.

That gain, coupled with the world's richest peoples' new total worth of $1.9 trillion (more than the GDP of Canada), wasn't reported by some kooky socialist group, but by [Bloomberg News](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-01/billionaires-worth-1-9-trillion-seek-advantage-in-2013.html).

Merchants of Death and Nuclear Weapons ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/7-merchants-death-nuclear-weapons/)) The threat of nuclear war is not strictly an example of censorship, but of a desire for media reform. A study from the The Physicians for Social Responsibility said 1 billion people could starve in the decade after a nuclear detonation. Corn production in the US would decline by an average of 10 percent for an entire decade and food prices would make food inaccessible to hundreds of millions of the world's poorest. This is not journalism in the classic sense. In traditional journalism, as it's played out since the early 20th century, news requires an element of something new in order to garner reporting - not a looming threat or danger. So in this case, what is identified is the need for a new kind of journalism - \"solutions journalism.\" **\"Solutions journalism,\" Sarah van Gelder wrote in the foreword to Censored 2014, \"must investigate not only the individual innovations, but also the larger pattern of change - the emerging ethics, institutions, and ways of life that are coming into existence.\" ** **Sources:** Marc Pilisuk, \"Occupying the Merchants of Death,\" Project Censored, Nov. 22, 2012, [available here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/occupying-the-merchants-of-death/). **8. Bank Interests Inflate Global Prices by 35 to 40 Percent ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/8-bank-interests-inflate-global-prices-35-40-percent/)) **Does 35 percent of everything bought in the United States go to interest? Professor Margrit Kennedy of the University of Hanover thinks so, and she says it's a major funnel of money from the 99 percent to the rich.** In her 2012 book, [*Occupy Money*](http://www.amazon.com/Occupy-Money-Creating-Economy-Everybody/dp/0865717311/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1385763016&sr=8-1&keywords=Occupy+Money%3A+Creating+an+Economy+Where+Everybody+Wins), Kennedy wrote that tradespeople, suppliers, wholesalers, and retailers along the chain of production rely on credit. Her figures were initially drawn from the German economy, but Ellen Brown of the [Web of Debt](http://ellenbrown.com/) and [Global Research](http://www.globalresearch.ca/) said she found similar patterns in the US. This \"hidden interest\" has sapped the growth of other industries, she said, lining the pockets of the financial sector. So if interest is stagnating so many industries, why would journalists avoid the topic? Few economists have echoed her views, and few experts emerged to back up her assertions. Without people in power pushing the topic, a mainstream journalist would be seen as going out on a limb to report on such important matters. If reporters raise an issue the elites are not raising themselves, then they're labelled ideological, or said to have an axe to grind. This makes mainstream journalism worthless on many important issues. **Sources:** Ellen Brown, \"It's the Interest, Stupid!

When asked, \"In the new constitution, do you want natural resources that are not privately owned to be declared national property?\" its citizens voted 81 percent in favor. **The constitutional reforms are a direct response to the nation's 2008 financial crash, when Iceland's unregulated banks borrowed more than the country's gross domestic product from international wholesale money markets.** As Jessica Conrad of On the Commons reported, \"It is clear that citizens are beginning to recognize the value of what they share together over the perceived wealth created by the market economy.\" **Sources:** Jessica Conrad, \"Icelanders Vote to Include the Commons in Their Constitution,\" *Commons Magazine*, November 2012, [available here](http://onthecommons.org/magazine/icelanders-vote-include-commons-their-constitution).

A \"Culture of Cruelty\" along Mexico-US Border ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/10-culture-cruelty-along-mexico-us-border/)) The plight of Mexican border crossings usually involves three types of stories in US press: deaths in the stretch of desert beyond the border, the horrors of drug cartels, and heroic journeys of border crossings by sympathetic workers. But a report released a year ago by the organization No More Deaths asserts that **people arrested by Border Patrol while crossing were denied water and told to let their sick die.** No More Deaths conducted more than 12,000 interviews to form the basis of its study in three Mexican cities: Nacos, Nogales and Agua Prieta. The report cites grossly ineffective oversight from the Department of Homeland Security. This has received some coverage, from [Salon showcasing video](http://www.salon.com/2012/07/20/cruelty_on_the_border/) of Border Patrol agents destroying jugs of water meant for crossers to a [*New York Times*piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/us/call-for-better-tracking-of-cases-of-excessive-force-at-borders.html) citing a lack of oversight for Border Patrol's excessive force.

Half of global wealth owned by the 1 percent ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/1-half-of-global-wealth-owned-by-the-1-percent/)) We hear plenty of talk about the wealth and power of the top 1 percent of people in the United States, but the global wealth gap is even worse. Oxfam International, which has been working for decades to fight global poverty, released a January 2015 report showing that **by the end of this year, the wealthiest 1 percent will control more wealth than everyone else in the world put together. The Oxfam report provided evidence that extreme inequality is not inevitable, but is, in fact, the result of political choices and economic policies established and maintained by the power elite**, wealthy individuals whose strong influence keeps the status quo rigged in their own favor. Another stunning fact: The wealth of 85 of the richest people in the world combined is equal to the wealth of half the world's poor combined. The mainstream news media coverage of the report was spotty at best. A few corporate television networks covered Oxfam's January report.

Oil industry illegally dumps fracking wastewater ** ([Full story here](http://www.projectcensored.org/oil-industry-illegally-dumps-fracking-wastewater/)) Fracking, which involves pumping high-pressure water and chemicals into rock formations to free up oil and natural gas, has been a huge issue nationwide. But there's been little discussion of one of the side effects: The contamination of aquifers. The Center for Biological Diversity reported in 2014 that **oil companies had dumped almost 3 billion gallons of fracking wastewater into California's underground water supply. Since the companies refuse to say what chemicals they use in the process, nobody knows exactly what the level of contamination is.** But wells that supply drinking water near where the fracking waste was dumped tested high in arsenic, thallium and nitrates. Although corporate media have covered debate over fracking regulations, the study regarding the dumping of wastewater into California's aquifers went all but ignored at first. There appears to have been a lag of more than three months between the initial independent news coverage of the Center for Biological Diversity revelations and corporate coverage. **Sources:** Dan Bacher, \"Massive Dumping of Wastewater into Aquifers Shows Big Oil's Power in California,\" [IndyBay](http://tinyurl.com/DumpingWastewater), Oct. 11, 2014. \"California Aquifers Contaminated with Billions of Gallons of Fracking Wastewater,\" [Russia Today](http://tinyurl.com/nbtoa6j), Oct. 11, 2014.

Popular resistance to corporate water grabbing** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/4-popular-resistance-to-corporate-water-grabbing/)) For decades, private companies have been trying to take over and control water supplies, particularly in the developing world. Now, as journalist Ellen Brown reported in March 2015, **corporate water barons, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, the Carlyle Group and other investment firms \"are purchasing water rights from around the world at an unprecedented pace.\" However, over the past 15 years, more than 180 communities have fought back and remunicipalized their water systems.** From Spain to Buenos Aires, Cochabamba to Kazakhstan, Berlin to Malaysia, water privatization is being aggressively rejected. Meanwhile, in the United States, some cities-in what may be a move toward privatization-are radically raising water rates and cutting off service to low-income communities. The mainstream media response to the privatization of water has been largely silence. **Sources:** Ellen Brown, \"California Water Wars: Another Form of Asset Stripping?,\" [Nation of Change](http://tinyurl.com/CaliforniaWaterWars), March 25, 2015.

But the story has largely disappeared from the news. The continued dumping of extremely radioactive cooling water into the Pacific Ocean from the destroyed nuclear plant, already being detected along the Japanese coastline, has the potential to impact entire portions of the Pacific Ocean and North America's western shoreline. Aside from the potential release of plutonium into the Pacific Ocean, Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) recently admitted that the facility is releasing large quantities of water contaminated with tritium, cesium and strontium into the ocean every day. **The plant's owner, Tokyo Electric Power Co., \"admitted that the facility is releasing a whopping 150 billion becquerels of tritium and 7 billion becquerels of cesium- and strontium-contaminated water into the ocean every day.\" The potential for long-term problems all over the world is huge-and the situation hasn't been contained. ** **Sources:** \"TEPCO Drops Bombshell About Sea Releases; 8 Billion Bq Per Day,\" [Simply Info: The Fukushima Project](http://www.fukuleaks.org/web/?p=13700), Aug. 26, 2014.

Methane and arctic warming's global impacts ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/6-methane-and-arctic-warmings-global-impacts/)) Carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are a threat to climate stability. But there's another giant threat that hasn't made much news. **The arctic ice sheets, which are rapidly melting in some areas, contain massive amounts of methane-a greenhouse gas that's way worse than carbon dioxide. As the ice recedes, that methane is getting released into the atmosphere. **All predictions about the pace of global warming and its impacts might have to be re-evaluated in the wake of revelations about methane releases. A 2013 study, published in *Nature*, reported that a 50-gigaton 'burp' of methane is 'highly possible at any time.' That would be the equivalent of at least 1,000 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Since 1850, humans have released a total of about 1,475 gigatons in carbon dioxide. A massive, sudden change in methane levels could lead to temperature increases of 4 to 6 degrees Celsius in just one or two decades. Such changes would have \"unprecedented effects\" for life on Earth. A huge story? Apparently not. The major news media have made very little mention of the methane monster. **Sources:** Dahr Jamail, \"The Methane Monster Roars,\" [Truthout](http://tinyurl.com/MethaneMonsters), Jan. 13, 2015. **7.

Fear of government spying is chilling writers' freedom of expression ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/7-fear-of-government-spying-is-chilling-writers-freedom-of-expression/)) Writers in Western liberal democracies may not face the type of censorship seen in some parts of the world, but their fear of government surveillance is still causing many to think twice about what they can say. Lauren McCauley, writing in Common Dreams, quoted one of the conclusions from a report by the writers' group PEN America: If writers avoid exploring topics for fear of possible retribution, the material available to readers-particularly those seeking to understand the most controversial and challenging issues facing the world today-may be greatly impoverished. A PEN America survey showed that **34 percent of writers in liberal democracies reported some degree of self-censorship, compared with 61 percent of writers living in authoritarian countries, and 44 percent in semi-democratic countries.** Almost 60 percent of the writers from Western Europe, the United States ... indicated that U.S. credibility 'has been significantly damaged for the long term' by revelations of the U.S. government surveillance programs. Other than Common Dreams, the PEN report attracted almost no major media attention. **Sources:** Lauren McCauley, \"Fear of Government Spying 'Chilling' Writers' Speech Worldwide,\" [Common Dreams](http://tinyurl.com/GovernmentSpying), Jan. 5, 2015.

Who dies at the hands of police-and how often ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/8-who-dies-at-the-hands-of-us-police-and-how-often/)) High-profile police killings, particularly of black men, have made big news over the past few years. But there's been much less attention paid to the overall numbers-and to the difference between how many people are shot by cops in the U.S. and in other countries. In the January 2015 edition of Liberation, Richard Becker, relying on public records, concluded that **the rate of U.S. police killing was 100 times that of England, 40 times that of Germany and 20 times the rate in Canada.** In June 2015, the *Guardian* concluded that 102 unarmed people were killed by U.S. police in the first five months of that year-twice the rate reported by the government. Furthermore, the *Guardian* wrote, \"black Americans are more than twice as likely to be unarmed when killed during encounters with police as white people.\" The paper concluded that, \"32 percent of black people killed by police in 2015 were unarmed, as were 25 percent of Hispanic and Latino people, compared with 15 percent of white people killed.\" And as far as accountability goes, **the *Washington Post* noted that in 385 cases of police killings, only three officers faced charges. ** **Sources:**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__censored__media-censorship-15.txt:4:7e9e7d956bec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12299, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__censored__media-censorship-15.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__censored__media-censorship-15", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "the *Guardian* wrote, \"black Americans are more than twice as likely to be unarmed when killed during encounters with police as white people.\" The paper concluded that, \"32 percent of black people killed by police in 2015 were unarmed, as were 25 percent of Hispanic and Latino people, compared with 15 percent of white people killed.\" And as far as accountability goes, **the *Washington Post* noted that in 385 cases of police killings, only three officers faced charges. ** **Sources:** Richard Becker, \"U.S. Cops Kill at 100 Times Rate of Other Capitalist Countries,\" [Liberation](http://tinyurl.com/nntxdrm/), Jan. 4, 2015.

Millions in poverty get less media coverage than billionaires do ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/9-millions-in-poverty-get-less-media-coverage-than-billionaires-do/)) The news media in the U.S. doesn't like to talk about poverty, but they love to report on the lives and glory of the super-rich. **The advocacy group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) analyzed the three major television news networks and found that 482 billionaires got more attention than the 50 million people who live in poverty.** This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who follows the mainstream media, or pays much attention to the world of social media. The top rung of society gets vast amounts of attention, for good and for ill-but the huge numbers of people who are homeless, hungry and often lacking in hope just aren't news. The notion that the wealthiest nation on Earth has 1 in every 6 of its citizens living at or below the poverty threshold reflects not a lack of resources, but a lack of policy focus and attention-and this is due to a lack of public awareness to the issue. The FAIR study showed that between January 2013 and February 2014, an average of only 2.7 seconds per every 22-minute episode discussed poverty in some format. During the 14-month study, FAIR found just 23 news segments that addressed poverty. **Sources:** \"Millions in Poverty Get Less Coverage Than 482 Billionaires,\" [Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting](http://tinyurl.com/MillionsinPoverty), June 26, 2014.

The [first of the two NAS reports](http://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/public-release-event-climate-intervention-reports) found that most proposals to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere-through processes such as fertilizing the ocean with iron to dissolve carbon dioxide-are too expensive to be widely implemented. The [Academy's second report](http://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/public-release-event-climate-intervention-reports) evaluated proposals to seed the atmosphere with particles to reflect sunlight back into space, a process known as albedo modification. **20. FBI Seeks Backdoors in New Communications Technology ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/20-fbi-seeks-backdoors-in-new-communications-technology/)) Responding to announcements by Apple and Google that they would make customers' smartphone and computer data more secure, in Oct. 2014 the FBI's director James Comey announced that the Bureau was seeking to enlarge its data collection capabilities to include direct access to cell phones, tablets, and computers through an expansion of the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. Comey proclaimed that expanding surveillance was in the interest of \"public safety\" to protect the nation against \"potential terrorist threats.\" **21. The New Amazon of the North: Canadian Deforestation ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/21-the-new-amazon-of-the-north-canadian-deforestation/)) Since 2000, Canada has led the world in deforestation, despite being overshadowed by reports of the forests in Brazil and Indonesia. With only 10 percent of the world's forests, Canada now accounts for 21 percent of all deforestation in the world. Surges in oil sands and shale gas development, logging, and road expansion have been the major contributors to the destruction of Canada's forests. Deforestation by Canada and other countries deposits more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than does all of the world's transportation machinery. **22. Global Killing of Environmentalists Rises Drastically ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/22-global-killing-of-environmentalists-rises-drastically/)) From 2002 to 2013, at least 908 people were killed globally due to their environmental advocacy, with the rate of murder doubling in the last four years. Latin America and Asia show the highest rates of violence as tensions over limited natural resources in these regions escalate. Brazil remains overwhelmingly more dangerous for environmentalists than other countries; twice as many environmentalists were killed in Brazil as in any other country. However, Brazil is just one especially striking case in what is a global trend. **23.

A five-month [study conducted by CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rape-kits-data-by-the-numbers) in 2009 had found a minimum of at least 20,000 unprocessed rape kits across the US. **24. NSA's AURORAGOLD Program Hacks Cell Phones around World ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/24-nsas-auroragold-program-hacks-cell-phones-around-world-2/)) The NSA has hacked cell phone networks worldwide for many years. At least nine NSA documents that show how the NSA has spied on hundreds of companies, as well as other countries that are close to the US. Through a secret program codenamed AURORAGOLD, the NSA sought security weaknesses in cell phone technology to exploit for surveillance. The documents also revealed NSA plans \"to secretly introduce new flaws into communication systems,\" which would make those systems easier for the NSA to access. **25. Greenland's Meltwater Contributes to Rising Sea Levels** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/25-greenlands-meltwater-contributes-to-rising-sea-levels/)) Atmospheric warming is capable of reaching thousands of meters below Greenland's massive ice sheet, potentially increasing the glaciers' rate of flow and creating pools of \"meltwater\" trapped below the ice. Two separate but related studies confirmed that surface melt can drain down to fill concealed lakes under the ice, ultimately contributing to rising sea levels. **Important: Top 20 Articles Ever Published Revealing Media Censorship** For concise summaries of the top 20 most revealing articles ever published in the major media with links to the full articles on their media websites, see [www.WantToKnow.info/newsarticles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newsarticles).

Bush is remembered largely for his role in curbing civil liberties in the name of his \"war on terror.\" **But it's President Obama who signed the 2012 NDAA, including its clause allowing for indefinite detention without trial for terrorism suspects. **Obama promised he would \"interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict\" - leaving us adrift if and when the next administration chooses to interpret them otherwise. Another law of concern is the National Defense Resources Preparedness Executive Order that Obama issued in March 2012. That order authorizes the President, \"in the event of a potential threat to the security of the United States, to take actions necessary to ensure the availability of adequate resources and production capability, including services and critical technology, for national defense requirements.\" **Sources:** Spencer Ackerman and Noah Shachtman, \"[Read the FBI Memo: Agents Can 'Suspend the Law](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/03/fbi-memo-bend-suspend-law/),'\" Wired, March 28, 2012, James Bamford, \"[The NSA Is Building the Country's Biggest Spy Center](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter),\" Wired, March 15, 2012, Chris Hedges, \"[Why I'm Suing Barack Obama](http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/why_im_suing_barack_obama_20120116),\" Truthdig, January 16, 2012, . **2.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__censored__media_censorship_12.txt:0:2800686f9c26", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12306, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__censored__media_censorship_12.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__censored__media_censorship_12", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "a potential threat to the security of the United States, to take actions necessary to ensure the availability of adequate resources and production capability, including services and critical technology, for national defense requirements.\" **Sources:** Spencer Ackerman and Noah Shachtman, \"[Read the FBI Memo: Agents Can 'Suspend the Law](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/03/fbi-memo-bend-suspend-law/),'\" Wired, March 28, 2012, James Bamford, \"[The NSA Is Building the Country's Biggest Spy Center](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter),\" Wired, March 15, 2012, Chris Hedges, \"[Why I'm Suing Barack Obama](http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/why_im_suing_barack_obama_20120116),\" Truthdig, January 16, 2012, . **2. Oceans in Peril ** The collapse of our oceans could compromise life itself. In a haunting article in ***Mother Jones* reporter Julia Whitty paints a tenuous seascape - overfished, acidified, warming - and describes how the destruction of the ocean's complex ecosystems jeopardizes the entire planet,** not just the 70 percent that is water. Whitty compares ocean acidification, caused by global warming, to acidification that was one of the causes of the \"Great Dying,\" a mass extinction 252 million years ago. Life on earth took 30 million years to recover. In a more hopeful story, a study of 14 protected and 18 non-protected ecosystems in the Mediterranean Sea showed dangerous levels of biomass depletion. But it also showed that the marine reserves were well-enforced, with five to 10 times larger fish populations than in unprotected areas. This encourages establishment and maintenance of more reserves. **Sources:** Julia Whitty, \"[The End of a Myth](http://www.onearth.org/article/the-end-of-a-myth),\" OnEarth, February 27, 2012, Richard Gray, \"[Warming Oceans Cause Largest Movement of Marine Species in Two Million Years](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/8598597/Warming-oceans-cause-largest-movement-of-marine-species-in-two-million-years.html),\" Telegraph (UK), June 26, 2011, David A.

US Deaths From Fukushima Not Reported** A plume of toxic fallout floated to the US after Japan's tragic Fukushima nuclear disaster on March 11, 2011. The US Environmental Protection Agency found radiation levels in air, water, and milk that were hundreds of times higher than normal across the United States. One month later, the EPA announced that radiation levels had declined, and they would cease testing. But after making a Freedom of Information Act request, journalist Lucas Hixson published emails revealing that on March 24, 2011, the task of collecting nuclear data had been handed off from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to the Nuclear Energy Institute, a nuclear industry lobbying group. And in one study that got little attention, **scientists Joseph Mangano and Janette Sherman found that in the period following the Fukushima meltdowns, 14,000 more deaths than average were reported in the US, mostly among infants. ** **Source:** Joseph Mangano and Janette Sherman, \"[14,000 U.S. Deaths Tied to Fukushima Reactor Disaster Fallout](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medical-journal-article--14000-us-deaths-tied-to-fukushima-reactor-disaster-fallout-135859288.html),\" International Journal of Health Services, December 19, 2011, Alex Roslin, \"[What Are Officials Hiding about Fukushima?](http://straight.com/article-491941/vancouver/what-are-officials-hiding-about-fukushima?page=0,1)\" Straight.com (Vancouver), October 20, 2011, Danny Schechter, \"[Beyond Fukushima: A World in Denial about Nuclear Risks](http://www.commondreams.org/view/2011/03/21-0),\" Common Dreams, March 21, 2011. **4.

FBI Informants Carried Out Terrorist Plots Under FBI Direction** We know that FBI agents go into communities such as mosques, both undercover and in the guise of building relationships, quietly gathering information about individuals. This is part of an approach to finding what the FBI now considers the most likely kind of terrorists, \"lone wolves.\" Its strategy: \"seeking to identify those disgruntled few who might participate in a plot given the means and the opportunity. And then, in case after case, the government provides the plot, the means, and the opportunity,\" writes *Mother Jones* journalist Trevor Aaronson. 508 cases classified as terrorism-related have come before the US Department of Justice since the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. **In 243 of these cases, an informant was involved; in 49 cases, an informant actually led the plot. **And \"with three exceptions, all of the high-profile domestic terror plots of the last decade were actually FBI stings.\" **Sources:** Trevor Aronson, \"[The Informants](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/08/fbi-terrorist-informants),\" *Mother Jones*, September/October 2011, [FBI Organizes Almost All Terror Plots in the US](http://rt.com/usa/news/fbi-terror-report-plot-365-899/print),\" RT.com, August 23, 2011 **5. Federal Reserve Secretly Loaned Over $1 Trillion to Major Banks** The Federal Reserve, the US's quasi-private central bank, was audited for the first time in its history this year. The audit report states, \"From late 2007 through mid-2010, Reserve Banks provided more than a trillion dollars ... in emergency loans to the financial sector.\" **These loans had significantly less interest and fewer conditions than the high-profile TARP bailouts, and were rife with conflicts of interest.** The audit was restricted to Federal Reserve lending during the financial crisis. On July 25, 2012, a bill to audit the Fed again, with fewer limitations, authored by Rep. Ron Paul, passed the House of Representatives. HR459 was expected to die in the Senate, but the movement behind Paul and his calls to hold the Fed accountable, or abolish it altogether, seem to be growing. **Source:** Matthew Cardinale, \"[First Federal Reserve Audit Reveals Trillions in Secret Bailout](http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2011/08/28-3),\" Inter Press Service, Common Dreams, August 28, 2011. **6.

The International Year of the Cooperative** The corporate media barely mentioned the UN declaring 2012 to be the International Year of the Cooperative, based on the coop business model's stunning growth. The UN found that, in 2012, one billion people worldwide are coop member-owners, or one in five adults over the age of 15. The largest is Spain's Mondragon Corporation, with over 80,000 member-owners. **The UN predicts that by 2025, worker-owned coops will be the world's fastest growing business model.** Worker-owned cooperatives provide for equitable distribution of wealth and, just maybe, a brighter future for our planet. **Sources:** Jessica Reeder, \"[The Year of the Cooperative](http://www.yesmagazine.org/new-economy/2012-the-year-of-the-cooperative),\" *Yes!

NATO War Crimes in Libya** In January 2012, **the BBC \"revealed\" how British Special Forces agents joined and \"blended in\" with rebels in Libya to help topple dictator Muammar Gadaffi,** a story that alternative media sources had reported a year earlier. NATO admits to bombing a pipe factory in the Libyan city of Brega that was key to the water supply system that brought tap water to 70 percent of Libyans, saying that Gadaffi was storing weapons in the factory.

Prison Slavery in the US** On its website, the UNICOR manufacturing corporation proudly proclaims that its products are \"made in America.\" That's true, but they're made in places in the US where labor laws don't apply, with **workers often paid just 23 cents an hour to be exposed to toxic materials with no legal recourse.** These places are US prisons. The majority of products manufactured by inmates are contracted to the Department of Defense. Inmates make complex parts for missile systems, battleship anti-aircraft guns, and landmine sweepers, as well as night-vision goggles, body army, and camouflage uniforms. Of course, this is happening in the context of record high imprisonment in the US, where grossly disproportionate numbers of African Americans and Latinos are imprisoned, and can't vote even after they're freed.

The law specifies as criminal offenses the acts of entering or remaining in areas defined as \"restricted.\" Although pundits have debated to what extent the new law restricts First Amendment rights or criminalizes Occupy protests,** it does make it easier for the Secret Service to overuse or misuse existing laws to arrest lawful protesters** by lowering the requirement of intent in the prosecution of criminal activity. **Sources:** Danny Weil, \"[Many Forms of Occupy Protests Subjected to New Bill Making Protests Illegal](http://www.dailycensored.com/many-forms-of-occupy-protests-subjected-to-new-bill-making-protests-illegal/),\" TheDaily Censored (blog), March 5, 2012, Oskar Mosquito, \"[NDAA: Limiting Protesters' Rights](http://mediaroots.org/enacting-the-ndaa-limiting-protesters-rights),\" Media Roots, March 5, 2012, Brian Doherty, \"[Bill Passes House](http://reason.com/blog/2012/03/01/bill-passes-house-protests-near-secret-s),\" Reason (blog), March 1, 2012. **More of the Top 25 Media Censorship Stories of 2012** **11. Members of Congress Grow Wealthier Despite Recession** The net worth of the members of Congress continues to rise regardless of the economic recession. An analysis of financial disclosure forms, using the minimum valuation of assets, showed that members of the House and Senate in 2010 had a collective net worth of $2.04 billion, a $390 million increase from the $1.65 billion held in 2008.

Disclosure forms do not include non-income-producing assets. **12. US Joins Forces with al-Qaeda in Syria** The US, Britain, France, and some conservative Arab allies have funded and armed the Syrian rebellion from its start in 2011. In fact, the US has been funding groups against Bashar al-Assad since the mid-1990s. However, the anti-Assad ranks include members of al-Qaeda, Hamas, and other groups that the United States lists as terrorist organizations. **13. Education \"Reform\" a Trojan Horse for Privatization ** Public education is the target of a well-coordinated, well-funded campaign to privatize as many schools as possible, particularly in cities. This campaign claims it wants great teachers in every classroom, but its rhetoric demoralizes teachers, reduces the status of the education profession, and champions standardized tests that perpetuate social inequality. The driving logic for such reform is profits. **14. Who Are the Top 1 Percent and How Do They Earn a Living?** The richest 1 percent of the country now owns more than 40 percent of the wealth and takes home nearly a quarter of national income. Evidence based on tax returns indicates that this superelite 1 percent consists of nonfinancial executives, financial professionals, and members of the legal, real estate, and medical professions. While the 99 percent deal with the direct consequences of that crisis, the 1 percent increasingly have left behind deteriorating neighborhoods in favor of wealthy enclaves, further isolating themselves. **15. Dangers of Everyday Technology ** Recent research raises compelling concerns about two commonplace technologies, cellular phones and microwave ovens. Heavy, long-term exposure to cell phone radiation increases risks for certain types of cancer, including leukemia, and in males impairs sperm production. Prenatal exposure to cell phone radiation has been shown to produce blood-brain barrier leakage, and brain, liver, and eye damage. The microwave radiation that heats food also creates free radicals that can become carcinogenic. Most studies indicating minimal or no health risks are, in fact, industry-sponsored. **16. Sexual Violence Against Women Soldiers on the Rise and Under Wraps ** The 2005 death of US Army Private LaVena Johnson was officially ruled suicide by the Dept. of Defense. Johnson's autopsy revealed wounds inconsistent with suicide, including chemical burns that many believe were intended to destroy DNA evidence of rape. The Pentagon has tried to intimidate reporters working on stories about her. At least twenty other female soldiers have died under suspicious circumstances. According to the Department of Defense, in 2010, there were 3,158 total reports of sexual assault in the military. The DOD estimates that this number", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__censored__media_censorship_12.txt:5:0df50a102e27", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12311, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__censored__media_censorship_12.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__censored__media_censorship_12", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "LaVena Johnson was officially ruled suicide by the Dept. of Defense.

According to the Department of Defense, in 2010, there were 3,158 total reports of sexual assault in the military. The DOD estimates that this number represents only 13.5 percent of the actual assaults. **17. Students Crushed By One Trillion Dollars in Student Loans** In April 2012, US student loan debt topped one trillion dollars, more than credit card debt. Although corporate media dutifully reported this milestone, they underplayed its significance and ignored one promising solution. Student loan debt is the only form of consumer loan debt that has increased substantially since 2008. The threat of massive student loan defaults requiring another taxpayer bailout is a systemic risk as serious as the bank failures that brought the US economy to the brink of collapse in 2008. **18. Palestinian Women Prisoners Shackled during Childbirth** Female Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons are treated inhumanely and often denied medical care, and legal representation, and are forced to live in squalid conditions. The conditions and violations faced by women in Israeli jails need to be addressed from a gender perspective, according to CEDAW, the United Nation's Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. **19. New York Police Plant Drugs on Innocent People to Meet Arrest Quotas ** A host of stories document how the New York Police Department operates outside the very laws it is charged with enforcing. In October 2011, a former NYPD narcotics detective testified that he regularly saw police plant drugs on innocent people as a way to meet arrest quotas. The NYPD's controversial \"stop and frisk\" program has invested seventy-five million dollars to arrest suspects for possessing minimal amounts of marijuana. Each arrest costs approximately $1,000 to $2,000. **20. Stealing From Public Education to Feed the Prison-Industrial Complex ** A systemic recasting of education priorities gives official structure and permanence to a preexisting underclass comprised largely of poor people of color. The rise of corporate-backed charter schools and privatized prisons cannot be understood apart from the record closures of public schools across the country. **21. Conservatives Attack US Post Office to Break the Union and Privatize Postal Services ** The US Postal Service has been under constant assault for years from conservative Republicans who aim to eviscerate the strongest union in the country. Under a 2006 postal act, USPS must fully fund retiree health benefits for future retirees-including the retirement packages of employees not even born yet. No other organization, public or private, has to pre-fund 100 percent of its future health benefits.

No other organization, public or private, has to pre-fund 100 percent of its future health benefits. Thus, the post office's oft-reported nine-billion-dollar deficit is largely a result of government-imposed overpayments. **22. Wachovia Bank Laundered Money for Latin American Drug Cartels ** Between 2004 and 2007, Wachovia Bank handled funds totaling $378.4 billion for Mexican currency-exchange houses acting on behalf of drug cartels. The transactions amount to the largest violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, an anti-money-laundering law, in US history. This case is not exceptional; Wachovia is just one of several US and European banks that drug cartels have used to launder money. **23. US Covers up Afghan Massacre ** Although the March 2012 massacre of sixteen unarmed Afghan civilians, nine of whom were children, received a great deal of news coverage, independent news sources have focused on whether one US solider acting alone-as US officials have insisted-or multiple US soldiers-as Afghan witnesses and Afghan President Hamid Karzai contend-bear direct responsibility for the killings. **24. Alabama Farmers Look to Replace Migrants with Prisoners ** Alabama's expansive anti-immigrant law, HB56, has been so economically devastating that farmers in the state sought legislation to force hard labor on prison inmates eligible for work release programs, to \"help farms fill the gap and find sufficient labor.\" The state's Department of Corrections opposed the legislation, noting that its approximately 2,000 prisoners eligible for work release already have jobs, and that \"the prison system isn't the solution to worker shortages caused by the law.\" **25. Evidence Points to Guantanamo Dryboarding** In June 2006, three Guantanamo prisoners were found dead in their cells, hanging from what appeared to be makeshift nooses. Although the Department of Defense declared the deaths suicides, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) inquiry found evidence inconsistent with suicide-including the fact that the prisoners' hands were bound behind their backs. The NCIS evidence suggests that the prisoners died from lethal interrogations that included dryboarding, a technique using controlled suffocation. **Note:** Project Censored also recognizes the importance of defining and protecting the \"Commons\" as essential to a meaningful future.

All of these bills were inspired by the Bank of North Dakota (BND), the nation's only state-owned bank. While other states are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, the state of North Dakota continues to report surpluses.

Ocean Acidification Increasing at Unprecedented Rate ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/1-ocean-acidification-increasing-unprecedented-rate/)) Our oceans are acidifying - even if the nightly news hasn't told you yet. It's well known that burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide into the air. Less understood is that 25% of this carbon dioxide is absorbed by oceans. **The average acidity of surface ocean waters worldwide is more than 30% greater than at the start of the industrial revolution.** **The rising carbon dioxide in our oceans burns up and deforms the smallest, most abundant food at the bottom of the food chain**. One vulnerable population is the tiny sea butterfly. In only a few short decades, the death and deformation of this fragile species could endanger predators all along the oceanic food web, scientists warn. This \"butterfly effect\" threatens fisheries that feed over 1 billion people worldwide. Our oceans may slowly cook our food chain into new forms with potentially catastrophic consequences. Scientists initially believed that fish would not be directly affected by ocean acidification, but recent research indicates otherwise. From clownfish (remember Nemo?) to walleye pollock (got fish sticks?) scientists have found that exposure to high levels of carbon dioxide", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__censored__press-censorship-14.txt:0:171fb64bbb89", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12318, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__censored__press-censorship-14.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__censored__press-censorship-14", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "this fragile species could endanger predators all along the oceanic food web, scientists warn.

There is little funding for research on ocean acidification and its affects. **Sources:** Julia Whitty, \"10 Key Findings From a Rapidly Acidifying Arctic Ocean,\" [Mother Jones report](http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/05/arctic-ocean-rapidly-getting-more-acidic), May 7, 2013.

Top Ten US Aid Recipients All Practice Torture ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/2-top-ten-us-aid-recipients-practice-torture/)) Sexual abuse, children kept in cages, extra-judicial murder. While these sound like horrors the US would never support, the reverse is true: **The top ten nations receiving US foreign assistance in fiscal year 2014 all are known to practice torture, and at least half are reported to be doing so on a massive scale.** Yet, the US is a signatory of the United Nations' Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Israel received over $3 billion in US aid for fiscal year 2013-14, according to a Congressional Research Service report. Israel was criticized by the country's own Public Defender's Office for torturing children suspected of minor crimes. The next top recipients of US foreign aid were Afghanistan, Egypt, Pakistan, Nigeria, Jordan, Iraq, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. All countries were accused of torture by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. When the US funds a highway or other project that it's proud of, it plants a huge sign proclaiming \"your tax dollars at work.\" When the US funds torturers, the corporate media bury the story, or worse, don't report it at all. **Sources:** Daniel Wickham, \"Top 10 US Aid Recipients All Practice Torture,\" [Left Foot Forward article](http://www.leftfootforward.org/2014/01/top-ten-us-aid-recipients-all-practice-torture), January 30, 2014. **3. Trans-Pacific Partnership: Secret Deal to Help Corporations** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/3-wikileaks-revelations-trans-pacific-partnership-ignored-corporate-media/)) On Nov. 13, 2013, WikiLeaks published a section of a trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership Treaty, or TPP. On the surface, the treaty is meant to facilitate trade among Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US, and Vietnam. However, there are a number of red flags. Eight hundred million people, and one-third of all world trade, stand to be affected by the treaty, yet** only three people from each member nation have access to the entire document.

Many criticized the secrecy surrounding the TPP, arguing the real world consequences may be grave. Doctors Without Borders wrote, \"If harmful provisions in the US proposals for the [TPP] agreement are not removed before it is finalized, this trade deal will have a real cost in human lives.\" **Source:** \"Secret Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP),\" [WikiLeaks release](https://wikileaks.org/tpp), Nov. 13, 2013.

Corporate Internet Providers Threaten Net Neutrality** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/4-corporate-internet-providers-threaten-net-neutrality/)) As this year's book from Project Censored went to press, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had just publicly revealed its proposed new rules for Internet traffic. A 3-2 vote by the FCC opened a four-month window for formal public comments on how strict those rules should be, and galvanized corporate media attention on the issue of net neutrality. By contrast, for months leading up to this development, independent journalists had been informing the public about the anticipated showdown over net neutrality and the stakes in that battle with virtually no media coverage. **Since then, Verizon v. FCC has been well covered by both corporate and independent media. However, corporate outlets such as the New York Times and Forbes tend to highlight the business aspects of the case,** skimming over vital particulars affecting the public and the Internet's future. **Sources:** Paul Ausick, \"Verizon Goes After FCC in Court Monday,\" [24/7 Wall St. report](http://247wallst.com/telecom-wireless/2013/09/09/verizon-goes-after-fcc-in-court-monday), September 9, 2013.

Bankers Remain on Wall Street Despite Major Crimes ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/5-bankers-back-wall-street-despite-major-crimes/)) Bankers responsible for rigging municipal bonds and bilking billions of dollars from American cities have largely escaped criminal charges. Dominick Carollo, Steven Goldberg, and Peter Grimm were dubbed a part of the \"modern American mafia,\" by the Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi, one of the few journalists to consistently cover their trial. **Every day in the US, low-level drug dealers get more prison time than these scheming bankers who rigged auctions of municipal bonds, essentially stealing from projects intended to build public schools, hospitals, libraries, and nursing homes in virtually every US state.** The three had been convicted in 2012 for this. However, in November 2013, those convictions were reversed on a technicality: Because it took federal prosecutors so long to build the massive case, the statute of limitations ran out. Meanwhile, disturbingly uninformed cable media \"journalists\" defended the bankers, saying they shouldn't be prosecuted for \"failure,\" as if cheating vulnerable Americans were a bad business deal. Over the course of decades, the nation's bankers transformed into the modern mafioso. Unfortunately, our modern media changed as well, and are no longer equipped to tackle systemic, complex stories. **Sources:** Matt Taibbi, \"Another Batch of Wall Street Villains Freed on Technicality,\" [Rolling Stone article](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/another-batch-of-wall-street-villains-freed-on-technicality-20131204), Dec. 4, 2013.

The Deep State: Government \"Without Reference to the Consent of the Governed\"** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/6-deep-state-government-without-reference-consent-governed/)) Concerned citizens are condemning the US government's lack of transparency, accountability, and honest constituent representation. Mike Lofgren, a congressional staff member for 28 years specializing in national security, addressed the issue of the \"deep state\" that undemocratically orchestrates unchecked private agendas, while corporate media distract the public's attention by focusing on traditional Washington partisan politics. Lofgren contended that, although the deep state is \"neither omniscient nor invincible,\" it is a \"relentlessly well entrenched,\" association of elements of government and parts of top-level finance and industry that is effectively able to govern the US without reference to the consent of the governed.\" **Rep.

FBI Dismisses Murder Plot against Occupy as NSA Cracks Down on Dissent ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/7-fbi-dismisses-murder-plot-occupy-leaders-nsa-big-business-cracks-dissent/)) In October 2011, when the Occupy movement arrived in Houston, protesters were subject to local and federal surveillance, infiltration by police provocateurs, and police assault. Months later,** a document obtained in December 2012 from the Houston FBI office shows that the agency was aware of a plot to assassinate Occupy movement leaders-and did nothing about it.** And in Arizona, law enforcement collaborated with JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon divulging Occupy plans. The CEO claimed he was simply avoiding possible protests, and local law enforcement was happy to help. Government documents from the National Security Agency and other government offices revealed a grim mosaic of 'counter-terrorism' operations and negative attitudes toward activists and other citizens. **Sources:** Dave Lindorff, \"FBI Document-'[DELETED]' Plots to Kill Occupy Leaders',\" [WhoWhatWhy article](http://whowhatwhy.com/2013/06/27/fbi-document-deleted-plots-to-kill-occupy-leaders-if-deemed-necessary), June 27, 2013.

Ignoring Extreme Weather Connection to Global Warming ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/8-corporate-news-ignores-connections-extreme-weather-global-warming/)) News analyses have found mainstream media frequently report on severe weather changes without discussing global warming as a possible cause.** A study by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting found extreme weather events in 2013 spurred 450 broadcast news segments, only 16 of which even mentioned climate change.** National news outlets have fallen on the job as well, as The New York Times recently shuttered its environmental desk and its Green blog, reducing the number of reporters exclusively chasing down climate change stories. Unlike many journalists, ordinary people often recognize the threat of our warming planet. Over 400,000 protested in the People's Climate March in New York City alone, while simultaneous protests erupted across the globe, calling for government, corporate, and media leaders to address the problem. **Sources:** Peter Hart, \"Weather-Without Climate,\" [Extra! report](http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/weather-without-climate) (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting), Dec. 2, 2013.

US Media Hypocrisy in Covering Ukraine Crisis ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/9-us-media-hypocrisy-covering-ukraine-crisis/)) **The US battle with Russia over Ukraine's independence is actually an energy pipeline squabble, a narrative lost by mainstream media coverage.** Russian President Vladimir Putin has drawn fire from the media as a tyrant, without complex analyses of his country's socio-economic interests. As the media often do, they have turned the conflict into a cult of personality, talking up Putin's shirtless horseback riding and his hard-line style with deftness missing from their political analysis. Secretary of State John Kerry declaimed the Russian intervention as \"a nineteenth-century act in the twenty-first century.\" What Russia's US critics seem to forget is the United States' own history of overthrowing democratic governments, including the invasion of Iraq, which Kerry supported. Corporate media also fail to acknowledge that Putin ordered the occupation of Kiev after a coup led at least partly by neo-Nazis-conditions arguably less criminal than the US invasion of Iraq, which the US legitimized with false claims. **Sources:** Robert Perry, \"America's Staggering Hypocrisy,\" [Consortium News article](http://consortiumnews.com/2014/03/04/americas-staggering-hypocrisy), March 4, 2014.

World Health Organization Suppresses Report on Iraqi Cancers and Birth Defects ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/10-world-health-organization-suppresses-report-iraqi-cancers-birth-defects/)) The United States' legacy in Iraq possibly goes beyond death to a living nightmare of cancer and birth defects, due to the military's use of depleted uranium weapons, a World Health Organization study found. Iraq is poisoned. Much of the report's contents were leaked to the BBC during its creation. But the release of the report, completed in 2012 by WHO, has stalled. **Critics claim the US is deliberately blocking its release, masking a damning Middle East legacy rivaling the horrors of Agent Orange in Vietnam.** But Iraq will never forget the US intervention, as mothers cradle babies deformed from the womb, the continuing gifts of our invasion. **Sources:** Denis Halliday, \"WHO Refuses to Publish Report on Cancers and Birth Defects in Iraq Caused by Depleted Uranium Ammunition,\" [Global Research article](http://www.globalresearch.ca/who-refuses-to-publish-report-on-cancers-and-birth-defects-in-iraq-caused-by-depleted-uranium-ammunition/5349556), September 13, 2013.

However, many think tanks-including the Brookings Institution, Heritage Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, Cato Institute, and the RAND Corporation, among others-receive significant financial backing from extremely wealthy corporations and/or individuals. Because the law does not require public disclosure of donors' identities, these relationships raise the issue of whether think tanks' analyses and recommendations are tainted by donor agendas. **12. Pentagon Awash in Money Despite Serious Audit Problems** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/12-pentagon-awash-money-despite-serious-audit-problems/)) Congress is expanding the Pentagon's 2014 budget by $32 billion. The Pentagon currently receives over $600 billion, when its current budget is combined with supplemental war funding. One out of every five US tax dollars is spent on defense. Where does the money go? \"The exact answer is a mystery,\" wrote Dave Gilson for Mother Jones. \"That's because the Pentagon's books are a complete mess.\" As the Government Accountability Office dryly noted, the Pentagon has \"serious financial management problems\" that render its financial statements \"inauditable.\" **13. Lawsuit Challenges Nuclear Power Industry Immunity from Liability in Nuclear Accidents ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/13-lawsuit-challenges-nuclear-power-industry-immunity-liability-nuclear-accidents/)) A lawsuit filed by lawyers on behalf of 1,415 plaintiffs, including 38 residents of Fukushima and 357 persons from outside Japan, holds not only the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) but also Toshiba, Hitachi, and General Electric responsible for the 2011 meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Historically, manufacturers and operators of nuclear power plants have been granted immunities in liability for accidents. The Fukushima case is a landmark challenge to nuclear power plant manufacturers' immunity from liability in nuclear accidents. **14. Evidence of Ongoing Wireless Technology Health Hazards ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/14-accumulating-evidence-ongoing-wireless-technology-health-hazards/)) Wireless phones emit radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) when in use. In May 2011, after the consideration of laboratory studies, studies of long-term use of wireless phones, and data on the incidence of brain tumors, the World Health Organization (WHO) determined RF-EMFs to be a \"possible\" human carcinogen. Other studies have shown an association between long-term mobile and cordless phone use with glioma and acoustic neuroma. **15.

The Beef Industry Supports Feeding Cattle Chicken Poop ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/16-beef-industrys-feedlot-feedback-loop/)) The beef industry increasingly feeds cattle \"poultry litter,\" scraped from chicken coop floors, a practice that risks the spread of mad cow disease-yet the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] has done nothing to stop it. In 1997, the FDA made it illegal to feed dead cows to living cows, the main cause of the disease. In response, the beef industry teamed up with the poultry industry to exploit a major loophole in the 1997 law. The poultry industry feeds the dead remains of cattle to chickens and other poultry; the mess created by poultry, known as \"litter,\" is then sold to the cattle producer who feed it to cattle that the public eats. **17. Gaza Running Out of Drinking Water** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/17-2016-will-find-gaza-drinking-water/)) In Gaza, 1.7 million Palestinians currently live without clean drinking water. Over 80 percent of Gazans buy their drinking water, with some families paying as much as a third of their household income. Gaza relies on a single aquifer for all of its fresh water. It is contaminated with sewage, chemicals, and seawater. A recent United Nations report warned that \"the aquifer could become unusable as early as 2016, with the damage irreversible by 2020.\" **18. National Database of Police Killings Aims for Accountability ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/18-national-database-police-killings-aims-accountability/)) Although the FBI tracks how many police officers die in the line of duty, it keeps no such record for how many civilians are killed by police each year. Recognizing a significant gap in the public records of civilian deaths at the hands of law enforcement officers, D. Brian Burghart, the editor of the Reno News & Review and a journalism instructor at University of Nevada, decided to create a public database. Burghart has compiled a list of police agencies across the country to facilitate public record requests about fatal incidents. **19.

As one example among many, in Sept. 2012, Dr. Gilles-éric Séralini [published research](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-study-finds-tumors-rats-fed-monsantos-gm-corn) in the Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology. [His findings](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-smelling-rat-gm-maize-health-the-sralini-affair) showed the toxic impact of Monsanto's herbicide and genetically modified corn. However, after publication, the journal made the unprecedented decision to retract the study. A new connection between the journal and Monsanto might account for the retraction. **20. Estonia a Global Example of E-Government, Digital Freedom, Privacy, and Security ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/20-estonia-global-example-e-government-digital-freedom-privacy-security/)) Since Estonia regained independence in 1991, its government has sought to redesign the nation's entire information infrastructure with goals of openness, privacy, and security. The technology platform that Estonia built to serve its citizens sets an example for the rest of the world. Each citizen has one identification number to use across all systems, from paper passport to bank records to any government office or medical care. This includes giving electronic signatures, filing taxes, and voting. Estonians elect their parliament online, and get their taxes back in two days. **21. Questioning the Charter School Hype ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/21-questioning-charter-school-hype/)) Charter schools have been heralded as the antidote to \"failed\" public schools, especially in poor urban communities of African-American and Latino/a students. Politicians and celebrities alike now advocate charters schools. However, charter schools have come under fire for not fulfilling the roles or achieving the results that their proponents have claimed. Instead of providing positive teaching and preparing children for the future, recent news reports have indicated that charter schools are subjecting students to padded cells, public shaming and embarrassment, poor instruction, and the negative consequences of financial corruption. **22. Corporate News Media Understate Rape, Sexual Violence ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/22-corporate-news-media-understate-rape-sexual-violence/)) Media analysts observe how journalists refrain from using the word \"rape\" to describe incidents of sexual assault. Instead, news outlets downplay the humiliation and cruelty entailed in these acts by referring to them as \"sex crimes,\" \"inappropriate sexual activity,\" or \"forced sex,\" even though such acts are legally recognized as \"rape.\" **23. Number of US Prison Inmates Serving Life Sentences Hits Record ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/23-number-us-prison-inmates-serving-life-sentences-hits-new-record/)) The number of prisoners serving life sentences in the US state and federal prisons reached a new record of over 150,000 in 2012. Of these, 49,000 are serving life without possibility of parole, an increase of 22.2 percent since 2008. Keeping these prisoners locked up for life costs taxpayers around $1.8 billion annually. **24.

Restorative Justice Turns Violent Schools Around ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/24-restorative-justice-turns-violent-schools-around/)) Last year when American Paradigm Schools took over Philadelphia's infamous, failing John Paul Jones Middle School, rather than beef up the already heavy security to ensure safety and restore order, American Paradigm stripped it away. During renovations, they removed both metal detectors and barred windows. The police predicted chaos. But, instead, new numbers seem to show that in a single year the number of serious incidents fell by 90 percent. **25. US Military Balancing Budget on Backs of Disabled Veterans** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/25-chaptered-us-military-seeks-balance-budget-backs-disabled-veterans/)) The US military has been engaged in a policy of forcing wounded and disabled veterans out of service to avoid paying benefits and to make room for new able-bodied recruits. Identifying injured combat soldiers as delinquent and negligent has lead to a practice called \"chaptering out\" which results in those soldiers being forced to leave the military without an honorable discharge. Because of this, thousands of soldiers have been discharged without federal benefits including health care, unemployment, and educational programs. **Inspiring News: ** For summaries of some of the most inspiring major media articles ever published, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles). **Important: Top 20 Articles Ever Published Revealing Press Censorship** For concise summaries of the top 20 most revealing articles ever published in the major media with links to the full articles on their media websites, see [www.WantToKnow.info/newsarticles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newsarticles).

More US Soldiers Committed Suicide Than Died in Combat ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/1-more-us-soldiers-committed-suicide-than-died-in-combat/)) **For the second year (2010) in a row, more US soldiers killed themselves (468) than died in combat (462).** In 2009, the 381 suicides of active-duty soldiers recorded by the military also exceeded the number of deaths in battle. The Good report, which references the Congressional Quarterly as a source, was published in January 2011, just weeks after military authorities announced that a psychological screening program seemed to be stemming the suicide rate among active-duty soldiers. \"This new data, that American soldiers are now more dangerous to themselves than the insurgents, flies right in the face of any suggestion that things are 'working,'\" Good Senior Editor Cord Jefferson wrote. **Sources:** *Good* Report, \"[More US Soldiers Killed Themselves Than Died in Combat in 2010](http://www.good.is/post/more-us-soldiers-killed-themselves-than-died-in-combat-in-2010)\" *Truthdig*, \"[Death and After in Iraq](http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_body_baggers_of_iraq_20110321)\" *Alternet*, \"[Can You Face the True Consequences of War?](http://www.alternet.org/world/150322/can_you_face_the_true_consequences_of_war_the_horrors_of_bagging_soldiers%27_bodies_in_iraq/?page=1)\" **2.

Obama Authorizes International Assassination Campaign** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/3-obama-authorizes-international-assassination-campaign/)) The Obama administration has quietly put into practice an 'incomplete idea' left over from the G.W. Bush presidency: creating a de facto 'presidential international assassination program.'** U.S. citizens suspected of encouraging \"terror\" are being put on \"death lists\" without any due process of law.** The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the U.S. military have the authority to kill U.S. citizens abroad without a trial and outside war zones if strong evidence exists that they're involved in terrorist activity, the Washington Post reported in a front page story. A moral, ethical, and legal analysis of the assassinations seems to be significantly lacking inside the corporate media. In December of 2010, Human Rights Watch asked for clarification of the legal rationale behind this practice after a judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging the notion. **Source:** Human Rights Watch, \"[Letter to President Obama - Targeted Killings](http://www.hrw.org/news/2010/12/07/letter-obama-targeted-killings)\" Inter Press Service, \"[Judge Declines to Rule on Targeted Killings of U.S. Citizens](http://ipsnorthamerica.net/news.php?idnews=3426)\" *Salon*, \"[Obama Authorizes Assassination of U.S. Citizen](http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/04/07/assassinations)\" Philip Alston, [UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings](http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/LegalObservations) **4. Human Caused Food Crisis Expands** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/4-global-food-crisis-expands/)) A new worldwide spike in agricultural commodity and food prices is generating both predictable and extraordinary fallouts. The search for causes once again leads to a conjuncture of flawed policies in trade, environment, finance and agriculture that is likely to produce more dangerous volatility in years to come. David Moberg, offering an in-depth breakdown of the global food crisis in *In These Times*, places the blame for rising food prices and increasing malnutrition on flawed economic policies. **\"Hunger is currently a result of poverty and inequality, not lack of food,\"** he concludes. \"Since 2010 began, roughly another 44 million people have quietly crossed the threshold into malnutrition, joining 925 million already suffering from lack of food,\" Moberg writes. \"If prices continue to rise, this food crisis will", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__censored__press_censorship_11.txt:1:b6674ebe90ec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12330, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__censored__press_censorship_11.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__censored__press_censorship_11", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "come.

Private Prison Companies Fund Anti-Immigrant Legislation ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/5-private-prison-companies-fund-anti%e2%80%93immigrant-legislation/)) Over the past four years roughly a million immigrants have been incarcerated in dangerous detention facilities in our taxpayer-financed private prison system. Children were abused, women were raped, and men died from lack of basic medical attention. When Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer ran for reelection in 2010, her greatest out-of-state campaign contributions came from high-ranking executives of Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), one of the nation's largest prison companies. CCA profits directly from building and operating prisons and detention centers. CCA previously employed two of Brewer's legislative aides as lobbyists. Peter Cervantes-Gautschi spotlights Brewer's links to CCA and goes deeper still, offering an historic account of how investors in **CCA and prison giant Geo Group have for years actively pushed for legislation that would result in the widespread incarceration of undocumented immigrants.** **Sources:** Social Policy, \"[Wall Street & Our Campaign to Decriminalize Immigrants](http://www.scribd.com/doc/42097444/Wall-Street-amp-Our-Campaign-to-Decriminalize-Immigrants-Rathke)\" **6. Google Spying? ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/6-google-spying/)) Earlier this year the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated Internet search engine giant Google for illegally collecting personal data such as passwords, emails, and other online activities from unsecured Wi-Fi networks in homes and businesses across the US and around the world. A flurry of stories aired in the spring of 2010 when it became apparent that Google Street View vehicles, in the process of collecting data for its mapping service, also picked up consumer \"payload\" data on Wi-Fi networks, including e-mail messages, website data, user names, and passwords. The tech giant publicly apologized for what it characterized as a mistake, saying it had \"failed badly.\" **The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) admonished Google in a letter, but declined to pursue it further. **Project Censored authors claim that the FTC abandoned its inquiry because a week earlier, Obama attended a Democratic Party fundraiser at the Palo Alto home of Google executive Marissa Mayer, citing a San Francisco Chronicle article about the $30,000-per person affair. **Sources:** United States Federal Trade Communication, [Personal Communication of David Vladeck](http://www.ftc.gov/os/closings/101027googleletter.pdf); *San Francisco Chronicle*, \"[Google's Marissa Mayer Hosting Obama At $30,000-A-Head Fundraiser Tonight](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/10/21/businessinsider-googles-marissa-mayer-to-host-president-obama-for-30000-a-head-fundraiser-2010-10.DTL)\" **7.

It's being marketed as a resilience training to reduce adverse psychological consequences to soldiers who endure combat. Comprehensive Solider Fitness (CSF) is described as a \"holistic approach to warrior training,\" emphasizing positive psychology as a means to counter mental health problems arising from horrific combat situations. Yet **there are many questions about the wisdom of launching a required, untested psychology program for more than a million soldiers, one that encourages soldiers to think positive even in the face of traumatizing events. **This \"training\" program might better be described as a research project. The core hypothesis of this massive program's success has yet to be confirmed through further research. **Sources:** Truthout, \"[The Dark Side of Comprehensive Soldier Fitness](http://www.truthout.org/dark-side-comprehensive-soldier-fitness/1301814000)\" Psychology of Well Being, [A Holistic Approach to Warrior Training](http://psychologyofwellbeing.com/201008/comprehensive-soldier-fitness.html); Truthout, \"[Army's 'Spiritual Fitness' Test Comes Under Fire](http://www.truth-out.org/armys-fitness-test-designed-psychologist-who-inspired-cias-torture-program-under-fire66577)\" **8. The Myth of Clean and Safe Nuclear Power ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/8-the-fairytale-of-clean-and-safe-nuclear-power/)) The terrifying meltdowns of Japan's Fukushima nuclear reactors reignited worldwide debate about the wisdom of relying on nuclear energy as an electricity source. While Germany opted to phase out its nuclear facilities by 2022 in the wake of the tragedy, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) came under scrutiny after **a Union of Concerned Scientists report analyzed 14 \"near misses\" at nuclear power plants in 2010, revealing the shortcomings in NRC inspections. Yet mainstream media's treatment of nuclear power is all too willing to endorse the idea that nuclear power is safe.** Major news publications readily go along with the nuclear industry's branding of the power source as \"clean\" and \"carbon free\" when it's really not. Nuclear power presents a security threat of unprecedented proportions: It's capable of a catastrophic accident that can kill hundreds of thousands of people, with a byproduct that is toxic for millennia.

The U.S. government has conducted weather modification experiments for over half a century, and the military-industrial complex stands poised to capitalize on these discoveries. **One of the latest programs is [HAARP](https://www.WantToKnow.info/war/haarp_weather_modification_electromagnetic_warfare_weapons), the High-Frequency Active Aural Research Program. This technology can potentially trigger floods, droughts, hurricanes and earthquakes.** The scientific idea behind HAARP is to \"excite\" a specific area of the ionosphere and observe the physical processes in that excited area with intention of modifying ecological conditions. HAARP can also be used as a weapon system, capable of selectively destabilizing agricultural and ecological systems of entire regions. At a recent international symposium, scientists asserted that manipulation of climate through modification of cirrus clouds is neither a hoax nor a conspiracy theory and is fully operational. **Sources:** Global Research, \"[Atmospheric Geoengineering: Weather Manipulation, Contrails and Chemtrails](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=20369)\" Dr. Coen Vermeeren, [Symposium speech](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/7299427); Commonwealth Club, \"[Man-Made Climate Change in the Skies](http://commonwealthclub.org/events/archive/podcast/man-made-climate-change-skies-32811)\" [For highly revealing documentaries on HAARP by Canada's CBC and the History Channel, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/war/haarp_weather_modification_electromagnetic_warfare_weapons)] **10. Real Unemployment: One Out of Five in US ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/10-real-unemployment-one-out-of-five-in-us/)) The corporate media wants America to feel secure during a time of unemployment crisis, but people deserve to know what is really happening rather than a statistical lie. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the \"official unemployment rate\" by counting everyone who had no job, was available for work, and had actively sought work in the last four weeks, according to the BLS website. But alternative BLS statistics incorporate so-called \"discouraged workers,\" unemployed individuals who've given up on the job hunt. **In the first four months of 2011, the national unemployment rate officially stood at around 9 percent, while a BLS statistic incorporating discouraged workers and the marginally employed bumped that figure up to 15.9 percent. **Yet according to San Francisco-based economist John Williams, who maintains a website called Shadow Government Statistics, the \"real\" unemployment rate is actually 22.1 percent, or more than one out of five US residents. **Sources:** *Information Clearing House*, \"[9% Unemployment Rate is a Statistical Lie](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article27435.htm)\" Shadow Government Statistics, \"[Alternate Unemployment Charts](http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/unemployment-charts)\" ** ** Thanks to the [*San Francisco Bay Guardian*](http://www.sfbg.com/2011/09/27/worst-kept-secrets) and Rebecca Bowe for parts of the above summaries. **More of the Top 25 Press Censorship Stories of 2011** **11.

Trafficking of Iraqi Women Rampant ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/11-trafficking-of-iraqi-women-rampant/)) Human trafficking occurs throughout the world, yet has become increasingly more prevalent in Iraq due to the instability produced by the war. Many Iraqi women and girls are widowed or orphaned by wartime casualties. Currently, more than 50,000 Iraqi women have fled to Jordan and Syria and are trapped in sexual servitude with no possibility of escape. **12. Pacific Garbage Dump: Did You Think Your Plastic Was Being Recycled?** ([Story here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/pacific-garbage-dump%e2%80%94did-you-really-think-your-plastic-was-being-recycled/)) Many people do not realize that there is a swirling mass of plastic in the middle of the Pacific ocean that qualifies as the planet's largest garbage dump. [Recent research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch#Size_and_visibility) sponsored by the National Science Foundation suggests the affected area may be twice the size of Hawaii. The 5 Gyres Project estimates that there are 315 billion pounds of plastic in the ocean right now. **13. Will a State of Emergency Be Used to Supersede Our Constitution? ** ([Story here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/13-will-a-state-of-emergency-be-used-to-supersede-our-constitution/)) A program dating back to the Eisenhower era is now converted to bestow secret powers on the president for anything he considers an emergency. Recent \"Continuity of Government\" planning has quietly removed time-honored constitutional protections and increased the militarization of civilian law enforcement. For the first time in US history, military troops are allowed to do police actions in US cities. Recently the US Army established an active-duty brigade trained to manage civil unrest and crowd control. Historically this has been illegal. There has been a loss of local authority and sustained preparations for the possibility of martial law. **14.

Some are still in hiding, fearing that their parents will disown them for running away to avoid circumcision. Many girls have been forced to cut short their studies and married off at a young age because of parental fear the daughters will be ostracized if too educated. **15. Big Polluters Freed from Environmental Oversight ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/15-big-polluters-freed-from-environmental-oversight/)) The Obama administration has distributed billions of dollars in stimulus money to some of the nation's biggest polluters and granted exemptions from basic environmental errors.

It is a chemical that works better than alcohol, but poisons workers. In these factories the workers, often women in their teens or 20s, were forced to work with the poison in unventilated rooms. **17. Superbug Bacteria Spreading Worldwide** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/17-superbug-bacteria-spreading-worldwide/)) Lethal superbugs are emerging that do not respond to any known drugs. The World Health Organization states that the New Delhi or NDM-1 superbug was recently found in UK patients and has reached a critical point. These super bugs are resistant to carbapenem antibiotics, which is a major concern to experts because they are used for hard to treat infections that evade other drugs. Already 25,000 people die each year from superbugs in Europe. **18. Monsanto Tries to Benefit from Haiti's Earthquake ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/18-monsanto-tries-to-benefit-from-haiti%e2%80%99s-earthquake/)) In May 2010, five months after an earthquake destroyed Haiti, the American multinational Monsanto donated the country 60 tons of corn and vegetable hybrid seed. USAID took charge of the seed distribution. A month later, on June 4, 2010, around 10,000 Haitian farmers demonstrated against Monsanto's donation. Haitian farmers denounced Monsanto's seeds as they can't be reused each year, which leads to the necessity of buying new seed from the multinational every new sowing season. This dependence could also extend to the fertilizers and herbicides required by the american multinational who also produces them. **19. Oxfam Exposes How Aid Is Used for Political Purposes ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/19-oxfam-exposes-how-aid-is-used-for-political-purposes/)) In a new report, Oxfam has found that billions of dollars in international aid which could have transformed the lives of many people in some of the poorest countries in the world, was spent on unsustainable, expensive and dangerous aid projects which international donor governments used to support their own short-term foreign policy and security objectives. This type of aid often bypasses the poorest people and dangerously distorts the line between civilian and military activity. The politicization and militarization of aid has in some places made it much harder for aid agencies to provide help to those in need. **20.

Lyme Disease: An Emerging Epidemic ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/21-lyme-disease-an-emerging-epidemic/)) Lyme disease is one of the most political and controversial epidemics of our time. Lyme originates from a bacteria transmitted through the bite of a tick which can remain hidden for years, with symptoms mimicking other diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, and ADHD. And it is growing - new cases of Lyme occur each year at a rate ten times higher then that of AIDS and the West Nile Virus combined. Yet doctors risk losing their license if they treat Lyme as the chronic disease it is known to be. ([Powerful documentary here](http://www.hulu.com/watch/268761/under-our-skin)) **22.

The process typically involves a series of meetings, work by community \"delegates\" or representatives, and ultimately a final vote. It was first implemented in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1990, and has since spread. **23. Worldwide Movement To Ban or Charge Fees For Plastic Bags ** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/23-worldwide-movement-to-ban-or-charge-fees-for-plastic-bags/)) Shoppers worldwide are using 500 billion to one trillion single-use plastic bags per year. These bags pollute our waters, smother wetlands and entangle and kill animals. As larger animals eat smaller plastic-laden creatures, this also affects our health as we end up eating some form of plastic in our sea food. Now 35 countries have already banned the use of plastic bags, nine countries have passed levies and fees on use, and 12 countries are considering bans or fees. **24.

Extension of DU to Libya** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/25-extension-of-du-to-libya/)) President Obama's undeclared and Congressionally unauthorized war against Libya may have been compounded by the crime of spreading toxic uranium oxide in populated areas of that country. Concern has been voiced by groups such as the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons, which monitor the military use of so-called depleted-uranium (DU) anti-tank and bunker-penetrating shells. ** News Stories of Hope and Creative Change** For more than 30 years, Project Censored has searched out the most important undercovered stories of the year showing what's wrong with our world. But in 2008, Project Censored began offering a new feature: a list of the top underreported stories of hope and creative change. These stories suggest that a better world is both possible and practical, and that every day, all over the world, people are solving problems. The message is simple: Stop fighting or lamenting existing reality - be an innovator and help create something better. Below are 12 key examples from the year 2011.

Their success prompted a popular uprising against President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, which, after weeks of unprecedented protests, succeeded in ousting him. Soon, the grassroots struggles for democracy spread, with protests taking place throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Though some protests were violently suppressed, movements of the Arab Spring have dramatically increased prospects for democratization in the Middle East.

A growing movement of people accepts the idea that the entire economic system must be radically restructured for critical social and environmental goals to be met. They call for institutions with more egalitarian priorities than the narrow corporate focus on profits and growth. As the economy continues to falter, this movement is working to define a viable path toward long-term systemic change.

According to this myth, growing enough food will require expanding the current agribusiness model based largely on fossil fuels, petrochemicals, and capital-intensive monocultures of genetically modified crops. Yet recent scientific evidence demonstrates that farms designed to emulate natural ecosystems not only protect and restore natural resources, but are more productive than industrial farms.

Mirror neurons enable us to experience another's plight as if we were experiencing it ourselves. Several studies suggest humans are not soft-wired for aggression, violence, and self-interest (products of hierarchical oppression), but for collaboration and companionship. Our main drive is to belong. Consciousness has changed throughout history. As we evolve, we extend our empathetic ties.

Gratitude celebrates the present, blocks negative emotions, and affirms goodness by recognizing external, greater-than-self factors. People who are grateful have a higher sense of self worth because they are continually aware that others are looking out for them.

Widespread Lead Contamination Threatens Children's Health ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/1-widespread-lead-contamination-threatens-childrens-health-triple-household-water-bills/)) **Nearly 3,000 neighborhoods across the US had levels of lead poisoning more than double the rates found in Flint, Michigan at the peak of its contamination crisis**. Blood tests showed that more than 1,100 of those communities had rates of lead contamination \"at least four times higher\" than had been found in Flint. The US relies on an estimated 1.2 million miles of lead pipes for municipal delivery of drinking water. Much of this aging infrastructure is reaching or has exceeded its lifespan. A complete overhaul of the nation's aging water systems would require an investment of $1 trillion over the next 25 years, which could triple the cost of household water bills. A [Michigan State University study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169488) found that, \"while water rates are currently unaffordable for an estimated 11.9% of households this number could grow to 35.6% in the next five years.\" **Sources:** Joshua Schneyer and M.B.

Over Six Trillion Dollars in Unaccountable Army Spending ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/2-six-trillion-dollars-unaccountable-army-spending/)) According to a July 2016 report by the Department of Defense's Office of Inspector General (DoDIG), over the past 20 years the US Army has accumulated $6.5 trillion in expenditures that cannot be accounted for, because two government offices - the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army and the DoD's Defense Finance and Accounting Service - \"did not prioritize correcting the system deficiencies that caused errors and did not provide sufficient guidance for supporting system-generated adjustments.\" In other words the DoD \"has not been tracking or recording or auditing all of the taxpayer money allocated by Congress.\" **$6.5 trillion in unaccountable Army expenditures represents approximately fifteen years' worth of military spending. **Mandy Smithberger, director of the Strauss Military Reform Project [said], \"Accounting at the Department of Defense is a disaster, but nobody is screaming about it because you have a lot of people in Congress who believe in more military spending, so they don't really challenge military spending.\" **Sources:** Dave Lindorff, [\"The Pentagon Money Pit: $6.5 Trillion in Unaccountable Army Spending, and No DOD Audit for the Past Two Decades,\"](http://thiscantbehappening.net/node/3262) This Can't Be Happening!, August 17, 2016.

Pentagon Paid UK PR Firm for Fake Al-Qaeda Videos** ([Full story here](http://projectcensored.org/3-pentagon-paid-uk-pr-firm-fake-al-qaeda-videos/)) The Pentagon paid a British PR firm more than $660 million to run a top-secret propaganda program in Iraq from at least 2006 to December 2011. The UK-based PR firm Bell Pottinger produced short TV segments made to appear like Arabic news stories and insurgent videos. According to Bell Pottinger's former chairman, Lord Tim Bell, his firm had worked on a \"covert\" military operation. He reported to the Pentagon, the CIA, and the National Security Council on his firm's work in Iraq. Bell Pottinger's work consisted of three types of products, including TV commercials portraying al-Qaeda in a negative light, news items intended to look like they had been \"created by Arabic TV,\" and - the third and most sensitive type - fake al-Qaeda propaganda films. **The firm's former video editor said that he was given precise instructions for production of fake al-Qaeda films, and that US Marines would take CDs of these films on patrol to drop in houses that they raided**. **Source:** Crofton Black and Abigail Fielding-Smith, [\"Fake News and False Flags: How the Pentagon Paid a British PR Firm $500 Million for Top", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__censored__project-censored-2017.txt:1:19f59f0b8f50", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12342, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__censored__project-censored-2017.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__censored__project-censored-2017", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "they had been \"created by Arabic TV,\" and - the third and most sensitive type - fake al-Qaeda propaganda films. **The firm's former video editor said that he was given precise instructions for production of fake al-Qaeda films, and that US Marines would take CDs of these films on patrol to drop in houses that they raided**. **Source:** Crofton Black and Abigail Fielding-Smith, [\"Fake News and False Flags: How the Pentagon Paid a British PR Firm $500 Million for Top Secret Iraq Propaganda,\"](http://labs.thebureauinvestigates.com/fake-news-and-false-flags/) Bureau of Investigative Journalism, October 2, 2016. **4. Voter Suppression in 2016 Presidential Election** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/4-voter-suppression-2016-presidential-election/)) The Voting Rights Act of 1965 addressed discrimination in voting by requiring all state and local governments with a history of racial discrimination to get preclearance from the federal government before making any changes to their voting laws or procedures. In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that a key provision of the Voting Rights Act could no longer be used. **This made 2016 the first presidential election in fifty years without the full protections guaranteed by the Voting Rights Act**. Since *Shelby*, fourteen states implemented new voting restrictions, in many cases just in time for the election. Texas implemented a photo-ID law that resulted in one of the lowest voter turnouts in the country. In North Carolina a voter-ID requirement permitted just a few acceptable forms of identification: According to data from the state's board of elections, over 300,000 registered voters lacked even one accepted form of ID. Arizona made changes to its voting laws that the Department of Justice had previously rejected due to minority voter discrimination. **Sources:** Ari Berman, [\"This Election is being Rigged-But Not by Democrats,\"](https://www.thenation.com/article/this-election-is-being-rigged/) *Nation*, October 17, 2016.

Big Data and Dark Money Behind the 2016 Election**, [(Full story here](http://projectcensored.org/5-big-data-dark-money-behind-2016-election/)) Right-wing computer scientist and hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer was the top donor to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, contributing $13.5 million. Mercer also funded Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics company that specializes in \"election management strategies\" and using microtargeting. **Cambridge Analytica's website boasts that it has psychological profiles based on thousands of pieces of data for some 220 million American voters**. Mercer, Cambridge Analytica, and others used these capacities to tip the election toward Trump. Mercer's money also enabled Steve Bannon to fund *Breitbart*, a right-wing news site established with the express intent of serving as a *Huffington Post* for the Right.

Antibiotic Superbugs Threaten Health and Foundations of Modern Medicine ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/6-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-threaten-health-foundations-modern-medicine/)) **Pharmaceutical companies that produce antibiotics are creating dangerous superbugs when their factories leak industrial waste**. Superbugs are bacteria that become resistant to antibiotics. Pharmaceutical factories in China and India - the places where the majority of the world's antibiotics are manufactured - are releasing \"untreated waste fluid\" into local soils and waters, leading to increases in antimicrobial resistance that diminish the effectiveness of antibiotics and threaten the foundations of modern medicine. A number of the companies have established links to US markets. After bacteria in the environment become resistant, they can exchange genetic material with other germs, spreading antibiotic resistance around the world, according to [an assessment](http://epha.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DRUG-RESISTANCE-THROUGH-THE-BACK-DOOR_WEB.pdf) issued by the European Public Health Alliance (EPHA). At the heart of the issue is how to motivate pharmaceutical companies to improve their production practices. With strong demand for antibiotics, the companies continue to profit despite the negative consequences of their actions. **Sources:** Melinda Wenner Moyer, [\"Dangerous New Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Reach U.S.,\"](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dangerous-new-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria-reach-u-s/) *Scientific American*, May 27, 2016.

Over a five-year period, the US Navy has been responsible for more than 11.8 million takes of marine mammal species in four North Pacific areas of operation. The Navy currently does not allow expert civilians or US Fish and Wildlife officials on board their vessels to monitor impacts during training exercises. With little oversight on Navy training activities, the public is left in the dark regarding their environmental impacts, including especially how Navy operations impact fish in the North Pacific and marine life at the bottom of the food chain. **Sources:** Dahr Jamail, [\"Navy Allowed to Kill or Injure Nearly 12 Million Whales, Dolphins, Other Marine Mammals in Pacific,\"](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/36037-the-us-navy-s-mass-destruction-of-marine-life) *Truthout*, May 16, 2016. **8. Maternal Mortality a Growing Threat in US ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/8-maternal-mortality-growing-threat-us/)) Each year, more than 65,000 pregnant women in the United States suffer life-threatening complications, including physical and psychological conditions aggravated by pregnancy, and more than 600 die from pregnancy-related causes. Inadequate health care in rural areas and racial disparities are drivers of this maternal health crisis. **Nationally, African American women are three to four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related causes**, with rates even higher in parts of the US characterized as \"pockets of neglect,\" such as Georgia, where the 2011 maternal mortality rate of 28.7 per 100,000 live births was nearly double the national average. Across the US, the number of women who are vulnerable to high-risk deliveries is rising. In addition, doctors rarely warn patients of the potential for serious injuries and complications that can occur following birth. **Sources:** Elizabeth Dawes Gay, [\"Congressional Briefing Puts U.S. Maternity on Exam Table,\"](http://womensenews.org/2016/04/congressional-briefing-puts-u-s-maternity-on-exam-table/) *Women's eNews*, April 15, 2016.

DNC Claims Right to Select Presidential Candidate ** (For full story, [click here](http://projectcensored.org/9-dnc-claims-right-select-presidential-candidate/)) In June 2016, Beck & Lee, a legal firm based in Miami, filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of supporters of Bernie Sanders against the Democratic National Committee and its former chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, alleging that the DNC broke legally-binding neutrality agreements in the Democratic primaries by strategizing to make Hillary Clinton the nominee before a single vote was cast. Transcripts from the hearing on the lawsuit document the DNC's lack of commitment to key articles of its own charter.

Around the world, governments shutting down Internet access limited freedom of speech, swayed elections, and damaged economies. \"In the worst cases,\" Rowlands wrote, \"Internet shutdowns have been associated with human rights violations,\" as happened in Ethiopia and Uganda. The IPS report quoted Deji Olukotun at digital rights organization Access Now: \"**What we have found is that Internet shutdowns go hand in hand with atrocities.\" Access Now documented fifty-three instances in 2016 in which national governments shut down the Internet for all or part of a country**, \"throttled\" access speeds to make the Internet essentially unusable, or blocked specific communication methods. These fifty-three instances represent a sharp uptick in government shutdowns of the Internet.

Justice Department's Secret FISA Rules for Targeting Journalists ** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/1-justice-departments-secret-fisa-rules-for-targeting-journalists/)) A pair of 2015 memos from former attorney general Eric Holder to the Department of Justice's National Security Division show how the government could use court orders under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to monitor the communications of journalists and news organizations. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and the Freedom of the Press Foundation [obtained the documents](https://freedom.press/news/lawsuit-seeks-government-guidelines-surveillance-journalists-leak-investigations-surge/) through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and a lawsuit. **FISA rules are \"much less stringent\" than the Justice Department's media guidelines for obtaining subpoenas, court orders, and warrants against journalists**. The procedures governing FISA surveillance and national security letters allow government officials to circumvent the media guidelines' requirements that the information sought is \"essential\" to a successful investigation, that \"reasonable alternative attempts\" have been made to obtain the information, and that the government inform the journalist and negotiate with them. **Sources:** Cora Currier, \"[Government Can Spy on Journalists in the U.S. Using Invasive Foreign Intelligence Process](https://theintercept.com/2018/09/17/journalists-fisa-court-spying/),\" The Intercept, September 17, 2018.

These partnerships have resulted in what amounts to state censorship. **In the name of fighting the scourge of \"fake news,\" Facebook altered its proprietary algorithms in ways that [significantly reduced traffic](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/02/how-facebook-screwed-us-all/) to progressive websites such as Common Dreams and Slate**.

US Women Face Prison Sentences for Miscarriages** (For full story, [click here](https://www.projectcensored.org/8-us-women-face-prison-sentences-for-miscarriages/)) Many people fear that the new Supreme Court will overturn *Roe v.

But there is more at stake, according to Naomi Randolph in a 2019 *Ms. Magazine* article: **pregnant women could face a higher risk of criminal charges for miscarriages or stillbirths, due to lawmakers in numerous states enacting laws that recognize fetuses as people, separate from the women carrying them**. One example that Randolph provided is in Alabama, where voters recently passed a measure that \"endows fetus' with 'personhood' rights for the first time, potentially making any action that impacts a fetus a criminal behavior with potential for prosecution.\" Collectively, laws like Alabama's have resulted in hundreds of American women facing prosecution for the outcome of their pregnancies. The cases all vary in detail, but the commonality is women losing their rights if they are thought to be endangering a fetus. **Source:** Naomi Randolph, \"[What Losing Roe Would Mean for Women of Color](https://msmagazine.com/blog/2019/01/22/losing-roe-mean-women-color/),\" *Ms. Magazine*, January 22, 2019. **9.

Simultaneously, our Instagram account was deplatformed (suspended). Each of these platforms had hundreds of thousands of followers. Collectively, more than half a million followers have been denied access to truthful information. We received the following notifications from both platforms: **Fighting Big Tech + Big Pharma** Despite not posting content on Facebook for the past 21 days due to an existing 30-day ban, and constantly self-censoring our content in an attempt to avoid continual shadow-banning and censorship, both pages were abruptly deplatformed. **Removing CHD accounts is evidence of a clearly orchestrated attempt to stop the impact we have during a time of heightened criticism of our public health institutions.** Deplatforming by the tech giants came days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) quietly walked back many of their previous COVID-19 policies that CHD has criticized since the beginning of the pandemic. Within hours of CHD deplatforming, CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky [shared her plans](https://default.salsalabs.org/T8b8de77c-c320-4736-9e27-05742d946dcc/c25821a8-ec5c-4e98-9016-d79dc3cae358) for overhauling how the agency works while admitting to a flawed response to the COVID-19 and [pandemic missteps](https://default.salsalabs.org/Tb80b5bf2-6e3b-4c77-9967-a1a63ad6f964/4e88cc86-4693-4a81-94c9-a38b2081d5f2). There's no clear indication of why Facebook and Instagram chose to deplatform us at this time, but the timing dovetails with our ongoing [censorship lawsuit](https://default.salsalabs.org/T0bc07f65-24df-417b-83cf-eea02bff8e11/0d5f9648-4e94-4b47-ba06-e024afc22319) against Facebook. CHD filed a [lawsuit](https://default.salsalabs.org/T3c5abb15-89bb-4146-8db0-46e229a82980/078be24a-9f3d-4f50-834d-2407d3e669f0) against Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, in August, 2020. Recently, in its [Ninth Circuit Court appeal filed](https://default.salsalabs.org/Td78e9d16-b40d-4f60-9cf9-33761ecb818d/a2cc39f7-7beb-45b9-b02c-c68ef3d787a5) on July 29, CHD provided the court with [CDC-produced documents](https://default.salsalabs.org/T0ba32b40-2339-45bd-a096-1868463d70c4/caf81af1-964c-47c1-9c2f-b6de208db6ee) the agency shared with Facebook. These documents, provided to Facebook on a regular basis, contained what the CDC considered misinformation. Titled \"COVID Vaccine Misinformation: Hot Topics,\" the CDC documents asked tech giants to \"be on the lookout\" (BOLO) for various topics they consider to be misinformation including: COVID-19 vaccine shedding, VAERS reports, spike protein data and more. The CHD case is currently pending in a Ninth Circuit decision. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said: \"Facebook is acting here as a surrogate for the Federal government's crusade to silence all criticism of draconian government policies.

I'm very much enjoying the opportunity to educate and inspire people from around the world on this popular news website. Yet interestingly, **Google for the first time has censored one of my examiner.com articles on its main search engine. Most intriguing is that this case of censorship originates in a very inspiring news event.** [My censored article](http://www.examiner.com/x-6495-National-Intelligence-Examiner~y2009m5d27-Censored-Jewish-professor-wins-Arab-Nobel-Peace-Prize), published on examiner.com on May 27th, told about the wonderfully refreshing story of Stanford professor Ronald Levy being the first ever Jewish recipient of the Arab equivalent of the Nobel Peace Prize. It's a very encouraging development which you think would be widely reported. Yet as pointed out in my article, there was practically no media coverage of this heartening news. A careful Google search showed that the only major U.S. or English-language European media to report this landmark event was Reuters. **Yet even the [Reuters article](http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS137121+23-Mar-2009+BW20090323) completely failed to mention Levy's Jewish heritage and the incredible significance of a Jew being awarded the prestigious $200,000 prize for the very first time.** It's quite interesting that the only major media source I found anywhere which reported this wonderful peace overture from Saudi Arabia was Israel's respected daily *Haaretz*, which posted a detailed and [optimistic article](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1078687.html) titled \"U.S. professor becomes first Jew to win 'Arab Nobel Prize'\". This media censorship in itself was astonishing, but I was even more astounded when the day after I published this article, I could not find it in a Google search. I often check Google after I publish articles to see how each article is listed, and to check its ranking. Every article I have ever checked usually shows up on the main Google search page within 12 hours, and always within 24 hours. Why on Earth did Google censor this particular article for the first time? You can verify this for yourself. It's now been over a week and Google still has not indexed the article. Go to my article at [this link](http://www.examiner.com/x-6495-National-Intelligence-Examiner~y2009m5d27-Censored-Jewish-professor-wins-Arab-Nobel-Peace-Prize). Take any string of 10 words or so in length (other than the quote from *Haaretz* and the first paragraph). Copy the string of words into the search box at [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) and put quotation marks at the beginning and end of the string of words. When you then click the search button, you will likely find no", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__censorship_media_google_arabic_israeli.txt:0:6d0d061220c9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12366, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__censorship_media_google_arabic_israeli.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__censorship_media_google_arabic_israeli", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "for yourself.

Copy the string of words into the search box at [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) and put quotation marks at the beginning and end of the string of words. When you then click the search button, you will likely find no results, and certainly no results with that article. ([Example here](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Reuters+published+a+detailed+article+on+Professor+Ronald+Levy%27s+achievements)) You can do this with [any other article I've written](http://www.examiner.com/x-6495-National-Intelligence-Examiner) for examiner.com before that one, and it will show up in the search. Note that if you do a search on the title or first paragraph of my article, you will find that a number of other websites reported the article, giving only the title and an introduction, and were listed on Google. Since I posted that article, I've written three other, non-related articles. Two of those posted normally to Google, but the one on [CIA mind control programs](http://www.examiner.com/x-6495-National-Intelligence-Examiner~y2009m5d29-CIA-hypnotist-Individuals-could-be-taught-to-do-anything-including-murder-suicide-etc) was the second article ever not to be listed. So it appears I may now have someone monitoring which of my articles get indexed and which don't. **On Google's specialized search for news, this kind of censorship of some of my more sensitive articles has been going on for a long time, but now it is happening on their regular searches, too.** **[Update June 4th:** Not long after I posted this message to examiner.com at 4:40 PM PDT yesterday, the article on CIA mind control was finally indexed on Google. Maybe someone is watching. On checking this morning, after I sent this message to our over 6,000 WantToKnow.info subscribers, the nobel prize censorship article still had not been indexed. I checked again at 1 PM and it was indexed! Yea!!! Thanks to all who contacted Google. Together, we make a difference!] **Why all the censorship?** **Why did Google censor this article? Many people are not aware that the military and intelligence services have embedded key agents in all major media organizations (including Google and Yahoo) to monitor what is reported. Often, these agents work under cover.** They are hired on as regular staff, yet secretly they are working for the military, FBI, or CIA to influence news selection and content. I highly suspect that these agents somehow censored my article at Google (and Yahoo) and may even have had a role in the original inspiring article not being published. For one clear example of this, read the [Project Censored news article](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/3-us-armys-psychological-operations-personnel-worked-at-cnn/) titled \"Embedded in media, U.S. Army's Psychological Operations Personnel Worked at CNN.\" Here's a quote from that article: \"Psyops personnel, soldiers, and officers, have been working in CNN's headquarters in Atlanta through our program 'Training With Industry,'\" Major Thomas Collins of the U.S. Army Information Service said in a telephone", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__censorship_media_google_arabic_israeli.txt:1:cbb9151e2f35", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12367, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__censorship_media_google_arabic_israeli.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__censorship_media_google_arabic_israeli", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Google (and Yahoo) and may even have had a role in the original inspiring article not being published.

Collins asserted, \"They worked as regular employees of CNN. They helped in the production of news.\" The military/CNN personnel belonged to the airmobile Fourth Psychological Operations Group stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. One of the main tasks of this group of almost 1,200 soldiers and officers is to spread \"selected information.\" Two *New York Times* articles also reveal infiltration of the media. The first describes \"an extensive and largely hidden Pentagon campaign to transform network military analysts into 'surrogates' and 'message force multipliers'\". The second, titled \"Behind TV Analysts, Pentagon's Hidden Hand,\" states: \"Hidden behind that appearance of objectivity ... is a Pentagon information apparatus that has used those analysts in a campaign to generate favorable news coverage of the administration's wartime performance. Most of the analysts have ties to military contractors vested in the very war policies they are asked to assess on air.\" To read key excerpts of these two revealing *New York Times* articles with links to the full originals on the *Times *website, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-pentagon-report-withdrawn-exonerated-military-manipulation-media) and [here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-behind-tv-analysts-pentagons-hidden-hand). In my work as a [top language interpreter](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fredburksresigns) at the U.S. Department of State, I worked with a number of FBI agents and military officers of all ranks. I probably encountered a number of CIA agents, as well, though they are careful never to admit it. I learned from a few of these insiders first-hand how politics is sometimes manipulated in big ways to profit those in power at the expense of the public. Though I think there is a need for organizations like our military and intelligence services to protect the public and prevent violent groups from endangering public safety, I find the excessive secrecy and blatant manipulation of public perception in which these agencies engage to actually work against the public interest. Too often, they end up supporting the interests and war agenda of the [power elite](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles), while neglecting the interests of the general public. Why do you think they might want to censor inspiring articles on Jewish-Arab relations? Could such articles defeat their [war agenda](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup)? Katharine Graham, former owner of the *Washington Post*, once commented, \"We live in a dirty and dangerous world. There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldn't.

Pierre Salinger announced on Nov. 8, 1996, that hed received documents proving that a US Navy missile had accidentally downed TWA flight 800. That same day, FBIs Jim Kallstrom called a press conference. At one point, a man raised his hand and asked why the Navy was involved in the investigation while a possible suspect. Remove him! Kallstrom yelled. Two men leapt over to the questioner and grabbed him by the arms. There was a momentary chill in the air after the guy had been dragged out of the room. Kallstrom and entourage acted as if nothing had happened. Jim Kallstrom was later hired by CBS.

Robert Garwood14 years a prisoner of the Vietnamesewas found guilty in the longest court-martial in US history. At the end of the court-martial, there seemed no question that he was a monstrous traitor. In 1985, Garwood was speaking publicly about something that had never made the news during his court-martial. He knew of other American prisoners in Vietnam long after the war was over. My sources included outstanding experts like former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency General Tighe and returned POWs like Captain McDaniel, who held the Navys top award for bravery. With such advocates, it was hard not to consider the possibility that prisoners (some 3,500) had in fact been kept by the Vietnamese as hostages to make sure the US would pay the more than $3 billion in war reparations.

You'll contemplate whether or not to join a union, support a nonprofit organization, undergo invasive surgery, try alternative medicine, or take a vaccine. **Each choice will be heavily influenced by the media narrative that you are living in. **Your belief about the world, its perils and possibilities, will be dictated in large part by the story you believe about current events. - Tony Brasunas, [Red White & Blind](https://www.redwhiteandblind.com/)* Dear online world, The signs are everywhere that we live in a society seemingly incapable of civil dialogue. The culture and information wars playing out in the media have generated ferocious argument, yet very little clarity about how we can engage with each other across the vast differences in the news we consume. Real corruptions and cover-ups remain hidden from public awareness, largely due to the special interests driving our corporate media systems telling us what to believe and not to believe. Yet what if we *can* have a nuanced, nonpartisan conversation about the very controversial issues shaping our lives? Meet Tony Brasunas, a committed independent media activist who has researched and wrote extensively about censorship, propaganda, free speech, and media literacy in America for a number of years. **Associate Director Amber Yang for PEERS and WantToKnow.info recently hosted an interview with Brasunas, where he shares about his recent book, *[Red White & Blind: The Truth about Disinformation and the Path to Media Consciousness](https://www.redwhiteandblind.com/)*.** You can find the link to the interview below, or go directly to our Youtube channel to watch. Utilizing a storytelling approach in his book, Brasunas takes people on a journey to explore the relationship between the media and core issues of our times.** COVID, Jeffrey Epstein, and the events that transpired on January 6 are few of the many examples he uses to explore how the media covertly shapes public opinion, largely by inciting social division.** He also explores issues once discredited as \"conspiracy theories,\" yet have now turned out to be valid or worthy of consideration. He calls for the cultivation of *media consciousness*, a state of awareness that supports people in navigating the manipulative noise of the media landscape.

We also explore the history and origins of media manipulation, the different forms of media biases, and media literacy skills that anyone can adopt to build what he calls a \"balanced media diet.\" As a young blogger for *The San Francisco Chronicle* during the buildup to the Iraq war, Brasunas covered an appearance by senator Joe Biden at a downtown hotel. Brasunas wrote that Biden was advocating for an invasion, yet didn't mention the grave impacts this will have on Iraqi people and the environment. When his piece was published, he was disturbed that his critique on Biden's call for war was omitted. Who had chosen to censor that section from his article? *I published an online political magazine of my own in San Francisco ... focusing primarily on issues that didn't get into the big papers, such as ownership of media, election fraud, and the underlying stories about the Iraq War, third parties, 9/11, and domestic surveillance. I noticed censorship and propaganda distorting virtually every major story in the corporate media, and it inspired me to look more deeply. **I learned to distinguish everyday editorial decision-making-which is not censorship-from imperiously silencing viewpoints or entire stories on account of systemic or nefarious bias, which is indeed censorship.*** - Excerpt from* [Red White & Blind](https://www.redwhiteandblind.com/)* In 2016, Brasunas was also censored by *Huffington Post *for [writing about](https://tonybrasunas.medium.com/the-deeper-reason-independents-and-progressives-will-not-support-hillary-clinton-db79a10b23c7) the manipulation of media coverage for Bernie Sanders' campaign. This led him down a meaningful path to making sense of the vast corruption and media manipulation on both sides of the political aisle. *The media began counting superdelegates in October as if they'd already voted even though today they still haven't; the DNC performed something shockingly similar to money laundering for the Clinton campaign to circumvent donation maximums and [funnel millions to her campaign](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670); the debates were reduced, canceled, or scheduled at times few people would watch, which prevented Bernie Sanders from becoming better known earlier in the primary; and the primary rules as a whole were [written and rewritten](https://web.archive.org/web/20160718185823/https://www.usuncut.com/politics/debbie-wasserman-schultz-hillary-clinton/) by DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who happens to be a longtime Clinton friend and ally*. - Excerpt from [Brasunas' censored article](https://tonybrasunas.medium.com/the-deeper-reason-independents-and-progressives-will-not-support-hillary-clinton-db79a10b23c7) for *Huffington Post* Despite the challenging problems we face in our media systems, Brasunas carries a positive vision for our collective future.

He emphasizes that for the first time in human history, we can interact and share our experiences with each other directly and quickly through the digital world. *A media awakening is unfolding all over the country. Media censorship and propaganda are increasing but so is awareness of this distortion. This isn't the first book on this, and it won't be the last. It has become cliché lately to say a battle is being fought for the minds of Americans, but that's because it's true. This battle is part of a larger war going on all across the world in this era of accelerating technology, globalization, and wealth inequality.* *This war is between, on the one hand, reactionaries who seek greater centralization of power into the hands of national and global governing bodies, something that the internet and globalization enable. Opposing them are those whom I call progressives who seek decentralization of power and a return of sovereignty to smaller communities and individuals, things that the internet also enables in a way never before possible. **Will the internet enable a small new set of rulers to centralize global power and run the world, or will its extraordinary ability to distribute information and knowledge fuel an enlightenment? **The former could happen using modern surveillance, facial recognition, monitored biometrics, controlled social media, and manufactured media narratives. The latter, however, could establish a new decentralized world of smaller, freer, more autonomous communities and nations. The presence or absence of Free Speech and a Free Press will in part determine the outcome of this great power struggle. *- Excerpt from *[Red White & Blind](https://www.redwhiteandblind.com/)* Check out [Tony Brasunas' website](http://tonybrasunas.com/) and his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tonybrasunas), and consider supporting him and his excellent book *[Red White & Blind](https://www.redwhiteandblind.com/)*.

Here's an amazing, yet little-known fact that should be front-page news everywhere: **Violent crime in America has plummeted to levels not seen since the 1960s.** We're talking about a major improvement in public safety that's happened right under our noses-yet somehow, it's been buried or greatly downplayed by the major media. **The Numbers Will Amaze You:** Violent crime rates in 2023? **Lesss than 1/3 of what they were in 1993** Personal theft/larceny crimes? **Down to 1/8 of 1993 levels** Your odds of being sexually assaulted? **Down 60%** from what they were 30 years ago Don't believe it? Check out the official [U.S. Department of Justice statistics](https://ncvs.bjs.ojp.gov/multi-year-trends/crimeType). Let that sink in. You are literally [three times safer](https://bjs.ojp.gov/document/cv23.pdf) today than you were in the early '90s. The largest decline came between 1993 and 2010, after which the rates largely leveled out. Sadly, the pandemic lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 led to increased angst worldwide causing a spike in violent crime, but by 2023 the numbers had returned to pre-pandemic levels. The [FBI's report on 2024 statistics](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-2024-reported-crimes-in-the-nation-statistics) shows further declines. **The Media Blackout That Doesn't Make Sense** Here's where it gets really weird. When I first stumbled across this data over a decade ago, I thought it had to be wrong. Crime dominating headlines every day, yet we're actually experiencing what could be considered a safety miracle? I dove deep into FBI statistics I found on [this webpage](https://ncvs.bjs.ojp.gov/multi-year-trends/crimeType) expecting to debunk it-instead, I found one of the most inspiring untold stories of our time. **But here's the kicker: Almost nobody knows about it.** I've been tracking media coverage of this phenomenon for years, and what I've found is astounding. Major outlets either: Bury the good news in boring statistics Water it down with qualifying language (\"appears to be safer\") Focus on the few areas where crime hasn't dropped Completely ignore the story altogether **The Headlines That Should Have Been** Instead of inspiring celebrations, here's what we got: \"Crime Rates Fall Again, but Decline May Slow\" ([NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/15/us/crime-rates-fall-again-but-decline-may-slow.html)) \"FBI: U.S. crime falls, but small town violence up\" ([USA Today](https://web.archive.org/web/20090608122647/https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-06-01-fbi-report_N.htm)) \"Crime rate decline puzzles theorists\" ([Boston Globe](https://web.archive.org/web/20110905084702/http://articles.boston.com/2010-09-14/news/29300139_1_violent-crime-property-crime-james-alan-fox)) FBI says violent crime fell 4 percent last year; but has long downward trend hit bottom?

Every breakthrough gets a \"but.\" **What's Really Behind This Inspiring Story?** The honest answer? **Nobody knows for sure.** And that's actually part of what makes this so fascinating! Theories include: **Smartphone distraction:** Potential criminals too busy scrolling to commit crimes **Aging population:** Baby boomers moved past crime-prone years **Digital connection:** Internet and social media creating more social bonds **Better policing strategies** (though not harsher sentences-incarceration rates haven't changed much) The beautiful mystery is that this transformation happened organically, without some massive government program or dramatic social intervention. **Why This Story Matters Now More Than Ever** In a world drowning in negativity, fear-mongering, and division, we're sitting on one of the most hopeful data points in modern American history-yet it continues to be hidden from the public. **This isn't just statistics. This is proof that:** Society can dramatically improve Progress doesn't always require massive interventions We're capable of becoming fundamentally safer, more peaceful people The \"world is falling apart\" narrative is often wrong **The Game-Changing Question ** If media can downplay or ignore one of the most positive developments in public safety history, **what [other inspiring news](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspiration/hope_optimism_reasons) are we missing?** What other quiet revolutions are happening while we're distracted by daily outrage cycles? **Your Mission: Become a Hope Spreader** **This story doesn't just need to be told-it needs to be celebrated, shared, and shouted from the rooftops.** Every time someone says \"the world is going to hell\" or \"we're doomed\" you now have hard data proving that in at least one crucial way, we're living in the safest, most peaceful America in generations. **Share this. Print it out. Email it to friends. Post it on social media.** Because if we can't celebrate genuine progress when it happens, how will we ever recognize it when it's right in front of us? No matter what the reason for this decline, let's celebrate this great news! At least in this one very significant way, our world is a safer place to live.

And [crimes involving theft](https://ncvs.bjs.ojp.gov/multi-year-trends/crimeType) have dropped to 1/8 of what they were in that same time frame. What inspiring news!!! Yet notice how little media attention this has drawn. I first discovered this over 10 years ago when I came across a major media article stating violent crime rates were on the decline. Given all of the violence reported in the news every day, I was amazed and skeptical. To verify the claim, I searched for and found the FBI's webpage listing [cumulative crime statistics](https://web.archive.org/web/20120317073714/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/tables/viortrdtab.cfm) from 1973 to 2009. I was most surprised to find that not only were violent crime rates steadily declining over the previous few decades, the cumulative decline was huge! What great news!!! Yet I was also fascinated that the article I read didn't mention the extent of this decline. Why wasn't the public informed on this great news? So ever since, I've followed this topic with great interest. The largest decline came between 1993 and 2010, after which the rates largely leveled out. Yet even now, no one seems to know about this,. As I've searched the news past and present, I've found almost no articles that highlight this wonderful news. **I've only found one major media article which talked about violent crime being at the lowest rate in over 50 years, and even that article failed to mention that the overall violent crime rate had dropped to 1/3 of what it was 17 years prior to publication date.** That [one article](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/us/24crime.html) was from the *New York Times* on May 23, 2011. Yet this article, too, seemed to downplay the great news with a title that was far from inspiring, \"Steady Decline in Major Crime Baffles Experts.\" But at least this one report laid out some of the astounding statistics: \"The number of violent crimes in the United States dropped significantly last year, to what appeared to be the lowest rate in nearly 40 years. In all regions, the country appears to be safer. The odds of being murdered or robbed are now less than half of what they were in the early 1990s, when violent crime peaked in the United States.\" The author of this article used the words \"appeared to be the lowest rate,\" and \"the country appears to be safer.\" When this information is based on FBI statistics, why does he water down this most inspiring news by using the word \"appear\"? And the FBI statistics clearly show that the odds of being murdered or", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__media-hides-inspiring-news-crime.txt:0:853721925fb4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12382, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__media-hides-inspiring-news-crime.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__media-hides-inspiring-news-crime", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "murdered or robbed are now less than half of what they were in the early 1990s, when violent crime peaked in the United States.\" The author of this article used the words \"appeared to be the lowest rate,\" and \"the country appears to be safer.\" When this information is based on FBI statistics, why does he water down this most inspiring news by using the word \"appear\"? And the FBI statistics clearly show that the odds of being murdered or robbed are not just \"less than half,\" but actually less than one-third of what they were in the early 1990s. Here are a few articles I've collected which show the lack of reporting of this most inspiring news: June 1, 2009: *USA Today/*AP - [FBI: U.S. crime falls, but small town violence up](https://web.archive.org/web/20090608122647/https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-06-01-fbi-report_N.htm) Sept. 14, 2010: *Boston Globe/*AP - [Crime rate decline puzzles theorists](https://web.archive.org/web/20110905084702/http://articles.boston.com/2010-09-14/news/29300139_1_violent-crime-property-crime-james-alan-fox) June 11, 2012: *Washington Post/*AP - [FBI says violent crime fell 4 percent last year; but has long downward trend hit bottom?](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-fbi-says-violent-crime-fell-4-percent-last-year-but-has-long-downward-trend-hit-bottom) Nov. 10, 2014: *Chicago Tribun*e - [FBI: Violent crime drops, reaches 1970s level](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-fbi-violent-crime-drops-reaches-1970s-level) Sept. 28, 2015: CNN News - [FBI report: Violent crime down in U.S.](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-fbi-report-violent-crime-down-us) Notice the *USA Today* headline even waters down the inspiring news by focusing on where violence is up. And the title of a [*New York Times*article](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/15/us/crime-rates-fall-again-but-decline-may-slow.html) from the year 2000 is further evidence of a negative bias: \"Crime Rates Fall Again, but Decline May Slow,\" when it did not slow at all. **Why aren't the media reporting this amazing reduction in crime in top headlines to inspire people?** No one seems to know why crime declined so much. One reason may be that as the baby boomers are aging, the percentage of young adults has declined. It's possible that email and the Internet are helping people to feel more connected and less likely to want to harm others. Or it could be potential criminals now spend most of the time looking at their cell phones. All of these factors and more may play a role in the decline. It is not due to tougher sentencing laws, [as incarceration rates are little different from the early 1990s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_United_States_incarceration_rate_with_other_countries#U.S._incarceration_rate_peaked_in_2008)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_United_States_incarceration_rate_with_other_countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_United_States_incarceration_rate_with_other_countries). **No matter what the reason, let's celebrate this great news!

In the process, it is raising concerns of spreading propaganda at home in violation of federal law. An Associated Press investigation found that over the past five years, **the money the military spends on winning hearts and minds at home and abroad has grown by 63 percent, to at least $4.7 billion this year,** according to Department of Defense budgets and other documents. That's almost as much as it spent on body armor for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan between 2004 and 2006. **This year, the Pentagon will employ 27,000 people just for recruitment, advertising and public relations - almost as many as the total 30,000-person work force in the State Department.** The biggest chunk of funds - about $1.6 billion - goes into recruitment and advertising. Another $547 million goes into public affairs, which reaches American audiences. **And about $489 million more goes into what is known as [psychological operations](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060123psyops)**.

The declassified document is called \"Information Operations Roadmap\". It was obtained by the [National Security Archive](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB177/index.htm) at George Washington University using the Freedom of Information Act. Officials in the Pentagon wrote it in 2003. The Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, signed it. The operations described in the document include a surprising range of military activities: public affairs officers who brief journalists, psychological operations troops who try to manipulate the thoughts and beliefs of an enemy, computer network attack specialists who seek to destroy enemy networks. **The military's psychological operations, or [Psyops](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060123psyops), is finding its way onto the computer and television screens of ordinary Americans.** \"Psyops messages will often be replayed by the news media for much larger audiences, including the American public. Strategy should be based on the premise that the Department [of Defense] will 'fight the net' as it would an enemy weapons system,\" it reads. The document recommends that the United States should seek the ability to \"provide maximum control of the entire electromagnetic spectrum\". **US forces should be able to \"disrupt or destroy the full spectrum of globally emerging communications systems, sensors, and weapons systems dependent on the electromagnetic spectrum\".** The fact that the \"Information Operations Roadmap\" is approved by the Secretary of Defense suggests that these plans are taken very seriously indeed in the Pentagon. **Note:** For other revealing news articles on military corruption, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/militarycorruptionnewsarticles).

The Google-owned service says it will remove anything it deems \"medically unsubstantiated\".** Chief executive Susan Wojcicki said the media giant wanted to stamp out \"misinformation on the platform\". The move follows YouTube banning conspiracy theories falsely linking Covid-19 to 5G networks. Mrs Wojcicki made the remarks on Wednesday during her first interview since the global coronavirus lockdown began. \"So people saying, 'Take vitamin C, take turmeric, we'll cure you,' those are the examples of things that would be a violation of our policy,\" she told CNN. \"Anything that would go against World Health Organization recommendations would be a violation of our policy.\" **Last week, Facebook announced users who had read, watched or shared false Covid-19 information would receive a pop-up alert urging them to visit the WHO's website. **Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp, meanwhile, stopped users forwarding messages already shared more than four times by the wider community to more than one chat at a time.

The Los Angeles Times did run a follow-up article. But ... most of the major U.S. newspapers and the vast majority of television news programs ignored the story even though it came at a critical moment just weeks before the election. In fact, not one U.S. newsperson even bothered to ask me or the BBC for the data and research we had painstakingly done. The truth is, I knew that a story like this one would never be reported in my own country [the U.S.], because investigative reporting ... is dying. Again and again, I see this pattern repeated. Back in December 2000, I received two computer disks from the office of Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris. Analysis of the data ... indicated that Harris' office had purged thousands of African Americans from Florida's voter rolls as \"felons.\" Florida now admits that many of these voters were not in fact felons. Nevertheless, the blacklisting helped cost Al Gore the White House. I reported on the phony felon purge in Britain's Guardian and Observer and on the BBC while Gore was still in the race, while the count was still on. Yet the story of the Florida purge never appeared in the U.S. daily papers or on television ... until months later, that is, after the Supreme Court had decided the election. **Note:** The American-born author of this article, BBC reporter Greg Palast, has repeatedly exposed major corruption in the British media, yet the U.S. press often ignores his well-researched stories.

CNNi has aggressively pursued a business strategy of extensive, multifaceted financial arrangements between the network and several of the most repressive regimes around the world which the network purports to cover. Its financial dealings with Bahrain are deep and longstanding. **CNNi's pursuit of and reliance on revenue from Middle East regimes increased significantly after the 2008 financial crisis, which caused the network to suffer significant losses in corporate sponsorships. It thus pursued all-new, journalistically dubious ways to earn revenue from governments around the world.** Bahrain has been one of the most aggressive government exploiters of the opportunities presented by CNNi [which produces] programs in an arrangement it describes as \"in association with\" the government of a country, and offers regimes the ability to pay for specific programs about their country.

If the websites were created using federal funds, it could violate federal law prohibiting the production of propaganda for domestic consumption. **Some postings ... accused them of being sponsored by the Taliban. \"They disputed nothing factual in the story about information operations,\" **Vanden Brook said. **Note:** For more on a proposed amendment to a U.S. bill which would make it legal to use propaganda and lie to the American public, [click here](http://www.opednews.com/populum/linkframe.php?linkid=150568). **Correspondence and collusion between the New York Times and the CIA** **2012-08-29, *The Guardian* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/correspondence-collusion-...](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/correspondence-collusion-new-york-times-cia) The rightwing transparency group, Judicial Watch, released [on August 28] a new batch of documents showing how eagerly the Obama administration shoveled information to Hollywood film-makers about the Bin Laden raid. Obama officials did so to enable the production of a politically beneficial pre-election film about that \"heroic\" killing, even as administration lawyers insisted to federal courts and media outlets that no disclosure was permissible because the raid was classified. The newly released emails [were] between Mark Mazzetti, the *New York Times*'s national security and intelligence reporter, and CIA spokeswoman Marie Harf. The CIA had evidently heard that [*NY Times* columnist] [Maureen Dowd](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/maureendowd/index.html) was planning to write a column on the CIA's role in pumping the film-makers with information about the Bin Laden raid in order to boost Obama's re-election chances, and was apparently worried about how Dowd's column would reflect on them. **This exchange ... is remarkably revealing of the standard role played by establishment journalists and the corruption that pervades it. Here we have a *New York Times* reporter who covers the CIA colluding with its spokesperson to plan for the fallout from the reporting by his own newspaper **(\"nothing to worry about\"). Beyond this, that a *New York Times* journalist - ostensibly devoted to bringing transparency to government institutions - is pleading with the CIA spokesperson, of all people, to conceal his actions and to delete the evidence of collusion is so richly symbolic. **Note:** For deeply revealing reports from reliable sources on corruption in the major media, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/massmedianewsarticles). **Buying the War** **2007-04-25, PBS** [http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/btw/watch.html](http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/btw/watch.html) Four years ago on May 1, President Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln wearing", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__media-influence.txt:8:21804c5c21b2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12393, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__media-influence.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__media-influence", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "Beyond this, that a *New York Times* journalist - ostensibly devoted to bringing transparency to government institutions - is pleading with the CIA spokesperson, of all people, to conceal his actions and to delete the evidence of collusion is so richly symbolic. **Note:** For deeply revealing reports from reliable sources on corruption in the major media, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/massmedianewsarticles). **Buying the War** **2007-04-25, PBS** [http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/btw/watch.html](http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/btw/watch.html) Four years ago on May 1, President Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln wearing a flight suit ... in front of a giant \"Mission Accomplished\" banner. He was hailed by media stars as a \"breathtaking\" example of presidential leadership in toppling Saddam Hussein. **Despite profound questions over the failure to locate weapons of mass destruction and the increasing violence in Baghdad, many in the press confirmed the White House's claim that the war was won. How did the mainstream press get it so wrong?** How did the evidence disputing the existence of weapons of mass destruction and the link between Saddam Hussein to 9-11 continue to go largely unreported? In the run-up to war, skepticism was a rarity among journalists inside the Beltway. The [PBS \"Buying the War\"] program analyzes the stream of unchecked information from administration sources and Iraqi defectors to the mainstream print and broadcast press. While almost all the claims would eventually prove to be false, the drumbeat of misinformation about WMDs went virtually unchallenged by the media. \"Buying the War\" examines the press coverage in the lead-up to the war as evidence of a paradigm shift in the role of journalists in democracy and asks, four years after the invasion, what's changed? \"More and more the media become ... common carriers of administration statements,\" says the Washington Post's Walter Pincus. \"We've sort of given up being independent on our own.\" **Note:** You can view the highly revealing documentary \"Buying the War\" or read the transcript at the link above. **Homosexual prostitution inquiry ensnares VIPs with Reagan, Bush** **1989-06-29, WantToKnow.info*/Washington Times*** [https://www.WantToKnow.info/890629washingtontimesfranklin](https://www.WantToKnow.info/890629washingtontimesfranklin) **A homosexual prostitution ring is under investigation by federal and District authorities and includes among its clients key officials of the Reagan and Bush administrations, military officers, congressional aides and US and foreign businessmen with close social ties to Washington's political elite**.

Interviews with a handful of members of the team, which includes some of the nation's most respected engineers, also uncovered complaints that they had at various times been shackled with bureaucratic restrictions that prevented them from interviewing witnesses, examining the disaster site and requesting crucial information like recorded distress calls to the police and fire departments. **Members have been threatened with dismissal for speaking to the press.** **Note:** Our website has over 30 full articles posted from the *New York Times*.

He did not go because he was asked to do so by his syndicate. He did not go because he was asked to do so by the newspapers that printed his column. He went at the request of the CIA. **Alsop is one of more than 400 American journalists who in the past twenty-five years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents on file at CIA headquarters. Journalists provided a full range of clandestine services-from simple intelligence gathering to serving as go-betweens with spies in Communist countries. Reporters shared their notebooks with the CIA. Editors shared their staffs.** Some of the journalists were Pulitzer Prize winners, distinguished reporters who considered themselves ambassadors-without-portfolio for their country. Most were less exalted: foreign correspondents who found that their association with the Agency helped their work; stringers and freelancers who were as interested in the derring-do of the spy business as in filing articles; and, the smallest category, full-time CIA employees masquerading as journalists abroad. In many instances, CIA documents show, journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of the managements of America's leading news organizations. **Note:** To understand how the CIA and others manipulate the major media is in its news coverage, see the brilliant summary of the work of 20 award-winning journalists on this key topic at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediacover-up). **Washington's press is the cabin boy of the political class** **2012-08-03, *The Guardian* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/03/washington-press-corp-cab...](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/03/washington-press-corp-cabin-boy) The Washington press corps ... is too caught up in its own self-importance and petty competition to understand it has become the cabin boy of the political class. Washington reporters are co-conspirators in an ongoing fraud. The epidemic of blind quotes is a standard way of giving a platform to officials speaking in an official capacity, yet with zero accountability. The practice is also supremely manipulative, giving the most banal information the allure of forbidden fruit. **At its worst, the game can allow the vice president of the United States to leak phony intelligence to the *New York Times* and later refer back to the leak as independent journalistic confirmation, leading to invasion and hundreds of thousands of deaths and a trillion dollars in squandered treasure. **The Iraq disgrace aside, obscuring official sources might be understandable if this journalistic", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__media-influence.txt:11:154a26f75a21", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12396, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__media-influence.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__media-influence", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "accountability.

It almost never is. The blind quotes, though, are not even the worst of it. The *New York Times* recently revealed that reporters are not merely working on background, they negotiate after interviews what comments may be used and send them to sources for prepublication approval. The sources routinely edit those quotes before turning them back over to news organisations. As media ethicist Edward Wasserman so aptly put it, \"At this point you're no longer talking about an interview; you're talking about a press release ...

Everything. **In the old days, we only had a few threats to fear when it came to media manipulation: the government propagandist and the hustling publicist. They exploited the fact that the media was trusted and reliable. Today, with our blog and web driven media cycle, nothing can escape exaggeration, distortion, fabrication and simplification. Media manipulation is the status quo. It becomes, as Daniel Boorstin, author [of] [*The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America*](http://www.amazon.com/Image-Guide-Pseudo-Events-America/dp/0679741801/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1342889028&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Image%3A+A+Guide+to+Pseudo-Events+in+America), once put it, a \"thicket ... which stands between us and the facts of life.\" Today the media -- driven by blogs -- is assailed on all sides, by the crushing economics of their business, dishonest sources, inhuman deadlines, pageview quotas, inaccurate information, greedy publishers, poor training, the demands of the audience, and so much more. These incentives are real, whether you're the Huffington Post or CNN or some tiny blog. They warp everything you read online. Everyone is in on the game, from bloggers to non-profits to marketers to the New York Times itself. And when everyone is running the same racket, the line between the real and the fake becomes indistinguishable. Media manipulation exploits the difference between perception and reality. This all happens because of the poor incentives. **When readers don't PAY for news, the creators of the news don't have any loyalty to the readers.

US Congress Sells Out to Wall Street** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/1-us-congress-sells-out-to-wall-street-sources/)) Americans get the best democracy money can buy, money coming more than ever today from Wall Street. Since 2001, eight of the most troubled financial firms have donated $64.2 million to congressional candidates, presidential candidates and the Republican and Democratic parties. Is it surprising how much they control them? Influential House and Senate finance and banking committee members got $5.2 million from bailout recipients like Goldman Sachs, Citibank, AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and others. In the last election cycle, Obama received at least $4.3 million from the same institutions. From 1998 - 2007, financial and banking companies spent $1.7 billion on federal campaign contributions and another $3.4 billion on lobbyists. In 1999, the Glass-Steagall Act was gutted - the landmark 1933 law that prevented banks from getting into the insurance business. In January 2000, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act legitimized swap agreements and other hybrid instruments, at the core of today's problems, by preventing regulatory oversight of derivatives and leveraging, thus letting Wall Street legally pillage and speculate. **The result was a financial coup d'etat cementing the gradual takeover of the government by a small class of connected insiders who choose candidates, control elections, weaken financial regulations, and basically run the country for their own self-interest.** As a result, Washington today has become largely a subsidiary of the Wall", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__media_censorship_09.txt:0:945d779371f5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12401, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__media_censorship_09.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__media_censorship_09", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "legitimized swap agreements and other hybrid instruments, at the core of today's problems, by preventing regulatory oversight of derivatives and leveraging, thus letting Wall Street legally pillage and speculate. **The result was a financial coup d'etat cementing the gradual takeover of the government by a small class of connected insiders who choose candidates, control elections, weaken financial regulations, and basically run the country for their own self-interest.** As a result, Washington today has become largely a subsidiary of the Wall Street financial giants. **Sources:** Truthout/McClatchy, Oct. 2, 2008, \"[Lax Oversight?

US Schools Are More Segregated Today than in the 1950s** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/2-us-schools-are-more-segregated-today-than-in-the-1950s-source/)) According to a UCLA Civil Rights report, **\"schools in the US are 44 percent non-white, and ... Latinos and blacks, the two largest minority groups, attend schools more segregated today than during the civil rights movement forty years ago.\"** The result is: unequal education which denies disadvantaged youths access to college and better jobs; growing numbers of these youths becoming \"virtually unemployable\" for anything more than menial labor or the military; greater vulnerability to future poverty, poor health, gangs, crime, and prolonged incarceration in America's vast prison/industrial complex. The report stresses the need for \"leaders who recognize that we have a common destiny in an America where our children grow up together, knowing and respecting each other, and are all given the educational tools that prepare them for success in our society.\" The UCLA Civil Rights Study shows that most severe segregation in public schools is in the Western states, including California - not in the South, as many people believe. Eighty-five percent of the nation's teachers are white, and little progress is being made toward diversifying the nation's teaching force. **Source : **The Civil Rights Project, UCLA, January 2009, \"[Reviving the Goal of an Integrated Society: A 21st Century Challenge](http://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/deseg/reviving_the_goal_mlk_2009.pdf),\" by Gary Orfield. **3. Toxic Waste Behind Somali Pirates** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/3-toxic-waste-behind-somali-pirates/)) The international community has come out in force to condemn and declare war on the Somali fishermen pirates, while discreetly protecting the illegal, unreported and unregulated fleets from around the world that have been poaching and dumping toxic waste in Somali waters since the fall of the Somali government eighteen years ago. Foreign interests have been using hundreds of vessels to loot the country's food supply, according to the High Seas Task Force (HSTF), stealing \"an estimated $450 million in seafood from Somali waters annually\" and ruining the livelihoods of Somali fishermen. **Somalia has also been used as a dumping ground for hazardous waste starting in the early 1990s, and continuing through the civil war there.** Instead of rectifying the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__media_censorship_09.txt:1:d865f0d1df98", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12402, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__media_censorship_09.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__media_censorship_09", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Somali waters since the fall of the Somali government eighteen years ago.

Some say that the acts of piracy may actually be born of desperation. What is one man's pirate may be another man's Coast Guard. **Sources:** UK's Independent, January 5, 2009, \"[You are being lied to about pirates](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-you-are-being-lied-to-about-pirates-1225817.html),\" by Johann Hari.

Nuclear Waste Pools in North Carolina** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/4-nuclear-waste-pools-in-north-carolina/)) North Carolina's Shearon Harris nuclear plant contains the largest radioactive waste storage pools in the country. If the cooling system malfunctions, the resulting fire would be virtually unquenchable and could trigger a nuclear meltdown. Between 1999 and 2003, there were twelve major problems requiring the shutdown of the plant. In 2002, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) put the plant on notice for nine unresolved safety issues detected. When the NRC returned to the plant a few months later, it determined that the corrective actions were \"not acceptable.\" Between January and July of 2002, Harris plant managers were forced to manually shut down the reactors four times. **Problems at Shearon Harris continue with chilling regularity. Yet the NRC ignores the potential risks.** A recent study by Brookhaven Labs estimates that a pool fire could cause 140,000 cancers, contaminate thousands of square miles of land, and cause over $500 billion in off-site property damage. The plant is a nuclear time bomb, and millions in the region are at risk. **Source:** CounterPunch, August 9, 2008, \"[Pools of Fire](http://www.counterpunch.org/stclair08092008.html),\" by Jeffrey St. Clair. **5. Europe Blocks US Toxic Products** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/5-europe-blocks-us-toxic-products/)) Unlike in America, European countries are moving toward a model of insisting on environmental and consumer safety that requires assessing thousands of chemicals for their potential toxic effects. New regulations will mandate that companies seeking market access eliminate toxic substances and produce safer electronics, automobiles, toys and cosmetics. Without compliance henceforth, the products of hundreds of US companies may be excluded from European markets, and according to Mark Schapiro, author of *Exposed: The Toxic Chemistry of Everyday Products*, **\"only five percent of all chemicals in the US have undergone even minimal testing.\" Further, new EPA requirements consider the \"costs", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__media_censorship_09.txt:2:b8036db3790c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12403, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__media_censorship_09.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__media_censorship_09", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "assessing thousands of chemicals for their potential toxic effects.

The US produces and consumes the toxic materials from which other countries around the world are protected. **Sources:** Scientific American, Sep. 30, 2008, \"[European Chemical Clampdown Reaches Across Atlantic](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=european-chemical-clampdown-reaches-across-atlantic),\" by David Biello.

Lobbyists Buy Congress** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/6-lobbyists-buy-congress/)) **In 2008, The Center for Responsive Politics reported that \"special interests paid Washington lobbyists $3.2 billion in 2008,\" higher than any year on record and 13.7% more than 2007. That amounts to $17.4 million for each day Congress was in session, or $32,523 per legislator per day.** Health interests spent the most for the third consecutive year, $478.5 million, followed by the FIRE sector (finance, insurance and real estate) at $453.5 million. It's a small investment yielding big returns for these and other industries, competing at the public trough for as much as they can get. The payoff is in the billions for some corporations, and for Wall Street trillions have been pledged, as well as interest free money from the banker-owned Federal Reserve. **Source:** OpenSecrets.org, \"[Washington Lobbying Grew to $3.2 Billion Last Year, Despite Economy](http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/01/washington-lobbying-grew-to-32.html),\" by Center for Responsive Politics. **7. Obama's Military Appointments Have Corrupted Pasts** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/7-obamas-military-appointments-have-corrupt-past/)) **After promising not to politicize intelligence and to keep lobbyists out of top government posts, Obama appointed many former lobbyists and board members of companies doing business directly with the Pentagon.** He retained Robert Gates as Defense Secretary despite his history at CIA of having cooked the books for political reasons. According to Agency insiders who knew him, he \"corrupted the intelligence product\" to suit the White House and further his own self-interest. When Bush nominated him for CIA Director in 1991, a virtual insurrection among CIA analysts erupted over his penchant for having politicized intelligence. Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh states that, despite Gates' touted memory, he \"denied recollection of facts thirty-three times.\" Obama's Deputy Defense Secretary, William Lynn, is just as tainted. The former Raytheon vice president and company lobbyist caused Republican Senator Charles Grassley to object to his \"very questionable accounting practices\" as Pentagon comptroller during the Clinton years.

The former Raytheon vice president and company lobbyist caused Republican Senator Charles Grassley to object to his \"very questionable accounting practices\" as Pentagon comptroller during the Clinton years. He and Obama's Undersecretary of Defense, Robert Hale, who served as Assistant Air Force Secretary Financial Comptroller under Clinton, are claimed to have [lost enough taxpayer money](https://www.WantToKnow.info/corruptiongovernmentmilitary) to pay for Obama's stimulus plan four times over. They now again oversee DOD spending. The list goes on. Most of Obama's national security team is composed of recycled appointees committed to continued imperial wars and outlandish amounts of military spending for them. **Sources:** The Hill, November 24, 2008, \"[Ties to Chevron, Boeing Raise Concern on Possible NSA Pick](http://thehill.com/homenews/news/17167-ties-to-chevron-boeing-raise-concerns-on-possible-nsa-pick),\" by Roxana Tiron.

Bailed Out Banks Cheat IRS Out of Billions** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/8-bailed-out-banks-and-americas-wealthiest-cheat-irs-out-of-billions1/)) It's an old story. \"Only the little people pay taxes,\" according to former tax cheat Leona Hemsley (1920 - 2007), and rarely does anyone like her get caught. **In 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that 83 of the top publicly held US companies have operations in tax havens like the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and the Virgin Islands. 14 of these companies, including AIG, Bank of America, and Citigroup, received money from the government bailout.** In addition, Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) helped wealthy clients cheat the IRS out of over $20 billion in recent years, according to the Department of Justice. Other notorious tax havens include Austria, Luxembourg, Singapore, Hong Kong, Monaco, Gibraltar, and the Bahamas. In 2008, havens like these saved Goldman Sachs billions of dollars through \"changes in (its) geographic earnings mix.\" For many other companies, it's much the same through legal provisions in the tax code. According to some estimates, trillions of dollars in both corporate profits and personal wealth have migrated offshore, and the offshore banking world now harbors $11.5 trillion in individual wealth alone. **Sources:** Bloomberg, December 16, 2008, \"[Goldman Sachs's Tax Rate Drops to 1% or $14 Million](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601110&sid=a6bQVsZS2_18),\" by Christine Harper.

In Gaza, shell fragments revealed names of US defense contractors, including Raytheon. Another was marked the Pine Bluff Arsenal in Arkansas. In shocking support for Israel's questionable attacks, and in violation of international and US law, both Houses of Congress overwhelmingly endorsed the continued aggression. Obama stayed silent on the subject in the run-up to his January 20 inauguration. **Sources:** Human Rights Watch, Mar. 25, 2009, \"[White Phosphorus Use Evidence of War Crimes Report](http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/03/25/israel-white-phosphorus-use-evidence-war-crimes),\" Fred Abrahams.

Ecuador Declares Foreign Debt Illegitimate** ([Full story here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/10-ecuador-declares-foreign-debt-illegitimate/)) In November 2008, Ecuador became the first country to undertake an examination of the legitimacy and structure of its foreign debt. In violation of Ecuadorian law, predatory international lenders were involved in hundreds of illegitimate irregularities. **Billions in foreign debt at exorbitant interest rates resulted in debt service far exceeding the principal borrowed, and at a staggering human cost.** In December, President Rafael Correa announced his country would default. In April 2009, he was re-elected overwhelmingly. **Ecuador exposed the corrupted international finance system in a way that could set a precedent for the poorest of indebted countries.** Correa asked other Latin American nations \"to forge a united response, (and for) the United Nations to help develop international norms to regulate the foreign debt market.\" The April 2008 House passed Jubilee Act was a positive step forward. However, the Senate failed to pass its S. 2166 version, then cleared the legislation from its books. In June 2009, Ecuador agreed with 91% of its creditors to pay 35 cents on the dollar for its debt. Other countries may now follow suit, especially those most impacted by the global economic crisis. **Sources:** Alternet, Nov. 26, 2008, \"[Ecuador Declares Foreign Debt Illegitimate and Illegal](http://www.alternet.org/world/108769/as_crisis_mounts,_ecuador_declares_foreign_debt_illegitimate_and_illegal/),\" by Daniel Denvir.

Mysterious Death of Mike Connell - Karl Rove's Election Thief** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/12-mysterious-death-of-mike-connellkarl-roves-election-thief//)) As Karl Rove's chief IT consultant, Connell was a key figure in [2004 election manipulations](https://www.WantToKnow.info/electionsvideodocumentary) for George Bush. Under subpoena to testify on his role in Ohio, he died mysteriously in a Dec. 19, 2008 plane crash. IT expert Stephen Spoonamore, a conservative Republican, explained how Connell's vote tabulation system worked. \"It allowed (for) the introduction of an additional single computer between computer A and computer B.\" The centralized collection of all incoming statewide results made it easy for a single operator, or a preprogrammed computer to change the results in any way desired by the team controlling the inserted computer. **13.

Major investors include: Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) - $49.1 million; Senator John Kerry (D-MA) - $38.2 million; Rep. Robin Hayes (R-NC) - $37.1 million; Rep.

World Bank's Carbon Trade Fiasco** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/15-world-banks-carbon-trade-fiasco/)) On the pretext of environmental protection, the World Bank is brokering carbon emission trading arrangements that destroy indigenous farmlands around the world and do little to cut pollution or reduce the threat of climate change. The scheme is similar to Obama's cap and trade bill (HR 2454: American Clean Energy and Security Act) that lets corporate polluters reap huge windfall profits by charging consumers more for energy and fuel. **16. US Repression of Haiti Continues** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/16-us-repression-of-haiti-continues/)) The US government plans to demolish the homes of hundreds of Haitians to expand an occupying UN force's military base. The *New York Times* has also published a [revealing article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/world/americas/24haiti.html?_r=1) titled \"Rights Groups Assail US for Withholding Aid to Haiti, Citing Political Motives.\" The Bush administration may have caused the deaths of thousands of Haitians by blocking aid for cynical and self-interested political purposes. **17. The ICC Facilitates US Covert War in Sudan** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/17-the-icc-facilitates-us-covert-war-in-sudan/)) Huge potential oil reserves explain the significance of Darfur. Washington's genocide claim is exaggerated for political purposes. It's part of America's chess game with China for control of the region's resources. Beijing already gets up to 30% of its oil from Africa. Under cover from International Criminal Court's fraudulent indictment of Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir for war crimes and other contrived reasons, America has exploited the region militarily for geopolitical advantage. **18. Ecuador's Constitutional Rights of Nature** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/18-ecuadors-constitutional-rights-of-nature/)) In September 2008, Ecuador became the first country ever to declare constitutional rights to nature, thus codifying a new system of environmental protection. Its Constitution declares nature \"has the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in evolution.\" Ecuador's Rights of Nature hold hope that other nations may adopt them and start to more fully protect the environment. **19. Bank Bailout Recipients Spent to Defeat Labor** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/19-bank-bailout-recipients-spent-to-defeat-labor/)) After receiving $25 billion in federal bailout funds, Bank of America organized opposition to the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA) - legislation to guarantee workers the right to bargain more fairly and collectively with management. Business is firmly opposed. On March 10, S. 560: Employee Free Choice Act of 2009 was introduced in the Senate. It was referred to the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee where it's pending. Given the Obama administration's opposition, its passage looks doubtful. **20.

Secret Control of the Presidential Debates** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/20-secret-control-of-the-presidential-debates/)) Since 1987, the Republican and Democrat-controlled Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) has run the process, dictates terms, and excludes unwanted participants. During the 2008 presidential cycle, the Obama and McCain teams secretly cut a deal on who could participate, permissible topics, and the debate format structure. Before he died, Walter Cronkite called the CPD an \"unconscionable fraud.\" **21. Recession Causes States to Cut Welfare** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/21-recession-causes-states-to-cut-welfare/)) Faced with huge budget shortfalls and little help from Washington, states have been forced to make major expenditure cuts, many affecting vital social services, including health care, education, and welfare. Yet cutting Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) began prior to the present crisis so funds could be redirected to other priorities. Nationally, welfare rolls dropped over 40% between 2001 and June 2008, and in some states, like Georgia, up to 90%. America's social safety net is fast disappearing. **22. Obama's Trilateral Commission Team** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/22-obamas-trilateral-commission-team/)) Obama appointed 11 members of the [Trilateral Commission](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=14614) (TC) to top positions in his administration in his first ten days in office. He was groomed for the presidency by key TC members. Zbigniew Brzezinski, co-founder of the TC with David Rockefeller in 1973, has been Obama's principal foreign policy advisor. Since the Carter administration, Trilateralists have held the following very influential positions: six of the last eight World Bank presidents; all presidents and vice-presidents of the US (except Obama and Biden); over half of all US secretaries of state; and three quarters of the secretaries of defense. The original stated purpose of the TC was to create a \"new international economic order.\" For more on powerful secret societies, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles). **23. Activists Slam World Water Forum as a Corporate-Driven Fraud** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/23-activists-slam-world-water-forum-as-a-corporate-driven-fraud/)) Organized every three years since 1997, activists have blasted the World Water Forum as a corporate trade show promoting privatization of water. The Forum's main organizer, the World Water Council (WWC), is dominated by two of the world's largest water companies, Suez and Veolia. WWC promotes expensive and destructive dam and water diversion projects, as well as putting water services in private hands through the establishment of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). The result has been huge price hikes, water pollution, depletion, and cut-offs that deny people the right to water if they can't pay the exorbitant cost. **24.

Dollar Glut Finances US Military Expansion** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/24-dollar-glut-finances-us-military-expansion/)) Economist Michael Hudson first addressed this topic in his 1972 book, \"Super Imperialism,\" updated in a 2003 edition. He revisited it in an award-winning article which explained the inter-related dynamics of: surplus US dollars pouring into the rest of the world for financial speculation and corporate takeovers; global central banks recycling these dollar inflows into US Treasury bonds to finance the federal budget deficit; and most important (but suppressed in the US media), the military character of the US payments deficit. **25.

Vast parts of of this region will be opened for oil and gas exploration, putting some of the planet's most pristine and biodiverse forests at risk. **Stories of Inspiration and Hope ** Project Censored also presents inspiring stories that didn't receive the coverage they deserved.

Global Plans to Replace the Dollar** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/1-global-plans-to-replace-the-dollar/)) Since the financial meltdown of 2008 sent a jarring ripple effect throughout the global economy, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has been talking up the idea of an international market that doesn't use the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency. The dollar now holds the status of the predominant anchor currency held in foreign exchange reserves, securing the United States' strategic economic position. In July of 2009 at the Group of Eight Summit in Italy, **President Medvedev underscored his call for a newly conceived \"united future world currency\" when he pulled a sample coin from his pocket and showed it off to heads of state**, the [Bloomberg news service](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aeFVNYQpByU4) reported. And the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development suggested in a report that the present system of using the dollar as the world's reserve currency should be subject to a wholesale reconsideration, according to [an article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/currency/6152204/UN-wants-new-global-currency-to-replace-dollar.html) in the U.K.'s * Telegraph*. **Sources:** *Christian Science Monitor*, \"[Iran and Russia Nip at US Global Dominance](http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0616/p06s12-woeu.html)\" Truthdig, \"[The American Empire Is Bankrupt](http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20090614_the_american_empire_is_bankrupt/)\" Bloomberg, \"[Medvedev Shows Off Sample Coin of New 'World Currency' at G-8](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aeFVNYQpByU4)\" *Telegraph* (UK), \"[UN Wants New Global Currency to Replace Dollar](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/currency/6152204/UN-wants-new-global-currency-to-replace-dollar.html)\". **2.

US Department of Defense is the Worst Polluter on the Planet** ([Full story here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/2-us-department-of-defense-is-the-worst-polluter-on-the-planet/)) The U.S. military burns through 320,000 barrels of oil a day. Yet that tally doesn't factor in fuel consumed by contractors, or the energy and resources used to produce bombs, grenades, missiles or other weapons of the Department of Defense. **By every measure, the Pentagon is the largest institutional user of petroleum products - yet it has a blanket exemption in commitments made by the United States to curb greenhouse gas emissions.** Despite its status as top polluter, the Department of Defense received little attention during talks at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Meanwhile, human health is threatened by the long-term environmental impacts of military operations throughout the globe. And depleted uranium contamination from the Iraq conflict has been linked to widespread health problems. \"The greatest single assault on the environment comes from one agency,\" author Barry Sanders wrote in *[The Green Zone: The Environmental Costs of Militarism](http://www.akpress.org/2009/items/greenzoneakpress)*, \"the Armed Forces of the United States.\" **Sources: **International Action Center, \"[Add Climate Havoc to War Crimes: Pentagon's Role in Global Catastrophe](http://www.iacenter.org/o/world/climatesummit_pentagon121809)\" Planet Green, \"[Can You Identify the Worst Polluter on the Planet?

According to [a story](http://www.thenation.com/article/secret-us-war-pakistan) that ran in *The Nation* in December 2009, the contractor is at the center of a covert program in Pakistan run by the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command in the city of Karachi. **Blackwater (Xe) is involved in planning targeted assassinations of suspected Taliban and al-Qaida operatives and helps direct a U.S. military drone bombing campaign** that runs parallel to the well-documented CIA predator strikes, according to a well-placed source within the U.S. military.

[Research led by the Johns Hopkins Children's Center](http://www.hopkinschildrens.org/Lack-of-Insurance-May-Have-Figured-In-Nearly-17000-Childhood-Deaths.aspx) revealed that **lack of health insurance may have figured into 17,000 childhood deaths among hospitalized children in the U.S. in the span of less than two decades.** The results of a study published in the *Journal of Public Health* compared more than 23 million hospital records from 37 states between 1988 and 2005, and found that uninsured children in the study were 60 percent more likely to die in the hospital than those with insurance. \"Can we say with absolute certainty that 17,000 children would have been saved if they had health insurance?

Throughout the African continent, an estimated 50 million hectares (200,000 square miles) of land have been acquired or are in the process of being negotiated for purchase over the last several years, with international agribusinesses, investment banks, hedge funds, and commodity traders leading the rush for cheap, undeveloped, arable land. **Ethiopia has approved at least 815 foreign-financed agriculture projects since 2007, but the food that is produced there will be exported rather than used to feed the 13 million people in need of food aid in that country.** Food shortages and riots in 28 countries in 2008, declining water supplies, climate change and huge population growth together have made land attractive.

But the conflict escalated when armed Peruvian government agents attacked the protesters with rifles and, according to eye witnesses, burned bodies and threw them into a river. In the aftermath Peru's Congress voted 82 to 12 to repeal two of the decrees that the indigenous groups had been standing against.

However, upon closer examination, many of the claims made by the World Health Organization (WHO) seem to be based on weak and incomplete data.

Among the many donor nations, Cuba and its medical teams played a major role in treating Haiti's earthquake victims. Public health experts say the Cubans were the first to set up medical facilities among the debris and to revamp hospitals immediately after the earthquake struck.

This decision is being made in spite of continued evidence of extreme waste, fraud, abuse, and corporate welfare in the military budget. At the same time, spending on \"non-security\" domestic programs such as education, nutrition, energy, and transportation will be frozen, resulting in inflationary cuts to essential services for the US public over the upcoming years.

Pachauri, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), told the *Observer* that Western society urgently needs to develop a new value system of \"sustainable consumption.\" The Nobel Prize winner stated, \"Today we have reached the point where consumption and people's desire to consume has grown out of proportion.\" **22. 1.2 Billion People in India to be Given Biometric ID Cards** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/22-1-2-billion-people-in-india-to-be-given-biometric-id-cards/)) India's 1.2 billion citizens are to be issued biometric identification cards. The cards will hold the person's name, age, and birth date, as well as fingerprints or iris scans, though no caste or religious identification. Within the next five years a giant computer will hold the personal details of at least 600 million citizens, making this new information technology system the largest in the world. The project will cost an estimated $3.5 billion. The 600 million Indians will receive a 16-digit identity number by 2014. **23.

IRF is an extrajudicial terror squad, the existence of which has been documented since the early days of Guantanamo. IRF has rarely been mentioned in the United States media or in congressional inquiries into torture. ** Stories of Hope and Creative Change** For more than 30 years, Project Censored has searched out the most important undercovered stories of the year showing what's wrong with our world. But in 2008, Project Censored began offering a new feature: a list of the top underreported stories of hope and creative change. These stories suggest that a better world is both possible and practical, and that every day, all over the world, people are solving problems. The message is simple: Stop fighting or lamenting existing reality-be an innovator and help create something better. Below are key examples from the year 2010. ** ****Happiness, Not Economic Growth, Is Becoming the Goal:** Global surveys confirm that the happiest peoples are not those living in countries with the highest growth rates or the most wealth, but those with the most equity, \"social solidarity,\" work-life balance, and strong safety nets. New research shows that, among developed countries, the healthiest and happiest aren't those with the highest incomes but those with the most equality. Increasing numbers are recognizing that growth-at-all-costs policies can't continue: Growth-based policies may increase the wealth for the already rich, but they have failed to result in broad well-being. Happiness is emerging as a substitute goal among researchers and leading policy makers. **Local Food Comes to a Neighborhood Near You:** Communities are increasingly turning to local food to improve health, strengthen the local economy, and bring fresh foods to those living in food deserts. **Worldwide Climate Movement Flexes Its Muscles:** The December 2009 United Nations climate talks in Copenhagen did not produce a binding treaty, but they did galvanize a united international movement of people calling for solutions to stop runaway climate change.

In the last two years, these trends have only gotten worse. But what is unreported is the growth of cooperatives, which are creating jobs that can't pick up and move overseas, while helping some communities make a green economic recovery. Worker-owned coops are just one segment of the 30,000 cooperative business in the U.S. generating $500 billion in revenue. These cooperatives are among the many inspired by the [Mondragon cooperatives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) in the Basque region of Spain **Citizen Budgeting Comes to the U.S.:** Born in Porto Alegre, Brazil, participatory budgeting has come to Chicago's 49th ward, the first place in the United States to adopt the practice that allows taxpayers to directly decide how to spend public money.

What's going on is a belief that you can manipulate communicable trust between the leadership and the led. The way you do that is you don't let the press in anywhere. Access to war is extremely limited. The fiercer the combat, the more the access is limited, [including] access to information. This is a direct contradiction of the stated policy of maximum access to information consistent with national security. There was a time in South Africa when people would put flaming tires around people's necks if they dissented.

The existence of this program which spread CIA propaganda through the media was flatly denied until it was uncovered in Senate hearings in the mid-1970s. The CIA's claims that it shut the program down in 1976 are undoubtedly a further deception. They simply shifted the operation to other parts of the agency as they had been caught red-handed. Before the US Senate Church Committee revelations, the media and CIA colluded overtly in their media propaganda campaigns, as you will read below. As the public was quite incensed with these revelations, afterwards the collusion became covert and much more sophisticated. Nowadays media executives or journalists are very careful keep their CIA connections secret, yet there is [plenty of evidence](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mass_media/media-influence) the techniques developed and used under Operation Mockingbird continue to be common practice.

These individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of newspapers and periodicals, scores of press services and news agencies, radio and television stations, commercial book publishers, and other foreign media outlets.\"256 [Carl Bernstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Bernstein), the reporter famous for his excellent investigation into the Watergate scandal, wrote that: \"(Joseph) Alsop is one of more than 400 American journalists who in the past twenty-five years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents on file at CIA headquarters. Some of these journalists' relationships with the Agency were tacit; some were explicit. There was cooperation, accommodation and overlap. Journalists provided a full range of clandestine services-from simple intelligence gathering to serving as go betweens with spies in Communist countries. **Reporters shared their notebooks with the CIA. Editors shared their staffs. Some of the journalists were Pulitzer Prize winners, distinguished reporters who considered themselves ambassadors without portfolio for their country. **Most were less exalted: foreign correspondents who found that their association with the Agency helped their work; stringers and freelancers who were as interested in the derring-do of the spy business as in filing articles; and, the smallest category, full-time CIA employees masquerading as journalists abroad. In many instances, CIA documents show, journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of the managements of America's leading news organizations.\"257 **While a majority of Mockingbird operations were overseas, the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mass_media__operation-mockingbird.txt:1:a9fb72961121", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12431, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mass_media__operation-mockingbird.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mass_media__operation-mockingbird", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "were less exalted: foreign correspondents who found that their association with the Agency helped their work; stringers and freelancers who were as interested in the derring-do of the spy business as in filing articles; and, the smallest category, full-time CIA employees masquerading as journalists abroad. In many instances, CIA documents show, journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of the managements of America's leading news organizations.\"257 **While a majority of Mockingbird operations were overseas, the goal was to have important, hard-hitting stories to be circulated in the American press.** Relationships with major United States media institutions certainly helped with this goal. Bernstein lists *The New York Times, CBS *and *Time inc. *as the most productive relationships the agency cultivated. They also created front organizations overseas who publicly maintained an appearance of free press but privately were operated by the agency. An example of this is the *Rome Daily American, *which was 40% owned by the CIA for three decades.258 Another strategy was developing relationships with major media owners who were known to harbor right-wing views, such as William Paley of *CBS*, and then passing on information of journalists, actors and screenwriters who harbored left-wing views. Information was also passed on to friendly congressmen such as Joseph McCarthy. These men and women would then be blacklisted from the industry. Lee J. Cobb was one such actor who was blacklisted, and recalled his experience: \"When the facilities of the government of the United States are drawn on an individual it can be terrifying. The blacklist is just the opening gambit - being deprived of work. Your passport is confiscated. That's minor. But not being able to move without being tailed is something else. After a certain point it grows to implied as well as articulated threats, and people succumb. My wife did, and she was institutionalized. In 1953 the HCUA (House UnAmerican Activities Committee) did a deal with me. I was pretty much worn down. I had no money. I couldn't borrow. I had the expenses of taking care of the children. Why am I subjecting my loved ones to this? If it's worth dying for, and I am just as idealistic as the next fellow. But I decided it wasn't worth dying for, and if this gesture was the way of getting out of the penitentiary I'd do it. I had to be employable again.\"259 **The CIA went as far as to write scripts for Hollywood. One interesting example is the funding of the movie version of Animal Farm in 1954, a book written just less than a decade earlier by George Orwell which enjoyed large commercial success. The problem for the CIA was that Orwell was a socialist, and his book attacked both capitalism and communism.

The problem for the CIA was that Orwell was a socialist, and his book attacked both capitalism and communism. To avoid this conflict, the CIA changed the ending of the Hollywood version to portray capitalism in a more positive light.260** Domestic surveillance was also used on journalists who had published classified material. In one example, a physical surveillance post was set up at a Hilton Hotel in view of the office of *Washington Post *writer Michael Getler.261 The operation defied the CIA's charter, which specifically prohibits domestic spying. The operation was directed towards numerous members of the Washington press corp, and was signed off by John F. Kennedy himself, in coordination with CIA director John McCone.262 **One CIA document states: \"Get books published or distributed abroad without revealing any U.S. Influence, by covertly subsidizing foreign publicans or booksellers... Get books published for operational reasons, regardless of commercial viability\". The Church Committee concluded that over 1000 books were published under this directive.263** Some investigative journalists have claimed that Operation Mockingbird did not end in 1976 as the CIA claims. For example, in 1998, researcher Steve Kangas claimed that conservative billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, who ran 'Forum World Features', a foreign news organization, was a CIA asset and used the organization to disseminate propaganda for circulation in the United States.264 Kangas ended up dead with a bullet hole in his head, in the office of Richard Scaife. It was ruled a suicide, although there were discrepancies in the police report and the autopsy.265 The Church Committee's conclusion accurately reflects the problems associated with Operation Mockingbird: \"In examining the CIA's past and present use of the U.S. media, the Committee finds two reasons for concern. The first is the potential, inherent in covert media operations, for manipulating or incidentally misleading the American public. The second is the damage to the credibility and independence of a free press which may be caused by covert relationships with the U.S. journalists and media organizations.\"266 While it is deplorable for citizens of countries to be subjected to a state-owned media, at least they can be aware of the biases and filter information accordingly. **We have been taught a lie from birth that the U.S. press is free from government meddling.

The wired-in society. The growth of organic food. The new frugality. This is the ritual that reveals their true function in the culture: pacification. It's their way of signaling the masses that Bigger Thinkers are looking after things, so go back to your Wii or Survivor or Facebook reveries. The amazing thing is how little is ever mentioned about the stories that really mattered, those that affected the very nature of our society, its institutions, and the relation of the people to their state and society. Those stories paint a picture of danger, of a people who have lost control of their government and the corporations that own it. But you'll hear nary a word about such difficult truths from any storyteller in the conventional media. So here, in no particular order, are my Top Ten Stories of the Naughties, the ones that really matter. **Iraq was all premised on lies, yet we're still there.** Saddam Hussein wasn't pursuing Weapons of Mass Destruction. He wasn't involved in 9/11. He wasn't engaged with Al Qaeda. We know all these things. And we know they were false at the time they were proffered. Yet, there we are, with no intent to leave, our very presence spitting in the face of International Law and the international community we so unctuously pretend to respect.

But over the last decade 2/3 of all economic growth has gone to the top 1% of income earners. Meanwhile the middle class has suffered a $13 trillion writedown in wealth as a result of the housing collapse. The banking bailout and the health care \"reform\" debate showed as never before the extent to which corporations have captured government and use it to redirect national wealth to themselves and their owners.

Matt Taibbi, one of the main journalists behind this effort, created a compilation of concise one-paragraph summaries of all the Twitter Files threads by every reporter involved. Links and notes on key information are included. You can access all of the summaries below. These included widespread scientific censorship related to COVID-19 issues to concerns of US election meddling and the banning of political voices. **Significant concerns are now being raised about Twitter's handling of these vital issues. **What influence should our government agencies have over Big Tech and public access to important information? How do we discern trustworthy information from propaganda and misinformation? **Meanwhile, culture wars and polarization playing out on mainstream and independent media platforms are hindering nuanced debate about this. **Why is the media not giving much attention to these deeper conversations? May we hold these challenging questions across our political differences, as we reform society and our media systems for democracy, free speech, and the greater good.

The idea behind the series is to show how all of Twitter's \"visibility filtering\" tools were on display and deployed after January 6th, 2021. **Key Revelations**: Trust and Safety chief Yoel Roth not only met regularly with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, but with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). Also, Twitter was aggressively applying \"visibility filtering\" tools to Trump well before the election.

Also, chief censor Roth argues for a ban on congressman Matt Gaetz even though it \"doesn't quite fit anywhere (duh),\" and Twitter changed its \"public interest policy\" to clear a path for Trump's removal.

The first describes how Twitter fell under pressure from Congress and the media to produce \"material\" showing a conspiracy of Russian accounts on their platform, and the second shows how Twitter tried to resist fulfilling moderation requests for the State Department, but ultimately agreed to let State and other agencies send requests through the FBI, which agent Chan calls \"the belly button of the USG.\" **Revelations**: at the close of 2017, Twitter makes a key internal decision. Outwardly, the company would claim independence and promise that content would only be removed at \"our sole discretion.\" The internal guidance says, in writing, that Twitter will remove accounts \"identified by the U.S. intelligence community\" as \"identified by the U.S.. intelligence community as a state-sponsored entity conducting cyber-operations.\" The second thread shows how Twitter took in requests from everyone - Treasury, HHS, NSA, FBI, DHS, etc. - and also received personal requests from politicians like Democratic congressman Adam Schiff, who [asked to have journalist Paul Sperry suspended](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1610394284867436547).

It attempted to answer some troubling questions: Why had Monsanto sued two small dairies to prevent them from labeling their milk as coming from cows *not* injected with [growth hormone rBGH]? Why had two Canadian health regulators claimed that their jobs were threatened - and then said Monsanto offered them a bribe to give fast-track approval to the drug? Why did Florida supermarkets break their much-publicized promise that milk in the dairy case would *not* come from hormone-treated cows? And why was the US the only major industrialized nation to approve this controversial genetically engineered hormone? (p. 211) Station managers were so proud of our work that they saturated virtually every Tampa Bay radio station with thousands of dollars' worth of ads urging viewers to watch what we'd uncovered about \"The Mystery in Your Milk.\" But then, our Fox managers' pride turned to panic. [Monsanto lawyer] John Walsh wrote that some points of the story \"clearly contain the elements of defamatory statements which, if repeated in a broadcast, could lead to serious damage to Monsanto and *dire consequences* for Fox News.\" (pp. 211-213) It was not long after our [unsuccessful] struggle to air an honest report had begun that Fox fired both the news director and the general manager. The new general manager, Dave Boylan, explained that if we didn't agree to changes that Monsanto and Fox lawyers were insisting upon, we'd be fired for insubordination within 48 hours. We pleaded with Dave to look at the facts we'd uncovered, many of which conclusively disproved Monsanto's claims.

This is an excerpt from an interview originally aired on BBC Newsnight on May 16, 2002.* Access was extremely limited to the press during the time of September 11th, and ever since then [has been] limited in a way that is unprecedented in American journalism. There was a full understanding of why access was so limited during that time. [However] in the weeks and months that followed September 11th, the federal government began to take an unprecedented attitude about the access of American journalists to the war. What's particularly troubling is that what's being done is in direct variance with the Pentagon's stated policy [of] maximum access and maximum information consistent with national security.

What's going on is a belief that you can manipulate communicable trust between the leadership and the led. The way you do that is you don't let the press in anywhere (p. 36-38). Access to the [Iraq] war is extremely limited. The fiercer the combat, the more the access is limited, [including] access to information. I would say that overwhelmingly the limiting of access to information has much more to do with the determination to be seen as conducting the war errorlessly than it does with any sense of national security (p. 40). None of us in journalism have asked questions strongly enough about limiting access and information for reasons other than national security. It's unpatriotic not to ask questions. Anybody in American journalism who tells you that he or she has not felt this pressure [not to ask tough questions] is either kidding themselves or trying to deceive you (p. 39-40) What we're talking about here is a form of self-censorship. Self-censorship is a real and present danger to journalists at every level and on a lot of different kinds of stories. Before the war, before September 11th, fear ruled every newsroom in the country in some important ways - fear if we don't dumb it down, if we don't tart it up, if we don't go to the trivial at the expense of the important, we're not going to be publishing a newspaper or magazine. We're not going to be on the air. The ratings will eat us up. (p. 41-42). There was a time in South Africa when people would put flaming tires around people's necks if they dissented. In some ways the fear [now in the U.S.] is that you'll have a flaming tire of lack of patriotism put around your neck. It's that fear that keeps journalists from asking the tough questions. And I am humbled to say, I do not except myself from this criticism (p. 42).

At the end of the court-martial, there seemed no question that Garwood was a monstrous traitor. (pp. 255, 256) In 1985, Garwood was speaking publicly about something that had never made the news during his court-martial. The *Wall Street Journal* reported he said that he knew firsthand of other American prisoners in Vietnam long after the war was over. He was supported by Vietnam combat veterans whose war records were impeccable. These veterans told a story vastly different from what was made public during the court-martial and one that was intimately tied to another *60 Minutes* story I was working on - \"Dead or Alive?\" The title referred to Vietnam POW/MIAs [Prisoners Of War/Missing In Action]. (p. 256) My sources included outstanding experts like former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency General Eugene Tighe and returned POWs like Captain Red McDaniel, who held the Navy's top award for bravery, had commanded the aircraft carrier *Lexington, *and was director of liaison on Capitol Hill for the Navy and Marine Corps. With such advocates providing back up, it was hard not to consider the possibility that prisoners (some 3,500) had in fact been kept by the Vietnamese communists as hostages to make sure the US would pay the more than $3 billion in war reparations that Nixon had promised before his fall from grace. Particularly compelling was the fact that of the 300 prisoners known to be held in Laos, not one was released for homecoming in 1973. (p. 256) Initially held back to ensure the US would fulfill its secret promise to pay reparation monies, by 1979 American POWs had become worthless pawns.

I had no idea that my life would be turned upside down and inside out - that I'd be assigned to walk into what I now call \"the buzzsaw.\" (p. 284) The buzzsaw is what can rip through you when you try to investigate or expose anything this country's large institutions - be they corporate or government - want kept under wraps. The system fights back with official lies, disinformation, and stonewalling. Your phone starts acting funny. Strange people call you at strange hours to give you strange information.

(p. 284) Pierre Salinger announced to the world on November 8, 1996, that he'd received documents from French intelligence proving that a US Navy missile had accidentally downed [TWA Flight 800]. That same day, FBI's Jim Kallstrom called a press conference to deny Salinger's allegations. [At the press conference,] Kallstrom rattled off a prepared speech, and then it was time for questions. A man raised his hand and asked why the Navy was involved in the recovery and investigation while a possible suspect. Kallstrom's response was immediate; \"Remove him!\" he yelled. Two men leapt over to the questioner and grabbed him by the arms. There was a momentary chill in the air after the guy had been dragged out of the room. Kallstrom acted as if nothing had happened. (pp. 290, 291) A few weeks after the FBI's visit to CBS, I received my walking papers. Law enforcement consultant Paul Ragonese eventually got his walking papers, too.

[Several] weeks after the election, this [extraordinary news](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2000/dec/10/columnists.theobserver) ran on page one of the country's leading paper. Unfortunately, it was in the wrong country: Britain. In the USA, it was not covered. It was given big network TV coverage. But again, it was on the wrong continent - on BBC TV, London. (pp. 195, 196) The office of the governor [also] illegally ordered the removal of felons from the voter rolls - *real felons* - but with the right to vote under Florida law. As a result, *50,000* of these voters could not vote. The fact that 90% of these voters were Democrats should have made it news because this maneuver alone more than accounted for Bush's victory. (pp. 197-200) In February 2001, I took my BBC film crew to Florida, having unearthed a page marked \"secret\" and \"confidential\" from the company the state had hired to make up the list of names to purge from voter rolls. I took my camera crew into an agreed interview with Jeb Bush's director of the Department of Elections. When I pulled out the confidential sheet, Bush's man ripped off the microphone and did the fifty-yard dash, locking himself in his office, all in front of our cameras. It was killer television and wowed the British viewers. We even ran a confession from the company. Newsworthy for the USA? Apparently not. (pp. 202, 203) A group of well-placed sources told my BBC team that before Sept. 11th the US government had turned away evidence of Saudi billionaires funding bin Laden's network. We got our hands on documents that backed up the story that FBI and CIA investigations had been slowed by the Clinton administration, then killed by Bush Jr.'s. The story made top of the news - in Britain. In the US, one TV reporter picked up the report. He was called, he says, by network chiefs, and told to go no further. He didn't.

Three decades later, despite the expenditure of $1 trillion in tax dollars, the number of hard-core addicts is shortly expected to exceed five million. Our nation has become the supermarket of the drug world, with a wider variety and bigger supply of drugs at cheaper prices than ever before. The problem now not only affects every town on the map, but it is difficult to find a family anywhere that is not somehow affected. (pp. 158, 159) The Chang Mai factory the CIA prevented me from destroying was the source of massive amounts of heroin being smuggled into the US in the bodies and body bags of GIs killed in Vietnam. (p. 165) My unit, the Hard Narcotics Smuggling Squad, was charged with investigating all heroin and cocaine smuggling through the Port of New York. My unit became involved in investigating every major smuggling operation known to law enforcement. We could not avoid witnessing the CIA protecting major drug dealers. Not a single important source in Southeast Asia was ever indicted by US law enforcement. This was no accident. Case after case was killed by CIA and State Department intervention and there wasn't a damned thing we could do about it. CIA-owned airlines like Air America were being used to ferry drugs throughout Southeast Asia, allegedly to support our \"allies.\" CIA banking operations were used to launder drug money. (pp. 165, 166) In 1972, I was assigned to assist in a major international drug case involving top Panamanian government officials who were using diplomatic passports to smuggle large quantities of heroin and other drugs into the US. The name Manuel Noriega surfaced prominently in the investigation. Surfacing right behind Noriega was the CIA to protect him from US law enforcement. As head of the CIA, Bush authorized a salary for Manuel Noriega as a CIA asset, while the dictator was listed in as many as 40 DEA computer files as a drug dealer. (pp. 166, 167) The CIA and the Department of State were protecting more and more politically powerful drug traffickers around the world: the Mujihadeen in Afghanistan, the Bolivian cocaine cartels, the top levels of Mexican government, Nicaraguan Contras, Colombian drug dealers and politicians, and others.

Media's duties, as I experienced firsthand, were twofold: first, to keep quiet about the gush of drugs that was allowed to flow unimpeded into the US; second, to divert the public's attention by shilling them into believing the drug war was legitimate by falsely presenting the few trickles we were permitted to indict as though they were major \"victories,\" when in fact we were doing nothing more than getting rid of the inefficient competitors of CIA assets. (pp. 166, 167) On July 17, 1980, drug traffickers actually took control of a nation. Bolivia at the time [was] the source of virtually 100% of the cocaine entering the US. CIA-recruited mercenaries and drug traffickers unseated Bolivia's democratically elected president, a leftist whom the US government didn't want in power. Immediately after the coup, cocaine production increased massively, until it soon outstripped supply. This was the true beginning of the crack \"plague.\" (pp. 167, 168) The CIA along with the State and Justice Departments had to combine forces to protect their drug-dealing assets by destroying a DEA investigation. How do I know? I was the inside source. I sat down at my desk in the American embassy and wrote the kind of letter that I never myself imagined ever writing. I detailed three pages typewritten on official US embassy stationary-enough evidence of my charges to feed a wolf pack of investigative journalists. I also expressed my willingness to be a quotable source. I addressed it directly to Strasser and Rohter, care of *Newsweek.* Two sleepless weeks later, I was still sitting in my embassy office staring at the phone. Three weeks later, it rang. It was DEA's internal security. They were calling me to notify me that I was under investigation. I had been falsely accused of everything from black-marketing to having sex with a married female DEA agent. The investigation would wreak havoc with my life for the next four years. (pp. 168-171) In one glaring case, an associate of mine was sent into Honduras to open a DEA office in Tegucigalpa. Within months he had documented as much as 50 tons of cocaine being smuggled into the US by Honduran military people who were supporting the Contras. This was enough cocaine to fill a third of US demand. What was the DEA response? They closed the office.

A Customs and DEA investigation quickly revealed that the smugglers were the Venezuelan National Guard headed by General Guillen, a CIA \"asset\" who claimed that he had been operating under CIA orders and protection. The CIA soon admitted that this was true. If the CIA is good at anything, it is the complete control of American mass media. So secure are they in their ability to manipulate the mass media that they even brag about it in their own in-house memos. The *New York Times* had the story almost immediately in 1990 and did not print it until 1993. It finally became news that was \"fit to print\" when the *Times* learned that *60 Minutes* also had the story and was actually going to run it. The highlight of the *60 Minutes* piece is when the administrator of the DEA, Federal Judge Robert Bonner, tells Mike Wallace, \"There is no other way to put it, Mike, [what the CIA did] is *drug smuggling*. It's *illegal* [author's emphasis].\" (pp. 188, 189) The fact is - and you can read it yourself in the federal court records - that seven months *before* the attempt to blow up the World Trade Center in 1993, the FBI had a paid informant, Emad Salem, who had infiltrated the bombers and had told the FBI of their plans to blow up the twin towers. Without notifying the NYPD or anyone else, an FBI supervisor \"fired\" Salem, who was making $500 a week for his work. After the bomb went off, the FBI hired Salem back and paid him $1.5 million to help them track down the bombers. But that's not all the FBI missed. When they finally did catch the actual bomber, Ramzi Yousef (a man trained with CIA funds during the Russia-Afghanistan war), the FBI found information on his personal computer about plans to use hijacked American jetliners as fuel-laden missiles. The FBI ignored this information, too.

He worked on several newspapers until being forced out of his job after the *San Jose Mercury News* retracted their support for the *Dark Alliance* story discussed below.* In 1996, I wrote a series of stories, entitled *Dark Alliance, *that began this way: For the better part of a decade, a Bay Area drug ring sold tons of cocaine to the Crips and Bloods street gangs of LA and funneled millions in drug profits to a Latin American guerilla army run by the CIA. The cocaine that flooded in helped spark a crack explosion in urban America. It is one of the most bizarre alliances in modern history - the union of a US-backed army attempting to overthrow a socialist government and the Uzi-toting \"gangstas\" of Los Angeles. (p. 143) In December 1995, I wrote a lengthy memo to my editors, advising them of what my Nicaraguan colleague and I had found: With the help of recently declassified documents, FBI reports, DEA undercover tapes, as well as interviews with some of the key participants, we will show how a CIA-linked drug and stolen car network provided weapons and tons of high-grade, dirt cheap cocaine to the very person who spread crack through LA and from there into the hinterlands. A bizarre bond between an elusive CIA operative and a brilliant car thief from LA's ghettos touched off a social phenomenon - crack and gang-power - that changed our lives. The day these two men met was literally ground zero for California's crack explosion. This is also the story of how an ill-planned foreign policy adventure - the CIA's \"secret\" war in Nicaragua - boomeranged back to the streets of America, in the long run doing more damage to us than to our \"enemies\" in Central America. We have compelling evidence that the kingpins of this cocaine ring enjoyed a unique relationship with the US government that has continued to this day. (pp. 145-146) The story was developing a political momentum all of its own, and it was happening despite a virtual news blackout from the mass media.

I quit the *Mercury News* after that. (p. 153) The CIA's knowledge and involvement had been far greater than I'd ever imagined. Agents and officials of the DEA had protected the traffickers from arrest, something I'd not been allowed to print. At the start of the Contra war, the CIA and Justice Department had worked out an unusual agreement that permitted the CIA not to have to report allegations of drug trafficking by its agents to the Justice Department. It was a curious loophole in the law, to say the least. (p. 154) The *Mercury News* had broken the rules and used the Internet to get in by the back door, leaving the big papers momentarily embarrassed. It forced them to readdress an issue they'd much rather have forgotten. By turning on the *Mercury News*, the big boys were reminding the rest of the flock who really runs the newspaper business, Internet or no Internet, and the extent to which they will go to protect that power, even if it meant rearranging reality to suit them.

It is the first, and to date, the only, contemporaneous critical account of the FBI to be published by a mainstream publisher. He is also an independent investigative producer. He is the former editor and senior writer for the *National Reporter*, a publication specializing in reporting on the CIA.* According to the Central Intelligence Agency itself, as reported by the House Intelligence Committee, \"The Clandestine Service of the CIA is the only part of the Intelligence Community, indeed of government, where hundreds of employees on a daily basis are directed to break extremely serious laws in countries around the world. A safe estimate is that several hundred times every day (easily 100,000 times a year), officers engage in highly illegal activities.\" (pp. 115, 116) The national security of the United States requires that more than 100,000 extremely serious crimes be committed every year. The [House Intelligence] Committee expressed no legal or ethical concerns about these crimes. The committee indicated that it did not matter that laws were broken because they were laws of other countries. The CIA [is] committing crimes against humanity with *de facto* impunity and Congressional sanctioning. (pp. 116, 117) Government documents, including CIA reports, show that the CIA's crimes include terrorism, assassination, torture, and systematic violations of human rights. The documents show that these crimes are part and parcel of deliberate CIA policy. The report notes that CIA personnel are \"directed\" to commit crimes. (p. 117) CIA documents show that the CIA created, trained, and armed death squads in Guatemala as part of its coup and destabilization of the democratically elected government in 1954.

In Honduras, the CIA's own inspector general reported that paid CIA assets at the highest level created and ran a death squad which, according to the Honduran government, murdered at least 184 people. The House Intelligence Committee's only concern regarding these brutal CIA informants and other CIA offenders was that they might be arrested and prosecuted. The committee did not advise the CIA to cease or limit its lawlessness. The Senate Intelligence Committee proposed a bill that would immunize CIA offenders who violate treaties and international agreements while following orders. The bill passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on December 27, 2000. (pp. 117-118) [This law] means that the Constitution does not apply to the CIA or any US intelligence personnel. Why? Because the constitution provides that all treaties are the *supreme law of the land.* Not just law, but the *supreme law* - no exceptions. There was not a peep from the mass media about any of this even though such a story would not have affected corporate sponsorship or profits. (pp. 119) The intelligence committees recommended that the \"aggressive recruitment\" of \"terrorist informants who have human rights violations in their background\" be \"one of the highest priorities.\" Within months of instituting the guidelines, incoming CIA director George Tenet assured Congress that not a single unsavory applicant had been rejected. (pp. 120, 121) Former ambassador Robert White wrote that Manuel Noriega of Panama, Colonel Julio Alpirez of Guatemala, General Gustavo Alvarez Martinez of Honduras, Colonel Nicolas Carranza of El Salvador, and Emmanuel Constant of Haiti, all major human rights abusers, were CIA informants who \"enjoyed profitable contractual arrangements with the CIA not because they were particularly important sources of information, but because they served as paid agents of influence who promoted actions or policies favored by the CIA in that country.\" (p. 122) Former CIA General Counsel Sporkin revealed that the CIA, not the president, creates findings to fit preordained covert operations and sends the findings to the president for his signature. (p. 126, 127) There is next to no meaningful coverage ever of the CIA in the mainstream media, let alone analysis. The few exceptions prove the rule. In 1984, I was involved in one such exception.

ABC hired me to help produce a story about an investment firm in Hawaii that was heavily involved with the CIA. I had earlier provided the same story to BBC's *Newsnight*, which aired it. The story was fully documented, and nobody, including the CIA, was able to disprove the charges. Part of the report charged that the CIA had plotted to assassinate an American, Ron Rewald, the president of [the investment firm]. The ABC report provoked a brutal response from the CIA. The CIA demanded a full retraction without providing any counterproof other than their denial. (pp. 130, 131) At the center of the uproar was Scott Barnes who said on camera that the CIA had asked him to kill Rewald. After the show aired, CIA officials met with *ABC News* executive David Burke. They presented no evidence to counter the charges made in the program. Nonetheless, Burke was sufficiently impressed \"by the vigor with which they made their case\" to order an on-air \"clarification\" in which Peter Jennings acknowledged the CIA's position but stood by the story. But that was not good enough. [CIA Director William] Casey called ABC Chairman Leonard H. Goldenson. The call led to three meetings between ABC officials and Stanley Sporkin, CIA general counsel. On November 21, 1984, despite all the documented evidence presented in the program, Peter Jennings reported that ABC could no longer substantiate the charges, and that \"We have no reason to doubt the CIA's denial.\" He presented no evidence supporting the CIA's position. (pp. 131, 132) That same day, the CIA filed a formal complaint with the FCC, written by Sporkin and signed by [CIA Director] Casey, charging that ABC had \"deliberately distorted\" the news. Casey asked that ABC be stripped of its TV and radio licenses. This was the first time in the history of the country that a government agency had formally attacked the press. Yet, there was no uproar. (p. 132) During this time, Capital Cities Communications was maneuvering to buy ABC. [CIA Director] Casey was one of the founders of Cap Cities. Cap Cities bought ABC for $3.5 billion, which was called a \"bargain rate\" by the trade media. Besides Casey, two other founders of Cap Cities had extensive ties to the intelligence community. Within months, the entire investigative unit [of ABC] was dispersed, and the commentator on the Rewald program was assigned to covering beauty pageants. Needless to say, my contract was not renewed.

He has won numerous awards for his work.* There were 50 major media corporations in 1993, and now there are only about half a dozen. Corporate socialization has been exacerbated by the multibillion-dollar mergers that created international giants such as AOL Time Warner, Disney, General Electric, News Corporation, and Viacom. (pp. 425-428) Shortly after the outbreak of the First Terrorist War of the 21st Century, I was reminded of what US Senator Hiram Johnson said during World War I: \"The first casualty when war comes, is truth.\" Post-September 11, 2001, the free flow of information in America is slowing to a carefully monitored trickle. The president of the US says he can only trust eight members of Congress. The attorney general admonishes Congress to pass the controversial Anti-Terrorism Act without debate. The national security adviser cautions TV networks not to broadcast press conferences with Taliban leaders because they may contain hidden messages. The military tells the press this is a \"different war\" and thus it can't observe the 1992 agreement allowing the media more access to information. The president's press secretary warns the media and all Americans to watch what they say and watch what they do. These are ominous signs for democracy. (pp. 432, 433) In the same way that we survived Pearl Harbor, we will survive the Sept. 11 terrorist attack.

First, it regarded anything done by official sources, for example, government officials and prominent public figures, as the basis for legitimate news. Second, professional journalism posited that there had to be a news hook or a news peg to justify a news story. [This] helped to stimulate the birth and rapid rise of the public relations (PR) industry. Surveys show that PR accounts for anywhere from 40 to 70 percent of what appears as news. The third bias is that [professional journalism] smuggles in values conducive to the commercial aims of the owners and advertisers as well as the political aims of the owning class. The affairs of government are subjected to much closer scrutiny than the affairs of big business. The genius of professionalism in journalism is that it tends to make journalists oblivious to the compromises with authority they routinely make. (pp. 440, 441) Professional journalism equates the spread of \"free markets\" with the spread of democracy. To the US elite, however, democracy tends to be defined by their ability to maximize profit in a nation, and that is, in effect, the standard of professional journalism. (p. 442) [There] is the striking consolidation of the mass media from hundreds of significant firms to an integrated industry dominated by less than ten enormous transnational conglomerates and rounded out by no more than another fifteen very large firms. The first tier giants include AOL Time Warner, Disney, Viacom, News Corporation, Bertelsmann, Vivendi Universal, Sony, AT&T, and General Electric. The nine or ten largest media conglomerates now almost all rank among the 300 largest firms in the world; in 1965, there were barely any media firms among the five hundred largest companies in the world. (p. 444) The largest ten media firms own all the US TV networks, most of the TV stations in the largest markets, all major film studios, all major music companies, nearly all of the cable TV channels, much of the book and magazine publishing [industry], and much, much more. The logic of mass media industries is that a firm can no longer compete if it is not part of a larger conglomerate. General Electric's NBC is the only commercial TV network that does not own a major Hollywood film studio. (pp. 444, 445) Expensive investigative journalism - especially that which goes after powerful corporate or national security interests - is discouraged.

(p. 445) Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, real income declined or was stagnant for the lower 60 percent, while wealth and income for the rich skyrocketed. By 1998, discounting home ownership, the top 10 percent of the population claimed 76 percent of the nation's net worth. More than half is accounted for by the richest 1 percent. The *Washington Post* has gone so far as to describe ours as a nearly \"perfect economy,\" which [reveals] the vantage point of the corporate news media. And it does appear more and more perfect the higher one goes up the socioeconomic ladder. (pp. 447, 448) The rate of incarceration has more than doubled since the late 1980s. The US now has five times more prisoners per capita than Canada and seven times more than the whole of Western Europe. The US has 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's prisoners. Nearly 90 percent of prisoners are jailed for nonviolent offenses, often casualties of the so-called drug war. It is a debate among Democrats and Republicans over who can be \"tougher\" on crime, hire more police, and build more prisons. Almost overnight, the prison-industrial complex has become a big business and a powerful lobby for public funds. (p. 448) In the year 2000, a Texas man received 16 years in prison for stealing a Snickers candy bar, while four executives at Hoffman-LaRoche were found guilty of conspiring to suppress and eliminate competition in the vitamin industry in what the Justice Department called perhaps the largest criminal antitrust conspiracy in history. The four executives were fined anywhere from $75,000 to $350,000. They received prison terms ranging from three all the way up to four months. (p. 449) The propagandistic nature of the war coverage was made crystal clear by AOL Time Warner's CNN a few weeks after the war began in Afghanistan. CNN president Walter Isaacson authorized CNN to provide two different versions of the war: a more critical one for the global audience and a sugarcoated one for Americans. Isaacson instructed the domestic CNN to be certain that any story that might undermine support for the US war be balanced with a reminder that the war on terrorism is a response to the heinous attacks of September 11.

(p. 452) We need to press for the overhaul of the media system, so that it serves democratic values rather than the interests of capital. The US media system has nothing to do with the wishes of the Founding Fathers and even less to do with the workings of some alleged free market. To the contrary, the media system is the result of laws, government subsidies, and regulations made in the public's name, but made corruptly behind closed doors without the public's informed consent. The largest media firms are all built on top of the profits generated by government gifts of monopoly rights. It is impossible to conceive of a better world with a media system that remains under the thumb of Wall Street and Madison Avenue, under the thumb of the owning class. It is nearly impossible to conceive of a better world without some changes in the media status quo. We have no time to waste.

For most of my 18 years working with the U.S. Department of State, I did not see or hear anything which would support the belief of some of my conspiracy friends that global politics is largely controlled by a small group of evil men behind the scenes who wield inordinate amounts of wealth and power. **I laughed at the level of paranoia I perceived in these friends, as I had been in top secret meetings and never seen anything to support their fearful beliefs. ** Then in 2001, a wonderful friend sent me a [life-changing video](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060602ufosvideosfootage). The powerful, reliable information in this astonishing video shook me to the core, as it revealed a major [cover-up of UFOs](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up). Generals, astronauts, and other highly respected individuals sharing their personal experiences in this video could not all be lying. This forced me to completely reformulate my beliefs about how the world works. It started me on a quest to discover what was really going on behind the scenes. I dove into serious research and came up with an astounding amount of reliable, verifiable information on a number of major cover-ups which I previously would have dismissed as completely crazy. I then compiled the best of this information on the website [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info).

In no way does it represent the views of anyone else associated with the website. **The Galactic Federation** First, the television program *Star Trek* is much closer to the truth than anyone might imagine. I'm convinced that there is some form of galactic federation of advanced beings from various planets and star systems throughout our galaxy. The vast majority of these beings are far advanced from us both technologically and spiritually. A million years is a very short time in the evolution of a planet. Some of these extraterrestrial societies are *many* *millions* of years more evolved than us. They generally travel between planets not by mechanical propulsion, but by shifting dimensions. The federation's members all agree to a prime directive similar to that of Star Trek - not to disturb the natural evolutionary process of less evolved planets unless help is specifically requested, or unless it is necessary to avoid major disaster. Developing planets are invited to join the galactic federation only after they have evolved to a place where they have expanded beyond the confines of their own world both technologically *and* spiritually - meaning no more wars at the very least. Many researchers of these matters, including myself, are quite hopeful that humanity will soon move rapidly in that direction, so that Earth will eventually be considered for membership. **A Brief Speculative History: The Evolution of Humanity** Key researchers of UFO matters speculate that there are a few relatively young ET (extraterrestrial) societies which have developed the technology of interstellar travel, yet spiritually are lagging.

They are not part of the galactic federation, nor do they feel obligated to abide by its guidelines. Like the [Romulans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulan) of *Star Trek*, these societies at times ignore the prime directive and manipulate the natural evolution of developing planets for their own benefit. This may be what happened here on Earth. An abundance of [revealing evidence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_astronaut_theories) suggests that ETs have been visiting Earth from long prior to the dawn of modern man. In fact, [some researchers](https://web.archive.org/web/20101118232613/http://www.metahistory.org/gnostique/archonfiles/NineTheories.php) even suspect that one or more human-like, less spiritually evolved ET races may have been [involved in the evolution](http://www.newdawnmagazine.com/articles/the-dawn-of-the-genesis-race-our-extraterrestrial-dna-and-the-true-origins-of-the-species) of humans on this planet. These researchers speculate that at key points in ancient human history, members of these ET races chose select human women for procreation to inject more intelligent, capable genes into humankind, thus upgrading human capabilities. This may have been done for scientific purposes - such as to upgrade the pool of genetic possibilities available to the ETs - or to help correct perceived deficiencies in their own genetic code, or simply to forward evolutionary agendas. According to this theory, at certain times in ancient human history, these \"sons of gods\" (in the eyes of early humans) came down to procreate with \"the daughters of men,\" as is mentioned in [Genesis 6](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%206&version=9;) in the Bible and [other ancient writings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_mythology). Stories in the texts of various religions make a lot of sense if you consider that what was being described might have been some kind of extraterrestrial contact, for instance, Moses and the burning bush, Muhammad's [trip into the heavens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isra_and_Miraj) described in the Koran, \"virgin\" births, chariots of fire in [the Bible](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Ki%206:15-18;2Ki%207:6;Zec%201:8-11;Zec%206:1-8&version=8;) and [other ancient sources](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariots_of_the_Gods%3F), and more. **Nuclear Dangers Draw ET Interest** As humanity progressed through the industrial revolution and then developed nuclear capabilities in WWII, many ET societies began to pay more attention to developments in our world. This would account for the large increase in UFO sightings during and after WWII. More advanced ET societies became concerned that we could seriously damage our planet. Many UFO sightings occur around facilities with military and nuclear capabilities. The famous 1947 [Roswell incident,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_UFO_incident) where two UFOs may have crashed and been recovered in the New Mexico desert, took place right near where the 509th bomb group was located - the [only nuclear-capable jet fleet](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-ufos-real) in the world at that time! Some of the more advanced ET societies may be sending clear warnings to those in power not to play with nuclear bombs.

[Three military witnesses](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#2) in the landmark book [*Disclosure*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg) describe riveting personal experiences with UFOs where nuclear warheads were either disarmed or destroyed. In one case, at least 16 nuclear warheads were disarmed after UFOs were sighted over two U.S. military bases firing pencil-thin red beams into the warheads. One of the reasons I'm so optimistic about our future is that even though some of the less advanced ET societies may be causing problems here, other societies far advanced of them will not allow us or any other ET societies to badly damage the planet or the human race. In accordance with the prime directive, they will implement the minimum intervention necessary to keep things in balance. The vast majority of people on the planet may not even know that there was intervention. A significant number of caring individuals, including myself, are already sending requests to the more advanced ETs not to allow things to get out of hand, and to help us in whatever way is best. **The Control Group** After the recovery of [two downed UFOs](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#morris) at Roswell in 1947, it is speculated that [Majestic 12](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majestic_12) was formed. A secret task force comprised of top military and government officials, this group advised the president on the UFO situation and was charged with doing everything necessary to keep information on the subject top secret - for reasons of \"national security.\" Actions taken by this group may have led to secret contact with the ETs, and a [meeting between Eisenhower and some ETs](https://web.archive.org/web/20120208063444/https://exopolitics.org/Study-Paper-8.htm). At this meeting, agreements were made whereby one species of ETs was given permission to conduct genetic studies on the planet ([cattle mutilations](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-Cattle-mutilations-Los-Angeles-Times), abductions) in exchange for helping the U.S. to develop and advance its technology. This apparently was one of the lesser-evolved ET societies. Lasers, the integrated circuit, and fiber optics were just a few of the technologies \"seeded\" by these ETs secretly through military channels to select research groups in large corporations (see the book *[The Day After Roswell](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources#day)* by Colonel Philip J. Corso, who was in charge of seeding this technology). During Eisenhower's presidency, a major power struggle erupted over UFO technology. Eisenhower lost control of the subject, which is likely one reason why in his [farewell speech](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-ike-was-right-about-war-machine-) on leaving the presidency, he gives the following stern warning, \"We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence by the military-industrial complex.

The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist.\" Through the ever-increasing secrecy around this issue, everything related to UFOs became hidden even to later presidents. A culture of intense secrecy was formed, whereby all involved in these unacknowledged or \"[black projects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_projects)\" on UFOs and related material were strictly prohibited from discussing any information, except on a \"[need to know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_to_know)\" basis. **A Culture of Strict Control and Secrecy** Something to remember in dealing with secrecy and major cover-ups is that governments are massive bureaucracies and thus very inefficient in general and incapable of carrying out detailed secret plans. However, the military and intelligence branches of government are rigid hierarchies in which everyone knows their position. Superiors who give commands are very rarely questioned. Just the words \"Yes, sir\" bring up images of a \"good soldier\" in the military. The massive [Manhattan Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_project) (development of the first atomic bomb) is one example of a huge military project that was successfully kept secret for years. The building of an entire city to support the project in Oak Ridge, Tennessee at the time was [successfully kept secret](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Manhattan_Project#Project_sites) even from the state's governor. It is only through the use of the highly organized military and intelligence services that the world's [power elite](https://www.newsarticles.media/secretsocietiesnewsarticles), working together with key allies in government and the media, are able to carry out major cover-ups and secret operations like those involved with UFOs and ETs. A person must have special clearance to even get close to the group involved with UFOs and advanced technologies. Once a person reaches a certain level within this secret community and has been screened and cleared, if they agree to go deeper and thus be exposed to sensitive parts of the cover-up, they must agree to give up quite a bit of their freedom. [Microchips](https://www.WantToKnow.info/microchipsimplantsnewsarticles) are implanted in their bone to track their whereabouts. They are frequently monitored and strictly forbidden from sharing any secret information with anyone, under threat of [severe penalties](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#morris), including death if necessary. Everything that those with this special clearance publish or write - even their emails - is screened for content.

Only a very few of these people have ever managed to escape and get information out. The large majority of them likely enjoy the power of their positions, and thus are willing to put up with the restrictions on their liberty in exchange for money, power, and knowledge. Even among this secret group, which likely involves many thousands of people, very few have any idea of the full scope and scale of all that is going on. Some don't even know that their work is based in UFO technologies. Complex layers of secrecy ([compartmentalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_%28intelligence%29)) and the passing of sensitive information on a \"[need to know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_to_know)\" basis ensure that only a few at the top of the command structure know the big picture. Highly sophisticated [disinformation programs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation) also lead even insiders into false beliefs about the cover-up. It is unlikely than any one person knows all of what is going on, as like in any large society, there is infighting for control and power all the way to the very top. [Dr. Steven M. Greer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Greer), an MD and former head of a hospital ER, is the head of the [Disclosure Project](https://web.archive.org/web/20170402170839/http://www.disclosureproject.org/), which has collected riveting testimony from over 400 government and military witnesses on the UFO cover-up. Dr. Greer has met a few of the [top echelon](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#greer2) within the secret group. He estimates that as many as 40% of the top leaders in this secret structure now feel that everything has gone too far, and that it's time for a large-scale disclosure. Major shifts and changes are happening in this structure as people all over are gradually awakening to the fact that we are [all interconnected](https://www.weboflove.org) at the deepest levels. **Disempowering ETs** From my extensive research of this topic, I've come to believe that like humans, ETs have their strengths and weaknesses. It appears that while many, if not most ETs are either benevolent or neutral, others are more interested in control and dominance. Some of these may work with key individuals both inside and outside of the secret group which manages the cover-up. I suspect they interact with a select group of powerful men we might call \"the controllers.\" These are the ones at the top of the pyramid in the \"brotherhood\" mentioned above. These human controllers now have unprecedented control over the press, corporations, drug trade, stock market, oil and energy production, and lots more. They [facilitated the 9/11 attacks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-facts) in order to promote fear and war. **Empowering ETs and Humans ** Other", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:meaningoflifebigpicture.txt:5:286c54159065", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12469, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "meaningoflifebigpicture.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "meaningoflifebigpicture", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "outside of the secret group which manages the cover-up.

They [facilitated the 9/11 attacks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-facts) in order to promote fear and war. **Empowering ETs and Humans ** Other ETs, along with groups of humans and many individuals like myself, are focused on uncovering the intentions of the controllers at the same time as we lay the foundations for [planetary transformation](https://www.transformationteam.net). We are working to help humanity wake up both to all that is going on and to the infinite potential within each of us, so that humankind might eventually join the galactic community. We are focused, each in our own way, on spreading [love and empowerment](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#love) with no desire to work against anyone. We know that the controllers don't fully understand what they are doing, as their personalities and beliefs have been twisted by their own upbringing and many other factors. We are actively working to stop the destructive behavior of these controllers, yet even as we do this, we recognize that [all beings are in their essence divine](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#seeing) and fully [worthy of love](https://www.momentoflove.org) and empowerment. Both advanced ETs and humans working with them have no doubt that in the end, love always prevails. **Other Beings** Aside from these ETs, there are a large variety of beings or spirits who do not have physical bodies. The vast majority of these beings are far advanced of us spiritually, though like the ETs, among them are some less evolved spirits who don't yet understand the transformative power of love. By asking for guidance from the spirits (call them angels if you like) who spread love and empowerment, we can deeply enrich our personal lives and help to shift the planet into a [new paradigm](https://www.WantToKnow.info/070707newparadigm). We tend to attract to us whatever we hold deepest and strongest inside ourselves. Let us work to [become more aware](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#beliefsystems) of both our conscious and unconscious beliefs as we develop clear intentions and seek guidance in this. There are many [sources of guidance](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#divine) and inspiration if we only choose to open to them. By first committing ourselves to a path of love, healing, and empowerment, and then doing our best to fully live that path, and by inviting guidance from empowering ETs and other beings and forces more aware than ourselves, we can and will transform our lives and world. **Global Control** The controllers are working hard to consolidate the global economy under the multinational banks and corporations which they own and control. They know that cheap [new energy sources](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newenergysources) would allow people to become independent of the power grid that they now control.

They know that cheap [new energy sources](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newenergysources) would allow people to become independent of the power grid that they now control. It would also destroy the oil economy which in so many ways dominates the world and keeps those in power rich. So they will take whatever measures necessary, including killing people, to keep new energy sources from becoming available. They often use \"national security\" as the excuse to forward their plans. Patents for new energy devices and inventions are known to have been [seized for national security reasons](http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:35_U.S.C._181:Secrecy_of_certain_inventions_and_withholding_of_patent). These controllers now have incredible influence over the mass media, and thus public perception. In 1983, 50 corporations jointly controlled most of the mass media. Today it is dominated by [just five](http://www.corporations.org/media/) enormous transnational conglomerates. The controllers also have their hands in the international drug trade (largely [through the CIA](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediacorruption#levine)), and can have great influence on the stock market through the huge amounts of cash they control as a result of the cash-only drug trade. One of the reasons these people wanted 9/11 was that the Taliban began to [eradicate opium production](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-facts#opium) in Afghanistan in mid 2000, thus decimating the cash income through drugs of the controllers. In 2000, Afghanistan provided [over 70% of the world's heroin](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1840182.stm). By 2001, it had dropped to almost nothing. Yet by the end of 2002, under an [American installed puppet](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-facts#karzai) (a former Unocal contractor), the opium trade had [surpassed the levels of 2000](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-facts#narco)! If you don't believe it, follow the links. 9/11 provided a convenient pretext to invade Afghanistan and revive the profitable opium industry. **Control Methods** The controllers realize that there are several powerful [methods to control people](https://www.WantToKnow.info/brighterfuture): (1) create as much fear as possible while encouraging people to feel like victims, (2) convince citizens of the need for ever more secrecy, (3) keep the public polarized and (4) distract people from their deeper purpose in life through promoting consumerism, empty sex, drugs, the money chase, and more. 9/11 and the war on terrorism are part of an extended plan to promote these methods so that the controllers can eventually gain unbridled control of the politics and economics of the whole planet. **Transcending Control** Ultimately, it is the collective fear, secrecy, polarization, and loss of purpose within all of us that has allowed leaders to take power who would subvert democracy, and who would take away our freedoms and liberties.

By each one of us making a commitment to work on these issues both inside of ourselves and out in the world - and to inspire others to do the same - we can and will change our collective direction and build a solid foundation for a brighter future. The simple way to [counteract the methods of the controllers](https://www.WantToKnow.info/brighterfuture#brighterfuture) is to do our best to (1) transform fear into love, (2) promote transparency, (3) recognize and overcome polarization, and (4) continually develop and refine our [deepest intentions](https://www.WantToKnow.info/lifepurposeintentions) for life and then live these intentions. We can also empower ourselves by noticing when we feel like victims, and choosing instead to take responsibility for how we interpret our lives. Coming together to do this in groups provides support and magnifies all these efforts. The more people who join in these efforts, the less control the elite group has over our world. And [it's already happening](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/blessed_unrest_hawken)! We are rapidly developing a new paradigm on this planet!!! When we learn about things that appear to be \"bad\" or \"wrong,\" it's easy to place the responsibility outside of ourselves. It's very easy to blame others, like the controllers, for everything that's wrong with our world. Yet ultimately, we all are co-creators here. We all play a role in everything that goes on. When we commit to [look inside of ourselves](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/victim_or_creator_vs#transform) for the reason things aren't working the way we would like, we can make a big difference. By working to [transform fear](https://www.WantToKnow.info/coreissue) and hatred inside of ourselves, we can play a significant role in creating more love and empowerment not only in our own lives, but also in the world around us. I am [totally committed](https://www.inspiringcommunity.org/inspiringstories0304#intentionsfred) to do my very best to love, heal, and empower myself and all beings on this planet and beyond. I invite you to join me in this in whatever way feels right to you. **The Internet - A Powerful Source of Information** So I suspect there has been ET intervention throughout the history of humankind, with greatly increased contact since the 1940s. For decades, there have been huge cover-ups around energy, wars, drugs, and news coverage of these. All this information has been strictly suppressed through a variety of means and for a variety of reasons. With the advent of the Internet, however, the flow of information on all the cover-ups has become much more difficult to control. The controllers are very aware of the power of the Internet. They have a very well developed [disinformation campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation) working through a great variety of websites", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:meaningoflifebigpicture.txt:8:46107f84b4f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12472, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "meaningoflifebigpicture.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "meaningoflifebigpicture", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "there have been huge cover-ups around energy, wars, drugs, and news coverage of these.

They have a very well developed [disinformation campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation) working through a great variety of websites and other sources to lead researchers astray. That is why [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) has been very careful to focus on information that can be verified and that comes from trustworthy sources. If people are careful to verify and substantiate what they find on the Internet, they can now research and discover for themselves what is really going on in the world. This is another reason I'm very optimistic about the future. **Does Anybody Want to Know? ** From all this, it is clear that my entire view of the world shifted radically beginning in 2001. Before that, I was deeply convinced that there were no really huge cover-ups. Once I learned what was going on, however, I was eager to share this information with my friends. Yet to my great surprise, most of my friends didn't want to hear about it. As almost everything I had learned was based on solid, verifiable evidence, I had assumed that others would be both concerned and fascinated. I was very wrong. I found that few even of my close friends really wanted to know anything that would disturb their comfortable view of reality. I've now become very clear that most people are not willing to let their established concepts of the world go so easily. It can feel threatening to most people to learn that they have been massively deceived. I've learned that I'm more flexible than most in changing even deeply held beliefs when presented with evidence which clearly shows these beliefs to be mistaken. I now encourage people to explore how to develop a more open mind and more [fluid intelligence](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fluidintelligence) if they want to play a significant role in the transformation of our planet. I have also found that very few people are deeply committed to [what's best for all of us](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife2). Few are really interested even in consciously moving in that direction. On meeting new friends, I now generally expect most people not to be interested in all this, though I almost always put out feelers, just in case. I have no desire to push anyone into believing anything. Yet I do love talking about both the cover-ups and the transformation movements sweeping our planet with the few who are really open, and especially with the even fewer who already knew about some of this before I did. **New Friends** Thankfully, the deeper I open to all of this, the more", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:meaningoflifebigpicture.txt:9:ca8b05eb2ad4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12473, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "meaningoflifebigpicture.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "meaningoflifebigpicture", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "people not to be interested in all this, though I almost always put out feelers, just in case.

It's great to now be in contact with courageous, pioneering people not only from across the U.S., but also from Australia, New Zealand, Germany, and many other countries. Yet no matter how little or how much friends support me, I'm just excited to have gained all of this knowledge. I truly want to know what's happening in the world, so that I can be more effective in promoting transformation. I'm aware now that some of the controllers would like to steer us into World War III. And I'm really OK with that. Even if in a worst-case scenario we end up completely destroying the planet, I know that this would simply mean that all of our souls would migrate somewhere else to try again to learn that love is the way back into wholeness. Now I highly doubt that we will destroy the Earth. I'm actually incredibly optimistic, yet I'm also prepared for anything. Based on my belief in the [divine interconnectedness](https://www.weboflove.org) of all beings, I fully trust that what's best for all *is* what happens always. **No Fear. It's Why I'm Here! ** It's remarkable how I've hardly felt scared by even [the most twisted activities](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol) I've learned about. The reason is that for the first time in my life, it's very clear to me why I ended up living on this planet now. I'm here because this is a unique time when [many souls on the planet are awakening](https://www.transformationteam.net/transformationfable) from their slumber and being presented with a choice. We have the choice, upon being exposed to all this, to go back to sleep and be led into disempowering realms, or to wake up and join in creating a beautiful new paradigm based in love and cooperation.

After the show aired, CIA officials met with ABC executive David Burke, [who] was sufficiently impressed \"by the vigor with which they made their case\" to order an on-air \"clarification.\" But that was not enough. [CIA Director] Casey called ABC Chairman Goldenson. [Thus] despite all the documented evidence presented in the program, despite ABC standing by the program in a second broadcast, Peter Jennings reported that ABC could no longer substantiate the charges. That same day, the CIA filed a formal complaint with the FCC charging that ABC had \"deliberately distorted\" the news. In the complaint, Casey asked that ABC be stripped of its TV and radio licenses. During this time, Capital Cities Communications was maneuvering to buy ABC.

Case after case was killed by CIA and State Department intervention and there wasn't a thing we could do about it. ... In 1980, CIA-recruited mercenaries and drug traffickers unseated Bolivia's democratically elected president. Immediately after the coup, cocaine production increased massively. Bolivia [became] the source of virtually 100% of the cocaine entering the US. This was the beginning of the crack \"plague.\" ... The CIA along with State and Justice Departments had to protect their drug-dealing assets by destroying a DEA investigation. How do I know? I was the inside source. ... I sat down at my desk in the American embassy and wrote evidence of my charges. I addressed it to *Newsweek*. Three weeks later DEA's internal security [called] to notify me that I was under investigation. ... The highlight of the *60 Minutes* piece is when the administrator of the DEA, Federal Judge Robert Bonner, tells Mike Wallace, \"There is no other way to put it, Mike, [what the CIA did] is drug smuggling.

In 1996, I wrote a series of stories that began this way: For the better part of a decade, a Bay Area drug ring sold tons of cocaine to the Crips and Bloods gangs of LA and funneled millions in drug profits to a guerilla army run by the CIA. The cocaine that flooded in helped spark a crack explosion in urban America. ... The story was developing a momentum all of its own, despite a virtual news blackout from the major media. Ultimately, it was public pressure that forced the national newspapers into the fray. The *Washington Post*, the *New York Times*, and the *Los Angeles Times* published stories, but spent little time exploring the CIA's activities. Instead, my reporting and I became the focus of their scrutiny. It was remarkable [*Mercury News* editor] Ceppos wrote, that the four *Washington Post* reporters assigned to debunk the series \"could not find a single significant factual error.\" A few months later, the *Mercury News* [due to intense CIA pressure] backed away from the story, publishing a long column by Ceppos apologizing for \"shortcomings.\" The *New York Times* hailed Ceppos for \"setting a brave new standard,\" and splashed his apology on their front page, the first time the series had ever been mentioned there.
