Even if you don't agree with the initial assertion that there is a powerful group of elites who want to control the world, I think you will find this an excellent summary which gives practical ideas on how we can build a better future together. With very best wishes for a better future, Fred Burks for [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) [https://www.WantToKnow.info/brighterfuture](https://www.WantToKnow.info/brighterfuture) ** Building a Better Future** **The Current Situation** In order to give meaningful suggestions for building a brighter future, we first need to speak candidly about what's happening in the world at present. Based on the abundance of reliable, verifiable information provided on [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info), it appears that **there are factions within the world's power elite which desire to gain as much control over the world as possible. Their primary means for establishing control are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life.** As these factions gain ever-greater power and control, our freedoms and liberties are [increasingly taken away](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources#unconstitutional), often without our even realizing it. Fear is used as a powerful tool of control by these factions of the global elite. \"The terrorists want to kill us all. You are either for us or against us. Your job, savings, and retirement are no longer secure. You might be attacked at any time.\" All of these messages [push us towards fear](https://www.WantToKnow.info/alqaedafabricated). And by encouraging us to focus blame on others such as terrorists and \"evil\" leaders, the global power brokers push us away from feeling in control of our lives and towards the role of powerless victims. **The more we slip into fear and being victims, the easier it is for us to be manipulated. ** Secrecy leads to control through preventing the exposure of hidden agendas, and through breeding distrust, suspicion, and paranoia in the world. In the name of \"national security,\" we are told ever more frequently that [we should not know what is happening](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secrecygraham) behind closed doors in government. Yet we are encouraged to keep vigilant watch over our neighbors, over those who question the government, and over those who look or act different from us, as they could secretly be terrorists in sheep's clothing. **Rampant secrecy and suspicion are causing us to lose touch with the common humanity we share with all around us.** Polarization leads to \"us vs. them\" ways of thinking. **Divide and conquer is a tactic that has been successfully used by the power elite of the world for centuries.** As long as we are focused on blaming and attacking \"the enemy,\" we are not likely to look for the deeper causes of our polarization.

Controlling factions of the power elite work to keep public and [media attention](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediacorruption) away from their greatest concerns of power, wealth, and control, focusing attention instead on \"moral\" issues which divide the public into two opposing camps. They then control both sides of the divided public by assuring that corporate ownership of the media and key candidates from all political parties support their deeper power and polarization agendas. A final subtle, yet powerful method of gaining control is to distract people from their purpose in life. Consider that television, radio, and movies are filled with ever more greed, violence, and empty sex. Our educational system increasingly prioritizes passing tests over developing intelligence and creativity. Unrestrained corporate control of the media [limits what news we receive](https://www.WantToKnow.info/censored2004), and often shapes our decisions and the way we think. **Our attention is being diverted from our deeper purpose in life to the superficial attractions of sex, consumerism, and money.** ** As people succumb to fear, secrecy, and polarization, and as they lose touch with their sense of purpose in life, elements of the global elite are able to exert ever more control over our world.** **Towards a Brighter Future** What can we do about all this? Ultimately, it is the collective fear, secrecy, polarization, and loss of purpose within all of us that has allowed leaders to take power who would subvert democracy, and who would take away our freedoms and liberties. **By each one of us making a commitment to work on these issues both inside of ourselves and out in the world-and to inspire others to do the same-we can change our collective direction and build a solid foundation for a brighter future.** Several actions can help us to take firm steps in that direction. **[Develop purpose and intentions](https://www.WantToKnow.info/lifepurposeintentions) for your life.** To live full, rich lives in today's complex world, it's vitally important to give your life clear direction by exploring what is deepest and most meaningful to you, and by developing life purpose and intentions based on this. Then choose to live your intentions and follow your purpose to the best of your ability every day. By choosing to live with clear direction and focus, life becomes deeper and more meaningful. This then weakens the seduction of consumerism and media hype which distract us from our purpose, and allows us to more effectively focus on building a brighter future. **Choose to transform fear into acceptance and love.**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:betterfuture.txt:1:47fbb56be11a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9023, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "betterfuture.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "betterfuture", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "you, and by developing life purpose and intentions based on this.

This then weakens the seduction of consumerism and media hype which distract us from our purpose, and allows us to more effectively focus on building a brighter future. **Choose to transform fear into acceptance and love.** When we notice ourselves feeling fear, we can trace the roots of that fear, so that we are able to [identify our core challenges](https://www.WantToKnow.info/coreissue) and deal consciously with them. We can open to guidance from friends, teachers, and spiritual sources in moving from fear to acceptance and trust. We can transform our fears through welcoming the ever-present love of God, and the love that lies always deep within our own hearts, and in the hearts of those around us. In doing this, we begin to recognize fear as an invitation to growth. Become aware of when you are playing the role of victim, and choose instead to **take personal responsibility for building a brighter future**. In blaming others for our problems, we often avoid taking responsibility for how much we are involved in creating these problems through the choices we make. Whenever we catch ourselves playing the role of victim by blaming others (including the power elite) for everything that's wrong in our lives, we can choose instead to [look inside ourselves](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#acceptance), and to explore and take responsibility for our role in what's happening. By focusing less on blaming others, and more on improving ourselves, every one of us can make a difference both in our lives and in our world. **Avoid secrecy and encourage openness and transparency.** An important way we can do this is to work together to [inform friends and colleagues](https://www.WantToKnow.info/spreadtheword) about the major cover-ups being hidden from the public. Then in our personal lives, when we notice ourselves keeping information from others, we can examine our motives for this secrecy. Are we withholding information out of our own self-interest, or because this is really what's best for all involved? And on a deeper level, where are we avoiding being honest within ourselves? **Move beyond polarization and the focus on \"good vs. evil\" and \"us vs. them.\"** Consider the possibility that all of us are doing what we believe to be right based upon our beliefs, circumstances, and upbringing. Each of us has [a place in our heart](https://www.momentoflove.org/) that wants only to love and be loved.

One of the policemen bolted from the car and grabbed the fellow just as he was stepping off the ledge. His momentum threatened to carry both of them over the cliff, but the policeman refused to let go. Somehow he held on long enough for his partner to arrive and pull the two of them to safety. When a newspaper reporter asked, \"Why didn't you let go? You would have been killed,\" he answered: \"I couldn't... I couldn't let go. If I had, I couldn't have lived another day of my life.\"* [German philosopher Arthur] Schopenhauer's answer ... represents the breakthrough of a metaphysical reality, which is that you and the other are two aspects of one life, and your apparent separateness is but an effect of the way we experience forms under the conditions of space and time. **Our true reality is our identity and unity with all life.** As the writer Alberto Rios once put it, \"I am in your family tree and you are in mine.\" **Our connection to others goes to the core of life's mystery.** The religion of inequality - of money and power - has failed us; its gods are false gods. There is something more essential - more profound - in the American experience than the hyena's appetite. Once we recognize and nurture this, once we honor it, we can reboot democracy and get on with the work of liberating the country we carry in our hearts. - renowned journalist Bill Moyers, [*The Oligarchy vs. The People*](https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/bill-moyers-on-oligarchy-democracy) In a world facing significant challenges, our current stories about the world are falling short.

Everything is copacetic.\" The recipient's mother revealed: \"My son uses that word 'copacetic' all the time now. He never used it before he got his new heart.\" This had been the couple's special signal. **The Violin Case:** A 47-year-old foundry worker received a 17-year-old Black student's heart and developed a fascination with classical music.

Can I see my mom?\" or \"What happened to my children?\" He was lying beside [his mother] one night, Cyndi Hammons remembers, when he said that he needed to tell her something. \"I think I used to be somebody else,\" he whispered. Ryan was waking up sobbing at night and describing things his mother couldn't fathom: that he remembered living in Hollywood in a big white house with a swimming pool. That he once had three sons and a younger sister. That he drove a green car, and his wife drove a black one.* Not long after, Ryan saw a man he recognized in one of his library books, a peripheral figure in a photograph of six men: \"That's me!\" he told his mother. With the help of a production crew from the A&E series \"The Unexplained,\" they were able to identify the man as Marty Martyn, a movie extra and talent agent who died in 1964. Cyndi and Ryan traveled to California to meet Martyn's daughter, Marisa Martyn Rosenblatt, who was 8 when her father died. She ultimately confirmed many of Ryan's statements about Marty Martyn. **She didn't know that her father had driven a green car, or that he had a younger sister, but it turned out both claims were accurate. Marty Martyn's death certificate cited his age as 59, but Ryan insisted he had died at 61; census records and marriage listings ... confirmed this, as did Martyn's daughter.** - *Washington Post*, \"[The children who remember their past lives](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--children-who-remember-their-past-lives)\" [Another striking case](https://med.virginia.edu/perceptual-studies/wp-content/uploads/sites/360/2017/04/REI42-Tucker-James-LeiningerPIIS1550830716000331.pdf) involves James Leininger, who began having violent nightmares at age 2 about a plane crash and a pilot trapped inside.

Dr. Ian Stevenson from the University of Virginia [documented the case](https://open-data.spr.ac.uk/sites/default/files/ebook/article/sunita_khandelwal_reincarnation_case-809.pdf) of a young girl from India named Sunita Khandelwal. At age 2, she began insisting she had lived before in Kota, a major city in Rajasthan. She said she had died at age 7 after falling from a height, repeatedly pointing to a birthmark on the right side of her head that had bled for three days after birth. When investigator H.N. Banerjee at the University of Rajasthan in Jaipur took her to Kota when she was around 5 years old, Sunita led the way to the correct neighborhood, stopped in front of a silver shop, and identified it as her father's. The shopkeeper, Prabhu Dayal Maheshwari, confirmed that his daughter Shakuntala had died after falling from an interior balcony and suffering a fatal head wound on the same side. She was 8 (not 7) when she died, but the accident had occurred only two months after her birthday. Before she was ever taken to Kota, Sunita gave 34 detailed statements with only 2 incorrect and 3 unverified after multiple independent investigations. **If consciousness continues across lifetimes, even in ways we don't yet fully understand, the line between \"us\" and \"them\" becomes less fixed.** The wrongdoing we condemn in others may not be as distant from us as we assume. The whole idea of accountability may take on a deeper meaning. How much of \"me\" is shaped by biology, and how much might come from somewhere deeper? What if some of the things we dismiss in childhood aren't mistakes but early signs of important capacities we've culturally suppressed?

The [1983 CIA report on the Gateway Process](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) frames consciousness as a form of energy that transcends the brain. The report also notes rapid results for \"ordinary people,\" including \"impatient, results-oriented, skeptical pragmatists,\" outperforming traditional meditation. This was presented not as mystical but neurological, biophysical, and measurable. **Key Human Potential Discoveries in the CIA's Gateway Assessment** *Focus Levels* in the Gateway system are stepped states of consciousness reached through audio-guided brainwave training: **Focus 10**: mind awake, body deeply relaxed **Focus 12**: expanded awareness, beyond physical senses **Focus 15**: state beyond linear time (past access) **Focus 21**: perception beyond time-space (future access) These were the key findings: **1) Holistic insight, enhanced intuition, and problem-solving:** In Focus 12, participants could project a problem into expanded awareness and receive sudden, whole-picture solutions or symbolic answers immediately or over several days beyond ordinary analytical thinking. **2) Influencing outcomes through focused intention (Patterning):** Holding a desired outcome as already real in Focus 12 and projecting that intent to support measurable changes in physical reality. **3) Directed self-healing & energy balancing:** Using Focus 12 awareness to retune bodily \"energy flows\" and apply vivid visualization of internal systems and directed energy to specific organs/regions for healing and vitality. Participants achieved states where consciousness could modulate and reduce pain, accelerate healing in the body, synchronize physiological states, and even suppress tumor growth through focused awareness, breath, sound, and visualization. **4) Releasing internal \"blockages\":** Progress depends on dissolving anxieties, stresses, and \"energy blockages\" that disrupt clarity and expanded awareness. **5) Expanded self-understanding & clearer perception:** Emphasis on cultivating \"full self-knowledge\" to reduce distortion and improve objectivity in altered states. **6) New relationship to time & reality (Focus 15 & 21):** Advanced states involve accessing representations of past (Focus 15) and future (Focus 21), reshaping perception of time and personal history. **7) Consciousness beyond the body:** With sufficient training and synchronization, perception can occur independent of the physical body (out-of-body awareness). **8) Shared intention in altered states:** Groups in Focus 12 can \"unite their altered consciousness\" and resonate to reinforce perception and aims. The Gateway report revealed a simple truth: *self-awareness → nervous system regulation → clearer perception → greater agency* It's telling that this remained classified for decades.

Yet some knowledge isn't suppressed because it's dangerous. **A society that can self-regulate, self-heal, and access deeper layers of perception is harder to manipulate and even harder to govern through fear.** When we don't trust our own perception, we outsource it. We look to institutions, media, and authority figures to tell us what is true, what to fear, who to blame, and which side to take. In practical terms, here's how intuition and expanded states of awareness can show up in our daily life: • We sense when information is designed to **manipulate our emotions** rather than support **deeper insight, understanding, and sensemaking.** • When we pause, regulate, and widen our awareness, we can increasingly **hold complexity without needing to fall into the trance of certainty or polarization** (us vs. them, enemy-making, labels and partisan slogans, etc). We can increasingly face uncertainty and darker truths without **surrendering our agency or losing sight of the good and possible.** • We stay **curious long enough for new insights, solutions or creative, constructive paths** to appear. • We are increasingly able to \"read the room\" more effectively-sensing when tension rises, when people are shutting down, or when the energy shifts to keep dialogue open and productive. Each of us can become what's called a \"regulating presence\" - **people whose very energy helps regulate the hijacked nervous system of the collective.** This openness has a ripple effect. It changes how we listen, how we speak, and how others feel in our presence. When we bring this state into our relationships or our activism, **we can become the kind of person whose grounded energy helps others relax, think in new ways, open to goodness, and imagine new possibilities.** If the body can heal and the mind can perceive more than we're told, what else have we underestimated about ourselves? What would I discover about the world if I stayed open, curious, and relaxed? What would a regulated society look like? **Beyond Fear, Scarcity, and Separation** Together, these three examples reveal that human consciousness is not isolated in individual brains but part of a shared, unified field. ***If we are all originating from the same source, if we are ultimately the same consciousness that works through us, then it is complete ignorance to be violent to each other.** How do we transform using creativity, using the archetype of goodness, bring that into the equation of power, and learn to be nonviolent with each other?

There's a lot of mental violence going on. But the point is that the way we approach it as violence begets more violence. So, it never stops. The answer, of course, is that nonviolence has to grow from inside of us. **It has to be an intuition that often happens not just once or twice during the day, but becomes a conviction, a faith that I cannot be violent to my fellow human.** * - [Amit Goswami](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-what-quantum-physics-can-tell-us-about-nonviolence), founder of [Center for Quantum Activism](https://amitgoswami.org/) and former professor at the University of Oregon What might we create in our own lives and in the world when we are no longer defined by fear, scarcity, and separation? In facing the profound implications of this information, the darkness of the world continues to lose its power over me. **I continue to discover a strength to face the darkness in our world and courage to be curious about what I don't know.** When we get out of our own singular viewpoint, we're often told we'll be indulging in dangerous misinformation or hateful ideology. But I've found the exact opposite was true when I started reaching beyond the narratives I found so much certainty in. When I surrendered my certainty, I found incredible nuance and complexity, and therefore new understanding. **I witnessed change, healing, and transformation in places I never thought possible.** Culture wars, identity politics, negative news overload, and all the doom-and-gloom narratives... they are all symptoms of the same problem: we're operating inside a very small story about what it means to be human.

The answers aren't out there in fixing broken institutions that were never built to serve us. They're in our communities, our relationships, and the real-world movements *reimagining those systems entirely*-grounded in the understanding that worn-out policy fixes and partisan talking points almost never reach the root causes. This week's **Beyond Fear series** spotlights a game-changing social platform that's using technology for good and bringing people together across differences. This platform has helped shape dozens of laws in Taiwan and is now being adapted in California to bridge divides and create policies that seek to truly represent the voices of the people. Before we dive in, let's first set the context. **Divisive Media is a Business Model** A [growing body](https://www.sciencealert.com/social-media-networks-are-training-us-to-express-more-outrage-online) of [research](https://freemannews.tulane.edu/2024/10/11/rage-clicks-study-shows-how-political-outrage-fuels-social-media-engagement) is making it clear: [our media systems are structurally designed](https://www.colorado.edu/today/2025/07/30/selling-anger-how-cable-news-profits-outrage) to [amplify outrage and division](https://news.yale.edu/2021/08/13/likes-and-shares-teach-people-express-more-outrage-online). Former Facebook data scientist Frances Haugen [testified at a Senate hearing](https://time.com/6104899/facebook-reckoning-frances-haugen/) that the company's algorithm rewarded angry and polarizing content, even [pressuring political parties](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-60-minutes-polarizing-divisive-content/) to post more of it or risk losing visibility, constituents, and ultimately their jobs. Leaked internal research revealed that executives chose to look the other way because it was driving higher user activity and therefore more advertising revenue and growth. Meanwhile, everyday people [agree far more than they think](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-healing-political-divide) on [many issues](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/healing-the-culture-warsone-conscious). Yet media, politicians, and social platforms profit from exaggerating the gap, amplifying extreme voices, and keeping us locked in an \"us versus them\" mindset. Psychologists Dominic Packer and Jay Van Bavel [said it best](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/15/the-big-idea-are-we-really-so-polarised): **the deepest divide isn't over policy. Emotions and identities fuel polarization more than the actual issues on the table.** Our anger and rage can obviously be powerful tools for awakening and calling out injustice. Yet when content engineered for emotional reaction dominates the media ecosystem, it starts to replace any real or more subtle understanding of the complex forces driving today's chaos. *Too many Americans live in fear today. Fear of being cancelled by social media mobs. Fear of extremism. Fear of fear, itself. **Stories of woe permeate today's media messaging, seldom with nuanced reporting that puts threats in proper context. Propagandists work under the assumption that people eventually believe what they hear most often.** The constant hyping of a culture of fear has rhetorically scared otherwise reasonable Americans into irrational emotions and behaviors.

Much of the fear is coming from how we treat each other on social media, in our communities, [even in our movements](https://theintercept.com/2022/06/13/progressive-organizing-infighting-callout-culture/)-where the era of cancel culture sabotages genuine dialogue and viewpoint diversity. **Then Comes vTaiwan: 'Lifting Everyone Out of Echo Chambers'** If our media environment is engineered to divide and distract, then the real breakthrough comes from creating systems that foster common ground, open dialogue, and trust in each other. **Taiwan's bold experiment, [vTaiwan](https://www.nesta.org.uk/feature/six-pioneers-digital-democracy/vtaiwan/), shows what happens when technology is harnessed as a listening tool for the radical purpose of bringing people together across differences.** Now, [California is adapting Taiwan's groundbreaking vTaiwan model](https://www.noemamag.com/strengthening-the-connective-tissue-of-democracy/) into Engaged California, a first-of-its-kind public platform where citizens, officials, and policymakers can deliberate together and find common ground. vTaiwan was born in 2014 when students and citizens occupied the legislature to protest a secretive trade deal with China.

The aim isn't to force agreement on what's \"true,\" but to make the information landscape transparent so everyone can see the same sources even if they interpret them differently. **Invite everyone in.** People join the online discussion through Pol.is, an AI-powered platform that sorts thousands of comments in real time. You can share your own idea, or simply click \"agree\" or \"disagree\" on others. There's no reply button, so trollling or divisive statements aren't even visible. *Pol.is lifted everyone out of their echo chambers. It gave oxygen instead to statements that found support across different groups as well as within them. Technically, the tweak was small, but politically its effect was enormous. Rather than encourage grandstanding or the trading of insults, it gamified finding consensus.* - \"[Crossing Divides: How a social network could save democracy from deadlock](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50127713),\" BBC **See the big picture.** People can't directly argue with each other, but they can add new ideas for everyone to vote on.

Progress is tracked, results are shared, and the process can be repeated if needed. *By clearing away the noise and divisiveness, vTaiwan created outcomes that the government could actually act on. **It has formed the core of around a dozen pieces of laws and regulations now implemented in Taiwan.*** - \"[How Taiwan's 'civic hackers' helped find a new way to run the country](https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/556160-media-spread-fear-americans-listen/),\" *The Guardian* **Imagine a world...** *It's incumbent upon us to model the humanity we want, rather than demand the humanity we expect.* - business visionary and professor [Dr. David E. Martin](https://www.davidmartin.world/about/) Imagine a world where we go beyond media and social echo chambers. A world where our collective conversations are grounded in the courage to move beyond fear and surrender to something larger than our opinions, egos, identities, and the need to be right. Imagine if we radically shifted our conversations to frame every issue or topic in ways that bring us all together and highlight our common values. A new consciousness that integrates the best of the intellect (ideas, stories, beliefs, our version of the facts) with the relational world. To relate is to get present with others, relax our fears, listen, and ask questions to deepen the conversation. This may not always produce perfect results. Yet if enough people take the risk to relate to each other differently-to take the dehumanization out of our interactions and not see each other as enemies-we just might create new possibilities and choices we couldn't see before. **As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, we depend almost entirely on donations from people like you.

He was most renowned for his incisive program *Now *on CBS. Below are important excerpts from a speech he gave shortly after announcing his retirement. Parts of the speech were even reported in the *Miami Herald, *though sadly no other media gave coverage*. *Moyers' thought-provoking words are well worth consideration. Did you know that, as he mentions, **millions of Americans are eagerly anticipating the apocalypse and the imminent return of Christ. ** It is most unfortunate that in this speech Mr. Moyers doesn't acknowledge the many fundamentalist Christians who are dedicated to being good stewards of the environment. It is akin to lumping all fundamentalist Muslims in with terrorists. Yet Moyers' message is important because, as shown in surveys, many millions of fundamentalist Christians are being led to believe the environment is no longer important. The best-selling *Left Behind* book series he mentions is a clear example of this. Not in the least wanting to infringe on anyone's beliefs, I agree with Moyers that** it is the consequences of these beliefs on our environment that are most concerning.** Please help to spread the word on this most important matter. With best wishes, Fred Burks for [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) [http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/opinion/10391444.htm](http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/opinion/10391444.htm) (excerpts of speech in *Miami Herald*) [http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1206-10.htm](http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1206-10.htm) (full speech) **The Environment in Serious Trouble** *Below are excerpts from PBS public-affairs host Bill Moyers' speech accepting the Global Environmental Citizen Award at the Harvard Medical School.** *The journalist who truly deserves this award is Bill McKibben. He enjoys the most conspicuous place in my own pantheon of journalistic heroes for his pioneer writing about the environment. His best seller *The End of Nature* carried on where Rachel Carson's *Silent Spring* left off. Writing in Mother Jones recently, Bill described how the problems journalists routinely cover may be about to convert to chaotic, unpredictable, unmanageable situations. The most unmanageable, he writes, could be the accelerating deterioration of the environment, creating perils with huge momentum like the greenhouse effect that is causing Arctic melting to release so much fresh water into the North Atlantic that even the Pentagon is growing alarmed that a weakening Gulf Stream could yield abrupt, overwhelming changes, the kind that could alter civilizations. **That's one challenge journalists face -- how to tell such a story without turning off the people we most want to understand, who must act on what they read and hear.

As difficult as it is, however, for journalists to fashion a readable narrative, there is an even harder challenge -- to pierce the ideology that governs official policy today.** **Ideology and theology** One of the biggest changes in politics in my lifetime is that the delusional is no longer marginal. For the first time in our history, ideology and theology hold a monopoly of power in Washington. Theology asserts propositions that cannot be proven true; ideologues hold stoutly to a world view despite being contradicted by what is generally accepted as reality. **When ideology and theology couple, their offspring are not always bad, but they are always blind. And there is the danger: voters and politicians alike, oblivious to the facts**. Remember James Watt, President Reagan's first secretary of the Interior? The online environmental journal, Grist, reminded us recently of how Watt told the U.S. Congress that protecting natural resources was unimportant in light of the imminent return of Jesus Christ. He said, ``after the last tree is felled, Christ will come back.'' [Editorial note: Moyers had since conceded that James Watt never made this comment in public. Also please remember that many fundamentalist Christians do not embrace these beliefs.] Watt was serious. So were his compatriots across the country. They are the people who believe the Bible is literally true -- one-third of the American electorate, if a recent Gallup poll is accurate. **That's right - the rapture index. Google it and you will find that the best-selling books in America today are the 12 volumes of the left-behind series written by the Christian fundamentalist and religious right warrior, Timothy LaHaye. These true believers subscribe to a fantastical theology concocted in the 19th century by a couple of immigrant preachers who took disparate passages from the Bible and wove them into a narrative that has captivated the imagination of millions of Americans.** Its outline is rather simple, if bizarre (the British writer George Monbiot recently did a brilliant dissection of it and I am indebted to him for adding to my own understanding): once Israel has occupied the rest of its \"biblical lands,\" legions of the anti-Christ will attack it, triggering a final showdown in the valley of Armageddon. As the Jews who have not been converted are burned, the Messiah will return for the rapture. True believers will be lifted out of their clothes and transported to heaven, where, seated next to the right hand of God, they will watch their political and religious opponents suffer plagues of boils,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:billmoyers.txt:1:1a8da655ff26", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9040, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "billmoyers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "billmoyers", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "my own understanding): once Israel has occupied the rest of its \"biblical lands,\" legions of the anti-Christ will attack it, triggering a final showdown in the valley of Armageddon.

True believers will be lifted out of their clothes and transported to heaven, where, seated next to the right hand of God, they will watch their political and religious opponents suffer plagues of boils, sores, locusts, and frogs during the several years of tribulation that follow. I'm not making this up. Like Monbiot, I've read the literature. **I've reported on these people, following some of them from Texas to the West Bank. They are sincere, serious and polite as they tell you they feel called to help bring the rapture on as fulfillment of biblical prophecy. That's why they have declared solidarity with Israel and the Jewish settlements and backed up their support with money and volunteers. It's why the invasion of Iraq for them was a warm-up act, predicted in the Book of Revelations where four angels \"which are bound in the great river Euphrates will be released to slay the third part of man.\" A war with Islam in the Middle East is not something to be feared but welcomed - an essential conflagration on the road to redemption.** The last time I Googled it, the rapture index stood at 144 - just one point below the critical threshold when the whole thing will blow, the son of god will return, the righteous will enter heaven and sinners will be condemned to eternal hellfire. **So what does this mean for public policy and the environment? Go to Grist to read Glenn Scherer's *[The Road to Environmental Apocalypse](http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2004/10/27/scherer-christian/).* You will see how millions of Christian fundamentalists may believe that environmental destruction is to be welcomed -- even hastened -- as a sign of the coming apocalypse.** **We're not talking about a handful of fringe lawmakers who hold or are beholden to these beliefs. Nearly half the U.S. Congress before the recent election -- 231 legislators in total -- are backed by the religious right.** **Christian stations** Drive across the country with your radio tuned to the more than 1,600 Christian stations, or in the motel turn some of the 250 Christian TV stations and you can hear some of this end-time gospel. You will understand why people under the spell of such potent prophecies cannot be expected, as Grist puts it, ``to worry about the environment. **Why care about the Earth when the droughts, floods, famine and pestilence brought by ecological collapse are signs of the apocalypse?''** I read that the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has declared the election a mandate for President Bush on the environment.

That wants to relax pollution limits for ozone; eliminate vehicle tailpipe inspections; and ease pollution standards for cars, sports utility vehicles and diesel-powered big trucks and heavy equipment. That wants a new international audit law to allow corporations to keep certain information about environmental problems secret from the public. That wants to drop all its new-source review suits against polluting coal-fired power plans and weaken consent decrees reached earlier with coal companies. That wants to open the Arctic [National] Wildlife Refuge to drilling and increase drilling in Padre Island National Seashore, the longest stretch of undeveloped barrier island in the world and the last great coastal wild land in America. **I can see in the look on your faces just how hard it is to report a story like this with any credibility. So let me put it on a personal level. I have always been an optimist. I once agreed with the belief that people will protect the natural environment when they realize its importance to their health and to the health and lives of their children. Now I am not so sure.** **The news is not good these days. I can tell you, though, that as a journalist I know the news is never the end of the story. The news can be the truth that sets us free - not only to feel but to fight for the future we want.

Ross MD** **A 10-Page Summary** **In this summary of *Bluebird*, Dr. Ross describes unethical experiments conducted by psychiatrists to create amnesia, new identities, hypnotic access codes, and new memories in the minds of experimental subjects. His research is based on 15,000 pages of documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Dr. Ross is a past president of the International Society for the Study of Dissociation. Please help to [spread the word](https://www.WantToKnow.info/emailmk).** **Historical Background** The Manchurian Candidate is compelling evidence for the reality of therapist-created multiple personality disorder. The condition has been created deliberately by mind control doctors. Experiments to create Manchurian Candidate \"super spies\" must be understood in their social and historical context, which is one of pervasive, systematic mind control experimentation, not by a few isolated renegade doctors, but by the leaders of psychiatry and the major medical schools. Because this book is likely to provoke extreme reactions, I have taken great care to present only facts which are fully documented and based on objective, public domain information. Page E The basic premise of the book *The Manchurian Candidate* [[1]](#_edn1) is that a group of American POWs in the Korean War is brainwashed while crossing through Manchuria to freedom. They arrive back in the US amnesic for the period of brainwashing, and one of them has been programmed to be an assassin. His target is a candidate for president of the US. His Asian handlers control him with a hypnotically implanted trigger, a particular playing card. P. 23 Multiple personality disorder is now classified by the American Psychiatric Association [[2]](#_edn2) as dissociative identity disorder. According to my definition, the Manchurian Candidate is an experimentally created dissociative identity disorder that meets the following four criteria: Created deliberately A new identity is implanted Amnesia barriers are created Used in simulated or actual operations That the CIA created Manchurian Candidates is a fact, and easy to understand and justify from a national security perspective. I am not criticizing the CIA or the military because I am not an expert on intelligence matters. I am a psychiatrist specializing in dissociative disorders. Page G *BLUEBIRD* blows the whistle on extensive political abuse of psychiatry in North America in the second half of the 20th century. Many thousands of prisoners and mental patients were subjected to unethical mind control experiments by leading psychiatrists and medical schools. Organized academic psychiatry has never acknowledged this history. The network of mind control doctors involved in BLUEBIRD has done a great deal of harm to the field of psychiatry and to psychiatric patients. My goal is to break the ugly silence.

Organized academic psychiatry has never acknowledged this history. The network of mind control doctors involved in BLUEBIRD has done a great deal of harm to the field of psychiatry and to psychiatric patients. My goal is to break the ugly silence. Page K The participation of psychiatrists and medical schools in mind control research was not a matter of a few scattered doctors pursuing questionable lines of investigation. Rather, the mind control experimentation was systematic, organized, and involved many leading psychiatrists and medical schools. The mind control experiments were interwoven with radiation experiments, and research on chemical and biological weapons. They were funded by the CIA, Army, Navy, Air Force, and by other agencies including the Public Health Service and the Scottish Rite Foundation. Page F The psychiatrists, psychologists, neurosurgeons, and other contractors conducting the work were imbedded in a broad network of doctors. Much of the research was published in medical journals. The climate was permissive, supportive, and approving of mind control experimentation. P. F, 1 The work of the mind control doctors did not occur in a vacuum. The importation of Nazi doctors to the US through secret programs like PAPERCLIP is part of the context. After the end of World War II, German scientists and technical experts were being held in detainment camps. The British, French, Americans, and Russians became embroiled in highly competitive recruiting efforts to secure the services of these German specialists. The prospect of losing the industrial and scientific services of these German experts lead to the creation of Project PAPERCLIP. [[3]](#_edn3)[[4]](#_edn4)[[5]](#_edn5) P. 1, 3 Over 1,000 German scientists were secretly brought into the US without State Department approval. The most famous individual brought over in this manner was Werner von Braun, the rocket scientist. Von Braun was the head of the German V2 rocket program. The NASA rockets that took Neil Armstrong to the moon were built by von Braun and his colleagues. Medical doctors also came over under PAPERCLIP. P. 3, 4 Likewise, the Tuskeegee Syphilis Study helps us understand how mind control experimentation was not only tolerated by medical professionals, but published in peer-reviewed literature. [[6]](#_edn6)[[7]](#_edn7) The Study, started in Alabama in 1932, was run by the Public Health Service. 399 illiterate, poor rural black men with syphilis were recruited as subjects, along with 201 controls without syphilis. The purpose of the Study was to make sure the 399 men never got treatment. The subjects and their families weren't told they had syphilis and didn't know it was treatable. They were told that they had *bad blood*. P. 1, 9, 10 The cure for syphilis, penicillin, was introduced in the early 1940's. It was withheld from the Tuskeegee men for 30 years. The published results of the Study showed the men with untreated syphilis were sicker and died younger than controls.

The published results of the Study showed the men with untreated syphilis were sicker and died younger than controls. [[8]](#_edn8) How many women were infected with syphilis because these men were deliberately not treated? How many children were born with syphilis because of the Study? P. 11 The Tuskeegee Syphilis Study was eventually shut down in 1972 because of the efforts of an investigative journalist. There is no evidence to suggest that the government or the medical progression had any intention of closing the study as of 1972. People and organizations that knew about the Study included the Surgeon General, the American Heart Association, and the Center for Disease Control. Throughout its 40-year course, the Tuskeegee Study was praised and received various honors. P. 9-13 The Tuskeegee Study establishes that a large network of doctors and organization were willing to participate in, fund, and condone grossly unethical medical experimentation into the 1970's. The Study proves that considerable external pressure is often required before the medical profession takes the necessary action to terminate such experimentation. P. 14 Unethical radiation experiments were conducted on about 600 subjects [[9]](#_edn9)[[10]](#_edn10)[[11]](#_edn11) in the US beginning in the 1940's and running into the 1970's. Many people were injected with plutonium and exposed to other forms of radiation without their informed consent. 18 patients were injected with plutonium in an experiment run by the MANHATTAN PROJECT. Prisoners in Washington and Oregon state prisons were paid to have their testicles irradiated. They got $5 a month for the irradiation. During the experiment, which ran from 1963 to 1971, the subjects' testicles were exposed to 600 roentgen of radiation, which is 100 times the maximum recommended dose. P. 15-17 Clouds of radioactive material were released into the atmosphere and tracked as they moved downwind, often through populated areas. In one experiment code-named GREEN RUN, radioactive iodine-131 released from the Hanford Nuclear Facility drifted over Spokane. The cloud contained hundreds of times as much radiation as was released accidentally at Three Mile Island in 1979. P. 17 As was true of mind control and biological weapon research, radiation research experiments were conducted on children and unwitting civilians. In 1961, researchers at Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Boston University School of Medicine gave radioactive iodine to seventy retarded children at Wrentham State School. At Fernald School, MIT gave radioactive substances to children by putting it in their food. No risks of radioactivity were mentioned in the consent form signed by the parents.

The consent form stated that the purpose of the experiments was \"helping to improve the nutrition of our children.\" P. 15, 18 Dr. Saul Krugman of New York University and his staff deliberately injected severely mentally retarded children at Willowbrook State School with hepatitis virus in the 1950's and 1960's, [[12]](#_edn12) funded by the Army Medical Research and Development Command. To date there has been no compensation for victims of unethical biological experiments. P. 18, 19 Army doctors were actively involved in LSD testing at least until the late 1970's. Subjects of LSD experiments included children as young as five years old, and brain electrodes were implanted in children as young as 11 years of age. Four of the CIA's MKULTRA Subprojects were on children. The mind control doctors included Presidents of the American Psychiatric Association and psychiatrists who received full-page obituaries in the *American Journal of Psychiatry*. Responsibility for the unethical experimentation lies first with the individual doctors, but also collectively with the medical profession and with academia as a whole. P. 21 **Cold War Mind Control Experimentation** BLUEBIRD was approved by the CIA director on April 20, 1950. In August 1951, the Project was renamed ARTICHOKE. BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE included a great deal of work on the creation of amnesia, hypnotic couriers, and the Manchurian Candidate. [[13]](#_edn13)[[14]](#_edn14) ARTICHOKE documents prove that hypnotic couriers functioned effectively in real-life simulations conducted by the CIA in the early 1950's. The degree to which such individuals were used in actual operations is still classified. P. 23 The BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE documents available through the Freedom of Information Act, like all such documents, are heavily redacted. A great deal of text has been whited out, and other documents must still be entirely classified. BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE were administered in a *compartmented* fashion. The details of the programs were kept secret even form other personnel within the CIA. When asked why LSD research done under ARTICHOKE was hidden from the CIA Committee in charge of ARTICHOKE, Sydney Gottlieb, Chief, Medical Staff, Technical Services Division, CIA, responded, \"I imagine the only reason would have been concern for broadening awareness of its existence.\" P. 25, 27 An article in the February 18, 1979 *Wilmington Sunday News Journal *states: \"The ARTICHOKE interrogation was conducted in a safe house in the remote countryside staffed by security-cleared personnel.

It was conducted under medical cover of a routine physical and psychological assessment. The Subject was transported to the safe house in a 'covert car.' At the safe house he was given a conventional interrogation and then some whiskey. This was followed by two grams of Phenobarbital, which put him to sleep. A lie detector test was given, and the Subject was given intravenous chemicals. Following the chemically-assisted interrogation, the ARTICHOKE techniques were applied in three stages. A false memory was introduced into the Subject's mind without his conscious control. The procedure was repeated again with interrogation added.\" P. 28 ARTICHOKE operations involved detailed, systematic creation of specific amnesia barriers, new identities and hypnotically implanted codes and triggers. An ARTICHOKE document dated 7 January 1953 [[15]](#_edn15) describes the experimental creation of multiple personality in two 19-year old girls by the CIA. \"H\" is used as shorthand for hypnotic, hypnotized, or hypnotism: \"These subjects have clearly demonstrated that they can pass from a fully awake state to a deep H controlled state via the telephone, via some very subtle signal that cannot be detected by other persons in the room, and without the other individuals being able to note the change. It has been clearly shown that individuals can be induced into H by telephone, by receiving written matter, or by the use of code, signal, or words. Control of those hypnotized can be passed from one individual to another without great difficulty. It has also been shown by experimentation with these girls that they can act as unwilling couriers for information purposes, and that they can be conditioned to a point where they believe a change in identity on their part even on the polygraph.\" P. 32 Another ARTICHOKE document describes \"Analogous Case #3.\" \"A CIA Security Office employee was hypnotized and given a false identity. She defended it hotly, denying her true name and rationalizing with conviction the possession of identity cards made out to her real self. Later, having had the false identity erased by suggestion, she was asked if she had ever heard of the name she had been defending as her own five minutes before. She thought, shook her head, and said, 'That's a pseudo if I ever heard one.' Apparently she had true amnesia for the entire episode.\" P. 32, 33 In an experiment described in a document entitled \"SI and H experimentation [[16]](#_edn16) (25 September 1951)\", two female subjects took part in an exercise involving the planting of a bomb.

Both subjects performed perfectly and were fully amnesic for the exercise: \"[Deleted] was instructed that upon awakening, she would proceed to [deleted] room where she would wait at the desk for a telephone call. Upon receiving the call, a person known as \"Jim\" would engage her in normal conversation. During the course of the conversation, this individual would mention a code word. When she heard this code word, she would pass into a SI trance state, but would not close her eyes and remain perfectly normal and continue the telephone conversation. P. 37 She was told that upon conclusion of the telephone conversation, she would then carry out instructions: [Deleted] was shown an electric timing device. She was informed that this device was a bomb, and then instructed how to set the device. After [deleted] learned how to set and attach the device, she was told to take the timing device which was in a briefcase, and proceed to the ladies room [where] she would be met by a girl whom she had never seen who would identify herself by the code word \"New York.\" [Deleted] was then to show this individual how to attach and set the timing device and further instructions would be given that the timing device was to be carried in the briefcase to [deleted] room, placed in the nearest empty electric-light plug and concealed in the bottom, left-hand drawer of [a] desk, with the device set for 82 seconds and turned on.\" P. 37, 38 The BLUEBIRD/ARTICHOKE materials establish conclusively that full Manchurian Candidates were created and tested successfully by physicians with TOP SECRET clearance from the CIA. P. 61 As well as being potential couriers and infiltration agents, the subjects could function in effect as hypnotically controlled cameras. They could enter a room or building, memorize materials quickly, leave the building, and then be amnesic for the entire episode. The memorized material could then be retrieved by a handler using a previously implanted code or signal, without the amnesia being disturbed. Hypnosis was not the mind control doctors' only method for creation of controlled amnesia, however. Drugs, magnetic fields, sound waves, sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, and many other methods were studied under BLUEBIRD and ARTHICHOKE. P. 38 Another problem addressed repeatedly in the documents is called \"The Problem of Disposal of Subjects.\" Several personnel recommended the use of lobotomies for this purpose, but according to the documents this was rejected", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:bluebird10pg.txt:5:abc99d567382", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9049, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "bluebird10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "bluebird10pg", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "a previously implanted code or signal, without the amnesia being disturbed.

P. 38 Another problem addressed repeatedly in the documents is called \"The Problem of Disposal of Subjects.\" Several personnel recommended the use of lobotomies for this purpose, but according to the documents this was rejected as too unethical and too high a negative publicity risk. P. 41 The usage of electric shock to the brain for the creation of amnesia with hypnosis was discussed by an ARTICHOKE document dated 3 December 1951: \"[Deleted] is reported to be an authority on electric shock. He is a psychiatrist of considerable note. [Deleted] explained that electric shock might be of considerable interest to the 'Artichoke' type of work. He stated that the standard electric-shock machine (Reiter) could be used. He stated that using this machine with convulsive treatment, he could guarantee amnesia for certain periods of time, and particularly he could guarantee amnesia for any knowledge of use of the convulsive shock. He stated that the lower setting of the machine produced a different type of shock. When this lower current type of shock was applied without convulsion, it had the effect of making a man talk. He said that this type of shock produced in the individual excruciating pain. He stated that there would be no question that the individual would be quite willing to give information if threatened with the use of this machine. It was [deleted]'s opinion that an individual could gradually be reduced through the use of electro-shock treatment to the vegetable level.\" P. 44 **Project MKULTRA** ARTICHOKE and BLUEBIRD were administratively rolled over into MKULTRA, which was created by the CIA on April 3, 1953. MKULTRA was in turn rolled over into MKSEARCH on June 7, 1964. MKSEARCH then ran until June 1972, at which time extensive shredding of MKULTRA and MKSEARCH files was ordered by the Director of the CIA, Richard Helms. The surviving MKULTRA documents can be obtained from the CIA under the Freedom of Information Act. There was a round of declassification of mind control documents in the 1970's which were the foundation of books published in the 1970's and 1980's. [[17]](#_edn17)[[18]](#_edn18)[[19]](#_edn19)[[20]](#_edn20)[[21]](#_edn21)[[22]](#_edn22)[[23]](#_edn23) P. 7 A document entitled, \"Hypnotic Experimentation and Research, 10 February 1954\" [[24]](#_edn24) describes a simulation experiment of relevance to the creation of Manchurian Candidate assassins: \"Miss [deleted] was then instructed (having previously expressed a fear of firearms) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken miss [deleted] (now in a deep hypnotic sleep), and failing this, she would pick up a pistol nearby and fire it at Miss [deleted].

She was instructed that her rage would be so great that she would not hesitate to \"kill\" [deleted] for failing to awaken. Miss [deleted] carried out these suggestions to the letter including firing the (unloaded) gun at [deleted] and then proceeding to fall into a deep sleep. After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened and expressed complete amnesia for the entire sequence. Miss [deleted] was again handed the gun, which she refused (in an awakened state) to pick up or accept form the operator. She expressed absolute denial that the foregoing sequence had happened.\" P. 36, 37 MKULTRA was divided into 149 Subprojects. One group of Subprojects involved the development and testing of mind control drugs. The goal was to identify compounds which would assist in interrogation and in the creation of amnesia. The CIA sponsored LSD research through MKULTRA. It also financed LSD conferences and books. An undated document entitled \"D-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LDS-25),\" states \"Some of the more outstanding effects are the mental confusion, helplessness, and extreme anxiety which are produced by minute doses of this substance. Based upon these reactions, its potential use in offensive psychological warfare and in interrogation is considerable. It may become one of the most important psychochemical agents.\" P. 47, 51, 54, 73 Unethical practice by physicians and the direct involvement of pharmaceutical companies are part of the history of hallucinogens. Under TOP SECRET clearance, Eli Lilly Company was given a $400,000 grant in 1953 to manufacture and supply LSD to the CIA. Army LSD research was ongoing in 1977 when LSD was a controlled substance. At least 1,500 soldiers were given LSD without informed consent as part of Army mind control experiments. These facts have never been subject to ethical review or any policy or position statement by any medical organization. P. 52, 53, 68, 73 Frank Olson was a Fort Detrick biological warfare expert who committed suicide in 1953 after being given LSD hidden in liqueur by Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, Director of MKULTRA. Olson's family determined that he had committed suicide subsequent to a bad LSD trip only after reading Nelson Rockefeller's 1975 report on the CIA, published 22 years after Olsen's death. They were given $750,000 in compensation by Congress. P. 49 Biological warfare (BW) and chemical warfare (CW) research involved testing in many locations. CW research involved releasing bacteria and viruses into general population areas. The bacterium *Serratia marascens* was released in New York (June 1966), San Francisco (September 1950), and Pennsylvania (January", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:bluebird10pg.txt:7:1c2c1a8f729b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9051, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "bluebird10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "bluebird10pg", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "determined that he had committed suicide subsequent to a bad LSD trip only after reading Nelson Rockefeller's 1975 report on the CIA, published 22 years after Olsen's death.

CW research involved releasing bacteria and viruses into general population areas. The bacterium *Serratia marascens* was released in New York (June 1966), San Francisco (September 1950), and Pennsylvania (January 1955). A paper in the *Archives of Internal Medicine* describes eleven *Serratia marascens* infections seen in one San Francisco hospital between September 1950 and February 1951. The paper was published because *Serratia marascens* infections are very rare. P. 68, 69 MKULTRA Subproject 35 involved funding the construction of the Gorman Annex at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, DC. The total budget for the Annex of $1.25 million was to provide a hospital safe house for mind control research. One sixth of the space was set aside for the CIA, which placed three biochemists there under cover. P. 55 Another group of Subprojects consists of experiments and research on non-chemical mind control. This group of Subprojects is about one quarter of the total MKULTRA Subprojects. It involves most of the contractors with *unwitting* status. Unwitting contractors are ones who do not realize that the research money is from the CIA because it has been funneled through a *cutout* or front organization. By and large, the psychologists and sociologists were unwitting contractors, while the physicians, chemists, and the biologists had TOP SECRET clearance and were aware that they were working for the CIA. In CIA terminology, these people were *witting. *P. 54 Like the Tuskeegee Syphilis Study and the radiation research, MKULTRA involved direct experimentation on children without informed consent being given by their parents or guardians. In the case of the Tuskeegee Study, children were harmed by preventable congenital syphilis. In the radiation experiments, they were harmed through direct expose after birth or *in utero* exposure during experiments on their mothers. [[25]](#_edn25) Four of the MKULTRA Subprojects involved research on children. The deliberate creation of multiple personality in children is an explicitly stated plan in the MKULTRA Subproject Proposal submitted for funding on May 30, 1961. P. 56, 61 **The Mind Control Doctors - Dr. Ewen Cameron** Throughout the 20th century, academic psychiatry provided no public commentary, ethical guidance, or moral oversight concerning mind control experimentation, despite the fact that the leading psychiatrists and medical schools were well funded by the CIA and military for mind control research.

P. 126 These human guinea pigs were never told that they were subjects in military and CIA mind control experiments, and they never gave informed consent. They received no systematic follow-up to document the harm done to them. The welfare of the \"human subjects\" was not a relevant variable in the academic equation.\" The mind control doctors saw their patients as biological machines, a view which made them sub-human, and therefore easier to abuse in mind control experiments. P. 91, 126 The MKULTRA contractor about whom the most has been written is Dr. Ewen Cameron.

Schizophrenic patients were forced to lie naked in red light for eight hours a day for periods as long as eight months. Another experiment involved overheating patients in an electric cage until their body temperatures reached 102 degrees. P. 125 - 128 Dr. Cameron massively over-utilized coma therapy by putting patients in coma for 2 to 5 hours per day for up to 50 days in a row. At various times, Dr. Cameron was President of the Quebec, Canadian, American, and World Psychiatric Associations. He was one of four co-founders of the World Psychiatric Association. P. 126 -129 In a paper published in the *American Journal of Psychiatry* entitled \"Psychic Driving,\" Dr. Cameron [[33]](#_edn33) describes his brainwashing techniques. Psychic driving was carried out in two stages. In the first stage, patients were *depatterned*, which meant reduced to a vegetable state through a combination of massive amounts of electroconvulsive shock, drug-induced sleep and sensory isolation. When fully depatterned, patients were incontinent of urine and feces, unable to feed themselves, and unable to state their name, location, or the date. P. 129 In the second stage, *psychic driving* was introduced. This consisted of hundreds of hours of tape loops being played to the patient through earphones, special helmets, or speakers in the sensory isolation room. Dr. Cameron received a grant from Canada's Department of Health and Welfare for $57,750 for the years 1961 to 1964 for \"A Study of Factors Which Promote or Retard Personality Change in Individuals Exposed to Prolonged Repetition of Verbal Signals.\" P. 129, 131 Linda MacDonald was a victim of Dr. Cameron's unethical, destructive mind control experiments between May 1 and Sept. 12, 1963. Cameron used a \"treatment\" which involved intensive application of three brainwashing techniques; drug disinhibition, prolonged sleep treatment, and prolonged psychological isolation. These were combined with ECT [Electro Convulsive Therapy] treatments.

These were combined with ECT [Electro Convulsive Therapy] treatments. The amount of electricity introduced into Linda's brain exceeded by 76.5 times the maximum amount recommended in the ECT Guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association. P. 181-182 Dr. Cameron proved that doctors skilled in the right procedures can erase a subject's memory. His depattering technique resulted in permanent and complete amnesia. To this day, Linda MacDonald is unable to remember anything from her birth to 1963. As recorded by nurses in her chart, Linda was reduced to a vegetable state. She was completely disoriented. She didn't know her name, age or where she was. She didn't recognize her children. She couldn't read, drive, cook, or use a toilet. Not only did she not know her husband, she didn't even know what a husband was. P. 182-183 There is a connection to politics, power, and weapons in Linda MacDonald's life. Her husband worked for the Canadian Armament Research Development Establishment. His immediate boss was a man who sold arms to Saddam Hussein. His boss was also tied into the Iran-Contra affair, and was murdered in Europe a few years ago. P. 186 Life changed for Linda when the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program, *The Fifth Estate*, aired a segment on Dr. Cameron on January 17, 1984. A Vancouver newspaper ran a full-page story on Robert Loggie, a Vancouver man who had been experimented on by Dr. Cameron. Loggie was a plaintiff in the class action suit against the CIA for Dr. Cameron's MKULTRA experiments, which was settled out of court for $750,000, divided among the eight plaintiffs. P. 187 Linda's mother phoned her about the program. Linda shook a lot in reaction to the news and didn't know what to do. Through a reporter she got in touch with a Washington lawyer representing the eight Canadian plaintiffs. He advised Linda that she could not be a party to the class action suit against the CIA because she was 'treated' by Dr. Cameron after his CIA funding had stopped. The Canadian government had picked up the funding by 1963. Eventually she got $100,000 plus legal fees from the Canadian government. P. 187, 188 The fact that Dr. Cameron's unethical, inhumane, and grossly damaging experiments were published in the psychiatric literature [[34]](#_edn34)[[35]](#_edn35)[[36]](#_edn36) is a condemnation of the editorial standards of the journals, not a vindication of Dr. Cameron.

[[38]](#_edn38)[[39]](#_edn39)[[40]](#_edn40) In his book *Hypnotism*, [[41]](#_edn41) Dr. Estabrooks states that the creation of experimental multiple personality for operational use in military subjects, whom he refers to as super spies, is ethical because of the demands of war. P. 159, 162 He comments in a chapter entitled \"Hypnotism in Warfare\" that: \"the hand of the military must not be tied by any silly prejudices in the minds of the general public. War is the end of all law. In the last analysis any device is justifiable which enables us to protect ourselves from defeat.\" P. 162 In a May 13, 1968 article in the *Providence Evening Bulletin,* [[42]](#_edn42) Estabrooks is described as a former consultant for the FBI and CIA, and is quoted as saying that, \"the key to creating an effective spy or assassin rests in splitting a man's personality, or creating multipersonality, with the aid of hypnotism. This is not science fiction. This has and is being done. I have done it.\" P. 162 Dr. Estabrooks' proposal to the CIA dated June 22, 1954 states: \"In deep hypnosis the subject, military or civilian, can be given a message to be delivered to say Colonel X in Berlin. The message will be perfectly safe because the subject will have no memory in the waking state as to the message. It can be arranged that the subject will have no knowledge of ever having been hypnotized. It can be arranged that no one beside Colonel X in Berlin can hypnotize the subject and recover the message....I will take a number of men and will establish in them through the use of hypnotism the condition of split personality. Consciously they will be ardent Communists, fanatical adherents to the party line. Unconsciously they will be loyal Americans determined to thwart the Communists at every turn. These men will have no knowledge of ever having been hypnotized, and can only be hypnotized by such persons as the original operator may choose. Consciously they will associate with the Communists and learn all their plans. Once every month they, as loyal Americans, will tell what they know. This sounds unbelievable, but I assure you, it will work.\" P. 163, 165 In a 1971 article in *Science Digest*, Dr. Estabrooks [[43]](#_edn43) claimed to have created hypnotic couriers and counterintelligence agents for operational", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:bluebird10pg.txt:11:455182004b9a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9055, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "bluebird10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "bluebird10pg", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "have no knowledge of ever having been hypnotized, and can only be hypnotized by such persons as the original operator may choose.

I was involved in preparing army subjects during World War II. One successful case involved an Army Captain. He was an excellent subject but did not realize it. I removed from him, by post hypnotic suggestion, all recollection of ever having been hypnotized. I put him under deep hypnosis, and gave him - orally - a vital message to be delivered directly on his arrival in Japan to a certain colonel - let's say his name was Brown - of military intelligence. Outside of myself, Colonel Brown was the only person who could hypnotize Captain Smith. This is 'locking.' I performed it by saying to the captain, 'We will use the phrase 'the moon is clear.' Whenever you hear this phrase from Brown or myself you will pass instantly into deep hypnosis.' When Captain Smith re-awakened, he had no conscious memory of what happened in trance. The system is virtually foolproof.\" P. 167, 168 By the 1920's not only had [clinical hypnotists] learned to apply posthypnotic suggestion, but also had learned to split certain complex individuals into multiple personalities like Jeckyl-Hydes. During World War II, I worked this technique with a vulnerable Marine lieutenant I'll call Jones. I split his personality into Jones A and Jones B. Jones A, once a \"normal\" working Marine, became entirely different. He talked communist doctrine and meant it. He was welcomed enthusiastically by communist cells, and was deliberately given a dishonorable discharge by the Corps and became a card-carrying party member. Jones B was the deeper personality, knew all the thoughts of Jones A, was a loyal American and was \"imprinted\" to say nothing during conscious phases. All I had to do was hypnotize the whole man, get in touch with Jones B, the loyal American, and I had a pipeline straight into the Communist camp. It worked beautifully for months.\" P. 169 Dr. Estabrooks did experiments on children. He corresponded with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover about using hypnosis to interrogate juvenile delinquents. His experimentation on children raises the possibility that investigators have attempted to create Manchurian Candidates in children. Such a possibility might seem far-fetched until one considers the LSD, biological and radiation experiments conducted on children, the fact that four MKULTRA Subprojects were on children, and that hypnotic subjects described in the CIA documents include girls 19 years of age.

P. 176, 177 **Other Mind Control Doctors** Dr. Harold Wolff, a Professor of Medicine at Cornell, was a director of the CIA cutout [front organization], The Human Ecology Foundation, and the investigator of MKULTRA Subproject 61. Dr. Wolff's accomplishments include being President of the American Neurological Association and editor of *Archives of Neurology*. [[44]](#_edn44) P. 85 Dr. Martin Orne [[45]](#_edn45)[[46]](#_edn46) is one of the leading experts on hypnosis of the 20th century. For about 30 years, he was the editor of *The International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis. *He is one of two psychiatrists professionally active into the late 1990's who is a documented CIA mind control contractor, along with Dr. Louis Jolyon West. [[47]](#_edn47) Dr. West, who killed an elephant with LSD [[48]](#_edn48) at Oklahoma City Zoo, had TOP SECRET clearance with the CIA and military. P. 81, 121, 124 Dr. William Sweet [[49]](#_edn49) participated in both brain electrode implant experiments and the injection of uranium into medical patients at Harvard University. The 925-page *Final Report. Advisory Committee on Human radiation Experiments* tells the story of the radiation experiments, and their linkage to mind control. [[50]](#_edn50) P. 1 **Brain Implants** A CIA memorandum for MKULTRA Subproject 142 describes the control of animals through stimulation of brain electrodes. The overall goal was clear; to control the mind and behavior, and to create dissociation through a combination of drugs, hypnosis, brain electrode implants, electric shock, and beaming different kinds of energy at the brain. The ability to create limited, controlled amnesia through a variety of methods was a primary goal of the mind control programs. P. 87 Brain electrode experiments were also conducted in humans. Dr. Jose Delgado, [[51]](#_edn51)[[52]](#_edn52)[[53]](#_edn53)[[54]](#_edn54)[[55]](#_edn55)[[56]](#_edn56)[[57]](#_edn57) a neurosurgeon and professor at Yale, received funding for brain electrode research on children and adults. He was able to control the movements of his animal and human subjects by pushing buttons on a remote transmitter box. In one paper, Dr. Delgado describes the cats as \"mechanical toys.\" P. 87-89 An 11-year old boy underwent a partial change of identity upon remote stimulation of his brain electrode: [[58]](#_edn58) \"Electrical stimulation of the superior temporal convolution induced feminine striving and confusion about his own sexual identity.

The patient, an 11-year-old boy, said, 'I was thinking whether I was a boy or a girl, which I'd like to be,' and 'I'd like to be a girl.' After one of the stimulations the patient suddenly began to discuss his desire to get married to the male interviewer. P. 89 Temporal-lobe stimulation produced in another patient open manifestations and declarations of pleasure, accompanied by giggles and joking with the therapist. In two adult female patients stimulation of the same region was followed by discussion of marriage and expression of a wish to marry the therapist. P. 89 Brain electrode research was also conducted independently at Harvard by Dr. Delgado's coauthors, Drs. Vernon Mark, Frank Ervin, and William Sweet. Mark and Ervin describe implanting brain electrodes in a large number of patients at Harvard hospitals. A patient named Jennie was 14 years old when they put electrodes in her brain. In Mark and Ervin's *Violence and the Brain*, [[59]](#_edn59) photographs show 18-year old Julia smiling, angry, or pounding the wall depending on which button is being pushed on the transmitter box sending signals to her brain electrodes. P. 89-91 Dr. Heath, [[60]](#_edn60)[[61]](#_edn61)[[62]](#_edn62) Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Tulane University, placed brain electrodes in a young homosexual man and fitted him with a box. A button on the box could be used to electrically stimulate an electrode implanted in the septal region of his brain, a pleasure center. During one three-our period, the patient, referred to as B-19, stimulated himself 1,500 times. [[63]](#_edn63) \"During these sessions, B-19 stimulated himself to a point that he was experiencing an almost overwhelming euphoria and elation, and had to be disconnected, despite his vigorous protests. P. 94 **Non-lethal Weapons** Non-lethal weapons is a broad category which includes devices for beaming various kinds of energy at human targets in order to temporarily incapacitate them, or to control or affect their behavior. Non-lethal weapons research has been conducted at universities in the US on contract to the CIA, and has overlapped with research on hallucinogens and brain electrode implants. Funding of the experiments began in MKULTRA. P. 103 Subproject 62 documents \"certain kinds of radio frequency energy have been found to effect reversible neurological changes in chimpanzees.\" Subproject 54 was studying how to produce concussions from a distance using mechanical blast waves propagated through the air.

Masking of a noise of this duration should not be difficult. It would be advantageous to establish the effectiveness of both of the above methods as a tool in brain-wash therapy.\" P. 104, 105 MKULTRA Subproject 119 was a literature review which included a summary of existing information on \"Techniques of activation of the human organism by remote electronic means.\" According to a report in *Defense Electronics*, [[64]](#_edn64) consideration was given to using non-lethal weapons technology on David Koresh during the Branch Davidian siege in the spring of 1993. P. 105 Research on the ability of magnetic fields to facilitate the creation of false memories and altered states of consciousness is apparently funded by the Defense Intelligence Agency through the project cryptonym SLEEPING BEAUTY. \"Sleeping Beauty was a Defense Department study of remote microwave min-influencing techniques.\" [[65]](#_edn65) P. 116 There is abundant evidence in the public domain [[66]](#_edn66) that non-lethal weapons research is ongoing and funded annually in the tens of millions of dollars or more. Given the fact that chemical and biological weapons, mind control drugs and radiation have been tested on unwitting civilian populations, it is possible that non-lethal weapons have been tested on unwitting civilians. P 106. A memorandum from Richard Helms, [[67]](#_edn67) Acting Deputy Director to Allen Dulles, Director of the CIA dated 3 April 1953 and entitled \"Two Extremely Sensitive Research Programs\" (MKULTRA and MKDELTA) includes the statement, \"Even internally in CIA, as few individuals as possible should be aware of our interest in these fields and of the identity of those who are working for us. At present this results in ridiculous contracts, often with cut-outs [front organizations], which do not spell out the scope or intent of the work. Complete Government audits of such contracts are impossible for the same reason.\" P. 125 **To order *Bluebird*, and to get more information on mind control and other major cover-ups, see our [Resource List](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources).

May we all remember how precious life is, and how special the moment of death can be. **The Littlest Firefighter** The 26-year-old mother stared down at her son who was dying of terminal leukemia. Although her heart was filled with sadness, she also had a strong feeling of determination. Like any parent she wanted her son to grow up and fulfill all his dreams. Now that was no longer possible. The leukemia would see to that. But she still wanted her son's dreams to come true. She took her son's hand and asked, \"Bopsy, did you ever think about what you wanted to be once you grew up? Did you ever dream and wish what you would do with your life?\" \"Mommy, I always wanted to be a fireman when I grew up.\" Mom smiled back and said, \"Let's see if we can make your wish come true.\" Later that day she went to her local fire department in Phoenix, Arizona, where she met Fireman Bob, who had a heart as big as Phoenix. She explained her son's final wish and asked if it might be possible to give her six-year-old son a ride around the block on a fire engine. Fireman Bob said, \"Look, we can do better than that. If you'll have your son ready at seven o'clock Wednesday morning, we'll make him an honorary fireman for the whole day. He can come down to the fire station, eat with us, go out on all the fire calls, the whole nine yards! \"And if you'll give us his sizes, we'll get a real fire uniform for him, with a real fire hat -- not a toy one -- with the emblem of the Phoenix Fire Department on it, a yellow slicker like we wear and rubber boots.

He rode in the different fire engines, the paramedic's van, and even the fire chief's car. He was also videotaped for the local news program. Having his dream come true, with all the love and attention that was lavished upon him, so deeply touched Bopsy that he lived three months longer than any doctor thought possible. Yet finally, one night all of his vital signs began to drop dramatically. The head nurse, who believed in the hospice concept that no one should die alone, began to call the family members to the hospital. Then she remembered the day Bopsy had spent as a fireman, so she called the Fire Chief and asked if it would be possible to send a fireman in uniform to the hospital to be with Bopsy as he made his transition. The chief replied, \"We can do better than that. We'll be there in five minutes. Will you please do me a favor? When you hear the sirens screaming and see the lights flashing, will you announce over the PA system that there is not a fire? It's just the fire department coming to see one of its finest members one more time. And will you open the window to his room?\" About five minutes later a hook and ladder truck arrived at the hospital, extended its ladder up to Bopsy's third floor open window and five firefighters climbed up the ladder to Bopsy's room. With his mother's permission, they hugged him and held him and told him how much they loved him. In one touching moment, Bopsy looked up at the fire chief and said, \"Chief, am I really a fireman now?\" \"Yes, Bopsy, you are a fireman now,\" the chief said. With those words, Bopsy smiled and closed his eyes one last time. He passed away the next morning. **For more on the background of this amazing true story:** [www.wish.org/about/the_first_wish/the_first_make_a_wish_child](https://web.archive.org/web/20080423191212/http://www.wish.org/about/the_first_wish/the_first_make_a_wish_child) - Make-A-Wish website on Bopsy [www.personalgrowth...](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/stories/21a.bopsy_story.pdf) - Bopsy's story and photos in the Phoenix Fire Department's newsletter [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/01/bopsy-fireman...](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/01/bopsy-fireman-make-a-wish_n_4181841.html) Follow-up 32 years after Bopsy's death [http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/boyslastwish&title=](http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/boyslastwish&title=) **For more inspiration: ** See our awesome collection of a variety of inspiring resources [available here](https://www.momentoflove.org/inspiringresources).

Yet in order to give meaningful suggestions to further support this, we first need to speak candidly about what's happening in the world at present. It appears that there are factions within the [world's power elite](https://www.newsarticles.media/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) which still desire to exert as much control as possible over the world. **Their primary means for establishing control are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life.** When these factions gain greater power and control, our freedoms and liberties are [increasingly taken away](https://www.WantToKnow.info/unconstitutionalcivillibertiesloss), sometimes without our even realizing it. Fear is used as a powerful tool of control by these factions of the global elite. \"The terrorists want to kill us all. Your job, savings, and retirement are no longer secure. You are either for us or against us. We might be attacked at any time.\" All of these messages [push us towards fear](https://www.WantToKnow.info/powerofnightmares). And by encouraging us to focus blame on others such as terrorists and \"evil\" leaders, the global power brokers push us away from feeling in control of our lives and towards the role of powerless victims, so that we look to them for protection. The more we slip into fear and being victims, the easier it is for us to be manipulated. Secrecy leads to control through preventing the exposure of hidden agendas, and through breeding distrust, suspicion, and paranoia in the world. In the name of \"national security,\" we have been told ever more frequently that we should [not know what is happening](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secrecygraham) behind closed doors in government. Yet we are encouraged to keep vigilant watch over our neighbors, over those who question the government, and over those who look or act different from us, as they could secretly be terrorists in sheep's clothing. **Rampant suspicion and secrecy cause us to lose touch with the common humanity we share with all around us.** Polarization leads to \"us vs. them\" ways of thinking. Divide and conquer is a tactic that has been used successfully by the power elite of the world for centuries. As long as people focus on blaming and attacking \"the enemy,\" they are not likely to look for the deeper causes of their problems. Controlling factions of the power elite work to keep public and [media attention](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediacorruption) focused on issues which divide us into two polarized camps, so that their greatest concerns of [power and control](https://www.WantToKnow.info/divinewisdomunderstanding) go unnoticed.

A final subtle, yet powerful method of gaining control is to distract people from their purpose in life. Consider that television, radio, and movies have been filled with ever more greed, violence, and empty sex. Our educational system has increasingly prioritized passing tests over developing intelligence and creativity. Excessive corporate control of the media has [limited what news we receive](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediainformation#censored), and often shaped our decisions and the way we think. **Our attention has been subtly diverted from our deeper purpose in life to the more superficial attractions of sex, consumerism, and money.** When we succumb to fear, secrecy, and polarization, and when we lose touch with our sense of purpose in life, elements of the global elite are able to exert ever more control over our lives and world. **Towards a Brighter Future** What can we do about all this? Ultimately, it is the collective fear, secrecy, polarization, and loss of purpose within all of us that has allowed leaders to take power who would subvert democracy, and who would take away our freedoms and liberties. **By each one of us making a commitment to work on these issues both inside of ourselves and out in the world - and to inspire others to do the same - we are changing our collective direction and building a solid foundation for a brighter future.** Several actions can help us to take firm steps in that direction. **Develop purpose and intentions for your life.** To live rich, full lives in today's complex world, it's vitally important to give your life clear direction by exploring what is deepest and most meaningful to you, and by [developing a life purpose](https://www.WantToKnow.info/lifepurposeintentions) and life intentions based on this. Then choose to live your intentions and follow your purpose to the best of your ability every day. By choosing to live with clear direction and focus, life becomes deeper and more meaningful. This then weakens the seduction of consumerism and media hype which distract us from our purpose, and allows us to more effectively focus on building a brighter future. **Choose to transform fear into acceptance and love.** When we notice ourselves feeling fear, we can trace the roots of that fear, so that we are able to [identify our core challenges](https://www.WantToKnow.info/coreissue) and deal more consciously with them.

We can open to guidance from friends, teachers, and spiritual sources in helping us to move from fear to [acceptance and understanding](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife2#acceptance). We can also transform our fears through welcoming the ever-present love of our divine creator, and the love that lies always deep within our own hearts, and in the hearts of those around us. In doing this, we begin to recognize fear as an invitation to growth. Become aware of when you are playing the role of victim, and choose instead to **take personal responsibility for building a brighter future**. In blaming others for our problems, we often avoid taking responsibility for how much we are involved in creating these problems through the choices we make. Whenever we catch ourselves playing the role of victim by blaming others (including the power elite) for everything that's wrong in our lives, we can choose to take a [look inside ourselves](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/victim_or_creator_vs), and to explore and take responsibility for our role in what's happening. By focusing less on blaming others, and more on improving ourselves, every one of us can make a difference both in our lives and in our world. **Avoid secrecy and encourage openness and transparency.** An important way we can do this is to work together to [inform friends and colleagues](https://www.WantToKnow.info/spreadtheword) about the major cover-ups being hidden from the public. Then in our personal lives, when we notice ourselves keeping information from others, we can examine our motives for this secrecy. Are we withholding information out of our own self-interest, or because this is really [what's best](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife2) for all involved? And on a deeper level, where are we avoiding being honest with ourselves? **Move beyond polarization and the focus on \"good vs. evil\" and \"us vs. them.\"** Every person in the world has a heart. And each of us has [a place in our heart](https://www.momentoflove.org/) that wants only to love and be loved. Consider the possibility that all of us are doing what we believe to be right based upon our beliefs, circumstances, and upbringing. As we focus less on blaming and judging \"them\" and more on [supporting the highest motive](https://www.WantToKnow.info/transformation#nurturance) in all people - including members of the power elite - we increasingly come to see that we are all one human family, and that we can choose to transform our world by working together for the good of all. **And finally, come together in groups and communities **to support each other in making these positive changes.

Yet let us not overly focus on changing the outside world without first having a solid internal foundation, lest we fall into blaming others, and into the polarizing \"us vs. them\" ways which only further divide us.

He had been talking for 60 seconds straight when he slipped in the comment, \"let me finish\" between his own words. He had been given 90 seconds to respond, and no one was in any way trying to cut him off. What was he referring to? Who was he talking to with this comment? The answer is that it is very possible that Bush was responding to someone who was feeding information to him through a hidden earphone. Listen to the [mp3](http://nyc.indymedia.org/usermedia/audio/6/bush-let_me_finish.mp3) of this comment at [NYC indymedia](http://nyc.indymedia.org/newswire/display/125456/index.php), or watch the video on the C-SPAN website at: rtsp://cspanrm.fplive.net/cspan/project/c04/c04093004_debate1.rm (copy and paste this address to your web browser, then fast forward to 40 min 30 sec). As a deep insider myself, I have independent confirmation of President Bush using an earpiece to assist him in communicating intelligently with others. I've worked as a contract Indonesian language interpreter with the US State Department for over 18 years. I first started interpreting at the presidential level in 1995 at a White House meeting for President Clinton and President Suharto of Indonesia with their top advisors. You can read a short story of the many small miracles that led me to interpret for presidents at [www.inspiringcommunity.org/inspiringstories](https://www.inspiringcommunity.org/inspiringstories) (scroll down to Issue #1, where it is the second story). On September 19, 2001, just eight days after 9/11, I was in the White House interpreting for an important 90-minute meeting between President Bush and President Megawati Soekarnoputri of Indonesia. This meeting made national news on all the TV networks, as at the time, the administration wanted to show they were supportive of our Muslim friends. Indonesia has the largest population of Muslims in the world. Over 80% of Indonesia's 220 million people are Muslim. This was my first time interpreting for Bush. The previous day, I had been given the 22 points Bush would be covering in this meeting in order to familiarize myself with the topics to be discussed. About half of these \"talking points\" had to do with terrorism, which was to be fully expected given what had just happened. The other points, however, involved many details of Indonesian politics which even I would have had a tough time addressing, let alone Bush, who I assumed had limited knowledge of Indonesia. During those 90 minutes, President Bush not only covered all the points, he covered them quite well and **without any notes! **Not once during the entire meeting did he look at any notes or receive cues from anyone present in discussing the Indonesian political situation with depth and intelligence.

I was astonished! \"How could this be?\" I asked myself. It was a huge surprise. I concluded either that Bush was much more intelligent than we had been led to believe, or that somehow someone was feeding answers to him through a hidden earpiece. At the time, I really didn't know which of these was true. Having worked directly with President Bush twice since then, and having additionally talked with many of my fellow interpreters who have worked directly with him, I am now certain that he could not have had that much knowledge of Indonesia. He doesn't even read the daily newspaper to keep up with what's being reported in the press. I am convinced that he must have been using some sort of earpiece through which someone was telling him what to say. Having interpreted for media guests touring large TV studios, I've seen how the news anchors all have hidden earphones, and how the news producers are feeding them all sorts of information even as they talk live on TV. \"20 seconds to a commercial,\" \"15 seconds of filler here,\" \"wrap it up quick \" etc... This is standard practice for live TV shows. The \"let me finish\" comment made by Bush in the debate was only confirmation of something I already knew. I will also mention that a number of months ago a colleague of mine was in the room with President Bush and his advisors when Bush threw a full blown temper tantrum filled with fowl language and all. He ranted and raved at his advisors for a number of minutes to the shock and dismay of my colleague who was standing unseen in the refreshment corner. When he finally finished blowing off steam, Bush turned towards the refreshment table only to see my colleague standing there. He instantly switched into his \"good ol' boy\" friendly demeanor and said, \"Hey, how ya doin' buddy?\" Politics is not a pretty business. I have many stories from my experiences interpreting at international conferences and secret meetings attended only our leaders and their interpreters. I have seen a number of our world's leaders (not just Americans) acting like high school boys playing power games.

Indeed, it is a discovery that could end the pain and suffering of countless millions and change life on Earth forever. Certainly, the medical world would rush to embrace you with every imaginable accolade and financial reward imaginable. You would think so, wouldn't you? Unfortunately, arguably the greatest medical genius in all recorded history suffered a fate literally the opposite of the foregoing logical scenario. **In fact, the history of medicine is replete with stories of genius betrayed by backward thought and jealously, but most pathetically, by greed and money. ** In the nineteenth century, [Semmelweiss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis) struggled mightily to convince surgeons that it was a good idea to sterilize their instruments and use sterile surgical procedures.

Often, the visionary who challenges it pays a heavy price for his 'heresy.' ** So, you have just discovered a new therapy which can eradicate any microbial disease but, so far, you and your amazing cure aren't very popular. What do you do next? Well, certainly the research foundations and teaching institutions would welcome news of your astounding discovery. Won't they be thrilled to learn you have a cure for the very same diseases they are receiving hundreds of millions of dollars per year to investigate? Maybe not, if it means the end of the gravy train for all your research to find a cure. These people have mortgages to pay and families to support. Perhaps you should take your discovery to the pharmaceutical industry; certainly it would be of great interest to those protectors of humanity, right? **But remember, you have developed a universal cure which could make most drugs obsolete, so the pharmaceutical industry just might be less than thrilled to hear about your work.** In fact, the bigshots might even make it certain that your human disease-ending technology never sees the light of day, by preventing it from becoming licensed by the regulatory agencies. Now, assuming your amazing cure is an electronic instrument, the only cost of using it is electricity. And it is harmless to patients, who can recover without losing their hair, the family home, and their life savings. So, with your technology, there is no longer any reason for people with cancer to pay over $300,000 per patient - to become deathly ill from chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and surgery. It sounds like you won't find many friends and support among practicing oncologists, radiologists, and surgeons, doesn't it? You might try the hospitals and big clinics. But how thrilled are they going to be about a therapy administered in any doctor's office; which reverses illness before the patient has to be hospitalized? Thanks to you, the staffs of these institutions would essentially be out of work. Well then, how about the insurance companies? Surely, they would be delighted to save the expense of hospitalization - at least the companies which haven't invested in hospitals, where the staff is now sitting around waiting for someone to break a leg or be in a car accident ... and the ones who don't lose policyholders as a result of your invention ... and the companies", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:cancercuresroyalrife.txt:1:fb179d2550bf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9081, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "cancercuresroyalrife.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "cancercuresroyalrife", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Thanks to you, the staffs of these institutions would essentially be out of work.

Oh well, forget the insurance companies, too. It looks like you just might have a little problem with the medical establishment, no? Probably the only friends you'll have will be the patients and those progressive doctors who see change as an opportunity, rather than a threat to their established money-making machines. Those people will love you. But they don't call the shots. **What follows now is the story of exactly such a sensational therapy and what happened to it. In one of the blackest episodes in recorded history, this remarkable electronic therapy was sabotaged and buried by a ruthless group of men. It has re-emerged in the underground medical/alternative health world only since the mid-1980's. This is the story of Royal Raymond Rife and his fabulous discoveries and electronic instruments. ** If you have never heard of Rife before, prepare to be angered and incredulous at what this great man achieved for all of us only to have it practically driven from the face of the planet. But, reserve your final judgment and decision until after you have read this. Of course, some may regard this as just an amusing piece of fiction. However, for those who are willing to do some investigating on their own, there will be mentioned several highly-respected doctors and medical authorities who worked with Rife, as well as some of the remarkable technical aspects of his creation. So let's now turn to the story of the most amazing medical pioneer of the 20th century. **The Life of Royal Rife** Royal Raymond Rife was a brilliant scientist born in 1888 and died in 1971. After studying at Johns Hopkins, Rife developed technology which is still commonly used today in the fields of optics, electronics, radiochemistry, biochemistry, ballistics, and aviation. **He received 14 major awards and honors and was given an honorary Doctorate by the University of Heidelberg for his work.** During the 66 years that Rife spent designing and building medical instruments, he worked for Zeiss Optics, the U.S. Government, and several private benefactors. Because Rife was self-educated in so many different fields, he intuitively looked for his answers in areas beyond the rigid scientific structure of his day. He had mastered so many different disciplines that he literally had, at his intellectual disposal, the skills and knowledge of an entire team of scientists and technicians from a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:cancercuresroyalrife.txt:2:4dd66156e589", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9082, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "cancercuresroyalrife.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "cancercuresroyalrife", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "his work.** During the 66 years that Rife spent designing and building medical instruments, he worked for Zeiss Optics, the U.S. Government, and several private benefactors. Because Rife was self-educated in so many different fields, he intuitively looked for his answers in areas beyond the rigid scientific structure of his day. He had mastered so many different disciplines that he literally had, at his intellectual disposal, the skills and knowledge of an entire team of scientists and technicians from a number of different scientific fields. So, whenever new technology was needed to perform a new task, Rife simply invented and then built it himself. Rife's inventions include a heterodyning ultraviolet microscope [see [*New York Times*article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/311122nytimes.rifemicroscope.pdf)], a microdissector, and a micromanipulator. When you thoroughly understand Rife's achievements, you may well decide that his was one of the most gifted, versatile, scientific minds in human history. By 1920, Rife had finished building the world's first virus microscope. **By 1933, he had perfected that technology and had constructed the incredibly complex [Universal Microscope](http://www.rife.org/newspaper/flygrows.jpg), which had nearly 6,000 different parts and was capable of magnifying objects 30,000 times their normal size. With this incredible microscope, Rife became the first human being to actually see a live virus.** Modern electron microscopes instantly kill everything beneath them, viewing only the mummified remains and debris. What the Rife microscope can see is the bustling activity of living viruses as they change form to accommodate changes in environment, replicate rapidly in response to carcinogens, and transform normal cells into tumor cells. But how was Rife able to accomplish this, in an age when electronics and medicine were still just evolving? Here are a few technical details to placate the skeptics... **Rife painstakingly identified the individual spectroscopic signature of each microbe, using a slit spectroscope attachment.** Then, he slowly rotated block quartz prisms to focus light of a single wavelength upon the microorganism he was examining. This wavelength was selected because it resonated with the spectroscopic signature frequency of the microbe based on the now-established fact that [every molecule oscillates at its own distinct frequency](http://www.biomedic.co.uk/bioresonancetechnology.html). The atoms that come together to form a molecule are held together in that molecular configuration with a covalent energy bond which both emits and absorbs its own specific electromagnetic frequency. No two species of molecule have the same electromagnetic oscillations or energetic signature. Resonance amplifies light in the same way two ocean waves intensify each other when they merge together. The result of using a resonant wavelength is that micro-organisms which are invisible in white light suddenly become visible in a brilliant flash of light when they are exposed to the color frequency that resonates with their own distinct spectroscopic signature. Rife was thus able to see these otherwise invisible organisms and watch them actively invading tissues cultures. Rife's discovery enabled him to view organisms that no one else could see with ordinary", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:cancercuresroyalrife.txt:3:721dadea79b6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9083, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "cancercuresroyalrife.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "cancercuresroyalrife", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "intensify each other when they merge together.

[For more details in an article written by Rife, [click here](http://web.archive.org/web/20100724091033/http://www.sangraal.com/rife.htm)] **More than 75% of the organisms Rife could see with his Universal Microscope are only visible with ultra-violet light. But ultraviolet light is outside the range of human vision, it is 'invisible' to us. Rife's brilliance allowed him to overcome this limitation by heterodyning, a technique which became popular in early radio broadcasting.** He illuminated the microbe (usually a virus or bacteria) with two [harmonic] wavelengths of ... ultraviolet light frequency which resonated with the spectral signature of the microbe. These two wavelengths produced interference where they merged. This interference was, in effect, a third, longer wave which fell into the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This was how Rife made invisible microbes visible without killing them, a feat which today's electron microscopes cannot duplicate. [For a 1944 Smithsonian Institution report which includes information on Rife's amazing microscopes, [click here](http://www.archive.org/stream/annualreportofbo1944smit/annualreportofbo1944smit_djvu.txt) and do a search for the word \"Rife\"] By this time, Rife was so far ahead of his colleagues of the 1930's that they could not comprehend what he was doing without actually traveling to San Diego to Rife's laboratory to look through his Virus Microscope for themselves. And many did exactly that. One was Virginia Livingston. She eventually moved from New Jersey to Rife's Point Loma (San Diego) neighborhood and became a frequent visitor to his lab. Virginia Livingston is now often given the credit for identifying the organism which causes human cancer, beginning with research papers she began publishing in 1948. **Research into Cancer and Cancer Cures** In reality, Royal Rife had identified the human cancer virus first. ... In 1920, Rife made over 20,000 unsuccessful attempts to transform normal cells into tumor cells. He finally succeeded when he irradiated the cancer virus, passed it through a cell-catching ultra-fine porcelain filter, and injected it into lab animals.** Not content to prove this virus would cause one tumor, Rife then created 400 tumors in succession from the same culture. He documented everything with film, photographs, and meticulous records. **He named the cancer virus 'Cryptocides primordiales.' Virginia Livingston, in her papers, renamed it Progenitor Cryptocides. Royal Rife was never even mentioned in her papers. In fact, Rife seldom got credit for his monumental discoveries. He was a quiet, unassuming scientist, dedicated to expanding his discoveries rather than to ambition, fame, and glory.

He was a quiet, unassuming scientist, dedicated to expanding his discoveries rather than to ambition, fame, and glory. His distaste for medical politics (which he could afford to ignore thanks to generous trusts set up by private benefactors) left him at a disadvantage later, when powerful forces attacked him. Coupled with the influence of the pharmaceutical industry in purging his papers from medical journals, it is hardly surprising that few have heard of Rife today. Meanwhile, debate raged between those who had seen viruses changing into different forms beneath Rife's microscopes, and those who had not. Those who condemned without investigation, such as the influential Dr. Thomas Rivers, claimed these forms didn't exist. Because his microscope did not reveal them, Rivers argued that there was \"no logical basis for belief in this theory.\" **The same argument is used today in evaluating many other 'alternative' medical treatments; if there is no precedent, then it must not be valid. Nothing can convince a closed mind.** Most had never actually looked though the San Diego microscopes, as air travel in the 1930's was uncomfortable, primitive, and rather risky. So, the debate about the life cycle of viruses was resolved in favor of those who never saw it (even modern electron microscopes show frozen images, not the life cycle of viruses in process). Nevertheless, many scientists and doctors have since confirmed Rife's discovery of the cancer virus and its pleomorphic nature, using darkfield techniques, the [Naessens microscope](http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/eppp-archive/100/201/300/cdn_medical_association/cmaj/vol-158/issue-12/1621.htm), and laboratory experiments. **Rife ignored the debate, preferring to concentrate on refining his method of destroying these tiny killer viruses. He used the same principle to kill them which made them visible: resonance. By increasing the intensity of a frequency which resonated naturally with these microbes, Rife increased their natural oscillations until they distorted and disintegrated from structural stresses.** Rife called this frequency 'the mortal oscillatory rate,' or 'MOR', and it did no harm whatsoever to the surrounding tissues. Rife's instruments used the principle of harmonics. This principle can be illustrated by using an intense musical note to shatter a wine glass: the molecules of the glass are already oscillating at some harmonic (multiple) of that musical note; they are in resonance with it. Because everything else has a different resonant frequency, nothing but the glass is destroyed. There are literally hundreds of trillions of different resonant frequencies, and every species and molecule has its very own. It took Rife many years until he discovered the frequencies which specifically destroyed herpes, polio, spinal meningitis, tetanus, influenza, and an immense number", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:cancercuresroyalrife.txt:5:d2eab7975568", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9085, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "cancercuresroyalrife.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "cancercuresroyalrife", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "wine glass: the molecules of the glass are already oscillating at some harmonic (multiple) of that musical note; they are in resonance with it.

It took Rife many years until he discovered the frequencies which specifically destroyed herpes, polio, spinal meningitis, tetanus, influenza, and an immense number of other dangerous disease organisms. Rife also worked with the top scientists and doctors of his day, who also confirmed or endorsed various areas of his work. They included: [Arthur Kendall](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1658030/) (Director, Northwestern Medical School); Rufus Klein-Schmidt (President of USC); [E.C. Rosenow, Sr.](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/76/1965/192) (longtime Chief of Bacteriology, Mayo Clinic); [Dr. Milbank Johnson](http://www.dfe.net/Milbank_Johnson.html) (Director of the Southern California AMA); Whalen Morrison (Chief Surgeon, Santa Fe Railway); George Fischer (Childrens Hospital, N.Y.); Edward Kopps (Metabolic Clinic, La Jolla); and many others. On November 20, 1931, forty-four of the nation's most respected medical authorities honored Royal Rife with a banquet ... at the Pasadena estate of Dr. Milbank Johnson. **In 1934, the University of Southern California appointed a special medical research committee to bring terminal cancer patients from Pasadena County Hospital to Rife's San Diego Laboratory and clinic for treatment. The team included doctors and pathologists assigned to examine the patients - if still alive - in 90 days. ** **After the 90 days of treatment, the committee concluded that 86.5% of the patients had been completely cured. The treatment was then adjusted and the remaining 13.5% of the patients also responded within the next four weeks. The total recovery rate using Rife's technology was 100%.** **Suppression and Ridicule** ** But by 1939, almost all of these distinguished doctors and scientists were denying that they had ever met Rife. **What happened to make so many brilliant men have complete memory lapses? It seems that news of Rife's miracles with terminal patients had reached other ears. Remember our hypothetical question at the beginning of this report: What would happen if you discovered a potential cure for everything? You are now about to find out. At first, a token attempt was made to buy out Rife. **Morris Fishbein, who had acquired the entire stock of the American Medical Association [AMA] by 1934, sent an attorney to Rife with 'an offer you can't refuse.' Rife refused.** We may never know the exact terms of this offer. But we do know the terms of an offer Fishbein made to Harry Hoxsey for control of his herbal cancer remedy. Fishbein's associates would receive all profits for nine years and Hoxsey would receive nothing. Then, if they were satisfied that it worked, Hoxsey would receive 10% of the profits. Hoxsey decided that he would rather continue to make the profits himself. When Hoxsey turned Fishbein down, Fishbein used his", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:cancercuresroyalrife.txt:6:301fa9262d32", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9086, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "cancercuresroyalrife.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "cancercuresroyalrife", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "We may never know the exact terms of this offer.

Fishbein's associates would receive all profits for nine years and Hoxsey would receive nothing. Then, if they were satisfied that it worked, Hoxsey would receive 10% of the profits. Hoxsey decided that he would rather continue to make the profits himself. When Hoxsey turned Fishbein down, Fishbein used his immensely powerful political connections to have Hoxsey arrested 125 times in a period of 16 months. The charges (based on practice without a license) were always thrown out of court, but the harassment drove Hoxsey insane. [see article in *JAMA*, the journal of the AMA, [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/health/cancercures/cancer_cures_video#fishbein)] But Fishbein must have realized that this strategy would backfire with Rife. First, Rife could not be arrested like Hoxsey for practicing without a license. A trial on trumped-up charges would mean that testimony supporting Rife would be introduced by prominent medical authorities working with Rife. And the defense would undoubtedly take the opportunity to introduce evidence such as the 1934 medical study done with USC. **The last thing in the world that the pharmaceutical industry wanted was a public trial about a painless therapy that cured 100% of the terminal cancer patients and cost nothing to use but a little electricity. It might give people the idea that they didn't need drugs. ** And finally, Rife had spent decades accumulating meticulous evidence of his work, including film and stop-motion photographs. No, different tactics were needed. The first incident was the gradual pilfering of components, photographs, film, and written records from Rife's lab. The culprit was never caught. **Then, while Rife struggled to reproduce his missing data (in a day when photocopies and computers were not available), someone vandalized his precious virus microscopes. Pieces of the 5,682 piece Universal microscope were stolen. Earlier, an arson fire had destroyed the multi-million dollar [Burnett Lab](http://www.njpalisades.org/cn2001_03-04.htm) in New Jersey**, just as the scientists there were preparing to announce confirmation of Rife's work. But the final blow came later, when police illegally confiscated the remainder of Rife's 50 years of research. Then in 1939, agents of a family which controlled the drug industry assisted Philip Hoyland in a frivolous lawsuit against his own partners in the Beam Ray Corporation. This was the only company manufacturing Rife's frequency instruments (Rife was not a partner). Hoyland lost, but his assisted legal assault had the desired effect: the company was bankrupted by legal expenses. And during the Great Depression, this meant that commercial production of Rife's frequency instruments ceased completely. And remember what a universal cure meant to hospitals and research foundations? **Doctors who tried to defend Rife lost their foundations grants and hospital privileges. On the other hand, big money was spent ensuring that doctors who had seen Rife's", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:cancercuresroyalrife.txt:7:1d088a69064e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9087, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "cancercuresroyalrife.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "cancercuresroyalrife", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "instruments (Rife was not a partner).

On the other hand, big money was spent ensuring that doctors who had seen Rife's therapy would forget what they saw. Almost no price was too much to suppress it.** Remember that, today, treatment of a single cancer patient averages over $300,000. It's BIG business. Thus, Arthur Kendall, the Director of the Northwestern School of Medicine who worked with Rife on the cancer virus, accepted almost a quarter of a million dollars to suddenly 'retire' in Mexico. That was an exorbitant amount of money in the Depression. Dr. George Dock, another prominent figure who collaborated with Rife, was silenced with an enormous grant, along with the highest honors the AMA could bestow. Between the carrots and the sticks, everyone except Dr. Couche and Dr. Milbank Johnson gave up Rife's work and went back to prescribing drugs. **To finish the job, the medical journals, supported almost entirely by drug company revenues and controlled by the AMA, refused to publish any paper by anyone on Rife's therapy.** Therefore, an entire generation of medical students graduated into practice without ever once hearing of Rife's breakthroughs. The magnitude of this crime eclipses every mass murder in history. Cancer picks us off quietly. By 1960 the casualties from this tiny virus exceeded the carnage of all the wars America ever fought. In 1989, it was estimated that 40% of us will experience cancer at some time in our lives. In Rife's lifetime, he had witnessed the progress of civilization from horse-and-buggy travel to jet planes. In that same time, he saw the epidemic of cancer increase from 1 in 24 Americans in 1905 to 1 in 3 in 1971 when he died. He also witnessed the phenomenal growth of the American Cancer Society, the Salk Foundation, and many others collecting hundreds of millions of dollars for diseases that were cured long before in his own San Diego laboratories. In one period, 176,500 cancer drugs were submitted for approval. Any that showed 'favorable' results in only one-sixth of one percent of the cases being studied could be licensed. Some of these drugs had a mortality rate of 14-17%. When death came from the drug, not the cancer, the case was recorded as a 'complete' or 'partial remission' because the patient didn't actually die from the cancer. The inevitable conclusion reached by Rife was that his life-long labor and discoveries had not only been ignored, but probably would be buried with him. At that point, he ceased to produce much of anything", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:cancercuresroyalrife.txt:8:11f1d84cd871", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9088, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "cancercuresroyalrife.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "cancercuresroyalrife", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "the cases being studied could be licensed.

The inevitable conclusion reached by Rife was that his life-long labor and discoveries had not only been ignored, but probably would be buried with him. At that point, he ceased to produce much of anything and spent the last third of his life seeking oblivion in alcohol. It dulled the pain and his acute awareness of half a century of wasted effort - ignored - while the unnecessary suffering of millions continued so that a vested few might profit. And profit they did, and profit they do. In 1971, Royal Rife died from a combination of valium and alcohol at the age of 83. Perhaps his continual exposure to his own Rife frequencies helped his body endure abuse for so many years. **Modern Resurgence of Rife's Technology for Cancer Cures** Fortunately, his death was not the end of his electronic therapy. A few humanitarian doctors and engineers reconstructed his frequency instruments and kept his genius alive. **Rife technology became public knowledge again in 1986 with the publication of *[The Cancer Cure That Worked](http://www.amazon.com/Cancer-Cure-That-Worked-Suppression/dp/0919951309?tag=wanttinfo-20)*, by Barry Lynes, and other material about Royal Rife and his monumental work.** There is wide variation in the cost, design, and quality of the modern portable Rife frequency research instruments available. Costs vary from about $1200 to $3600 with price being no legitimate indicator of the technical competence in the design of the instrument or performance of the instrument. Some of the most expensive units have serious technical limitations and are essentially a waste of money. At the other extreme, some researchers do get crude results from inexpensive simple, unmodified frequency generators, but this is just as misguided as spending too much money. Without the proper modifications, the basic frequency generator gives only minimal and inconsistent results. Please recall that the actual destruction of the viruses and bacteria is not accomplished by the frequency displayed on these cheap generators, but by certain shorter harmonics of that particular frequency which are often blocked by the crudity of a cheap and rudimentary instrument itself. This very problem led Rife to ultimately abandon the 'ray tube' design in favor of today's version. The newer technology applies the frequencies and their harmonics to the body through the use of hand-held, footplate, or stick-on electrodes. Proper frequency exposure and flushing of the body with large amounts of clean, pure water is critical to achieve the kind of results Rife got. These procedures are fully explained in the manuals of the best units on the market. So, unless you would be satisfied with sporadic results for minor conditions, it is suggested you use only the highest quality", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:cancercuresroyalrife.txt:9:4a90fa4620b8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9089, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "cancercuresroyalrife.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "cancercuresroyalrife", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "technology applies the frequencies and their harmonics to the body through the use of hand-held, footplate, or stick-on electrodes.

While perfectly legal for veterinarians to use to save the lives of animals, Rife's brilliant frequency therapy remains taboo to orthodox mainstream medicine because of the continuing threat it poses to the international pharmaceutical medical monopoly that controls the lives - and deaths - of the vast majority of the people on this planet. ** More Information on Royal Rife, Cancer Cures, and Health Cover-up ** [http://www.rense.com/health/rife.htm](http://www.rense.com/health/rife.htm) - Link to the above article on Jeff Rense's website.

The bill can then be paid later. The system is also designed to curb identity theft and prevent fraudulent access to credit card accounts that is increasingly common in crowded restaurants and clubs. Clubbers who want to join the scheme at Baja Beach Club in Barcelona pay 125 euros (about US $150) for the VeriChip -- about the size of a grain of rice -- to be implanted in their body. Then when they pass through a scanner the chip is activated and it emits a signal containing the individual's number, which is then transmitted to a secure data storage site. The club's director, Conrad Chase, said he began using the VeriChip, made by Applied Digital Solutions, in March 2004 because he needed something similar to a VIP card and wanted to provide his customers with better service. \"I believe we should use new technology to provide our customers with the best service and entertainment,\" Chase told CNN. He said 10 of the club's regular customers, including himself, have been implanted with the chip, and predicted more would follow. \"I know many people who want to be implanted,\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:cbscnnimplants.txt:0:6320a2819794", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9095, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "cbscnnimplants.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "cbscnnimplants", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "began using the VeriChip, made by Applied Digital Solutions, in March 2004 because he needed something similar to a VIP card and wanted to provide his customers with better service. \"I believe we should use new technology to provide our customers with the best service and entertainment,\" Chase told CNN. He said 10 of the club's regular customers, including himself, have been implanted with the chip, and predicted more would follow. \"I know many people who want to be implanted,\" said Chase. \"Almost everybody now has a piercing, tattoos or silicone. Why not get the chip and be original?\" In the wake of the Madrid train bombings that killed 190 people in March, Chase said VeriChip could also boost security by speeding up checks at airports, for example. He denied the scheme had any drawbacks. The VeriChip is an in-house debit card and contains no personal information. It is made of glass so poses no health risk, Chase said. But Dr. Arun Patel, a general physician in Los Angeles, warned that placing an electronic device inside the body could be problematic. \"From a medical standpoint, obviously you worry about radiation with any electronic device,\" Patel said. (The following article by Associated Press is posted on the CBS news website) [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/07/17/tech/main563819.shtml](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/07/17/tech/main563819.shtml) **A Real Chip On Your Shoulder** **MEXICO CITY, July 17, 2003** **(AP) **Borrowing from an idea that allows pet owners to track their dogs and cats, **a U.S. company launched Thursday in Mexico the sale of microchips that can be implanted under a person's skin and used to confirm everything from health history to identity. ** The microchips, which went on sale last year in the United States, could tap into a growing industry surrounding Mexico's crime concerns. Kidnappings, robberies and fraud are common here, and Mexicans are constantly looking for ways to stay ahead of criminals. The microchip, the size of a grain of rice, is implanted in the arm or hip and can contain information on everything from a person's blood type to their name. Hospital officials and security guards can use a scanning device to read the chip's information. In a two-hour presentation, Palm Beach, Florida-based Applied Digital Solutions Inc. introduced reporters to the VeriChip and used a syringe-like device and local anesthetic to implant a sample in the right arm of employee Carlos Altamirano. \"It doesn't hurt at all,\" he said. \"The whole process is just painless.\" Another chip user, Luis Valdez, who is diabetic, said the chip is \"as innovative to me as the cell phone.\" Antonio Aceves, the director of the Mexican company charged with distributing the chip here, said that in the first year of sales, the company hoped to implant chips in 10,000 people and ensure that at least 70 percent of all hospitals had the technology to read the devices.

Similar technology has been used on dogs and cats as a way to identify the pets if they are lost or stolen. The VeriChip can track subjects who are within 5 miles, but officials want to develop a new chip that can use satellite technology to track people who are farther away and may have been kidnapped. While the idea of using the chip to track people has raised privacy concerns in the United States, the idea has been popular with Mexicans, who have been contacting Aceves and asking when the new global positioning chip will be available. The company hopes to have the new anti-kidnapping chip developed by 2003. **What you can do:** Explore more reliable information on microchip implants and much more in our comprehensive Mind Control Information Center at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrolinformation).

Neocons' plans for global domination top the annual list of stories ignored or downplayed by the mainstream media.** By Camille T. Taiara for the *Bay Guardian* IF THERE'S ONE influence that has shaped worldwide political events over the past year, it's the extent to which the Bush administration has exploited the events of Sept. 11, 2001, to solidify its military and economic control of the world at the expense of democracy, true justice, and the environment. But George W. Bush hasn't simply been responding to world events. The agenda his administration has followed fits perfectly with a clearly defined plan that's been in place for more than a decade. The neoconservative blueprint for United States military domination is hardly a secret. A group called the Project for a New American Century, a think tank founded by hawks who are now in prominent jobs in the White House - released a version of it three years ago--before 9/11. The document is shocking in its candor: it asserts that the United States should be moving unilaterally to assert military control around the globe, and that all that's necessary to jump-start the effort is a \"new Pearl Harbor.\" Yet none of the major news media in this country have reported on this document or on the fact that Bush is so closely following its script. [click [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20030210081543/http://www.newamericancentury.org/publicationsreports.htm) to see the full report titled *Rebuilding America's Defences*, written by the Bush team before the 2000 election, also mentioned on our 9/11 timeline] That's the biggest \"censored\" story in the nation last year, according to Sonoma State University's Project Censored, a 27-year-old program dedicated to shining some light on the shortcomings of the major news media. Researchers at Sonoma State meticulously combed through news reports from 2002 and the first quarter of 2003 to find stories that didn't get the media attention they deserved. This year's big stories include the attack on civil liberties at home, Donald Rumsfeld's plan to provoke terrorists, and treaty-busting by the United States. In many cases, these stories got little or no play or else were presented piecemeal, without any attempt to put the information in context. \"The stories this year", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:censored2003.txt:0:7ee039915874", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9098, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "censored2003.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "censored2003", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Researchers at Sonoma State meticulously combed through news reports from 2002 and the first quarter of 2003 to find stories that didn't get the media attention they deserved.

In many cases, these stories got little or no play or else were presented piecemeal, without any attempt to put the information in context. \"The stories this year reflect a clear danger to democracy and governmental transparency in the U.S. - and the corporate media's failure to alert the public to these important issues,\" Project Censored director Prof. Peter Phillips told the *Bay Guardian*. What follows is the *Bay Guardian*'s rundown of Project Censored's top 10 censored or underreported stories for last year: **1. The neoconservative plan for global dominance**** ** \"Terror: A question of when, not if,\" read the front-page headline of the Sept. 7, 2002, *San Francisco Chronicle*. Americans, it argued, will just have to get used to the fact that we're now engaged in a \"perpetual war.\" Later that day Bush went on TV to ask the nation for another $87 billion for the fight against terrorism. But the concept of \"perpetual war,\" and the military strategy that comes with it - of unilateralism, preemptive strikes, and a \"forward presence\" in key regions throughout the globe - is nothing new. The Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon simply provided the perfect rationale to implement existing plans. Back in the early 1990s, hawks in Bush Sr.'s administration--notably, then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, with the help of General Colin Powell and Paul Wolfowitz drew up a plan that was virtually identical to the National Security Strategy unveiled in September 2002. Their blueprint -was first spelled out in a classified internal policy statement in 1992 titled \"Defense Planning Guidance\" (later repeated in Cheney's \"Defense Strategy for the 1990s,\" formally released in January of 1993). It - called for the United States to assert its military superiority to prevent the emergence of a new superpower rival. It also called for the United States to diversify its military presence throughout the world, offered a policy of preemption, argued nuclear program while discouraging those of other countries, and foresaw the need for the United States to act alone, if need be, to protect its interests and those of its allies. Sound familiar? Yet the neocons knew they faced a hard sell as Bill Clinton took office. \"Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategy, Forces, and Resources,\" a report released by the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) in 2000, stated that the United States needed a catastrophe, \"a new Pearl Harbor,\" as the authors called it, to jump-start the neocons' blueprint for all-encompassing military and economic world dominance. (PNAC was founded by none other than Cheney, Wolfowitz, Richard", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:censored2003.txt:1:6a29e7760563", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9099, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "censored2003.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "censored2003", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "those of its allies. Sound familiar? Yet the neocons knew they faced a hard sell as Bill Clinton took office. \"Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategy, Forces, and Resources,\" a report released by the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) in 2000, stated that the United States needed a catastrophe, \"a new Pearl Harbor,\" as the authors called it, to jump-start the neocons' blueprint for all-encompassing military and economic world dominance. (PNAC was founded by none other than Cheney, Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, Donald Rumsfeld, and other former Reagan and Bush administration hawks.) Then came the attacks of Sept. 11--just nine months after the Bush administration took office. The events of that day provided the perfect excuse for Cheney and company to finally see their plans to fruition. Top on their list of targets was Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Within 24 hours of the planes hitting the World Trade Center and Pentagon--and without so much as an inkling of evidence as to who had carried out the attacks--Attorney General John Ashcroft was already calling for war on Iraq, according to a report by Bob Woodward in the *Washington Post*. Indeed, the neocons have had the Persian Gulf in their crosshairs for 30 years now. Ever since the oil crisis of 1976 and the Gulf states' nationalization of their petroleum industries in the years that preceded it, the United States began building up forces in the region - primarily in Saudi Arabia - and strengthening relationships with regional dictatorships. The reasons seem simple: the region holds two-thirds of the world's oil.

Homeland security threatens civil liberties** The year 2002 ought to be remembered as the year when Big Brother came of age. As the Pentagon waged unending war abroad in the name of battling terrorism, the Bush administration pursued a parallel, wholesale war on dissent at home, fusing foreign intelligence operations with domestic security. Agencies such as the FBI were granted sweeping powers to spy on U.S. citizens. Civil liberties took the greatest hit in the last 30 years, as the feds consistently slashed away at our basic constitutional rights--including the right to privacy, to any semblance of a fair trial in cases broadly defined as terrorism-related, and to the freedoms of speech, association, and assembly. The Bush administration undertook all this and much more by means of the USA PATRIOT Act, executive orders, and the newly created Department of Homeland Security. On Oct. 1, 2002, the government established the Northern Command, - a branch of the U.S. armed forces empowered to coordinate military \"assistance\" to domestic law enforcement agencies. That was just the latest in a push to allow the federal government to use the U.S. military against its own citizens in the event of mass civil unrest. (That trend wasn't without precedent:", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:censored2003.txt:2:3b83d0f407e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9100, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "censored2003.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "censored2003", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "more by means of the USA PATRIOT Act, executive orders, and the newly created Department of Homeland Security.

That was just the latest in a push to allow the federal government to use the U.S. military against its own citizens in the event of mass civil unrest. (That trend wasn't without precedent: an anonymous Justice Department official told the *Seattle Weekly*, in late December 1999, that the feds had deployed an elite U.S. Army strike force by the name of the Delta Force, to infiltrate the now-infamous anti-World Trade Organization demonstrations in that city weeks earlier.) Yet media coverage of these measures was piecemeal at best, - and failed to shed light on the sordid details and ominous repercussions that accompanied them. Frank Morales, *Global Outlook*, Winter 2003; Alex Jones, [www.rense.com](http://www.rense.com), 2/11/03 and Global *Outlook*, Vol. 4; Charles Lewis and Adam Mayle, Center for Public Integrity, 2/7/03. **3. U.S. illegally removes pages from Iraq U.N. report** Bush administration insiders often take extreme measures to protect their own, - including those who supplied Saddam Hussein's regime with weapons of mass destruction and training on how to use them. Even as Bush urged military action against Iraq for the country's failure to divulge details of its alleged chemical, biological, and nuclear arsenal, the U.S. government covertly removed 8,000 of the 11,800 pages of the weapons declaration the Iraqi government had submitted to the United Nations Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency. But the Iraqis released copies of the full report to key media outlets in Europe. It turns out that the missing pages may have contained damning details on 24 US-based corporations, various federal departments and nuclear weapons labs, and several high-ranking members of the Reagan and Bush administrations that, from 1983 until 1990, helped supply Hussein with botulinum toxins, anthrax, gas gangrene bacteria, the makings for nuclear weapons, and associated instruction. Among those implicated: Eastman Kodak, Dupont, Honeywell, Hewlett-Packard, Bechtel, the U.S. Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture, the Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia nuclear weapons labs, and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfield. Michael I. Niman, *The Humanist* and *ArtVoice*, March/April 2003. **4. Rumsfield's plan to provoke terrorists** Buried deep in one of its Sunday issues late last October, the *Los Angeles Times* published a story by military analyst William Arkin about a slew of secret armies the Pentagon had been creating around the world. One such force caught the eye of regular *CounterPunch* contributor Chris Floyd, who picked up on the tip and ran with it. \"According to a classified document prepared for Rumsfeld by his Defense Science Board, the new organization - the 'Proactive, Preemptive Operations Group (dubbed the \"Pee-Twos\")' - will carry out secret missions designed to 'stimulate", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:censored2003.txt:3:2d44f2b02848", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9101, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "censored2003.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "censored2003", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "Angeles Times* published a story by military analyst William Arkin about a slew of secret armies the Pentagon had been creating around the world.

In short, the alleged document seemed to show that the Pentagon was gearing up to actively instigate terrorist acts, despite the risk to innocent civilians. [[www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) has had this information on it's 9/11 timeline for over a year. See the original article at [Los Angeles Times, 10/27/02](https://www.WantToKnow.info/021027latimes)] Chris Floyd, *CounterPunch*, 11/1/02. **5. The effort to make unions disappear** What better way to make those pesky unions disappear than by branding them a threat to national security? That's precisely what the neocons in the White House and on Capitol Hill have been doing - in a blatant move to break some of the country's most powerful labor syndicates. And, so far, they've gotten away with it. Bush, - certainly not known as a stalwart of workers' rights, invoked his war on terrorism rhetoric in early October 2002 to force striking International Longshore and Warehouse Union dock workers in Oakland back on the job, thereby undermining the future of the ILWU's West Coast labor agreement. Then, when the Bush administration created the Department of Homeland Security, its Secretary Tom Ridge invoked similar reasoning to argue that the department's employees be exempted from civil service regulations governing pay scales, hiring and promotion practices, bans on discrimination, whistle-blower protections, and, - last but not least, -collective bargaining rights. Lee Sustar, *Z Magazine*, 9/20/02; David Bacon, *War Times*, October-November 2002; Anne-Marie Cusac, *The Progressive*, February 2003; Robert L. Borosage, *The American Prospect*, March 2003. **6. Closing access to information technology** All the stories that make up this year's Project Censored winners were gleaned from alternative and international media sources. Likewise, progressives quickly learned to seek out sources like CommonDreams.org, truthout.org, and the U.K. Independent's Web site for the real news on the latest war on Iraq. The Internet has functioned as the single most important medium for accessing these kinds of information. But if the big communications companies get their way, the Web could be compromised as a democratic source of alternative news and perspectives. Soon, what we get from the Web could be a carbon copy of what we already get from corporate TV, cable, radio, and newspapers. For several years now, businesses that provide access to the Web - cable, telephone, and (more recently) satellite companies - have been working to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:censored2003.txt:4:e092288f12bd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9102, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "censored2003.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "censored2003", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "most important medium for accessing these kinds of information. But if the big communications companies get their way, the Web could be compromised as a democratic source of alternative news and perspectives. Soon, what we get from the Web could be a carbon copy of what we already get from corporate TV, cable, radio, and newspapers. For several years now, businesses that provide access to the Web - cable, telephone, and (more recently) satellite companies - have been working to cash in on their control over distribution. Unlike the companies controlling the telephone lines (which by law must grant access to any company that wants to use them) the Federal Communications Commission opted, in spring 2002, to grant cable companies full control over who could use their cable networks--and under what terms. Cable companies can now manage the speed at which different sites pop up, block out any content they choose, and even deny sites and ISPs access to their lines altogether. Of course, the telephone companies have since been lobbying for the same exclusive rights over DSL. The telephone and cable lines are controlled by monopolies in most U.S. cities and towns. Comcast, now the world's largest cable company, exerts sole control over cable lines serving almost one third of U.S. households. Arthur Stamoulis, *Dollars and Sense*, September 2002. **7. Treaty busting by the United States.** Even as the Bush administration publicly demanded that terrorists be brought to justice and that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, and others dismantle their (in Iraq's case, alleged) nuclear weapons programs, it consistently worked to undermine hard-fought international agreements, - including numerous treaties and the international court system - meant to do just that. In fact, the United States has now \"either blatantly violated or gradually subverted\" at least nine multilateral treaties on which it is a signatory, Project Censored found. These include the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Commission, the Biological Weapons Convention, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the Treaty Banning Antipersonnel Mines, the U.N. Convention on Climate Change, and the Rome Statute of the ICC. Bush has also voted to authorize a U.S. military attack on the International Criminal Court in The Hague should the ICC dare try any American for war crimes. All these action have been taken in the name of national security. Yet, \"this unprecedented rejection of and rapid retreat from global treaties ... will render these treaties and conventions invalid without the support and participation of the world's foremost superpower,\" wrote Project Censored's authors.

U.S. and British forces continue use of depleted uranium weapons despite massive evidence of negative health effects.** Former Sergeant First Class Carol Picou will never be the same after serving in the first Gulf War. On the frontlines with a mobile medical unit, \"I noticed that all the bodies that were on the highways and tanks and all the armament that was damaged was burnt,\" the veteran nurse told *Hustler* magazine last spring. \"It was actually literally black, and I thought the Iraqi people were black-skinned. It amazed me that they were burnt that bad, - that we would have used some type of armament that would actually melt these people into their vehicles.\" Picou began experiencing serious health effects almost immediately. Back in the United States, her muscles were deteriorating. She permanently lost control of her bowels. She suffered from 104-degree fevers, and her skin would break open and bleed. Rather than take care of Picou, who had served in the armed forces since 1978, the Army medically discharged her against her wishes in 1995. \"More than 9,600 of the relatively young Operation Desert Storm veterans have died since serving in Iraq, a statistical anomaly\" wrote Dan Kapelovitz, the reporter who interviewed Picou. Of those still living, more than a third, - upward of 236,000, have filed Gulf War Syndrome-related claims with the Veteran's Administration. Research overwhelmingly suggests these ailments and deaths were caused by depleted uranium, a metal the military uses in much of its hardware that is so dense it can pierce through steel-armored tanks. But this radioactive material has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, according to renowned scientist Helen Caldicott. In Iraq incidences of cancer, childhood leukemia, and rare mutations in newborns have skyrocketed. A study conducted by the U.S. Army in 1990, at least six months before the first Gulf War, shows the U.S. government knew what the effects would be. Nonetheless, the Americans and Brits dropped anywhere between 300 to 800 tons of the stuff on Iraq over the four-day assault. They've done nothing to clean up the radioactive mess left behind. \"In effect, George Bush Sr. used weapons of mass destruction on his own people,\" Kapelovitz continued. But it didn't end there. The United States has since used depleted uranium weapons in Kosovo, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and again during its most recent assault on Iraq, - a fact that was reported in the European media but not widely in the United States.

In Afghanistan: poverty, women's rights, and civil disruption worse than ever.** Rather than allow the international community to supply sufficient security forces to safeguard Afghan citizens from brutal warlords--and thereby create the foundation necessary for democracy and reconstruction--the United States has instead financed and armed regional warlords in its effort to root out the last remaining al-Qaeda forces. As a result, by October 2002, a year after the U.S. embarked on its campaign to \"liberate\" that war-torn Central Asian country, private armies were estimated to be 700,000 strong. (The International Security Assistance Force, in contrast, consists of a scant 5,000 troops, only enough to provide meager protection for Kabul, Afghanistan's capital.) The practice has, in effect, strengthened the nation's endemic system of military feudalism. The heroin trade has skyrocketed to record highs. Life expectancy is a mere 46 years, with more than one in four children not making it to their fifth birthday. Only 10 percent of those children who survived had access to an education. In many regions the constraints placed on women's basic liberties have reverted to those imposed by the Taliban. Per capita average yearly income was only $280. And the basic infrastructure needed to reintroduce law and order, like a working justice system, banking institutions, a national army, remained a pipe dream. In short, thanks to American policies, Afghanis are more forsaken than ever. Yet, Afghanistan has once again dropped off the corporate media's radar, and with it, that of the American public.

Critics fear the program is just another bid by more powerful nations to exploit the continent's last remaining natural resources - at the expense of Africans themselves. First-world meddling has already wrought havoc on Africa. During the cold war, the United States alone injected $1.5 billion worth of weaponry and training into the continent, now the most war-torn in the world. From 1991 to 1995 the U.S. increased its military contributions to 50 out of Africa's 53 nations. Millions have died from war, displacement, disease, and starvation as a result. Meanwhile, structural adjustment programs force-fed to African nations by the IMF, World Bank, and G8 in the name of development have only resulted in the continent's foreign debt rising by a whopping 500 percent over the past 20 years. More of the same isn't likely to help.

The top 5% is now capturing an increasingly greater portion of the pie while the bottom 95% is clearly losing ground, resulting in the rapidly vanishing middle class. This trend is the product of legislative policies carefully crafted and lobbied for by corporations and the ultra-wealthy over the past 25 years. America's economic trends have a global footprint. Today, **the top 400 income earners in the U.S. make as much in a year as the entire population of the 20 poorest countries in Africa.** A series of reports released in 2003 by the UN warn that further increases in the imbalance in wealth throughout the world will have catastrophic effects if left unchecked, such as the collapse of the entire global economy. [#2: Ashcroft vs. the Human Rights Law that Holds Corporations Accountable](http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/2.html) **Attorney General John Ashcroft is seeking to strike down one of the world's oldest human rights laws**, the Alien Torts Claim Act (ATCA) which holds government leaders, corporations, and senior military officials liable for human rights abuses taking place in foreign countries. Organizations such as Human Rights Watch (HRW) vehemently oppose the removal of this law, as it is one of the few legal defenses victims of human rights violations can claim against powerful organizations such as governments or multinational corporations.

Organizations such as Human Rights Watch (HRW) vehemently oppose the removal of this law, as it is one of the few legal defenses victims of human rights violations can claim against powerful organizations such as governments or multinational corporations. By attempting to throw out this law, the Bush Administration is effectively opening the door for human rights abuses to continue under the veil of foreign relations diplomacy. [#3: Bush Administration Censors Science](http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/3.html) In Washington D.C. more than 60 of the nation's top scientists, including 20 Nobel laureates, medical experts, and former federal agency directors, issued a statement February 18, 2004 accusing the Bush Administration of deliberately distorting scientific results for political ends. They are calling for regulatory and legislative action to restore scientific integrity to federal policymaking. Under the current administration, **the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has blacklisted scientists who pose a threat to pro-business ideology**, and many unqualified scientists with close industry ties have been appointed to advisory boards. [#4: High Levels of Uranium Found in Troops and Civilians](http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/4.html) Civilian populations in Afghanistan and Iraq and occupying troops have been contaminated with astounding levels of radioactive uranium as a result of post-9/11 use of tons of uranium munitions by the U.S. **Four million pounds of radioactive uranium were dropped on Iraq in 2003 alone**. Most American weapons (missiles, smart bombs, bullets, tank shells, cruise missiles, etc.) contain high amounts of uranium that on detonation, release a radioactive dust. Once ingested, these subatomic particles slice through DNA. With a half-life of 4.5 billion years, it is a permanent contaminant distributed throughout the environment. Scientists from around the world testify to the huge increase in birth deformities and cancers wherever uranium munitions have been used. The effects of the U.S. deployment will be felt in all the neighboring countries in the Middle East and Asia, as well as in our returning troops. [#5: The Wholesale Giveaway of Our Natural Resources](http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/5.html) **The Bush Administration's environmental policies are destroying much of the environmental progress made over the past 30 years.** Between the \"Clean Skies Initiative,\" a recent policy that allows power plants to emit more than five times more mercury and twice as much sulfur dioxide, and the \"Healthy Forests Initiative,\" which allows the wholesale liquidation of ancient forests by corporate timber interests under the guise of fire prevention, resource extraction and pollution is occurring at unprecedented rates. [#6: The Sale of Electoral Politics](http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/6.html) **Conflicts of interest exist between the largest suppliers of electronic voting machines in the United States and key leaders in the Republican Party**. While the voting machines themselves present some technical issues, the political affiliations within the voting machine", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:censored2004.txt:1:ae7d6a25012b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9110, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "censored2004.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "censored2004", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "much sulfur dioxide, and the \"Healthy Forests Initiative,\" which allows the wholesale liquidation of ancient forests by corporate timber interests under the guise of fire prevention, resource extraction and pollution is occurring at unprecedented rates.

While the voting machines themselves present some technical issues, the political affiliations within the voting machine industry pose even more serious questions. The three major companies involved in implementing the new, often faulty, technology at voting stations throughout the country have strong ties to the Bush Administration, Republican leaders, and major defense contractors. [#7: Conservative Organization Drives Judicial Appointments](http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/7.html) **In 2001 George W. Bush eliminated the longstanding influence of the American Bar Association (ABA) in the evaluation of the prospective federal judges**. ABA's judicial ratings had long kept extremists from the right and left off the bench. In its place, Bush has been using the Federal Society for Law and Public Policy Studies--a national organization whose mission is to advance a conservative agenda by moving the country's legal system to the right. One of the most important issues in the country is the control of one of the three branches of government, the judiciary. While Presidents and Congress-members get elected every few years, judicial appointments are for life, Our courts deal with nearly every aspect of life; work conditions and wages, schools, civil rights, affirmative action, crime and punishment, abortion and the environment, amongst others. [#8: Cheney's Energy Task Force and The Energy Policy](http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/8.html) Cheney Energy Task Force documents turned over in the summer of 2003 by the Commerce Department as a result of the Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by Sierra Club and Judicial Watch contain maps of Iraqi oilfields, pipelines, refineries and terminals. The documents, dated March 2001, also contain plans of occupation and exploitation that predate September 11, confirming suspicions that the Bush Administration** energy policy is driving U.S. military strategy**. [#9: Widow Brings RICO Case Against U.S. government for 9/11](http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/9.html) Ellen Mariani became widowed when her husband Louis Neil Mariani perished in the collision between United Airlines flight 175 and the South Tower of the World Trade Center. In addition to her refusal of the government's million-dollar settlement offer, **Mrs. Mariani has filed a 62 page complaint in federal district court charging that President Bush and officials: (1) had adequate foreknowledge of 911, yet failed to warn the country or attempt to prevent it;** (2) have since been covering up the truth of that day; (3) have therefore abetted the murder of plaintiff's husband and violated the Constitution and multiple laws of the United States; and (4) are thus being sued under the Civil Racketeering, Influences, and Corrupt Organization (RICO) Act for Malfeasant conspiracy, obstruction of justice and wrongful death.

[#10: New Nuke Plants: Taxpayers Support, Industry Profits](http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/10.html) Senator Peter Domenici (R-NM), along with the Bush Administration, is looking to give the nuclear power industry a huge boost through the new Energy Policy Act. **The Domenici-sponsored bill will give nuclear power plants credits costing taxpayers an estimated 7.5 billion dollars, to build six new privately owned, for-profit reactors across the country.** Safety standards will be lowered and liability will be passed on to taxpayers. This is in addition to the $4 billion already provided for other nuclear energy programs. [#11: The Media Can Legally Lie](http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/11.html) **In 2003, a Florida Court of Appeals ruled that there are no written rules against distorting news in the media**. It agreed with an argument by Fox Television that, under the First Amendment, broadcasters have the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on public airwaves. Under the current ruling, it is up to the public to discover whether or not they are being lied to. [#12: The Destabilization of Haiti](http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/12.html) **On February 29, 2004, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was forced into exile by American military.** While U.S. officials were eventually forced to acknowledge the kidnapping allegations, they were quick to discredit them and deny responsibility. Meanwhile, the circumstances that led to the current situation in Haiti, as well as the history of U.S. involvement, are being ignored by U.S. officials and the mainstream media.

But experts dismissed its worth, and warned it could be dangerous. Now researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina have shown an extract may shrink some tumours. Chaparral tea was widely used in the US as an alternative anti-cancer agent from the late 1950s to the 1970s. However, the American Cancer Society said there was no proof that it was an effective treatment for cancer - or any other disease. And the US Food and Drug Administration warned against its use after research showed it could damage the liver and the kidneys. However, initial results from the latest study show that an extract of the shrub appears not only to be safe, but to have a positive effect. The researchers tested a refined extract taken from chaparral called M4N. They injected it into the tumours of eight patients with advanced head and neck cancer that had not responded to other forms of treatment. The trial was primarily designed to test whether the extract was safe. The results were encouraging - patients seemed to tolerate it well, and there was no evidence of the serious liver damage previously associated with chaparral use. However, the study also produced some evidence that the extract had begun to shrink the tumours. The researchers now plan a larger study aimed at showing whether the drug really does work. **Trials important** Henry Scowcroft, science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: \"Chaparral does not have a good track record as an anti-cancer treatment, but this finding is interesting and suggests that the active ingredients of the plant should be investigated further. \"Plants are an extremely useful source of anticancer drugs. For example the drugs vinblastine and vincristine from the periwinkle plant are used to treat many different cancers. \"And Taxol, which is obtained from the bark of yew trees, is used to treat ovarian and breast cancer. \"It is extremely important to test plant extracts thoroughly before they are routinely used in people, to make sure they have no harmful side effects. \"This is why clinical trials of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:chaparralforcancer.txt:0:3d7ca539206b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9116, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "chaparralforcancer.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "chaparralforcancer", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "investigated further. \"Plants are an extremely useful source of anticancer drugs.

But because patients usually do not realise they have cancer until it has spread, it is very hard to treat.

May we all have the courage to open to love in the times of greatest fear. Here is what she wrote: Hi, Fred! I wanted to let you know I very much enjoyed the story about Gertrude [from Transforming Our Relationship with Money]. I have a short one to relate to you in return that is included in the book *[The Courage for Peace](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1573241652/qid=1101589698/sr=1-5/ref=sr_1_5/002-0802337-2502456?tag=wanttinfo-20&v=glance&s=books)* by Louise Diamond. I have found that many people want to 'stand up for Peace' but are terribly afraid of physical retaliation if they do. When I was attending Peace demonstrations last year and this, I met many people who told me that they felt as I did but were absolutely scared to the bone to march for fear of repercussions at home, work, etc. The following story is for these folks: \"Charlotte was a Swiss woman who made the decision during World War II to work with the French Resistance. She was aware of the risks, realizing that capture would not only mean the end of her usefulness, but would most certainly involve being tortured for information, and, if she survived that, the inevitable transport to a concentration camp. \"Nonetheless, Charlotte persevered. She served the Resistance in various capacities for four years. Finally, she was caught. Jailed by the Gestapo, Charlotte awaited her interrogation with great trepidation. When she was escourted into the interrogation chamber, however, Charlotte found herself in a most improbable state. Her heart suddenly opened, and she began viewing her captors with great love! She felt a pure radiance shining through her to the men who would surely deal viciously with her. She said nothing, simply relaxing into that state of love. \"Inexplicably, whenever her would-be tormentors would begin to question her, something odd would happen. A phone call or summons would come that would call them away, or some other outside force would stop the interrogation before it could complete its course. Even when she was put on the train for the camps, the train didn't run. Charlotte, choosing to stay in a state of love rather than fear, even in the most violent of circumstances, thus escaped the worst of the harm that could have befallen her.\" Have a most wonderful Thanksgiving!

German, British, and French soldiers, already sick and tired of the senseless killing, disobeyed their superiors and fraternized with \"the enemy\" along two-thirds of the Western Front (a crime punishable by death in times of war). German troops held Christmas trees up out of the trenches with signs, \"Merry Christmas.\" \"You no shoot, we no shoot.\" Thousands of troops streamed across a no-man's land strewn with rotting corpses. They sang Christmas carols, exchanged photographs of loved ones back home, shared rations, played football, even roasted some pigs. **Soldiers embraced men they had been trying to kill a few short hours before. They agreed to warn each other if the top brass forced them to fire their weapons, and to aim high.** A shudder ran through the high command on either side. Here was disaster in the making: soldiers declaring their brotherhood with each other and refusing to fight. Generals on both sides declared this spontaneous peacemaking to be treasonous and subject to court martial. By March 1915 the fraternization movement had been eradicated and the killing machine put back in full operation. By the time of the armistice in 1918, fifteen million would be slaughtered. Not many people have heard the story of the Christmas Truce. On Christmas Day, 1988, a story in the *Boston Globe* mentioned that a local FM radio host played \"Christmas in the Trenches,\" a ballad about the Christmas Truce, several times and was startled by the effect. **The song became the most requested recording during the holidays in Boston on several FM stations.** \"Even more startling than the number of requests I get is the reaction to the ballad afterward by callers who hadn't heard it before,\" said the radio host. \"They telephone me deeply moved, sometimes in tears, asking, 'What the hell did I just hear?' \" You can probably guess why the callers were in tears. The Christmas Truce story goes against most of what we have been taught about people. It gives us a glimpse of the world as we wish it could be and says, \"This really happened once.\" It reminds us of those thoughts we keep hidden away, out of range of the TV and newspaper stories that tell us how trivial and mean human life is. It is like hearing that our deepest wishes really are true: the world really could be different. **Christmas in The Trenches - Song ** **To listen to this inspirational Christmas story in song: [click here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/audio/christmas_truce_in_the_trenches)** Words & Music by John McCutcheon, c. 1984, [John McCutcheon / Appalsong](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=John+McCutcheon&crid=1U76GYQ9TLI0M) **This song is based on a [true story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce) from the front lines of World War I that I've heard many times.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:christmastruce.txt:0:5080909c7a05", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9121, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "christmastruce.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "christmastruce", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "newspaper stories that tell us how trivial and mean human life is.

To Belgium and to Flanders, to Germany to here, I fought for King and country I love dear. 'Twas Christmas in the trenches, where the frost so bitter hung. The frozen fields of France were still, no Christmas song was sung. Our families back in England were toasting us that day, Their brave and glorious lads so far away. I was lying with my messmate on the cold and rocky ground, When across the lines of battle came a most peculiar sound. Says I, \"Now listen up, me boys!\" each soldier strained to hear, As one young German voice sang out so clear. \"He's singing bloody well, you know!\" my partner says to me. Soon, one by one, each German voice joined in harmony. The cannons rested silent, the gas clouds rolled no more, As Christmas brought us respite from the war. As soon as they were finished and a reverent pause was spent, \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\" struck up some lads from Kent. The next they sang was \"Stille Nacht,\" \"'Tis 'Silent Night,'\" says I, And in two tongues one song filled up that sky. \"There's someone coming towards us!\" the front line sentry cried. All sights were fixed on one lone figure trudging from their side. His truce flag, like a Christmas star, shone on that plain so bright, As he bravely strode unarmed into the night. Then one by one on either side walked into No Man's Land, With neither gun nor bayonet we met there hand to hand. We shared some secret brandy and wished each other well, And in a flare lit soccer game we gave 'em hell. We traded chocolates, cigarettes, and photographs from home. These sons and fathers far away from families of their own. Young Sanders played his squeezebox and they had a violin, This curious and unlikely band of men. Soon daylight stole upon us and France was France once more. With sad farewells we each began to settle back to war.

The *Washington Post *on October 18th had an article which included the following paragraph: From a podium on a wide granite landing on the memorial steps, former U.S. attorney general Ramsey Clark called for the impeachment of Bush for war crimes. Activists in the audience carried anti-Bush stickers and signs, and one of the most prominent banners on display was one declaring, \"The Bush regime engineered 9-11.\" [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40594-2004Oct17.html?sub=AR](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40594-2004Oct17.html?sub=AR) The fact that the 9/11 banner is even mentioned is another major breakthrough! We're seeing 9/11 in the news more frequently now. The below article in the *Los Angeles Times *yesterday, Oct. 20th, is another great example. Reporter Robert Scheer discusses a crucial 9/11 report completed by the CIA in June which top officials are refusing to release. \"The report found very senior-level officials responsible.\" We are reaching critical mass on this important issue. The media is being forced to report these matters if they want to maintain any credibility. Thanks to all of you for helping to spread this vital news far and wide!

Although the report by the inspector general's office of the CIA was completed in June, it has not been made available to the congressional intelligence committees that mandated the study almost two years ago. \"It is infuriating that a report which shows that high-level people were not doing their jobs in a satisfactory manner before 9/11 is being suppressed,\" an intelligence official who has read the report told me, adding that \"the report is potentially very embarrassing for the administration, because it makes it look like they weren't interested in terrorism before 9/11, or in holding people in the government responsible afterward.\" When I asked about the report, Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said she and committee Chairman Peter Hoekstra (R-Mich.) sent a letter 14 days ago asking for it to be delivered. \"We believe that the CIA has been told not to distribute the report,\" she said. \"We are very concerned.\" According to the intelligence official, who spoke to me on condition of anonymity, release of the report, which represents an exhaustive 17-month investigation by an 11-member team within the agency, has been \"stalled.\" First by acting CIA Director John McLaughlin and now by Porter J. Goss, the former Republican House member (and chairman of the Intelligence Committee) who recently was appointed CIA chief by President Bush. The official stressed that the report was more blunt and more specific", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:cia911secret.txt:0:67b4d7217e34", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9124, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "cia911secret.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "cia911secret", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "very concerned.\" According to the intelligence official, who spoke to me on condition of anonymity, release of the report, which represents an exhaustive 17-month investigation by an 11-member team within the agency, has been \"stalled.\" First by acting CIA Director John McLaughlin and now by Porter J. Goss, the former Republican House member (and chairman of the Intelligence Committee) who recently was appointed CIA chief by President Bush. The official stressed that the report was more blunt and more specific than the earlier bipartisan reports produced by the Bush-appointed Sept. 11 commission and Congress. \"What all the other reports on 9/11 did not do is point the finger at individuals, and give the how and what of their responsibility. This report does that,\" said the intelligence official. \"The report found very senior-level officials responsible.\" By law, the only legitimate reason the CIA director has for holding back such a report is national security. Yet neither Goss nor McLaughlin has invoked national security as an explanation for not delivering the report to Congress. \"It surely does not involve issues of national security,\" said the intelligence official. \"The agency directorate is basically sitting on the report until after the election,\" the official continued. \"No previous director of CIA has ever tried to stop the inspector general from releasing a report to the Congress, in this case a report requested by Congress.\" None of this should surprise us given the Bush administration's great determination since 9/11 to resist any serious investigation into how the security of this nation was so easily breached. In Bush's much ballyhooed war on terror, ignorance has been bliss. The president fought against the creation of the Sept. 11 commission, for example, agreeing only after enormous political pressure was applied by a grass-roots movement led by the families of those slain. And then Bush refused to testify to the commission under oath, or on the record. Instead he deigned only to chat with the commission members, with Vice President Dick Cheney present, in a White House meeting in which commission members were not allowed to take notes. All in all, strange behavior for a man who seeks reelection to the top office in the land based on his handling of the so-called war on terror. In September, the New York Times reported that several family members met with Goss privately to demand the release of the CIA inspector general's report. \"Three thousand people were killed on 9/11, and no one has been held accountable,\" 9/11 widow Kristen Breitweiser told the paper. The failure to furnish the report to Congress, said Harman, \"fuels the perception that no one is being held accountable.

By TIM WEINER** Published: March 10, 1999 Sidney Gottlieb, who presided over the Central Intelligence Agency's cold-war efforts to control the human mind and provided the agency poisons to kill Fidel Castro, died on Sunday in Washington, Va. He was 80 and had spent his later years caring for dying patients, trying to run a commune, folk dancing, consciousness-raising and fighting lawsuits from survivors of his secret tests. Friends and enemies alike say Mr. Gottlieb was a kind of genius, striving to explore the frontiers of the human mind for his country, while searching for religious and spiritual meaning in his life. But he will always be remembered as the Government chemist who dosed Americans with psychedelics in the name of national security, the man who brought LSD to the C.I.A. In the 1950's and early 1960's, the agency gave mind-altering drugs to hundreds of unsuspecting Americans in an effort to explore the possibilities of controlling human consciousness. Many of the human guinea pigs were mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts and prostitutes -- ''people who could not fight back,'' as one agency officer put it. In one case, a mental patient in Kentucky was dosed with LSD continuously for 174 days. Other experiments involved agency employees, military officers and college students, who had varying degrees of knowledge about the tests. In all, the agency conducted 149 separate mind-control experiments, and as many as 25 involved unwitting subjects. First-hand testimony, fragmentary Government documents and court records show that at least one participant died, others went mad, and still others suffered psychological damage after participating in the project, known as MK Ultra. The experiments were useless, Mr. Gottlieb concluded in 1972, shortly before he retired. The C.I.A. awarded Mr. Gottlieb the Distinguished Intelligence Medal and deliberately destroyed most of the MKUltra records in 1973. John Gittinger, a C.I.A. psychologist who vetted Mr. Gottlieb -- ''one of the most brilliant men I've ever known'' -- and worked with him for 22 years, said the agency began the tests because it was gripped by ''a great fear'' in the cold war. It was afraid that the Soviet Union would corner the market on LSD and use it as a chemical weapon or that China would perfect the black art of brainwashing, Mr. Gittinger said. The agency and Mr. Gottlieb believed the United States had to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ciamindcontrolsidneygottliebobituary.txt:0:90673d520df9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9130, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ciamindcontrolsidneygottliebobituary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ciamindcontrolsidneygottliebobituary", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "-- ''one of the most brilliant men I've ever known'' -- and worked with him for 22 years, said the agency began the tests because it was gripped by ''a great fear'' in the cold war. It was afraid that the Soviet Union would corner the market on LSD and use it as a chemical weapon or that China would perfect the black art of brainwashing, Mr. Gittinger said. The agency and Mr. Gottlieb believed the United States had to fight by any means necessary. ''We were in a World War II mode,'' Mr. Gittinger said. ''The war never really ended for us.'' John Marks, author of the definitive book on the experiments, ''The Search for the 'Manchurian Candidate' '' (Times Books, 1979) said Mr. Gottlieb was ''unquestionably a patriot, a man of great ingenuity.'' ''Gottlieb never did what he did for inhumane reasons,'' Mr. Marks said. ''He thought he was doing exactly what was needed. And in the context of the time, who would argue? But with his experiments on unwitting subjects, he clearly violated the Nuremburg standards -- the standards under which, after World War II, we executed Nazi doctors for crimes against humanity.'' Sidney Gottlieb was born in New York City on Aug. 3, 1918, the son of immigrants from Hungary. His parents were orthodox Jews, but he did not embrace the faith. Mr. Gottlieb ''had had a real problem to find a spiritual focus, having gone away from Jewishness,'' Mr. Gittinger said, and he experimented with everything from agnosticism to Zen Buddhism all his life. He left the City College of New York, first for the Arkansas Polytechnic Institute, then for the University of Wisconsin, where he graduated, magna cum laude, with a chemistry degree in 1940. He earned a doctorate in biochemistry from the California Institute of Technology, where in 1942 he married Margaret Moore, the daughter of Presbyterian missionaries who served in India, where she was born. A clubfoot kept him from military service in World War II, and he was always bitter that he missed the war, Mr. Gittinger said. Mr. Gottlieb joined the C.I.A. in 1951, although not before telling Mr. Gittinger, his interviewer, that he had been a socialist in his youth. Two years later, the agency established MKUltra and Mr. Gottlieb was running it. As chief of the agency's technical services division, he served two decades as the senior scientist presiding over some of the C.I.A.'s darkest secrets. The first of these were the LSD experiments. Mr. Gottlieb was fascinated by the drug, and, a family friend said, he took it hundreds of times. ''He was the most curious man I ever knew,'' Mr. Gittinger said. ''He was willing to try anything to discover something.'' Mr. Gottlieb was also involved in the C.I.A.'s assassination plots.

In the Eisenhower and Kennedy Administrations, Mr. Gottlieb, always under orders from the Director of Central Intelligence or his chief spymaster, developed a poison handkerchief to kill an Iraqi colonel, an array of toxic gifts to be delivered to Fidel Castro, and a poison dart to kill a leftist leader in the Congo. None of the plans succeeded. After he left the C.I.A., Mr. Gottlieb and his wife went to India, where he ran a leper hospital for 18 months. A lifelong stutterer, he pursued a master's degree in speech therapy. He bought land with an old log cabin outside a small Virginia town, Boston, where he practiced two of his lifelong hobbies, folk dancing and herding goats. ''He bought that old house and the land with the idea of setting up a communal home, with several families living together,'' said Mr. Gittinger, a lifelong friend. At least one other couple stayed for years. Mr. Gottlieb spent his last years in Washington, Va., a pretty village in the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountains, working in a hospice, tending to the dying. He is survived by his wife and four children, Penny Gottlieb Chesluk, Rachel Gottlieb Samoff, Peter Gottlieb and Steven Gottlieb. Cleaving to old habits of secrecy, his wife declined to disclose the cause of Mr. Gottlieb's death. **Special Note:** For lots more reliable, verifiable information suggesting a major cover-up of government mind control programs, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol).

Ruppert now has 35 members of the US congress subscribing to his penetrating newsletter.

It is all part and parcel of a plan to bring down Bush and the Neocons and to replace them with the next set of leaders who are in alignment with the plans of the CIA and leading families of the country. There are numerous, clear indicators pointing to this, which are mentioned in the article below. Based on my own sources and observations, I've seen for about a year now a plan to take down Bush and associates, and to use them as the scapegoats for all the troubles that have and will boil to the surface. By placing the blame for everything on Bush and friends, the ruling elite can continue to run its global plans unfettered. Remember that Kerry is from the same Skull & Bones secret society as Bush. In fact, Kerry's beautiful wife, Teresa Heinz, married into one of the ruling families of this country (Heinz 57). Kerry, by the way, is Teresa's third husband. Her first husband, John Heinz, also came from the infamous Skull & Bones society, which only accepts 15 new members each year. Quite a coincidence to have two husbands from this most distinguished secret society! (see Boston Globe and MSNBC articles confirming this:[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4500423](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4500423); [http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/kerry/articles/2004/04/13/bush_bones_connected_to_kerry_bones/](http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/kerry/articles/2004/04/13/bush_bones_connected_to_kerry_bones/)) I concur with the below article that Bush is certainly going down. It is only a matter of when. The question is, how much will the truth come out, and how many secrets will the ruling families be able to bury with his demise. I and many others are committed to revealing all of these secrets no matter what happens to Bush. By revealing the dark underbelly of this political/economic machine, I firmly believe we can build a critical mass of people who will demand a better world based on peace and cooperation.

Ruppert with additional reporting by Wayne Madsen from Washington JUNE 8, 2004 1600 PDT (FTW) - Why did DCI George Tenet suddenly resign on June 3rd, only to be followed a day later by James Pavitt, the CIA's Deputy Director of Operations (DDO)? The real reasons, contrary to the saturation spin being put out by major news outlets, have nothing to do with Tenet's role as taking the fall for alleged 9/11 and Iraqi intelligence \"failures\" before the upcoming presidential election. Both resignations, perhaps soon to be followed by resignations from Colin Powell and his deputy Richard Armitage, are about the imminent and extremely messy demise of George W. Bush and his Neocon administration in a coup d'etat being executed by the CIA. The coup, in the planning for at least two years, has apparently become an urgent priority as a number of deepening crises threaten a global meltdown. Based upon recent developments, it appears that long-standing plans and preparations leading to indictments and impeachment of Bush, Cheney and even some senior cabinet members have been accelerated, possibly with the intent of removing or replacing the entire Bush regime prior to the Republican National Convention this August. FTW has been documenting this Watergate-like coup for more than fifteen months and almost everything we will discuss about recent events was by us predicted in detail in these pages. Please see our stories \"The Perfect Storm - Part I\" (March 2003); \"Blood in the Water\" (July 2003); \"Beyond Bush - Part I\" (July 2003); \"Waxman Ties Evidentiary Noose Around Rice and Cheney\" (July 2003); and \"Beyond Bush - Part II\" (October 2003). There were two things we didn't get right. One was the timing. We predicted the developments taking place now as likely to happen after the November election, not before. Secondly, we did not foresee the sudden resignations of Tenet and Pavitt. Understanding the resignations is the key to understanding a deteriorating world scene and that America is on the precipice of a presidential and constitutional crisis that will ultimately dwarf the removal of Richard Nixon in 1974.

So why did Tenet and Pavitt resign? We'll explain why and we will provide many clues along the way as we make our case. HIGH CRIMES AND REALLY STUPID MOVES Shortly after the \"surprise\" Tenet-Pavitt resignations, current and former senior members of the U.S. intelligence community and the Justice Department told journalist Wayne Madsen, a former Naval intelligence officer, that they were directly connected to the criminal investigation of a 2003 White House leak that openly exposed Valerie Plame as an undercover CIA officer. What received less attention was that the leak also destroyed a long-term CIA proprietary intelligence gathering operation which, as we will see, was of immense importance to US strategic interests at a critical moment. The leak was a vindictive retaliation for statements, reports and actions taken by Plame's husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, which had deeply embarrassed the Bush administration and exposed it to possible charges for impeachable offenses, including lying to the American people about an alleged (and totally unfounded) nuclear threat posed by Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Conservative columnist Robert Novak, the beneficiary of the leak, immediately published it on July 14, 2003 and Valerie Plame's career (at least the covert part) instantly ended. The actual damage caused by that leak has never been fully appreciated. Wilson deeply embarrassed almost every senior member of the Bush junta by proving to the world that they were consciously lying about one of their most important justifications for invading Iraq: namely, their claim to have had certain knowledge, based on \"good and reliable\" intelligence, that Hussein was on the brink of deploying a nuclear weapon, possibly inside the United States. It was eventually disclosed that the \"intelligence\" possessed by the administration was a set of poorly forged documents on letterhead from the government of Niger, which described attempts by Iraq to purchase yellowcake uranium for a nuclear weapons program. It has since been established by Scott Ritter and others that Iraq's nuclear weapons program had been dead in the water and non-functioning since the first Iraq war. Wilson was secretly dispatched in February 2002, on instructions from Dick Cheney to the CIA, to go to Niger and look for anything that might support the material in the documents. They had already been dismissed as forgeries by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the CIA, and apparently everyone else who had seen them. The CIA cautioned the administration, more than once, against using them. Shortly thereafter, Wilson returned and gave his", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ciaresignations.txt:2:04db294f78e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9135, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ciaresignations.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ciaresignations", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "water and non-functioning since the first Iraq war.

The CIA cautioned the administration, more than once, against using them. Shortly thereafter, Wilson returned and gave his report stating clearly that the allegations were pure bunk and unsupportable. In spite of this, unaware of the booby traps laid all around them, the entire power core of the Bush administration jumped on the Niger documents as on a battle horse and charged off into in a massive public relations blitz. Bush, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld, Powell, Wolfowitz and others - to varying degrees - insisted, testified, and swore that they knew, and had reliable, credible and verified intelligence that Saddam was about to deploy an actual nuclear device built from the Niger yellowcake. It was full court media press and they successfully scared the pants off of most Americans who believed that Saddam was going to nuke them any second. George Bush made the charge and actually cited the documents in his 2003 State-of-the-Union address, even after he had been cautioned by George Tenet not to rely on them. In a major speech at the United Nations, Colin Powell charged that Iraq was on the verge of deploying a nuke and had been trying to acquire uranium. Dick Cheney charged in several speeches that Saddam was capable of nuclear terror. And shortly before the invasion, when asked in a television interview whether there was sufficient proof and advance warning of the Iraqi nuclear threat, a smug and confident Condoleezza Rice quipped, \"If we wait for a smoking gun, that smoking gun may be a mushroom cloud over an American city.\" Rice was lying through her teeth. By July of 2003, as the Iraqi invasion was proving to be a protracted and ill-conceived debacle, executed in spite of massive resistance from within military, political, diplomatic and economic cadres, there was growing disgust within many government circles about the way the Bush administration was running things. The mention of Wilson's report came in July though his name was not disclosed. It suggested corroborative evidence of criminal, rather than stupid, behavior by the administration. The San Francisco Chronicle reported: A senior CIA official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the intelligence agency informed the White House on March 9, 2002 - 10 months before Bush's nationally televised speech - that an agency source who had traveled to Niger could not confirm European intelligence reports that Iraq was attempting to buy uranium from the West African country.

Note the reference to an Agency source. It was inevitable that Wilson would move from no comment, to statements given on condition of anonymity, and finally into the public spotlight. That he did, in a July 6th New York Times Editorial titled \"What I Didn't Find in Africa.\" Soon he was giving interviews everywhere. On July 14th Novak published the column outing Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame. As a result, any criminal investigation of the Plame leak will also go into the Niger documents and any crimes committed which are materially related to Plame's exposure. Instead of retreating, Wilson advanced. In September he went public, writing editorials and granting interviews which thoroughly exposed the Bush administration's criminal use of the documents, Cheney's lies about the mission, and all the other lies used to deceive the American people into war. At the moment he went on the record, Wilson became another legally admissible, corroborative evidentiary source; a witness available for subpoena and deposition, ready to give testimony to the high crimes and misdemeanors he has witnessed. First Clue: James Pavitt was Valerie Plame's boss. So was George Tenet. HOW THE TRAP WAS SET Conflicting news reports suggest that perhaps several sets of the documents were delivered simultaneously to several recipients. I could find only one news story (out of almost 60 I have reviewed) which indicated just when the Niger papers were first put into play. One of the most fundamental questions in journalism, \"when?\" was omitted from every major press organization's coverage except for a single story from the Associated Press on July 13th. [T]he forged Niger government documents, showing attempts by Iraq to purchase yellowcake, were delivered by unknown sources to Italian journalist Corriere della Sera who gave them to the Italian intelligence service. She then reportedly gave them to Italian intelligence agents who gave them to the US embassy. Seymour Hersh of the New Yorker also offered this version indicating that the documents had surfaced in Italy in the fall of 2001. The fall of 2001. That means that the documents were created no more than three and a half months after September 11th. The earliest press report mentioning the documents was a March 7, 2003 story in The Financial Times. On that day, Mohammed El Baradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency reported to the UN Security Council that the documents were forgeries. The story contained a revealing paragraph: \"The allegation about the uranium purchase first surfaced in a UK government dossier", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ciaresignations.txt:4:75bae67576ba", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9137, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ciaresignations.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ciaresignations", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "of 2001.

Niger was first named when the US State Department elaborated on the allegations on December 19 [2002]. Canada's Globe and Mail reported on March 8, 2003: [T]he forgeries were sold to an Italian intelligence agent by a con man some time ago and passed on to French authorities, but the scam was uncovered by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] only recently, according to United Nations sources familiar with the investigation. The documents were turned over to the IAEA several weeks ago. \"In fact, the IAEA says, there is no credible evidence that Iraq tried to import uranium ore from the Central African country in violation of UN resolutions. 'Based on thorough analysis, the IAEA has concluded, with the concurrence of outside experts, that these documents, which formed the basis for the reports of these uranium transactions between Iraq and Niger, are, in fact, not authentic,' Mr. El Baradei told the UN Security Council Friday.\" The Chicago Tribune reported on March 13, 2003, \"Forged documents that the United States used to build its case against Iraq were likely written by someone in Niger's embassy in Rome who hoped to make quick money, a source close to the United Nations investigation said. \"The Washington Post gave yet a different story, also on March 8, 2003: Knowledgeable sources familiar with the forgery investigation described the faked evidence as a series of letters between Iraqi agents and officials in the central African nation of Niger. The documents had been given to the U.N. inspectors by Britain and reviewed extensively by U.S. intelligence. The forgers had made relatively crude errors that eventually gave them away - including names and titles that did not match up with the individuals who held office at the time the letters were purportedly written, the officials said.\" The CIA, which had also obtained the documents, had questions about \"whether they were accurate,\" said one intelligence official, and it decided not to include them in its file on Iraq's program to procure weapons of mass destruction. In a follow-up story on March 13th the Post reported: \"It's something we're just beginning to look at,\" a senior law enforcement official said yesterday.

Officials are trying to determine whether the documents were forged to try to influence U.S. policy, or whether they may have been created as part of a disinformation campaign directed by a foreign intelligence service... The phony documents - a series of letters between Iraqi and Niger officials showing Iraq's interest in equipment that could be used to make nuclear weapons - came to British and U.S. intelligence officials from a third country. The identity of the third country could not be learned yesterday. What if it wasn't a foreign intelligence service? I had been suspicious that a Watergate-like coup was forming immediately after reading the first few stories about the documents. I was convinced when the AP reported on March 14, 2003 (just days before the Iraqi invasion) that the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee had called for an FBI investigation of the documents' origins. The Boston Globe reported two days later that the Senator was specifically seeking to determine whether administration officials had forged the documents themselves to marshal support for the invasion. The request was not nearly as significant to me as who it had come from - Jay Rockefeller of the Standard Oil Rockefellers. An oil dynasty was calling for an investigation of a bunch of oil men. Somebody was screwing up big time. Seymour Hersh dropped a major bombshell that went virtually unnoticed, 54 paragraphs deep into an October 27, 2003 story for the New Yorker titled \"The Stovepipe.\" \"Who produced the fake Niger papers? There is nothing approaching a consensus on this question within the intelligence community. There has been published speculation about the intelligence services of several different countries. One theory, favored by some journalists in Rome, is that [the Italian intelligence service] Sismi produced the false documents and passed them to Panorama for publication. \"Another explanation was provided by a former senior C.I.A. officer. He had begun talking to me about the Niger papers in March, when I first wrote about the forgery, and said, 'Somebody deliberately let something false get in there.' He became more forthcoming in subsequent months, eventually saying that a small group of disgruntled retired C.I.A. clandestine operators had banded together in the late summer of last year and drafted the fraudulent documents themselves.\" Hersh's revelation provided corroboration for something I and others, like the renowned political historian Peter Dale Scott, had been suspecting for a long time.

The CIA was fighting back. This was a well orchestrated, long-term covert operation - exactly what the CIA does all over the world. POINT OF NO RETURN Willing disclosure of the identity of a covert operative is a serious felony under Federal law, punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. The Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 makes it a crime for anyone with access to classified information to intentionally disclose information identifying a covert operative. The penalties get worse for doing it to a deep cover Direcorate of Operations (DO) case officer (as opposed to an undercover DEA Agent). After John Ashcroft was forced to recuse himself from the case, Patrick Fitzgerald, the U.S. Attorney in Chicago, was transferred to Washington and appointed special prosecutor in the Plame case. Robert Novak, rightly standing by the journalistic code of ethics, has steadfastly refused to identify his White House source. We would do the same thing in his shoes. The investigation is nearing a climax with pending issuance of criminal indictments. Press reports citing sources close to the investigation have directly and indirectly pointed fingers at Dick Cheney and his Chief of Staff, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, as suspects. Second clue: The criminal investigation of the Plame leak was investigated after a September 2003 formal request from the CIA, approved by George Tenet. Not only was Plame's cover blown, so was that of her cover company, Brewster, Jennings & Associates. With the public exposure of Plame, intelligence agencies all over the world started searching data bases for any references to her (TIME Magazine). Damage control was immediate, as the CIA asserted that her mission had been connected to weapons of mass destruction. However, it was not long before stories from the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal tied Brewster, Jennings & Associates to energy, oil and the Saudi-owned Arabian American Oil Company, or ARAMCO. Brewster Jennings had been a founder of Mobil Oil company, one of Aramco's principal founders. According to additional sources interviewed by Wayne Madsen, Brewster Jennigs was, in fact, a well-established CIA proprietary company, linked for many years to ARAMCO. The demise of Brewster Jennings was also guaranteed the moment Plame was outed. It takes years for Non-Official Covers or NOCs, as they are known, to become really effective. Over time, they become gradually more trusted; they work their way into deeper information access from more sensitive sources. NOCs are generally regarded in the community as among the best and most valuable of all CIA operations officers and the agency", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ciaresignations.txt:7:577079f04c30", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9140, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ciaresignations.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ciaresignations", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "well-established CIA proprietary company, linked for many years to ARAMCO. The demise of Brewster Jennings was also guaranteed the moment Plame was outed. It takes years for Non-Official Covers or NOCs, as they are known, to become really effective. Over time, they become gradually more trusted; they work their way into deeper information access from more sensitive sources. NOCs are generally regarded in the community as among the best and most valuable of all CIA operations officers and the agency goes to great lengths to protect them in what are frequently very risky missions. By definition, Valerie Plame was an NOC. Yet unlike all other NOCs who fear exposure and torture or death from hostile governments and individual targets who have been judged threats to the United States, she got done in by her own President, whom we also judge to be a domestic enemy of the United States. Moreover, as we will see below, Valerie Plame may have been one of the most important NOCs the CIA had in the current climate. Let's look at just how valuable she was. ARAMCO According to an April 29, 2002 report in Britain's Guardian, ARAMCO constitutes 12% of the world's total oil production; a figure which has certainly increased as other countries have progressed deeper into irreversible decline. ARAMCO is the largest oil group in the world, a state-owned Saudi company in partnership with four major US oil companies. One of them is ExxonMobil which gave up one of its board members, Condoleezza Rice, when she became the National Security Advisor to George Bush. All of ARAMCO's key decisions are made by the Saudi royal family while US oil expertise, personnel and technology keeps the cash coming in and the oil going out. ARAMCO operates, manages, and maintains virtually all Saudi oil fields - 25% of all the oil on the planet. It gets better. According to a New York Times report on March 8th of this year, ARAMCO is planning to make a 25% investment in a new and badly needed refinery to produce gasoline. The remaining 75% ownership of the refinery will go to the only nation that is quickly becoming America's major world competitor for ever-diminishing supplies of oil: China. Almost the entire Bush administration has an interest in ARAMCO. The Boston Globe reported that in 2001 ARAMCO had signed a $140 million multi-year contract with Halliburton, then chaired by Dick Cheney, to develop a new oil field. Halliburton does a lot of business in Saudi Arabia. Current estimates of Halliburton contracts or joint ventures in the country run into the tens of billions of dollars. So do the fortunes of some shady figures from the Bush family's past. As recently as 1991 ARAMCO had Khalid bin Mahfouz sitting on its Supreme Council or board of directors. Mahfouz, Saudi Arabia's former treasurer and the nation's largest banker, has been", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ciaresignations.txt:8:007d2eb9a89f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9141, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ciaresignations.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ciaresignations", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "by Dick Cheney, to develop a new oil field. Halliburton does a lot of business in Saudi Arabia. Current estimates of Halliburton contracts or joint ventures in the country run into the tens of billions of dollars. So do the fortunes of some shady figures from the Bush family's past. As recently as 1991 ARAMCO had Khalid bin Mahfouz sitting on its Supreme Council or board of directors. Mahfouz, Saudi Arabia's former treasurer and the nation's largest banker, has been reported in several places to be Osama bin Laden's brother in law. However, he has denied this and brought intense legal pressure to bear demanding retractions of these allegations. He has major partnership investments with the multi-billion dollar Binladin Group of companies and he is a former director of BCCI, the infamous criminal drug-money laundering bank which performed a number of very useful services for the CIA before its 1991 collapse under criminal investigation by a whole lot of countries. As Saudi Arabia's largest banker he handles the accounts of the royal family and - no doubt - ARAMCO, while at the same time he is a named defendant in a $1 trillion lawsuit filed by 9/11 victim families against the Saudi government and prominent Saudi officials who, the suit alleges, were complicit in the 9/11 attacks. Both BCCI and Mahfouz have historical connections to the Bush family dating back to the 1980s. Another bank (one of many) connected to Mahfouz - the InterMaritime Bank - bailed out a cash-starved Harken Energy in 1987 with $25 million. After the rejuvenated Harken got a no-bid oil lease in 1991, CEO George W. Bush promptly sold his shares in a pump-and-dump scheme and made a whole lot of money. Knowing all of this, there's really no good reason why the CIA should be too upset, is there? It was only a long-term proprietary and deep-cover NOC - well established and consistently producing \"take\" from ARAMCO (and who knows what else in Saudi Arabia). It was destroyed with a motive of personal vengeance (there may have been other motives) by someone inside the White House. From the CIA's point of view, at a time when Saudi Arabia is one of the three or four countries of highest interest to the US, the Plame operation was irreplaceable. Third clue: Tenet's resignation, which occurred at night, was the first \"evening resignation\" of a Cabinet-level official since October 1973 when Attorney General Elliott Richardson and his deputy, William Ruckelshaus, resigned in protest of Richard Nixon's firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. Many regard this as the watershed moment when the Nixon administration was doomed.

SAUDI ARABIA Given that energy is becoming the most important issue on the planet today, if you were the CIA, you might be a little pissed off at the Plame leak. But there may be justification to do more than be angry. Anger happens all the time in Washington. This is something else. One of the most important intelligence prizes today - especially after recent stories in major outlets like the New York Times reporting that Saudi oil production has peaked and gone into irreversible decline - would be to know of a certainty whether those reports are correct. The Saudis are denying it vehemently but they are being strongly refuted by an increasing amount of hard data. The truth remains unproven. But the mere possibility has set the world's financial markets on edge. Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi came to Washington on April 27th to put out the fires. It was imperative that he calm everybody's nerves as the markets were screaming, \"Say it ain't so!\" Naimi said emphatically that there was nothing to worry about concerning either Saudi reserves or ARAMCO's ability to increase production. There was plenty of oil and no need for concern. FTW covered and reported on that event. Writer and energy expert Julian Darley noted that there were some very important ears in the room, listening very closely. He also noted that Naimi's \"scientific\" data and promises of large future discoveries did not sit well many who are well versed in oil production and delivery. If anybody has the real data on Saudi fields, it is either ARAMCO or the highest levels of the Saudi royal family. The answer to the Saudi peak question will determine whether Saudi Arabia really can increase production quickly, as promised. If they can't, then the US economy is going to suffer bitterly, and it is certain that the Saudi monarchy will collapse into chaos. Then the nearby US military will occupy the oilfields and the U.S. will ultimately Balkanize the country by carving off the oil fields - which occupy only a small area near the East coast. That U.S. enclave would then provide sanctuary to the leading members of the royal family who will have agreed to keep their trillions invested in Wall Street so the US economy doesn't collapse.

Fourth clue: Bush and Cheney have both hired or consulted private criminal defense attorneys in anticipation of possible indictments of them and/or their top assistants in the Plame investigation. On June 3, just hours before Tenet suddenly resigned, President Bush consulted with and may have retained a criminal defense attorney to represent him in the Plame case. According to various press reports Bush has either retained or consulted with powerhouse attorney Jim Sharp, who represented Iran-contra figure retired Air Force Major General Richard Secord; Enron's Ken Lay; and Watergate co-conspirator Jeb Stuart Magruder. All three were facing criminal rather than civil charges. Either way, a clear signal has been sent that Bush expects to be either called to testify (which was a precursor in Watergate to a criminal indictment of Richard Nixon) or be named as a defendant. Either way, the President's men are falling faster than their counterparts fell in Watergate, and the initial targets are much higher up the food chain. Cheney's attorney is Terrence O'Donnell, a partner of the Williams and Connolly law firm. O'Donnell worked for then White House chief of staff Cheney in the Ford administration and as General Counsel for the Pentagon when Cheney was Defense Secretary under the first President Bush. He has been representing the Vice President in criminal and civil cases involving Cheney's chairmanship of Halliburton. These include a Justice Department investigation of Halliburton for alleged payment of bribes to Nigerian political leaders and a stockholders' fraud law suit against Halliburton. O'Donnell also represented former CIA director John Deutch when he was accused of violating national security by taking his CIA computer home and surfing the Internet while it contained hundreds of highly-classified intelligence documents. SPRINGING THE TRAP Now, seemingly all of a sudden, Bush and Cheney are in the crosshairs. Cheney has been questioned by Fitzgerald within the last week. The CIA Director's job by definition, whether others like it or not, is to be able to go to his President and advise him of the real scientific data on foreign resources (especially oil); to warn him of pending instability in a country closely linked to the US economy; and to tell him what to plan for and what to promise politically in his foreign policy. In light of her position in the CIA's relationship with Saudi Aramco, the outing of Valerie Plame made much of this impossible. In short, the Bush leak threatened National Security. This action by Bush is a rather stunning and extraordinary development. The President of the United States is potentially hiring a private criminal defense lawyer.

This action by Bush is a rather stunning and extraordinary development. The President of the United States is potentially hiring a private criminal defense lawyer. Unsurprisingly, the White House is doing all it can to bury the story, providing precious little detail or context for the President's action . But from what I have learned from those who have been quizzed by the Fitzgerald investigators it seems unlikely that they are interviewing the President merely as a matter of completeness, or in order to be able to defend their actions in front of the public. Asking a President to testify - or even be interviewed - remains a serious, sensitive and rare occasion. It is not done lightly. Doing so raises separation of powers concerns that continue to worry many. If so - and if the person revealed the leaker's identity to the President, or if the President decided he preferred not to know the leaker's identity - then this fact could conflict with Bush's remarkably broad public statements on the issue. He has said that he did not know of \"anybody in [his] administration who leaked classified information.\" He has also said that he wanted \"to know the truth\" about this leak. If Bush is called before the grand jury, it is likely because Fitzgerald believes that he knows much more about this leak than he has stated publicly. Perhaps Bush may have knowledge not only of the leaker, but also of efforts to make this issue go away - if indeed there have been any. It is remarkably easy to obstruct justice, and this matter has been under various phases of an investigation by the Justice Department since it was referred by the CIA last summer. On this subject, I spoke with an experienced former federal prosecutor who works in Washington, specializing in white collar criminal defense (but who does not know Sharp). That attorney told me that he is baffled by Bush's move - unless Bush has knowledge of the leak. \"It would not seem that the President needs to consult personal counsel, thereby preserving the attorney-client privilege, if he has no knowledge about the leak,\" he told me. What advice might Bush get from a private defense counsel? The lawyer I consulted opined that, \"If he does have knowledge about the leak and does not plan to disclose it, the only good legal advice would be to take the Fifth, rather than lie. The political fallout is a separate issue.\" I raised the issue of whether the President might be able to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ciaresignations.txt:12:a3f4d5a969ba", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9145, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ciaresignations.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ciaresignations", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "thereby preserving the attorney-client privilege, if he has no knowledge about the leak,\" he told me.

The lawyer I consulted opined that, \"If he does have knowledge about the leak and does not plan to disclose it, the only good legal advice would be to take the Fifth, rather than lie. The political fallout is a separate issue.\" I raised the issue of whether the President might be able to invoke executive privilege as to this information. But the attorney I consulted - who is well versed in this area of law - opined that \"Neither 'outing' Plame, nor covering for the perpetrators would seem to fall within the scope of any executive privilege that I am aware of.\" That may not stop Bush from trying to invoke executive privilege, however - or at least from talking to his attorney about the option. As I have discussed in one of my prior columns, Vice President Dick Cheney has tried to avoid invoking it in implausible circumstances - in the case that is now before the U.S .Supreme Court. Rather he claims he is beyond the need for the privilege, and simply cannot be sued. Suffice it to say that whatever the meaning of Bush's decision to talk with private counsel about the Valerie Plame leak, the matter has taken a more ominous turn with Bush's action. It has only become more portentous because now Dick Cheney has also hired a lawyer for himself, suggesting both men may have known more than they let on. Clearly, the investigation is heading toward a culmination of some sort. And it should be interesting. Last and final clue: Under Executive Privilege, a principle intended to protect the constitutional separation of powers, officials in the Executive Branch cannot give testimony in a legal case against a sitting President. The Bush administration has invoked or threatened to invoke the privilege several times. Dick did it over the secret records of his energy task force and George Bush tried to use it to prevent Condoleezza Rice from testifying before the \"Independent\" Commission investigating September 11th. Former officials of the Executive Branch are, however, free to testify if they are no longer holding a government office when subpoenaed or when the charges are brought.

The long-term (very corrupt and unethical) agenda of the Board, in the face of multiple worsening global crises, was intended to proceed far beyond the initially destructive war in Iraq, toward an effective reconstruction and a strategic response to Peak Oil. But the neocons have stalled at the ugly stage: killing hundreds of thousands of people; destroying Iraq's industrial and cultural infrastructure as their own bombs and other people's RPGs blow everything up; getting caught running torture camps; and making the whole world intensely dislike America. These jerks are doing real damage to their masters' interests. But (not surprisingly) Tenet and the CIA were and remain much better at covert operations and planning ahead than the Bush administration ever was. Tenet and Pavitt actually prepared and left a clear, irrefutable and incriminating paper trail which not only proves that they had shunned and refused to endorse the documents, the CIA also did not support the nuke charges and warned Bush not to use them. Where are those documents now? They're part of the Justice Department Plame investigation - and they're also in the hands of the Congressman who will most likely introduce and manage the articles of impeachment, if that becomes necessary: Henry Waxman (D), of California. If you would like to see how tightly the legal trap has been prepared, and how carefully the evidence has been laid out, I suggest taking a look around Waxman's web site at: [http://www.house.gov/waxman/](http://www.house.gov/waxman/). THE SWARM There are a multitude of signs that the Bush administration is being \"swarmed\" in what is becoming a feeding frenzy as opposition is surfacing from many places inside the government, including the military. The signs are not hard to find. The June 3rd issue of Capitol Hill Blue, the newspaper published for members of Congress, bore the headline \"Bush Knew About Leak of CIA Operative's Name\". That article virtually guaranteed that the Plame investigation had enough to pursue Bush criminally. The story's lead sentence described a criminal, prosecutable offense: \"Witnesses told a federal grand jury President George W. Bush knew about, and took no action to stop, the release of a covert CIA operative's name to a journalist in an attempt to discredit her husband, a critic of administration policy in Iraq.\" A day later, on June 4th Capitol Hill Blue took another hard shot at the administration. Titled \"Bush's Erratic Behavior Worries White House Aides\", the story's first four paragraphs say everything: \"President George W. Bush's increasingly erratic behavior and wide mood swings has the halls of the West Wing buzzing lately as aides privately express growing concern", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ciaresignations.txt:14:a4b57cd38fd2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9147, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ciaresignations.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ciaresignations", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "of a covert CIA operative's name to a journalist in an attempt to discredit her husband, a critic of administration policy in Iraq.\" A day later, on June 4th Capitol Hill Blue took another hard shot at the administration.

Bush's increasingly erratic behavior and wide mood swings has the halls of the West Wing buzzing lately as aides privately express growing concern over their leader's state of mind. \"In meetings with top aides and administration officials, the President goes from quoting the Bible in one breath to obscene tantrums against the media, Democrats and others that he classifies as 'enemies of the state.' Worried White House aides paint a portrait of a man on the edge, increasingly wary of those who disagree with him and paranoid of a public that no longer trusts his policies in Iraq or at home. \"'It reminds me of the Nixon days,' says a longtime GOP political consultant with contacts in the White House. 'Everybody is an enemy; everybody is out to get him. That's the mood over there.'\" The attacks have not stopped. On June 8th, the same paper followed with another story headlined, \"Lawyers Told Bush He Could Order Suspects Tortured\". Journalist Wayne Madsen, a Washington veteran with excellent access to many sources has indicated for this story that the Neocons have few remaining friends anywhere. All of this is consistent with a CIA-led coup. AHMED CHALABI Madsen reported that the Plame probe comes amid another high-level probe of Pentagon officials for leaking classified National Security Agency cryptologic information to Iran via Iraqi National Congress head Ahmed Chalabi. FBI agents have polygraphed and interviewed a number of civilian political appointees in the Pentagon in relation to the intelligence leak, said to have severely disrupted the National Security Agency's ability to listen in on encrypted Iranian diplomatic and intelligence communications. Chalabi's leak has once again forced Iran to change equipment, resulting in impaired U.S. intelligence gathering of Iran's sensitive communications. The probe into the Chalabi leak is centering on Pentagon officials who have been close to Chalabi, including Office of Net Assessment official Harold Rhode, Director of Policy and Plans officials Douglas Feith and William Luti, Undersecretary for Intelligence Stephen Cambone, and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz. In addition, some former Pentagon advisers are also targeted in the probe. Many press reports throughout 2003 indicated that Chalabi, distrusted and virtually discarded by the CIA, had been resurrected and inserted into the Iraqi political mix on the orders of Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz and the other Neocons listed above.

Madsen reported that lobbyists and political consultants in Washington are dusting off their copies of the Constitution and checking the line of presidential succession. One lobbyist said he will soon pay a call on Alaska Republican Senator Ted Stevens, who, as President pro tem of the Senate, is second in line to House Speaker Dennis Hastert to become President in the event Bush and Cheney both go. It is one of the greatest ironies of the Plame affair that the Bush administration, spawned and nurtured by oil, might have committed suicide by vindictively, cruelly and unthinkingly exacting personal retribution on an intelligence officer who had committed no offense, and who was, quite possibly, providing the administration with critical oil-related intelligence which the President needed to manage our shaky economy and affairs of state for a while longer to squeak through to re-election. In our opinion, nothing better epitomizes the true nature of the Neocons. That being said, they have to go.

Gen. John Ashcroft's announced desire for camps for U.S. citizens he deems to be \"enemy combatants\" has moved him from merely being a political embarrassment to being a constitutional menace. Ashcroft's plan, disclosed last week but little publicized, would allow him to order the indefinite incarceration of U.S. citizens and summarily strip them of their constitutional rights and access to the courts by declaring them enemy combatants. The proposed camp plan should trigger immediate congressional hearings and reconsideration of Ashcroft's fitness for this important office. Whereas Al Qaeda is a threat to the lives of our citizens, Ashcroft has become a clear and present threat to our liberties. The camp plan was forged at an optimistic time for Ashcroft's small inner circle, which has been carefully watching two test cases to see whether this vision could become a reality. The cases of Jose Padilla and Yaser Esam Hamdi will determine whether U.S. citizens can be held without charges and subject to the arbitrary and unchecked authority of the government. Hamdi has been held without charge even though the facts of his case are virtually identical to those in the case of John Walker Lindh. Both Hamdi and Lindh were captured in Afghanistan as foot soldiers in Taliban units. Yet Lindh was given a lawyer and a trial, while Hamdi rots in a floating Navy brig in Norfolk, Va. This week, the government refused to comply with a federal judge who ordered that he be given the underlying evidence justifying Hamdi's treatment. The Justice Department has insisted that the judge must simply accept its declaration and cannot interfere with the president's absolute authority in \"a time of war.\" In Padilla's case, Ashcroft initially claimed that the arrest stopped a plan to detonate a radioactive bomb in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:citizencamps.txt:0:e86754469819", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9150, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "citizencamps.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "citizencamps", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "a trial, while Hamdi rots in a floating Navy brig in Norfolk, Va.

The Justice Department has insisted that the judge must simply accept its declaration and cannot interfere with the president's absolute authority in \"a time of war.\" In Padilla's case, Ashcroft initially claimed that the arrest stopped a plan to detonate a radioactive bomb in New York or Washington, D.C. The administration later issued an embarrassing correction that there was no evidence Padilla was on such a mission. What is clear is that Padilla is an American citizen and was arrested in the United States--two facts that should trigger the full application of constitutional rights. Ashcroft hopes to use his self-made \"enemy combatant\" stamp for any citizen whom he deems to be part of a wider terrorist conspiracy. Perhaps because of his discredited claims of preventing radiological terrorism, aides have indicated that a \"high-level committee\" will recommend which citizens are to be stripped of their constitutional rights and sent to Ashcroft's new camps. Few would have imagined any attorney general seeking to reestablish such camps for citizens. Of course, Ashcroft is not considering camps on the order of the internment camps used to incarcerate Japanese American citizens in World War II. But he can be credited only with thinking smaller; we have learned from painful experience that unchecked authority, once tasted, easily becomes insatiable. We are only now getting a full vision of Ashcroft's America. Some of his predecessors dreamed of creating a great society or a nation unfettered by racism. Ashcroft seems to dream of a country secured from itself, neatly contained and controlled by his judgment of loyalty. For more than 200 years, security and liberty have been viewed as coexistent values. Ashcroft and his aides appear to view this relationship as lineal, where security must precede liberty. Since the nation will never be entirely safe from terrorism, liberty has become a mere rhetorical justification for increased security. Ashcroft is a catalyst for constitutional devolution, encouraging citizens to accept autocratic rule as their only way of avoiding massive terrorist attacks. His greatest problem has been preserving a level of panic and fear that would induce a free people to surrender the rights so dearly won by their ancestors. In \"A Man for All Seasons,\" Sir Thomas More was confronted by a young lawyer, Will Roper, who sought his daughter's hand. Roper proclaimed that he would cut down every law in England to get after the devil. More's response seems almost tailored for Ashcroft: \"And when the last law was down and the devil turned round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? ...

This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast ... and if you cut them down--and you are just the man to do it--do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?\" Every generation has had Ropers and Ashcrofts who view our laws and traditions as mere obstructions rather than protections in times of peril. But before we allow Ashcroft to denude our own constitutional landscape, we must take a stand and have the courage to say, \"Enough.\" Every generation has its test of principle in which people of good faith can no longer remain silent in the face of authoritarian ambition. If we cannot join together to fight the abomination of American camps, we have already lost what we are defending. *Jonathan Turley is a professor of constitutional law at George Washington University* ** ** ** ** -- To subscribe to or unsubscribe from the WantToKnow.info list (one email every few days): [https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe](https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe) -- ** **", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:citizencamps.txt:2:5a37778ede91", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9152, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "cnn.votingmachinesdemocracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "cnn.votingmachinesdemocracy", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Electronic Voting Machines: Risk to Democracy **Voting Machines Put U.S. Democracy at Risk CNN News Anchor Lou Dobbs Reporting** **\"Electronic voting machines are placing our democracy at risk.

Democrats are seeking to focus voter attention on President Bush's conduct of the war in Iraq, while Republicans are trying to convince voters that the president and all Republicans should be given credit for the conduct of the war on terror, and the fact that there has not been a terrorist attack on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001. And voters will also choose which party to support on a host of other issues, local and national: illegal immigration, border security, the state of the economy, the escalating cost of health care, failing public schools, record budget and trade deficits, and the declining standard of living for the middle class. Voters will be deciding whether the promise of challengers or the performance of incumbents merits their votes. The most recent polls reveal a national public mood that is now more supportive of a still unpopular president and about evenly divided over their preferences for, or tolerance of, congressional Republicans and Democrats. In other words, less than seven weeks before we go to the polls, there is every indication that the partisan quest for power on Capitol Hill will be close. But there is additional uncertainty about the outcome of our elections that is intolerable and inexcusable, and which could make the contested 2000 presidential election look orderly by comparison. As of right now, **there is little assurance your vote will count. As we've been reporting almost nightly on my broadcast for more than a year, electronic voting machines are placing our democracy at risk.** **Across the nation, eight out of every 10 voters will be casting their ballots this November on electronic voting machines.

Eight more states utilize a paper trail in their machines but don't require it, leaving 15 states with no mandated requirements for safeguarding your vote. But with no national law in place, our midterm elections are being threatened by a system lacking any real regulation and standards. The problems with electronic voting aren't necessarily new, yet we're still not ready for the midterms. **During the 2004 presidential election, one voting machine in a Columbus, Ohio, suburb reportedly added nearly 3,900 additional votes to Bush's total. Officials caught the machine's error because only 638 voters cast presidential ballots at that precinct, but in a heavily populated district, can we really be sure the votes will be counted correctly?** The May primary election in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, was nothing less than a complete debacle. A report from the Election Science Institute found the electronic voting machines' four sources of vote totals -- individual ballots, paper trail summary, election archives and memory cards -- didn't even match up. **The totals were all different, and the report concluded that relying on the current system for Cuyahoga County's more than 1.3 million people should be viewed as \"a calculated risk.\" Are we really willing to risk our democracy?** This problem is obviously not limited to Ohio. During Illinois' March primary, Cook County delayed the results of its crucial county board elections for a week as a result of human and mechanical problems at hundreds of sites with the new voting machines. The recent primary elections in Montgomery County, Maryland, also highlighted just how unprepared many polling places are for the midterms. The state election administrator is demanding to know what went wrong after election workers did not receive access cards to operate the Diebold voting machines for the county's 238 precincts on time, forcing as many as 12,000 voters to use provisional paper ballots that ran out quickly. Some were simply told to come back later and vote. There are four main manufacturers of electronic voting systems, none of which has been demonstrated to be more secure than the others. Diebold is the most well-known, but a new Princeton University study concerning Diebold's AccuVote-TS machine found that hackers can easily tamper with electronic voting machines by installing a virus to disable machines and change the vote totals. **Princeton researchers found that \"malicious software\" running on a single voting machine can steal votes with little, if any, risk of detection, and that anyone with access can install the software. **The study also suggests these machines are susceptible to voting-machine viruses.

Diebold says the unit used in the test was two generations old and to its knowledge is not used anywhere in the country. A 2005 Government Accountability Office report on electronic voting confirmed the worst fears of watchdog groups and election officials. That report said, \"There is evidence that some of these concerns have been realized and have caused problems with recent elections, resulting in the loss and miscount of votes.\" That is simply unacceptable. Congress and the White House need to immediately take steps to assure the integrity of electronic voting with paper trails that could be audited in any recount, or provisions must be made for paper ballots if the reliability of e-voting cannot be assured before November 7. When voters lose confidence in our elected representatives, we can vote the bums out. But what is the recourse if American voters lose confidence in our electoral system?

Fifteen years after the scientific embarrassment of the century, is this the beginning of something?** By Sharon Weinberger Sunday, November 21, 2004; Page W22 On a quiet Monday in late August -- a time of year when much of the Washington bureaucracy has gone to the beach -- a panel of scientists gathered at a Doubletree Hotel set between the Congressional Plaza strip mall and a drab concrete office building on Rockville Pike. They sat around a U-shaped table decked with laptops, with three government officials at the front, ready to hear about an idea that, if it worked, could change the world. The panel's charge was simple: to determine whether that idea had even a prayer of a chance at working. **The Department of Energy went to great lengths to cloak the meeting", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:coldfusion.txt:0:d2a0faa43da5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9160, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "coldfusion.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "coldfusion", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "a Doubletree Hotel set between the Congressional Plaza strip mall and a drab concrete office building on Rockville Pike.

The panel's charge was simple: to determine whether that idea had even a prayer of a chance at working. **The Department of Energy went to great lengths to cloak the meeting from public view. No announcement, no reporters. None of the names of the people attending that day was disclosed. The DOE made sure to inform the panel's members that they were to provide their conclusions individually rather than as a group, which under a loophole in federal law allowed the agency to close the meeting to the public.** At 9:30 a.m., six presenters were invited in and instructed to sit in a row of chairs along the wall. The group included a prominent MIT physicist, a Navy researcher and four other scientists from Russia, Italy and the United States. They had waited a long time for this opportunity and, one by one, stood up to speak about a scientific idea they had been pursuing for more than a decade. All the secrecy likely had little to do with national security and more to do with avoiding possible embarrassment to the agency. To some, the meeting would seem no less outrageous than if the DOE honchos had convened for a seance to raise the dead -- and in a way, they had: Fifteen years ago, the DOE held a very similar review of the very same idea. It was front-page news back in 1989. The subject was cold fusion, the claim that nuclear energy could be released at room temperature, using little more than a high school chemistry set. In one of the most infamous episodes of modern science, two chemists at the University of Utah announced at a news conference that they had harnessed the power of the sun in a test tube. It was, if true, the holy grail of energy: pollution-free, cheap and virtually unlimited. If it worked, cold fusion could supply the country's energy needs, with no more smog, no more nuclear waste, no more depending on other countries for oil. For a brief moment, an energy revolution seemed on the horizon. But when many laboratories tried and failed to reproduce the Utah results, scientists began to line up against cold fusion. Less than a year after the announcement, a DOE review found that none of the experiments had demonstrated convincing evidence of cold fusion. Almost as quickly as they had become famous, the scientists involved became the butt of comedians' jokes. A Time magazine millennium poll ranked cold fusion among the \"worst ideas\" of the century.

Almost as quickly as they had become famous, the scientists involved became the butt of comedians' jokes. A Time magazine millennium poll ranked cold fusion among the \"worst ideas\" of the century. But now, at the Doubletree in Rockville, it seemed all that could change. For the scientists who had risked ostracism to persist in studying cold fusion, the very fact that the Energy Department was reviewing their work this summer seemed like a breakthrough. True, according to two of the presenters who were there, the meeting began with harsh questions. But at 5 p.m., the presenters were ordered to leave the room, and when they returned, the mood had visibly lifted. At the end, the scientists presenting the idea and those reviewing it all shook hands. The reviewers stayed on to discuss the material. The cold fusionists went to a barbecue, feeling celebratory. No one had told them if the presentation had convinced anyone that cold fusion was real. But it was nice, they said, after so many years, just to be treated with respect. [SRI International chemist Michael] McKubre claims that when an experiment works, scientists can measure fleeting bursts of excess heat released in the process -- at times, up to 30 percent more energy comes out than went in. In some experiments, McKubre has detected byproducts, such as helium and tritium, that often accompany nuclear reactions. He says both phenomena are clear proof that fusion has occurred. **Since 1989, hundreds of scientists working in dozens of labs around the world have claimed similar results. Supporters point to the written literature -- more than 3,000 papers -- as proof of the effect. But the most credible cold fusion advocates concede that the vast majority of those papers are of poor quality; one *supporter *called the collection \"mixed toxic waste.\" ** Research money has dried up. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has refused to grant a patent on any invention claiming cold fusion. According to Esther Kepplinger, the deputy commissioner of patents, this is for the same reason it wouldn't give one for a perpetual motion machine: It doesn't work. These problems are all tied to the 1989 DOE review.

He made his mark designing the X-ray laser that was to be the centerpiece of Reagan's \"Star Wars\" anti-ballistic missile system. ** **Hagelstein describes the mainstream scientific community as \"mafias\" that promote and publish their friends' work, unwilling to accept new ideas. As Hagelstein explains it, leading physicists came out swiftly and prematurely against cold fusion. ** **Hagelstein says his acceptance of cold fusion was by no means immediate. \"Sometimes I was pretty sure that it was real, and sometimes I was convinced that it was all junk,\" he writes in an e-mail. It took several years before he was convinced. \"At this point, there are far too many results, of many different types, that constitute an argument that is very strong. There is no going back.\" ** As cold fusion research limped forward, Hagelstein faced a series of personal reverses. He has tenure at MIT, but he never made full professor. When his funding ran out, he eventually lost his lab space, his secretary, even his office. He has suffered from depression, which he attributes to his experience with cold fusion, but also downplays it. \"What's more important,\" he asks, \"me taking a little grief or if, by my actions, I could make a difference in the world?\" Hagelstein today remains the best-known name in the cold fusion community. And that's why in April 2003, he wrote directly to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham to request a new review. By November, the DOE had decided to do it, agreeing that after 15 years it was reasonable to review the progress of work in the field. The August review was limited to a single question, according to McKubre: Is the work surrounding cold fusion legitimate science? A positive answer -- even short of a ringing endorsement -- would finally lift the stigma, McKubre has said. It would also \"loosen the purse strings\" among potential funders. As of last month, the Department of Energy was saying that the review would be released by the end of the year. McKubre often speaks about a company in Israel, Energetics Technologies, that has received a couple of million dollars a year in private support to research cold fusion and has achieved \"startling results,\" producing much higher levels of power and heat than his own experiments. McKubre has visited the lab. \"It's the first", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:coldfusion.txt:3:161c27ebd5fd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9163, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "coldfusion.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "coldfusion", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "the purse strings\" among potential funders.

The field's acceptance, he maintains, will be simply a matter of the scientific community's looking at the improved experimental results in the future and coming to understand them.** **Note: **Dr. Eugene Mallove was killed in a bizarre dispute with a neighbor in May of this year.

I frequently receive powerful, sometimes very disturbing information from these sources. I rarely send out this kind of information to this list, as many people don't really want to know all the dark underbelly of everything that is happening. For those who are interested in receiving some of this deep information, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe). The below piece is a portion of National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice's testimony on April 8th before the 9/11 Independent Commission. This is her interchange with Commissioner John Lehman. I'm sending this information because I found it to be incredibly revealing, yet I could find no significant press coverage of this important portion of her three-hour testimony. You can find this testimony in the complete testimony transcript on the *Washington Post *website at [this link](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61252-2004Apr8_4.html). The portion below is about 2/3 of the way down the webpage. I also invite you to read our 9-11 timeline at [www.WantToKnow.info/9-11cover-up10pg](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-facts). When you combine the information on our timeline with the below testimony, you will see very strong evidence of complicity by top officials in government in 9/11. Once this information becomes widely know, I am confident that people throughout the country and even the world will begin to demand a new paradigm in government based on true democracy, openness, and cooperation. I welcome your comments on this. LEHMAN. First, during the short or long transition [between Clinton and Bush administrations] were you told before the summer that there were functioning Al Qaeda cells in the United States? RICE. In the memorandum that Dick Clarke sent me on Jan. 25 he mentions sleeper cells. There is no mention or recommendation of anything that needs to be done about them. And the F.B.I. was pursuing them. And usually when things come to me it's because I'm supposed to do something about it. And there was no indication that the F.B.I. was not adequately pursuing the sleeper cells. LEHMAN. Were you told that there were numerous young Arab males in flight training, had taken flight training, were in flight training? RICE. I was not. And I'm not sure that that was known at the center.

I don't remember being made aware of that, no. LEHMAN. Were you aware that it was the U.S. government established policy not to question or oppose the sanctuary policies of New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, San Diego for political reasons, which policy in those cities prohibited the local police from cooperating at all with federal immigration authorities? RICE. I do not believe I was aware of that. LEHMAN. Were you aware, to shift a little bit to Saudi Arabia, were you aware of a program that was well established that allowed Saudi citizens to get visas without interviews? RICE. I learned of that after 9/11. LEHMAN. Were you aware of the activities of the Saudi Ministry of Religious Affairs here in the United States during that transition? RICE. I believe that only after Sept. 11 did the full extent of what was going on with the Ministry of Religious Affairs became evident. LEHMAN. Were you aware of the extensive activities that the Saudi government in supporting over 300 radical teaching schools and mosques around the country, including right here in the United States? RICE. I believe we've learned a great deal more about this and addressed it with the Saudi government since 9/11. LEHMAN. Were you aware at the time of the fact that Saudi Arabia had, and were you told that they had in their custody the C.F.O.

In all our wanderings away from the Divine, humankind has virtually eliminated its most compelling features through misapplication of the logical mind, and through persistent belief in a language of limitation arising out of the controlling mechanisms of the hierarchical paradigm. Within this paradigm, language has often been used by those who desire to exert control to impose a form of limitation. Though in relative terms their words may appear liberating and empowering, those in power in the hierarchy have often used language as an instrument of entrapment and tyranny. At the other end of the spectrum, some of the noblest efforts of humanity in the usage of language have resulted in the Divine being gradually illuminated by the great spiritual visionaries of our world. Yet even the images portrayed by the language of these inspiring leaders cannot help but dilute the pure expression of the most compelling features of the Divine. **The Divine dances outside of the constructs of any language. It is complete within itself, and has a singular purpose of expressing the collective potential of all life in the universe.** It is the archetype of perfection. It is the standard bearer of each soul's innate design and ultimate destiny. The essence of the Divine is far beyond mental conception, yet humanity's tendency is to resort to the limiting language of the hierarchical paradigm to define and understand it. **The Hierarchical Paradigm ** Within the many-layered hierarchies so prevalent in many aspects of this world, those in high positions of power have attempted to guide the development of all humankind. In so doing, they have subtly obscured the direct connection between the individual and the Divine through layers of limiting language, belief system manipulation, and confining rituals designed to intercede between our inner essence and our divine source. **Each individual can come to know themselves to be free of all forms of external control.** This is not to imply that we should not trust others or join together in bonds of friendship and community. It is simply a reminder that relative truth is constantly shifting in the hands of those who desire to control. And even when the motive for their controlling behaviors may be of good will, it is still a form of control. When the revealers of \"Truth\" within the hierarchy withhold and suppress information, they are usually positioning themselves to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:consciousnessparadigms.txt:0:ae97f32684a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9172, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "consciousnessparadigms.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "consciousnessparadigms", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "control.** This is not to imply that we should not trust others or join together in bonds of friendship and community. It is simply a reminder that relative truth is constantly shifting in the hands of those who desire to control. And even when the motive for their controlling behaviors may be of good will, it is still a form of control. When the revealers of \"Truth\" within the hierarchy withhold and suppress information, they are usually positioning themselves to maintain or acquire more power rather than to disseminate empowerment to all. There are so many confusing and seemingly contradictory layers of relative truth that most individuals surrender much of their power to those in the hierarchy who use language to proclaim absolute truths. Language is seductive both to the ego's drive for power and control, and to the mind's inclination to surrender to, and believe in, the limiting language of external truths. Those desiring to control use language to lure the unsuspecting into believing in compelling images and ideas - real or imagined - for the sake of holding individuals in bondage to a lesser truth. They can thus cause many to support the hierarchy even when it no longer serves their deeper purpose. The hierarchical paradigm represents diverse interests, perceptions of reality, and motives of action. It is the desire to contain and control this diversity that causes the hierarchy to become ineffective in leading individuals to awareness of their divine heritage. Yet this diversity is also what permits it to attract and initially awaken such a breadth of individuals to their spiritual energies and intuitive abilities. Nevertheless, the hierarchy has trapped itself in vested specialization and in the limiting aspects of diversity that prevent it from evolving from an arduous ladder of evolution to a joyous river of light that is aligned with the purpose of empowering all souls to divine equality. There are individuals who are destined to demonstrate the truth of divine equality among all souls. The time is fast approaching when the veils of control at all levels of the hierarchy will be rendered obsolete by these individuals, who are destined to strip away the veils and allow the empowerment of divine equality to prevail over hierarchical power. It will become the fundamental purpose of those in power within the hierarchy to slowly remove these barriers to equality in such a way that the hierarchy appears to be the savior of consciousness rather than a detour from the road to expanded consciousness. Yet there are those present who will ensure that the curtain falls swiftly for all who are willing to skirt the hierarchy's tangled pathways, and who embrace their sacred heritage as [transformed expressions of the Divine](https://www.WantToKnow.info/transformation). **Searching for Connection and Wholeness** **After consciousness initially enters a human body, it is fragmented into a physical, emotional, and mental spectrum of perception and expression.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:consciousnessparadigms.txt:1:e7420407222b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9173, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "consciousnessparadigms.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "consciousnessparadigms", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "hierarchy appears to be the savior of consciousness rather than a detour from the road to expanded consciousness.

From the day of birth onward, human consciousness is conditioned to adapt into, and navigate within the limited three-dimensional, five-sensory context of the Earth. In effect, the soul purposely fragments its consciousness in order to experience separation from wholeness. ** The desire to evolve consciousness derives from the feeling of being less than whole, and in particular, the feeling of being disconnected from the Divine due to the fragmentation of consciousness. It is through these feelings that the fragmentation perpetuates itself and is passed into the genetic mind, which is the shared foundation of humanity. The collective genetic mind of humanity is the single most powerful component of the hierarchy. It is formed by the very conditions of living in a three-dimensional, five-sensory context that is all consuming. The desire for salvation results from feelings of inadequacy that constantly surge within the collective consciousness of humanity through the genetic mind. These feelings are again related to the fragmentation of individuals, and to their consequent inability to fully grasp their holistic nature, to reach into their divine origins, and to accept their divine equality with all. Thus ensues the seemingly endless search to be saved from the inadequacy and insecurity that result from the fragmentation of consciousness. In this state of separation, human consciousness has handicapped itself for the purpose of gaining new experience and a deeper understanding of the primal blueprint or grand vision of the Divine. **Once we develop a more expanded level of experience and understanding, our consciousness one day will, through the human body, transform this three-dimensional reality into a self-aware, integrated component of the universe.** This magnificent and purposeful endeavor produces within us the urge to seek out our wholeness and re-experience our divine connection to All That Is. The desire for connection and wholeness, in large measure, is the fuel that drives us to seek out and explore both evolution and salvation within the context of the hierarchical paradigm. It provides us with the motivation to seek help and guidance from a specific group within the hierarchy, and in so doing, cultivate a sense of connection, belonging, and unity. It is this very sense of connection, belonging, and unity that fosters a growing awareness of the underlying union between you, your divine essence, the world around you, and All That Is.

This is why the hierarchical paradigm is essential as a component of the grand experiment. It is why feelings of inadequacy and insecurity are developed and nurtured by the hierarchy. **The hierarchical paradigm is a key stage where, faced with inadequacy and insecurity, people eventually develop a sense of belonging and unity, a sense of connection to some grand, encompassing vision. This is also why the hierarchy nurtures saviors who point toward a greater vision.** These perceived saviors can facilitate the unification of all people, which in turn, facilitates the integration of humanity with the Divine. **The Prophet's Journey** Insightful spiritual leaders are able to peer deeply beneath the surface reality of life and experience how intricately connected every life form is, and how the composite of all life is intelligent far beyond an individual's capability to both perceive and express. These visionary leaders can thus interpret this deeper reality through their personal abilities to perceive and express life's dimensional depth and limitless intelligence. Yet no one is able to articulate life's full dimensional depth and breadth with the tools of language. They can only, at best, describe their interpretation or their impressions. In actuality, all of us are able to peer beneath the surface reality of life and perceive a unique vision of the universe. We require only time and intention to develop our own interpretations. And this is precisely what many great spiritual leaders have taught. **Life's deeper essence is not an absolute to be experienced by the chosen few, but an evolving, dynamic intelligence that wears as many faces as there are life forms. No group or people has the exclusive portal into the universe by which the Divine expresses itself in all its majesty. **The portal is available to all, because [the Divine is within all things](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#seeing). The great spiritual visionaries of Earth have all, in their own way, interpreted the universe and humanity's role therein. They produced a dynamic vision of life and the universe beyond what was currently defined within the hierarchy. Each of these great prophets or saviors thus created a new portal into the universe and were willing to share their vision knowing well that debate and probable ridicule would follow.

These men and women were the gateways for humanity to explore new facets of itself, to engage a part of its oversoul or collective consciousness that was essential at that particular time in its evolutionary cycle. Yet the visions of these great leaders, because they were articulated with authority and depth of insight, became a target of debate among various subgroups of the hierarchy. This debate then created a polarity of belief. A sympathetic constituency emerged to defend and embellish their particular leader's interpretation, while most established groups held it in contempt of previously held beliefs. Eventually, the leader's interpretations became confined and shaped into rigid dogma by followers who desired to create a new religion or sect. Thus, this infusion of fresh insight quietly receded into the hands of the hierarchy, where its deeper meaning became obscured by the very fact that it was incorporated into a massive structure that both protected and promoted it. Divine intelligence is connected to individuals and not organizations. Thus, the hierarchy is disconnected from the Divine in a vital and dynamic way. The hierarchy is connected to its own collective desire to help, to serve, and to perform a function that allows the use of power to drive toward the vision of its leaders. In itself, this is not wrong or misguided. It is all part of the primal blueprint that orchestrates the unfolding of consciousness from divine wholeness to sovereign soul, and from sovereign soul to collective wholeness. This is the spiral of integration that breeds wholeness and cascading beauty within the universe. What the hierarchy has loosely labeled as spirit comes as close as any word to the essence of divine intelligence. Divine intelligence inhabits all realities as an extension of the Divine. It is the emissary of the Divine that interweaves with the hierarchy as its counterbalance. Divine intelligence is the factor of integrity and alignment, which ensures that the hierarchy is serving its purpose within the primal blueprint. Divine intelligence is, in effect, the \"scientist\" who oversees the grand experiment. It establishes the criteria, selects the variables, monitors the results, and evaluates the alternative outcomes in the laboratory of time and space. The grand experiment is the ongoing transformation and expansion of divine intelligence through all beings in all dimensions of existence. **It is the purpose of the grand experiment to test alternative paradigms to determine, with some certainty, the paradigm that is best able to unify consciousness without impinging on the sovereignty of the individuated soul.** The grand experiment is composed of many distinct stages that interlink, leading to the great mystery.

Most of these different stages are being simultaneously played out within the time-space universe in order to prepare the universe for the impending expansion of divine consciousness into all forms and dimensions of existence. **The Transformation Paradigm: Inner Wisdom and Understanding ** In the case of the Earth, a new paradigm is currently emerging that promotes a clear connection of individual consciousness to the compelling features of the Divine without the intervention of a hierarchy. This is when the fables and myths of history step into the light and become known as they were originally intended. This is the time when language will be transformed into a new form of communication that exhibits the compelling features of the Divine in an artistry of energy and vibration that breaks down all barriers of control. It is time to recognize that the hierarchy extends throughout the cosmos to the very borders of discovery. It has branches that extend from every star system and from every known dimension. Virtually all life forms are \"leaves\" of this vast cosmological tree. This constitutes the grand indoctrination of species, spirits, planets, and stars as they each evolve through the branches of the tree. Thus, the hierarchy is an assemblage of externally oriented individuals who desire to invest their energies in support of a subgroup that has nested somewhere within this greatest of all manifest structures. Service is a driving force within the hierarchy, and in most cases, this translates into the concept of salvation and the teacher/student ordering of the universe. The hierarchy is composed of all individuals of all motives that have linked their energies into subgroups. These subgroups form independent branches of the vast, cosmological tree that encompasses all things that appear to be separate from the Divine. The roots of the tree are bound in the soil of genetic memory and subconscious instincts. At the base of the tree the first branches sprout. They are the oldest, representing the native religions of the species. The middle branches are the orthodox religions and institutions, while the upper branches represent contemporary belief systems that are newly emerging throughout the manifest universe. The whole tree, in this definition, is the hierarchy, and its seed was initially conceived, planted, and nurtured by divine intelligence for the purpose of stimulating the grand experiment. This is the experiment of comparing personal transformation through self-mastery with the hierarchical paradigm's evolutionary process. Evolution is the arduous and ongoing process of shifting positions", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:consciousnessparadigms.txt:5:3889b2722d09", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9177, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "consciousnessparadigms.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "consciousnessparadigms", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "The middle branches are the orthodox religions and institutions, while the upper branches represent contemporary belief systems that are newly emerging throughout the manifest universe.

This is the experiment of comparing personal transformation through self-mastery with the hierarchical paradigm's evolutionary process. Evolution is the arduous and ongoing process of shifting positions within the hierarchy - always assessing one's present position in relation to a new one that beckons. **The transformation paradigm is initiated simply by the recognition that rather than the dependency-inducing ways of the hierarchical paradigm, there are accelerated, independent pathways that bypass the hierarchy and lead to self-mastery, and that these new pathways can be accessed through direct experience of the tone or vibration of divine equality that is present within all of us. ** This tone or vibration is not what is commonly referred to as the music of the spheres or the vibration of spirit moving through the universe in resonance to divine intention. It is rather a vibration that becomes evident through the practice of three [principles of transformation](https://www.WantToKnow.info/transformation): seeing the Divine in all, nurturance of life, and gratitude. The application of these life principles disengages a soul from the controlling elements of the hierarchy, thus initiating the transformation experience. **Free Will** How can the hierarchy act as an interpretive center of truth without manipulating souls, and thus obscuring their free will? **The grand experiment was designed with free will as its primary method of obtaining authentic information that can be used to expand divine intelligence into all dimensions of existence. **Free will is the thread of authenticity that imbues value in the various tests within the grand experiment. The hierarchy never jeopardizes free will. Only the soul can choose its reality. This is the fundamental principle of free will. Free will is not obscured simply because an individual is presented with alternative realities or relative truths that delay its realization of divine equality. It is the choice of each soul to what extent it invests itself in external accounts of reality. The choice is always available for the soul to delve within its own resources and create a reality that is sovereign. The value of free will is always expanding as an individual moves towards personal transformation, and in like manner, is always diminishing when moving towards external dependence. The choice between personal transformation and external dependence is the basis of free will, and there is no structure or external source that can eliminate this basic choice. It is an inward choice that, regardless of outward circumstance, is incapable of being denied by anything external.

The universe encompasses all dimensions, and therefore, all realities are contained therein. In this incomprehensible diversity, each soul is presented with structures that define its free will in terms of its relationship to the Divine. Each of these structures varies in latitude of choice, but each is connected into the superstructure of the hierarchy. The structureless reality of divine intelligence is where free will was initially conceived. This principle was woven into the physical world as the thread of authenticity. It's degree of influence is determined by the soul's ability to recognize its own wholeness in relation to the Divine. **When people are unknowing of their inner wholeness, they tend to look for security outside of themselves. Uncertain of their place within the structured and ordered world around them, they often define themselves based upon their insecurities. Individuals thus become only pieces of their wholeness and like shards of glass from a beautiful vase, they bear little resemblance to their aggregate beauty. ** If the soul perceives itself as fragmented into its component parts, its comprehension of free will is limited to that which the hierarchy circumscribes. If, however, the soul is clearly known to be a conscious collective, realizing its sovereign wholeness, then the principle of free will is a form of structure that becomes unnecessary, like a fire on a summer day. If you were to perceive the origin of your existence, you would undoubtedly see how vast the soul is. If you could pierce through the veils that cover your destiny, you would understand how much more vast you will become. Between these two points of existence - origin and destiny - the soul is always the vibrant container of divine intelligence. It has willingly allowed itself to explore the time-space universe as an outpost of the Divine. Therefore, while the hierarchy may obscure the soul's comprehension of its wholeness, it is the soul who has surrendered, by choice, to listen to the language of limitation and the proclamations of external truths, and to become seduced by the hierarchical paradigm. Why has the hierarchy not provided the alternative paradigm of personal transformation, thus enabling the individual to make more conscious choices and more fully exercise its free will? It is because the hierarchy, like most individuals, is not aware of its own wholeness. Its fragments, or subgroups, are often obsessed with boundaries. Where there are rigid boundaries that define and limit, there is also structure.

Where there are rigid boundaries that define and limit, there is also structure. Where there is deeply ingrained structure, there is a pervasive belief that self-mastery attained through the development of inner wisdom and understanding is impossible. As the time-space universe conforms to the [matrix of belief projection](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#beliefsystems), the very concept of self-mastery through personal transformation has largely been removed from the hierarchy's reality. Thus, the hierarchy is unable to even conceptualize the transformation paradigm with any precision, let alone inform the soul that alternatives exist which issue from divine intelligence. The hierarchy is not responsible for this condition, each soul is. The paradigm of divine intelligence is primal. It existed before the hierarchy. **It is the soul that has chosen to explore the hierarchy's paradigm for the purpose of participating in the grand experiment and assisting in the emergence of a synthesis paradigm. **The hierarchy is quite benign as a manipulative force. It merely represents one stage in the journey toward wholeness. This sacred journey eventually transforms the soul to reach beyond its role as a vibrant container of divine intelligence to become a bridgeway for the expansion of the Divine into the physical world. **The Descent of the Divine into the World** There is an ancient belief, born of the hierarchy, in a great future ascension from the physical world into divine reality, and that humans of love will accompany this ascension process. Yet in the greater scheme of life, it is the Divine that is expanding to encompass the physical world with the purpose of aligning all souls to a new paradigm. Divine intelligence is stripping away the veils that hide the essential meaning of the soul in the physical world. As this progresses, the soul increasingly realizes its divine equality with all, and its many facets become increasingly aligned, allowing for an ever fuller expression of its transformed perspective. This transformation of the soul through self-mastery is the pathway into wholeness. It is the recognition that the soul is a composite of forms and the formless that is unified in one energy, one consciousness. When the fragments are aligned and interconnected, the soul becomes the instrument that facilitates this divine expansion. Thus, **the soul does not ascend from the physical world, but rather coalesces into a state of wholeness whereby its transformed expression can assist in the expansion, or in a different context, the descent of the Divine into the world.** Ascension is often construed as the natural outcome of evolution. In this view, all planetary systems and species are evolving", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:consciousnessparadigms.txt:8:ffb025a525c1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9180, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "consciousnessparadigms.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "consciousnessparadigms", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "energy, one consciousness.

In this view, all planetary systems and species are evolving to the point where they ascend from limitation, and eventually, the reality of the physical world will somehow fold into the Divine and cease to exist. In the greater reality, however, it is quite the opposite. The Divine is descending. It is inclusive of all things. It is divine intention to expand, not retreat. The soul transforms to wholeness within the cradle of the physical world, and in so doing, becomes a catalyst to the Divine's intention to expand. Can you see the perfection of this primal blueprint? Can you feel the shifting of the matrix from which your reality is cast? Can you not also understand that you, as a human being, consist of both a formless and formful identities that are individuated as a single point of pure energy, yet live in many places on many dimensions simultaneously? Only within the soul is the place of deep transformation discovered, where the formless self can enter and commune with its various outposts of form. The formless self is the eternal watcher who lives beyond the veil of form and comprehension, and draws forth the wisdom of time from the well of planets. It is the point of origin from whence divine intelligence flows. The eternal watcher, sometimes alluded to as the higher self or deeper self, is the divine interpretive center for the soul. As a pure conduit of divine intelligence, the eternal watcher is the only stable guidance system that can propel the soul to its wholeness. Thus, the soul is composed of both a formless identity infused with divine intelligence and a formful identity expressing as densified energy. While the formless is one, the formful is divested in many fragments of expression that isolate its consciousness as islands of perception and expression. This condition results in the soul's inability to recognize the vast and glorious nature of its existence. Upon entering a human body, the soul is largely silent and unmoving. It appears like a fleeting whisper of gladness that touches you like a mountain wind. It is quiet like a deep ocean. Yet the soul is coming forward into the world as a harbinger of divine expansion. It is beginning to make its divine essence known. Many now feel the shadow of their soul as it approaches. They consign all forms of definition to this \"shadow,\" seldom believing it to be the torchbearer of their total", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:consciousnessparadigms.txt:9:d28c2db6e02c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9181, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "consciousnessparadigms.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "consciousnessparadigms", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "largely silent and unmoving.

It is beginning to make its divine essence known. Many now feel the shadow of their soul as it approaches. They consign all forms of definition to this \"shadow,\" seldom believing it to be the torchbearer of their total selfhood. Here is where all the vows of faithfulness, all the ceremonies of love, and all the feelings of hope can be centered and given over to the divine essence that we each are. The primary reason that the hierarchical paradigm is so compelling is because the soul has become fragmented in how it perceives its total selfhood. The eternal watcher that lives through the human being is thus elusive to the time-space conditioned mind. Yet it is the mind that attempts to reach out and touch this subtle vibration of divine equality that is forever kindled by divine intelligence. However, the human mind is too conditioned to focusing on the fragments to realize the total scope of the soul that exists beyond the shadows of intuition. It is for this reason that humanity is exploring a hierarchical paradigm based upon evolution and salvation. Most humans have little or no conception of their wholeness, and require a savior and the acclimation process of evolution to bring them security and happiness. It is a natural condition of evolving groups and individuals to have a desire, implanted by the hierarchy, to be saved or to be a savior. This condition results in the teacher/student ordering of reality. It is a building block of evolution and the very essence of the hierarchy's structural existence. The salvation drama is an expression of souls that are preoccupied with the evolutionary process, and this is not confined to a religious context, but indeed applies to all facets of one's life. As there are relative truths, there are relative freedoms. As individuals evolve through the hierarchical process, an ever increasing sense of freedom is gained, yet external forces continue to exert control through limiting language, confining belief systems, excessive dependence upon the physical senses, and the seemingly indelible artifacts of the genetic mind. Each of these controlling influences can lead to continued reliance upon the hierarchy as it unceasingly attempts to impose a sense of inequality between us. **The underlying equation of the hierarchical paradigm is: individual + hierarchy = God connection. In the case of personal transformation, it is: individual + divine intelligence (accessed through inner wisdom and understanding) = divine equality with all. ** Divine intelligence, though it manifests as the vibration of equality, is subject to the will of the Divine. And as divine intention changes through the various stages of the grand experiment,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:consciousnessparadigms.txt:10:3fe968d74cbb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9182, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "consciousnessparadigms.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "consciousnessparadigms", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "it unceasingly attempts to impose a sense of inequality between us. **The underlying equation of the hierarchical paradigm is: individual + hierarchy = God connection.

And as divine intention changes through the various stages of the grand experiment, divine intelligence is also changing its form of manifestation. This change is occurring now within the worlds of time and space because divine intelligence is beginning to set the stage for the integration of the two primary paradigms within the grand experiment. **The Synthesis Paradigm: Integration ** The time has come to integrate the dominant paradigm of the hierarchy with the transformation paradigm of divine intelligence. This integration can only be achieved at the level of the soul. It cannot occur within the context of a human body or an aspect of the hierarchy. Only the soul - the integral manifestation of the wholeness of interdimensional consciousness imbued with divine intelligence - can facilitate and fully experience the integration of these two paradigms. This form of integration occurs naturally once the individual has fully explored the two paradigms and develops a synthesis paradigm whereby salvation is attained through the intention of the soul to \"save\" itself, and not rely upon external sources to perform this liberating task. This act of self-sufficiency begins to integrate the salvation idea with self-realization. The next step is to integrate the time-based incremental model of evolutionary progress with the realization-based model of the transformation paradigm. This is done when the soul is thoroughly convinced that experience and expression of its wholeness can only occur when it is no longer dependent on the various structures of the hierarchy. Once individuals take responsibility for their own salvation and integration, it does not mean that the hierarchy is to be shunned or avoided. The hierarchy is a wondrous instrument. It is symbolic of the body of the Divine, enabling it to submerge within the physical world similar to how the human body allows the soul to function in the physical world. The hierarchy is a vehicle of transformation even when it acts to suppress information and keep groups in obedience to its controlling hand. It is part of the ancient formula that prepares a new world for the synthesis paradigm and eventually leads to membership in the greater universe. **It is the combination of release from dependency on the hierarchy and salvation from within that initiates the synthesis paradigm into manifestation. ** The synthesis paradigm is the next outcome of the grand experiment, and in certain vibrational fields of the multidimensional universe, there are individuals who are indeed experiencing this stage of the experiment as forerunners of this", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:consciousnessparadigms.txt:11:ae0a28b4eb4d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9183, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "consciousnessparadigms.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "consciousnessparadigms", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "the ancient formula that prepares a new world for the synthesis paradigm and eventually leads to membership in the greater universe. **It is the combination of release from dependency on the hierarchy and salvation from within that initiates the synthesis paradigm into manifestation. ** The synthesis paradigm is the next outcome of the grand experiment, and in certain vibrational fields of the multidimensional universe, there are individuals who are indeed experiencing this stage of the experiment as forerunners of this expanded form of divine individuation. These individuals are specifically called to transmit this future experience into communication symbols and life principles that facilitate the bridging of the two paradigms. Beyond the initial design and construction of these \"bridges,\" these people will remain largely unknown. If they were to do anything more, they would rapidly become a fixture of the hierarchy and their contributions would become compromised. These transformed individuals are not present in the physical world to be formal teachers. They are present to be catalysts and designers. They are present to ensure that divine intelligence is allowed to balance the dominant force of the hierarchy. Their interest is not in creating a new belief system. Instead, they will focus on developing new communication symbols through various art forms that facilitate the soul's detachment from the controlling aspects of the hierarchy. These people will also demonstrate the natural ease of interweaving the two primary strands of existence into a synthesis paradigm. What these individuals will be doing, in effect, is to transform the time-space universe from hierarchical ladders of consciousness into inclusions of the Divine. In other words, divine reality will be extended into the physical world, and all life forms herein will experience this extension through a transformed hierarchical structure that is fully aligned with divine intelligence. What some call \"heaven on earth\" is merely the echo of a realization of this impending future time. **What is currently bearing down on the time-space universe is the expansion of the Divine through the accessibility of divine intelligence information to all souls regardless of form or structure. ** **Awakening** Once this information is accessible to all, every soul will eventually be inexorably drawn in this direction. And once each individual's inner spirit then becomes fully awakened, all souls will become part of the synthesis paradigm. What is being set in motion now in the physical world is the initial preparation for these paradigm shifts. More specifically, upon the Earth, these paradigms will be simultaneously played out over the next epoch of time. As always, it will be the choice of each one of us as to which paradigm we embrace in our journey.

This new paradigm resists definition. Words are inadequate to describe even the shadowy outlines of this new form of existence that is emerging from out of the synthesis paradigm. These various paradigms generally occur in a predetermined sequence, but not necessarily in a predetermined timeframe. The sequence of the divine expansion is: divine intelligence creation of a new reality; the ongoing development of a soul constructed hierarchy to act as the superstructure of the new creation; the emergence from the hierarchy of a dominant paradigm; the introduction of the divine intelligence paradigm; the integration of these two paradigms to form a synthesis paradigm of divine equality; and finally, divine expansion to the inclusion of all dimensions and souls. When this sequencing of the primal blueprint is achieved, the process with all that has been learned will be reconfigured, and a new element of the primal blueprint will be revealed that is unknown at this stage even by divine intelligence. The time required to fulfill the complete cycle is undetermined, but it is reasonable to expect that its completion is yet so distant in time that to attach measurement would simply be a feeble attempt at estimating the unknowable. Let there be no mistake, however, that the fulfillment of the primal blueprint is indeed the direction all souls are traveling. While all souls, as inspired manifestations of the Divine, are bestowed free will within their own realities, their ultimate destiny is not a matter of free will. The origin of all souls lies in the realm of divine intelligence, and it is divine intelligence that determines destiny as well. Yet souls are provided a tremendous latitude of choices to propel themselves from origin to destiny, and to reemerge into an expanded version of reality with a renewed vision of their own identity. All of the highest imaginings of humanity are yet unaware of the deepest foundation of the primal blueprint. We have sought the upper reaches of the building, yet remain unaware of the foundation's design. It is here, at the very core of existence, that the Divine is bursting forth with its creative energy. Yet it is simultaneously reintegrating with its invitation to wholeness.

Remember that language can be a tool of limitation. Feeling is an antidote to limitation that permits humanity to leap over boundaries imposed by the logical mind and witness first hand the wordless power of collective energy individuated.

Know it as a tone or vibration - a resonance that waits for you around every corner in which your life will turn. It is a beacon of the Divine gathering itself into the form of language in order to usher you to a place from which you can experience the formless tone of equality - the bypass of limitation.

The official story of 9/11 is a conspiracy theory in that the government claims 19 hijackers conspired together to hijack four planes and create terror in the world. The WantToKnow.info website purposely avoids using words like \"conspiracy theory\" because many people who are not aware of the many major cover-ups being hidden from the public shut down their rational mind as soon as they hear the word conspiracy. The main purpose of the [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) website is not to preach to the choir - those who already know about [9/11](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-conspiracy-theories), [mass media](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediainformation), [mind control](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrolinformation), [UFOs](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufoinformation), and other conspiracies - but rather to reach those who know little to nothing about all that is being hidden. **We have found that the most successful way to reach those who don't know is to present them with reliable, verifiable information that does not overly tax their belief systems.** Psychologically, most people can't handle too much disturbing information at once. Thus, we initially present only a small chunk of the conspiracy which the uninitiated can digest without being overwhelmed. Yet for those who are ready, we also offer lots more resources to go deeper.

We recommend exploring WantToKnow.info and all of these websites with healthy skepticism. Check the sources of the information whenever you have doubt. You may be surprised at how much solid information revealing major corruption and manipulation is suppressed. Many of the vitally important \"conspiracy theories\" first reported on these websites have later turned out to be true. It is unfortunate there are so few websites which present conspiracy theories at an entry level, with the most easily believable information first. We've found that drawing people in to the deeper levels of all that is being hidden, as is done on [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info), is generally a more effective strategy to open the eyes of skeptics and those who are not in the know. **Other Resources and Recommendations** **For an excellent book which shows how complex research into conspiracy theories can be, we highly recommend the book [*Them*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources#them) by BBC journalist [Jon Ronson](http://www.jonronson.com/).** One of the exceedingly few mainstream journalists who have tried to cover some of the deepest conspiracies,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:conspiracytheories.txt:1:774f13aafbd3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9189, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "conspiracytheories.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "conspiracytheories", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the deeper levels of all that is being hidden, as is done on [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info), is generally a more effective strategy to open the eyes of skeptics and those who are not in the know. **Other Resources and Recommendations** **For an excellent book which shows how complex research into conspiracy theories can be, we highly recommend the book [*Them*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources#them) by BBC journalist [Jon Ronson](http://www.jonronson.com/).** One of the exceedingly few mainstream journalists who have tried to cover some of the deepest conspiracies, Ronson has worked together with the likes of well known, yet controversial conspiracy researchers [Alex Jones](http://www.infowars.com) and [David Icke](http://www.davidicke.com). His fascinating, detailed accounts of these people show both how real these conspiracies can be, and how conspiracy researchers sometimes adopt a very biased or skewed perception of the world. As someone who is already aware of much of this information, we invite you to play an important role in bringing about positive change by considering how best to inform those who don't know of all that is going on. Consider that most people's minds can only handle a certain amount of \"reality shifting\" at once. **Start out with only a few pieces of verifiable information, and then see if they are open to more. **Pushing people rarely is effective. Consider using our [introductory email](https://www.WantToKnow.info/spreadtheword) and the \"share\" links at the top and bottom of any of our webpages to introduce people to the reliable, verifiable information we provide. **We also advise presenting information which has a conspiracy flavor not as something to cause fear or anxiety, but rather as an invitation for us all to work together for positive change in our world.** For other suggestions on what you can do to make a difference, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/brighterfuture).

The article (with pertinent sections copied below) states clearly that the Pittsburgh International Airport control tower was ordered to be evacuated at 9:49 on 9/11, more than 15 minutes before United flight 93 crashed in the Pennsylvania countryside. What possibly could have been the reasoning for evacuating the control tower when an air crisis was going on?!!! This is the control tower that could have told us definitively what happened to flight 93. Could this have been a way to keep the air traffic controllers from seeing that flight 93 was pursued by US military craft and shot down?

These core beliefs are rooted in deep, unexpressed fears. Depending on your perspective, core beliefs either cause all sorts of problems, or present many opportunities for growth. **When you choose to look at core belief work as an opportunity, you are much more likely to transform your fears into learning tools which lead to a better life.** Below are the most common core issues, their related fears or beliefs, and suggestions for dealing with them. **Examples of Common Core Challenges and Associated Fears or Beliefs** Abandonment - Nobody cares about me. I'm all alone. I don't matter. I can't trust anyone. Arrogance - I'm better than all of you. I'm too much. I'm right and you're wrong. Damaged - Something is wrong with me. I'm a failure. I'm damaged. Inferiority - I'm not good enough. I'm stupid. I'm worthless. I'm boring. I'm hopeless. Rejection - I'm a burden. I'm unwanted. Nobody wants to spend time with me. Shame - I'm bad. I'm evil. I'm a mistake. I'm a monster. I'm disgusting. I'm possessed. These challenging core beliefs often originate from childhood family scenarios. They can be a result of negative messages that were repeated many times to us by our parents or other significant people in our lives. Or one of these beliefs may have been driven deep into us during one or more traumatic experiences. **Was one of the above core beliefs drilled into you in your early years? ** Note that some people are overcompensators. If you are in this category, you may unconsciously do everything you can to make it appear as if you are anything but your core belief. For instance, someone with inferiority as a core belief might outwardly appear very macho or domineering. Yet deep inside, this is covering up a fear of being inferior. A person dealing with shame may be overly nice and giving to cover up a belief that they are really bad. Particularly if you are having trouble finding a core challenge, notice if any of your behavior is opposite of the core challenges above. **Examples of Behavior of Overcompensators** Abandonment - Always need to be included, join everything to avoid deeper feelings. Arrogance - Act very humble, hiding their deeper belief that no one can match them. Damaged - Present themselves as always great, avoid talking about their problems. Inferiority - Macho, domineering, need to prove they are better than others. Rejection - Present themselves as incredibly desirable, yet reject others easily. Shame - Overly nice and giving. Overcompetency. Secretly fear being exposed as fraud. Whether you are an overcompensator or not, **by exploring the deep beliefs behind your fears, you can transform your life for the better**. Though you", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:coreissue.txt:0:d8d97b6d98f3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9196, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "coreissue.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "coreissue", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "belief that no one can match them.

Rejection - Present themselves as incredibly desirable, yet reject others easily. Shame - Overly nice and giving. Overcompetency. Secretly fear being exposed as fraud. Whether you are an overcompensator or not, **by exploring the deep beliefs behind your fears, you can transform your life for the better**. Though you may find that you have more than one of the above, generally one will be more prominent than the others. Particularly if this is new to you, we highly recommend you first focus on exploring your most prominent core challenge. To deal with this, you can then design intentions to gradually shift this deeply ingrained fear or belief. **Suggested Intentions for Transforming Fears, Core Beliefs** Abandonment - I am worthy of love. I can find ways to safely share myself with others. Arrogance - I can learn from all around me. I can see goodness in everyone I meet. Damaged - I am whole and complete just as I am. I can choose to love all of me. Inferiority - I am a good, valuable person. I can make meaningful contributions to the world. Rejection - I am an attractive, interesting person. People can enjoy getting to know me. Shame - I can be gentle with myself. I can hold the best intentions for all deep in my heart. **At the root of all of these core challenges is a lack of acceptance and a deep feeling of being disconnected. This disconnection can be from ourselves, from others, from our spiritual nature, or from any combination of these.** Here are two empowering intentions for transforming these most basic core beliefs: May I ever deepen my acceptance of myself and all around me. May I ever deepen my connection with myself and with all around me. The above intentions are merely suggestions which you may or may not choose to use. By developing your own statements that resonate more strongly with your personal experience, you can transform your fears on a deeper level. Set aside time to explore these challenges. Change the wording any time you find something more appropriate. You might also invite close friends or family members to give suggestions. Writing down your intentions is highly recommended. Consider [writing a set of life intentions](lifepurposeintentions), and review them frequently to help keep you on track. Once you have developed your intentions, cultivate an awareness of how and when your core challenge is triggered. Notice when you are telling yourself that same old story. Each time this happens, remind yourself of your deeper intention and open to shifting from your old, disempowering self-image into a new, fuller way of being. **You can continually choose transformation by remembering to recognize fear as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:coreissue.txt:1:f473c7ba17c2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9197, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "coreissue.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "coreissue", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "a set of life intentions](lifepurposeintentions), and review them frequently to help keep you on track.

Each time this happens, remind yourself of your deeper intention and open to shifting from your old, disempowering self-image into a new, fuller way of being. **You can continually choose transformation by remembering to recognize fear as an invitation to growth.** Choose not to avoid or suppress your fears and core challenges. Working to accept and understand all parts of yourself, including your core challenges, opens the door to transformation and allows you more easily and naturally to access your beautiful deeper essence. This, in turn, can help you to live a much fuller and richer life. For overcompensators, who often have a strong tendency to avoid their fears, this is particularly important. You can find some empowering ideas on developing acceptance and understanding at [this link](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#acceptance). **Don't be surprised if after having a significant breakthrough in transforming a core belief, you eventually find the same issue rearing its ugly head again in a different form.** Most people find that transforming fear through working with their core beliefs is like peeling away layers of an onion. You make a significant breakthrough, only to eventually find the same old core belief manifesting in another, more subtle form. Yet as each layer is peeled away, you will very likely find your life to be richer, more meaningful, and more enjoyable than it was before. For more on transforming fear and core beliefs, there are many books, therapists, and workshops which explore this fertile topic. We particularly recommend two inspiring books. Eckhart Tolle's [*A New Earth*](http://www.amazon.com/New-Earth-Awakening-Lifes-Purpose/dp/0452287588/ref=ed_oe_p/104-3462640-4229555?tag=wanttinfo-20) gives many powerful suggestions to recognize and transform limiting aspects of ourselves. [*Undefended Love*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1572242086/qid%3D1109349140/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/102-6288596-7501746?tag=wanttinfo-20), by Psaris and Lyons, also gives excellent ideas and tools. By identifying and choosing to transform our core challenging beliefs, we transform our deepest fears and end up feeling more alive and more connected with ourselves and with those around us.

Out of just over $9bn, $8.7bn is unaccounted for, the inspector says. Much of the money came from the sale of Iraqi oil and gas,** and some frozen Saddam Hussein-era assets were also sold off. The money was in a special fund administered by the US Department of Defense, the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), and was earmarked for reconstruction projects. But the report says that a lack of proper accounting and poor oversight makes it impossible to say exactly what happened to most of it. \"The breakdown in controls left the funds vulnerable to inappropriate uses and undetected loss,\" the report said. This is not the first time that allegations of missing billions have surfaced in relation to the US-led invasion of Iraq and its aftermath. In 2005, the inspector general criticised the Coalition Provisional Authority, the US-led occupation administration, for its management of an $8.8bn fund that belonged to the Iraqi government. A criminal investigation conducted led to the conviction of eight US officials on bribery, fraud and money-laundering charges. **Why the Pentagon's accounting fixes end up broken** **December 23, 2013, CNBC/Reuters** [http://www.cnbc.com/id/101293095](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101293095) [http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part3](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part3) The Defense Department has launched 20 or more projects to build modern business-management systems since the late 1990s.

Interviews with scores of current and former defense officials, contractors and Pentagon watchers, as well as a review of dozens of reports by oversight agencies, show that the Pentagon is continually thwarted by a lack of accountability for failures ... and an incentive to spend.** All other federal agencies are audited annually ... and with rare exceptions, they pass every year. The Pentagon alone has never been audited, leaving roughly $8.5 trillion in taxpayer dollars unaccounted for since 1996. The Pentagon has for years kept lousy books with impunity. **The 2009 law requiring the Defense Department to be audit-ready by 2017 provides for no penalties if it misses the deadline. From 1995 through 2002, Senator Charles Grassley pushed through an amendment to the annual defense appropriations bill requiring the Pentagon to account for its expenditures by following one seemingly simple procedure: match each payment to the expense it covered. The order was ignored, and Grassley gave up. There is no doubt that bad bookkeeping conceals movements of money that in some instances are illegal. But because the Pentagon has never been audited, it is impossible to determine the frequency or extent of violations. **Note:** This article sadly fails to state the obvious: Many military officers illegally rake in tons of money with false contracts which benefit those officers and contracting companies. They obviously don't want their accounts to be properly audited.

Woodford and her fellow [accountants] set about preparing monthly reports to square the Navy's books with the U.S. Treasury's. And every month ... numbers were missing. Numbers were clearly wrong. **Woodford and her colleagues were told by superiors to ... enter false numbers, commonly called \"plugs,\" to make the Navy's totals match the Treasury's. Fudging the accounts with false entries is standard operating procedure. Former military service officials say record-keeping at the operational level throughout the services is rife with made-up numbers to cover lost or missing information. **Plugs also are symptomatic of one very large problem: the Pentagon's chronic failure to keep track of its money-how much it has, how much it pays out and how much is wasted or stolen.

The Defense Department's 2012 budget totaled $565.8 billion, more than the annual defense budgets of the 10 next largest military spenders combined, including Russia and China. How much of that money is spent as intended is impossible to determine. The Pentagon is largely incapable of keeping track of its vast stores of weapons, ammunition and other supplies. It has amassed a backlog of more than half a trillion dollars in unaudited contracts with outside vendors. [It] also has systematically ignored warnings about its accounting practices. The Pentagon is the only federal agency that has not complied with a law that requires annual audits of all government departments. That means that the $8.5 trillion in taxpayer money doled out by Congress to the Pentagon since 1996 ... has never been accounted for. That sum exceeds the value of China's economic output last year. A single [military accounting] office in Columbus, Ohio, made at least $1.59 trillion - yes, trillion - in errors, including $538 billion in plugs. **Note:** For more on military corruption, see the deeply revealing reports from reliable major media sources [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/militarycorruptionnewsarticles). **Defense Department drops $100M on unused airline tickets** **June 9, 2004, *USA Today/New York Times/*Associated Press** [http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2004-06-09-pentagon-flights_x.htm](http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2004-06-09-pentagon-flights_x.htm) The Defense Department spent an estimated $100 million for airline tickets that were not used over a six-year period and failed to seek refunds even though the tickets were reimbursable. The GAO estimated that between 1997 and 2003, the Defense Department bought at least $100 million in tickets that were not used or used only partially by a passenger who did not complete all legs of a flight. The waste went undetected because the department relied on individuals to report the unused tickets. They did not do so. **\"The millions of dollars wasted on unused airline tickets provides another example of why DOD financial management is one of our high-risk areas, with DOD highly vulnerable to fraud, waste and abuse,\" the GAO said.** Two of the three lawmakers who asked for the study were Republicans, and both were highly critical of the Pentagon's lack of financial control. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said, \"It's outrageous that the Defense Department would be sending additional federal tax dollars to the airlines by way of unused passenger tickets.\" While one GAO report focused on the unused tickets, the second investigation found potential fraud.

It said the department paid travelers for tickets the department already bought and reimbursed employees for tickets that had not been authorized. It is a crime for a government employee knowingly to request reimbursement for goods and services he or she did not buy. To demonstrate how easy it was to have the Pentagon pay for airline travel, the investigators posed as Defense employees, had the department generate a ticket and showed up at the ticket counter to pick up a boarding pass. **Note:** Isn't it interesting how both the *[New York Times](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01EED61630F93AA35755C0A9629C8B63)* and the [*Washington Post*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26307-2004Jun8.html) omitted the above statement in bold from their reports of this Associated Press article? **Military waste under fire: $1 trillion missing** **May 18, 2003, *San Francisco Chronicle*** (San Francisco's leading newspaper) [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/05/18/MN251738.DTL](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/05/18/MN251738.DTL) The Department of Defense, already infamous for spending $640 for a toilet seat ... couldn't account for more than a trillion dollars in financial transactions, not to mention dozens of tanks, missiles and planes. The nonpartisan General Accounting Office has raised the volume of its perennial complaints about the financial woes at Defense, which recently failed its seventh audit in as many years. \"Overhauling DOD's financial management operations represent a challenge that goes far beyond financial accounting,\" GAO chief David Walker told lawmakers. Recent government reports suggest the Pentagon's money management woes have reached astronomical proportions. A GAO report found Defense inventory systems so lax that the U.S. Army lost track of 56 airplanes, 32 tanks, and 36 Javelin missile command launch-units. When military leaders were scrambling to find enough chemical and biological warfare suits to protect U.S. troops, the department was caught selling these suits as surplus on the Internet \"for pennies on the dollar,\" a GAO official said. \"We are overhauling our financial management system,\" said Dov Zakheim, the Pentagon's chief financial officer. \"The Pentagon has failed to address financial problems that dwarf those of Enron,\" said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles. Gregory Kutz, director of GAO's financial management division [said]** \"I've been to Wal-Mart. They were able to tell me how many tubes of toothpaste were in Fairfax, Va. And DOD can't find its chem-bio suits.\"** Opposition to defense spending is portrayed as unpatriotic. Legislators are often more concerned about winning Pentagon pork than controlling defense waste. **Note:** For an intriguing Online Journal article exposing possible deep corruption on the part of the Pentagon's former CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Dov Zakheim, [click here](http://rense.com/general75/latest.htm).

First, I want to thank all of you for your support in this. I have been deeply impressed and inspired by the many wonderful offers of help and support I've received from journalists and other concerned people and groups around the country, and especially from the *Los Angeles Times*. As most of you know, my case is among the first batch of about 100 cases to be processed. Somehow I ended up first on the list with case number 03T001 (2003/Treasury/001). Until just two months ago, I was not interested in spending much time on this matter and was very hopeful that Congress would eventually remove any support enforcing this ban. As you likely know, both the Senate and House by large majorities did vote with identical language to do just this in October, only to have the travel ban provisions unethically stripped from the larger bill by two ranking members of the Conference Committee. As a result of this and of the fact that I was given case #1, I decided just this December to dedicate myself to challenging this travel ban. Since then, I have spent many long hours researching this matter and communicating with many knowledgeable and supportive individuals and groups around the country. In order to keep you all informed of the status of my case, I will summarize the important points here. On Dec. 30th, the attorney for the government, Brian Wissman, filed a Motion for Summary Judgment requesting that Judge Robert Barton find me guilty on the grounds that I have admitted to spending money in Cuba. This would prevent my case from going to a hearing and force me to pay a $7,590 penalty. My dedicated lawyer, Daniel Press, and I have until the end of January to respond to this motion. Mr. Press thinks it is very likely the judge will rule against me. If this happens, the only possibility of which I am aware is to appeal the ruling. In the meantime, my case has received plenty of media coverage which thus far has been very sympathetic. Six major newspaper articles, evening news coverage on the local ABC, NBC, and Fox affiliates, and two radio interviews have helped to spread the news. I welcome any additional media coverage, as I have nothing to hide. I believe the publicity can only help. The fact that over the past eight years I've worked as an Indonesian language interpreter for Bush, Clinton, Cheney, Gore, Powell, Albright, and others has been helpful in attracting media attention. If any of you want to help by contacting local and national media for interviews, we", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:cubatravelban.txt:0:47636e3d1e4d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9215, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "cubatravelban.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "cubatravelban", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "NBC, and Fox affiliates, and two radio interviews have helped to spread the news.

If any of you want to help by contacting local and national media for interviews, we can spread the news even further. You can use two information-packed documents posted on a website I manage to draw media interest. The first, [Cuba Travel Ban Facts](https://www.WantToKnow.info/cubatravelbanfacts), is a powerful one-page document listing key facts on the Cuba travel ban which show that it is both unreasonable and illegal. For each fact, I provide the source and one or more respectable Internet links so that anyone can verify these facts. If any of you have additional facts which should be included, please email me. The second document, [Interpreting Stories](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050418fredburksinterpretingstories), is a one-page summary of some interesting experiences I've had interpreting. I invite anyone with time and interest to contact the media and use these documents to promote interviews for me and other knowledgeable individuals. For any who are interested, I've also written a two-page timeline of my case. Just email me and ask for it. Feel free to ask any other questions you might have as well. I'm very open about all of this. Some of you, like me, may have wondered why I ended up with case #1. It is strange considering that there are hundreds of people with Cuba travel ban cases who traveled to Cuba both before and after my trip in December of 1999. It's even more strange that my girlfriend, who went to Cuba with me, did not receive an Order to Institute Proceedings until two months after I did, when all previous notices and letters over the past four years were sent separately to each of us within a few days of each other. It is entirely possible that I am being targeted because I manage a popular website which exposes major government cover-ups at [www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info). I invite you to take a look at this eye-opening website which is the result of the collective efforts of an international research team made up of professors, PhDs, doctors, and an Emmy award winner.

With very best wishes, Fred [http://www.customscoverup.com/](http://www.customscoverup.com/) To all the readers who have come to my site to learn more about the inner workings of the U.S. Custom's Service, I thought I'd write a brief synopsis of my case and what I experienced and the corruption I exposed while serving as a Special Agent at JFK Airport in New York. My hope is that it will instill enough anger into each and every reader so that you will write to your senators and congressmen to demand reform and accountability. I hope that you will take the time to write a letter to express your outrage about what happens to the whistle blowers in these agencies because it is the whistle blowers that will save your lives. The following is an account of some of my experiences while working for the U.S. Customs Service at JFK airport. On February 3, 1999, as a novice agent, I arrested two suspects and nearly $750,000 in cash. At some point while the currency was in the custody of the U.S. Customs Service, approximately $300,000 simply disappeared. I made note of the missing money in the \"Report of Investigation\" (ROI). My boss, Tom Flood, after a review of that report, ordered me to change the amount of the missing cash to a mere $44,000. It is interesting to note that all rooms at JFK Customs are equipped with video cameras--with one exception: the room where the currency is counted has no camera. I assumed that even a $44,00 discrepancy would spark interest from higher up in the agency. I was wrong. To my surprise, no internal affairs investigation was initiated. Instead, I was alienated and isolated from the group. While this was my *first* arrest, Supervisor, Tom Flood ordered the other agents in the office not to assist me. As it turned out, one of the two suspects was already wanted by the DEA so he was turned over to them. It was through this cooperative effort that I began to work with a DEA", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:customscoverups.txt:0:36884a356206", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9220, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "customscoverups.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "customscoverups", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "in the agency. I was wrong. To my surprise, no internal affairs investigation was initiated. Instead, I was alienated and isolated from the group. While this was my *first* arrest, Supervisor, Tom Flood ordered the other agents in the office not to assist me. As it turned out, one of the two suspects was already wanted by the DEA so he was turned over to them. It was through this cooperative effort that I began to work with a DEA agent from Florida. I had already become an outcast in the JFK office by reporting the missing $300,000. I now found myself without assistance from my supervisor or coworkers as I tried to do my job. Fortunately, I was getting assistance from another source. My contact at DEA in Florida told me about the smuggling operation at JFK and how the ring operated. An airline employee with keys to the ramp is booked on the same flight on which the courier (mule) brings drugs. The airline employee uses his keys and access as an employee, to exit the airport along with the mule, bypassing Customs, Security and Immigrations checkpoints. Using information obtained in the arrest and the information from the DEA, I began an investigation. Tom Flood expected that without guidance or assistance I would fail, but instead just the opposite happened. Within 6 weeks I made an important arrest. The case involved a conspiracy of airline workers at JFK who were smuggling massive amounts of drugs through the airport. The drugs ultimately found their way to the streets of New York. I arrested the mule who had 46.2 pounds of cocaine, I detained an airline employee, who was seated directly behind the mule with the keys to all the exit gates and I detained a New York City police detective seated with the other two. The DEA agent had described this exact smuggling scenario to me after making numerous arrests in Florida based on the same pattern. Tom Flood, my supervisor, released everyone except the mule, which in my opinion was insane. Having been a prosecutor for 6 years prior to my service with U.S. Customs, and having been an ATF agent as well, I know my agency could have gotten an indictment on that airline employee and maybe on the detective as well. Instead of arrest, that same employee was back at work on the airport ramps the very next day. As it turned out, I was in trouble. I was called into a meeting with Flood who ordered me to commit perjury before the Grand Jury. He said that it would be embarrassing for Customs to admit that drugs were being smuggled in right under our noses. Even more embarrassing is that it took DEA to inform us of the problem.

This was now an agency turf war ,and I was seen as being on the wrong side. I informed my supervisor that I would not lie before the Grand Jury and he threatened me with termination. I did not commit perjury and the DEA Agent involved in the arrest subsequently backed up my account of what transpired. Firing me presented yet another problem for those in charge at JFK. So far, my evaluations had always been excellent. They had to make me look incompetent before I could be let go. Tom Flood told me that he would re-write all my evaluations and make it look as if I had been doing a bad job. He had already stolen my evaluation book from a locked cabinet--but I had copies of the originals. I was fired. A year later there was an investigation on the circumstances of my termination and Tom Flood lied to the investigator. He presented re-written evaluations and stated that these were the only evaluations that had ever existed. These evaluations showed me to be an inferior agent and differed greatly from the positive versions (copies of the originals) which I gave to the investigator. Tom Flood was asked if my evaluations had been amended or superseded, he said that they had not. The investigator informed Flood's boss, Marvin Walker, that she had copies of the original evaluations and that Flood was lying. Walker told her to wait while he went to Flood's office for more information. An hour later, with Flood and Walker still behind closed doors, the investigator ended the meeting and decided to let the case go to trial. A Federal trial on my wrongful termination is set for the end of 2004. At JFK, it is business as usual. The same people are in charge and the problems continue unchecked. You, the public, are placed at risk every day while believing that things have changed in these days since 9/11. However since 9/11, there have been numerous violations. People with access to the ramps are NOT checked when they enter or leave the ramps. This means that drugs, money, bombs and guns can be placed on or removed from planes by airport workers in the course of their daily work.

Ramp workers were not screened by the federal government 2 years following 9/11. Finally, and most important, it doesn't matter what new procedures are enacted in Washington DC when supervisors at the ports of entry are incompetent, engaged in criminal activity and corruption or both. When the bosses are inept, the morale of the rank and file declines, leaving our borders unprotected. Here is a list of some recent incidents at JKF under the supervision of Tom Flood: 6/21/2002 - A group of American Airline workers are arrested for taking bribes of $1000 a head to smuggle illegal aliens through the airport using their pass keys, smuggling them through the sterile corridors, the same method I had described in March, 1999. 8/9/2002 - Discovered that thousands of US Customs employee credentials and computers with sensitive information were reported lost or stolen. 11/18/2002 - 118 ramp workers arrested at JFK who were illegal aliens and/or had criminal histories. 6/14/2003 - Naked man arrested found wondering on the ramps of LaGuardia Airport. Obviously, this man was mentally ill but he had broken security and if he was wearing overalls, nobody would have noticed him and he could have placed an explosive device on a plane. 8/12/2003 - 3 boat kids were washed ashore on the ramps of JFK and were wandering around for hours without being stopped. Imagine the kind of havoc they could have caused if they had bad intentions. **They** had to spend hours trying to seek out help from the police. 11/25/2003 - 25 airline ramp workers who were part of a large drug conspiracy ring were arrested for smuggling in huge amounts of drugs into the country, including the largest drug arrest in the history of JFK Airport. In a 14 month period alone, they smuggled into the US $50 million dollars worth of cocaine. They should have been arrested earlier but their arrest was timed for when a Congressional group was going to be at JFK that day. Customs denied that drugs were smuggled under their noses for over a decade, yet all my written documentation proves that Customs was well aware of the drug smuggling operation since at least 1999.

Epstein, M.D., **professor emeritus environmental and occupational medicine University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health Chairman, Cancer Prevention Coalition **Introduction** On May 23, 2003, President Bush proposed an Initiative to End Hunger in Africa [[1]](#_edn1) using genetically modified (GM) foods. He also blamed Europe's \"unfounded, unscientific fears\" of these foods for thwarting recovery efforts. Bush was convinced that GM foods held the key to greater yields, expanded U.S. exports, and a better world. His rhetoric was not new. It had been passed down from president to president, and delivered to the American people through regular news reports and industry advertisements. The message was part of a master plan that had been crafted by corporations determined to control the world's food supply. This was made clear at a biotech industry conference in January 1999, where a representative from Arthur Anderson Consulting Group explained how his company had helped Monsanto create that plan. First, they asked Monsanto what their ideal future looked like in fifteen to twenty years. **Monsanto executives described a world with 100 percent of all commercial seeds genetically modified and patented.** Anderson Consulting then worked backwards from that goal, and developed the strategy and tactics to achieve it. They presented Monsanto with the steps and procedures needed to obtain a place of industry dominance in a world in which natural seeds were virtually extinct.

Integral to the plan was Monsanto's influence in government, whose role was to promote the technology worldwide and to help get the foods into the marketplace quickly, before resistance could get in the way. A biotech consultant later said, \"The hope of the industry is that over time, the market is so flooded that there's nothing you can do about it. You just sort of surrender.\" [[2]](#_edn2) The anticipated pace of conquest was revealed by a conference speaker from another biotech company. He showed graphs projecting the year-by-year decrease of natural seeds, estimating that in five years, about 95 percent of all seeds would be genetically modified. While some audience members were appalled at what they judged to be an arrogant and dangerous disrespect for nature, to the industry this was good business. Their attitude was illustrated in an excerpt from one of Monsanto's advertisements: \"So you see, there really isn't much difference between foods made by Mother Nature and those made by man. What's artificial is the line drawn between them.\" [[3]](#_edn3) **To implement their strategy, the biotech companies needed to control the seeds-so they went on a buying spree, taking possession of about 23 percent of the world's seed companies. Monsanto did achieve the dominant position, capturing 91 percent of the GM food market.** [[4]](#_edn4) But the industry has not met their projections of converting the natural seed supply. Citizens around the world, who do not share the industry's conviction that these foods are safe or better, have *not* \"just sort of surrendered.\" Widespread resistance to GM food has resulted in a global showdown. U.S. exports of genetically modified corn and soy are down, and hungry African nations won't even accept the crops as food aid. Monsanto is faltering financially and is desperate to open new markets. The U.S. government is convinced that EU resistance is the primary obstacle and is determined to change that. On May 13, 2003, the U.S. filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization (WTO), charging that the European Union's restrictive policy on GM food violates international agreements. On the day the WTO suit was filed, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick declared, \"Overwhelming scientific research shows that biotech foods are safe and healthy.\" [[5]](#_edn5) This has been industry's chant from the start. It is the key assumption at the basis of their master plan, the WTO challenge, and the president's campaign to end hunger.

It is also, however, untrue. **The following chapters reveal that it was industry influence, not sound science, which allowed these foods onto the market. Moreover, if overwhelming scientific research suggests anything, it is that the foods should never have been approved.** Just as the magnitude of the industry's plan was breathtaking, so too are the distortions and cover-ups. While many of the stories in this book reveal government and corporate maneuvering worthy of an adventure novel, the impact of GM foods is personal. Most people in North America eat them at every meal. These chapters not only dismantle the U.S. position that the foods are safe, they inform you of the steps you can take to protect yourself and your family. **Chapter 1: A Lesson From Overseas** **When eminent scientist Arpad Pusztai went public about his accidental discovery that genetically modified (GM) potatoes severely damage the immune system and organs of rats, he was suspended from the prestigious Scottish research institute where he had worked for thirty-five years. He was silenced with threats of a lawsuit while the Institute denied or distorted his findings.** In the ensuing war over public opinion, biotech advocates tried to spin the science in favor of GM foods, but were thwarted at each attempt by leaked documents and compelling evidence. Pusztai, who describes this chapter as \"the most thorough and accurate report on the topic,\" was ultimately vindicated when his potato study was published in the *Lancet*. His remains the only independent safety assessment in a peer-reviewed journal. It contrasts sharply with the handful of published industry studies, an analysis of which reveals how they were designed to avoid finding problems. **Excerpt:** When Susan answered the door, she was startled to see several reporters standing in front of her. Several more were running from their cars in her direction and she could see more cars and TV news vans parking along the street. \"But you all know that we can't speak about what happened. We would be sued and-\" [[6]](#_edn6) \"It's OK now,\" the reporter from Channel Four Television interrupted, waving a paper in front of her. \"They've released your husband.

Arpad Pusztai (pronounced: Are-pod Poos-tie), a distinguished looking man in his late sixties, was already on his way. As his wife showed him the document, the reporters slipped past them into the house. But Arpad didn't notice; he was staring at the paper his wife had just handed him. He recognized the letterhead at once-The Rowett Institute, Aberdeen, Scotland. It was one of the world's leading nutritional institutes and his employer for the previous thirty-five years-until his sudden suspension seven months ago. And there it was, clearly spelled out. They had released their gag order. He *could* speak. The document was dated that same day, February 16, 1999. In fact, less than twenty minutes before, thirty reporters had sat in the Rowett Institute press conference listening to its director, Professor Phillip James, casually mention that the restrictions on Dr. Pusztai's speaking to the press had been lifted. Before James had finished his sentence, the reporters leaped for the door. They jumped into their cars and headed straight to the Pusztai's house on Ashley Park North, an address most were familiar with, having virtually camped out there seven months earlier. Now those thirty reporters, with TV cameras and tape recorders, were piled into the Pusztai's living room. Arpad Pusztai read the document-twice. As he looked up, the reporters started asking him questions all at once. He smiled, and breathed more easily than he had in a long time. He had all but given up hope. Now he finally had the chance to share what he knew about the dangers of genetically engineered foods. **The story of Arpad Pusztai made headlines throughout Europe for months, alerting readers to some of the serious health risks of genetically modified (GM) foods. It was barely mentioned, however, in the U.S. press;** the media watchdog group Project Censored described it as one of the ten most underreported events of the year. [[7]](#_edn7) In fact, major U.S. media avoided almost any discussion of the controversy over genetically modified organisms (GMOs) until May 1999. But that was all about saving the monarch butterfly from GM corn pollen, not about human food safety. It wasn't until the massive food recall prompted by StarLink corn that Americans were even alerted to the fact that they were eating GM foods everyday. Moreover, the American press was forced to question whether GM foods were safe. Up until then, the media had portrayed European resistance to America's GM crops as unscientific anti-Americanism. But as the story of Arpad Pusztai reveals, the European anti-GMO sentiment had been fueled, in part, by far greater health risks than the scattered allergic reactions attributed to StarLink. **Between the Chapters:", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:deception10pg.txt:3:c515d49a1f15", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9228, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "deception10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "deception10pg", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "by StarLink corn that Americans were even alerted to the fact that they were eating GM foods everyday.

What do these animals know that we don't? At the end of each chapter is a one-page story describing how farmers, students, and scientists discovered that animals refuse to eat the same GM foods that we consume everyday. **Excerpt**: **The *Washington Post* reported that laboratory mice, usually happy to munch on tomatoes, turned their noses up at the genetically modified FlavrSavr tomato.** Scientist Roger Salquist said of his tomato, \"I gotta tell you, you can be Chef Boyardee and mice are still not going to like them.\" [[8]](#_edn8) The mice were eventually force fed the tomato through gastric tubes and stomach washes. Several developed stomach lesions; seven of forty died within two weeks. The tomato was approved without further tests. **Chapter 2: What Could Go Wrong-A Partial List** Genetic engineers continually encounter unintended side effects-plants create toxins, react to weather differently, contain too much or too little nutrients, become diseased or malfunction and die. This chapter describes the process of genetic engineering and twenty-one ways in which it can create unexpected, potentially serious problems. **Excerpt:** New DNA chip technology has recently allowed scientists to monitor changes in DNA functioning when foreign genes are inserted.** In one experiment, there was a staggering 5 percent disruption of gene expression.** In other words, after a single foreign gene had been added through genetic engineering, one out of every 20 genes that were creating proteins either increased or decreased their output. According to Professor David Schubert, \"while these types of unpredicted changes in gene expression are very real, they have not received much attention outside the community of the DNA chip users.\" He adds that, \"there is currently no way to predict the resultant changes in protein synthesis.\" [[9]](#_edn9) **Chapter 3: Spilled Milk** \"The scientists' testimony before a Senate committee was like a scene from the conspiratorial television show The X-Files.\" [[10]](#_edn10) This was how Canada's leading paper described the story of six Canadian government scientists who tried to stand up to pressure to approve Monsanto's genetically engineered bovine growth hormone (rbGH) which they believed was unsafe.

The scientists were threatened by senior government officials, files were stolen from their locked file cabinets, Monsanto allegedly offered them a bribe of $1-2 million, and one senior official suddenly quit and disappeared, avoiding an appearance before a Parliamentary Committee. [[11]](#_edn11) What was happening to the Canadian scientists in 1998 amounted to \"re-runs\" of what U.S. government scientists faced in the 1980s. **W****hen FDA scientists tried to blow the whistle on what was happening, they were stripped of responsibilities or fired.** The FDA eventually approved rbGH on the basis of a research summary submitted by Monsanto that had distorted and deleted data about serious health effects, including cancer. **Excerpt:** The FDA's article states, \"it has also been determined that at least 90 percent of bovine growth hormone (bGH) activity is destroyed upon pasteurization of milk. Therefore, bGH residues do not present a human food safety concern.\" [[12]](#_edn12) Robert Cohen decided to investigate this claim. He uncovered what he considers to be blatant scientific fraud. The research had been conducted by undergraduate Paul Groenewegan. His three co-authors all had close ties with Monsanto. The paper described how they heated milk at 162 degrees F for thirty minutes. **Cohen said, \"when I read that, I said, wait a second, milk is pasteurized for 15 seconds at that temperature-not 30 minutes. They intentionally tried to destroy the hormone....** That must have been their mission. Why else would they heat the milk for 30 minutes at a high temperature reserved for a 15 second treatment?\" But even after thirty minutes only 19 percent of the bGH in milk from hormone-treated cows was destroyed. According to Cohen, \"They then 'spiked' the milk. This is their word, 'spike.' They added artificial bGH ... 146 times the level of naturally occurring bST in powdered form to the milk and heated it. The powdered bGH in milk was destroyed! They saved the day for Monsanto. The experiment worked. These men of science could claim that heat treatment destroys bGH.\" [[13]](#_edn13) **Chapter 4: Deadly Epidemic** In 1989, first dozens, then thousands fell sick. About one hundred people died, others struggled with paralysis, unbearable pain, and debilitating symptoms. [[14]](#_edn14) Authorities eventually tracked its cause: contaminants produced in one company's genetically modified variety of the food supplement L-tryptophan. [[15]](#_edn15) This chapter describes the evidence implicating genetic engineering as the cause of the epidemic and the efforts by industry and the FDA to divert the blame. Current regulations are so loose, they would allow that same type of deadly supplement onto the market today. **Chapter 5: Government By the Industry, For the Industry** Henry Miller", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:deception10pg.txt:5:97555434a1f7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9230, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "deception10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "deception10pg", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "unbearable pain, and debilitating symptoms.

Current regulations are so loose, they would allow that same type of deadly supplement onto the market today. **Chapter 5: Government By the Industry, For the Industry** Henry Miller was in charge of biotechnology issues at the FDA from 1979 to 1994. According to Miller, \"U.S. government agencies have done exactly what big agribusiness has asked them to do and told them to do.\" [[16]](#_edn16) This chapter reveals how industry influence has dictated policy, and how the FDA ignored the recommendations by the *majority* of their own scientists by approving GM foods without requiring safety tests. **Excerpts:** The biotech industry's success with these government leaders became apparent on May 26, 1992 in the Indian Treaty Room of the Old Executive Building. There, Vice President Dan Quayle announced the Bush administration's new policy on genetically engineered food: \"The reforms we announce today will speed up and simplify the process of bringing better agricultural products, developed through biotech, to consumers, food processors and farmers. We will ensure that biotech products will receive the same oversight as other products, instead of being hampered by unnecessary regulation.\" [[17]](#_edn17) By \"receive the same oversight as other products,\" Quayle meant that GM foods would be considered just as safe as natural, non-GM foods. And sidestepping \"unnecessary regulation\" meant that the government would not require any safety tests or any special labels identifying the foods as genetically engineered. The rationale for this hands-off policy was spelled out in an FDA document dated three days after Quayle's announcement. \"The agency is not aware of any information showing that foods derived by these new methods differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way.\" [[18]](#_edn18) Monsanto had what it wanted: government endorsement of safety, and no regulations that would interfere with its plans for rapid worldwide sales. **Political Science at the FDA** Attorney Michael Taylor was involved in the development of FDA policy. Prior to working at the FDA, Monsanto was his personal client. **Taylor had helped Monsanto draft pro-biotech regulations that the industry would lobby for. While working for the FDA, Taylor could implement those laws himself. For Monsanto, there was no better person to step into a leadership role at the FDA.** Taylor did not simply fill a vacant position at the agency. In 1991 the FDA created a new position for him: Deputy Commissioner for Policy. He instantly became the FDA official with the greatest influence on GM food regulation, overseeing the development of government policy. According to public interest attorney Steven Druker, who has studied the FDA's internal files, \"**During Mr. Taylor's tenure", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:deception10pg.txt:6:8d927cb171bc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9231, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "deception10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "deception10pg", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "himself.

He instantly became the FDA official with the greatest influence on GM food regulation, overseeing the development of government policy. According to public interest attorney Steven Druker, who has studied the FDA's internal files, \"**During Mr. Taylor's tenure as Deputy Commissioner, references to the unintended negative effects of bioengineering were progressively deleted from drafts of the policy statement (over the protests of agency scientists),** and a final statement was issued claiming (a) that [GM] foods are no riskier than others and (b) that the agency has no information to the contrary.\" [[19]](#_edn19) In 1994, Taylor became the administrator at the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, where he was also involved in biotechnology issues. He later became Vice President for Public Policy at Monsanto. When the FDA announced its policy, the public was not aware of any internal dissent. The policy boldly claimed that there was no information to indicate that GM foods were different or more risky than natural varieties. Since the American public generally trusts the FDA, people assumed that no such risks existed. But nearly a decade later, the agency's internal documents-made public for the first time through a lawsuit-told a different story. Linda Kahl, an FDA compliance officer, protested that by \"trying to force an ultimate conclusion that there is no difference between foods modified by genetic engineering and foods modified by traditional breeding practices,\" the agency was \"trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\" She insisted, \"the processes of genetic engineering and traditional breeding are different, and according to the technical experts in the agency, they lead to different risks.\" [[20]](#_edn20) One such expert was FDA microbiologist Louis Pribyl. \"There is a profound difference between the types of unexpected effects from traditional breeding and genetic engineering,\" wrote Pribyl in a letter to James Maryanski, the FDA's biotech coordinator. Pribyl said that several aspects of gene splicing \"may be more hazardous.\" [[21]](#_edn21) According to the *New York Times*, \"Dr. Pribyl knew from studies that toxins could be unintentionally created when new genes were introduced into a plant's cells.\" [[22]](#_edn22) Moreover, Pribyl wrote \"there is no certainty that [the breeders of GM foods] will be able to pick up effects that might not be obvious.\" He declared, \"This is the industry's pet idea, namely that there are no unintended effects that will raise the FDA's level of concern. But time and time again, there is no data to back up their contention.\" [[23]](#_edn23) Pribyl was only one of many FDA scientists asked to provide input during the formulation of the FDA's policy on genetically engineered food. According to Druker, records", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:deception10pg.txt:7:b578d21ffb30", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9232, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "deception10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "deception10pg", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "of GM foods] will be able to pick up effects that might not be obvious.\" He declared, \"This is the industry's pet idea, namely that there are no unintended effects that will raise the FDA's level of concern.

According to Druker, records show that the majority of these scientists identified potential risks of GM foods. Druker was the main organizer of the lawsuit that forced the FDA documents into the public domain. His nonprofit organization, the Alliance for Bio-Integrity, was the lead plaintiff. Having sorted through tens of thousands of pages of FDA documents, he described the opinion of the agency's scientists as follows: \"The predominant view was that genetic engineering entails distinct risks and that its products cannot be regarded as safe unless they have been confirmed to be so through appropriate feeding studies.\" Druker says several scientists \"issued strong warnings.\" [[24]](#_edn24) The Toxicology Group, for example, warned that genetically modified plants could \"contain unexpected high concentrations of plant toxicants,\" and described the reasons why these might be very difficult to identify. [[25]](#_edn25) Their director wrote, \"The possibility of unexpected, accidental changes in genetically engineered plants justifies a limited traditional toxicological study.\" [[26]](#_edn26) ** The Division of Food Chemistry and Technology outlined four potential dangers:** ** \"Increased levels of known naturally occurring toxins\"** ** \"Appearance of new, not previously identified\" toxins** ** Increased tendency to gather \"toxic substances from the environment\" such as \"pesticides or heavy metals\" ** ** \"Undesirable alterations in the levels of nutrients\"** They warned, \"unless genetically engineered plants are evaluated specifically for these changes,\" these four \"may escape breeders' attention.\" The division recommended testing every GM food \"before it enters the marketplace.\" [[27]](#_edn27) Gerald Guest, the director of FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) sent a letter to the FDA's Biotech Coordinator, James Maryanski, saying that he and the other CVM scientists concluded that there is \"ample scientific justification\" to require testing and review of each GM food before it is eaten by the public. He stated, \"CVM believes that animal feeds derived from genetically modified plants present unique animal and food safety concerns.\" He pointed out that, \"residues of plant constituents or toxicants in meat and milk products may pose human food safety concerns.\" [[28]](#_edn28) In spite of repeated internal memos outlining the potential for increased health risks posed by this new technology, subsequent drafts of the FDA's policy statement, overseen by Taylor, deleted more and more of the scientist's input. In a fiery memo to Maryanski, Pribyl challenged the direction the policy statement had taken: \"What has happened to the scientific elements of this document?

In a fiery memo to Maryanski, Pribyl challenged the direction the policy statement had taken: \"What has happened to the scientific elements of this document? Without a sound scientific base to rest on, this becomes a broad, general, 'What do I have to do to avoid trouble'-type document.... It will look like and probably be just a political document.... It reads very pro-industry, especially in the area of unintended effects.\" **But while the FDA's scientists were emphasizing caution and testing, its leaders were beholden to an altogether different lobbying effort.** A March 1992 memo from FDA Commissioner David Kessler, confirmed the White House's influence in the crafting of the agency's policy. \"The approach and provisions of the policy statement are consistent with the general biotechnology policy established by the Office of the President.... It also responds to White House interest in assuring the safe, speedy development of the U.S. biotechnology industry.\" [[29]](#_edn29) But even the draft of the policy that Kessler praised as White House-friendly was subject to further revision as it went up the political chain of command. A memo from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, at the Department of Health & Human Services, expressed reservations about the length and depth of the policy statement's concern for environmental effects of GM crops. The letter said, \"The extensive twelve page discussion seems to be ... dangerously detailed and drawn-out.\" [[30]](#_edn30) In the end, it was the political, rather than scientific considerations that prevailed. **The agency not only ignored its scientists, it claimed their concerns never existed.** For example, the State Department's Melinda Kimble, while negotiating GMO trade policy said, \"I want to make very clear that it is the position of the United States government that we do not believe there is a difference between GMO commodities and non-GMO commodities.\" [[31]](#_edn31) Likewise, a March 2003 statement by Speaker of the House Hastert declared, \"There is general consensus among the scientific community that genetically modified food is no different from conventional food.\" [[32]](#_edn32) When the FDA documents eventually became public, Maryanski defended the agency's policy. On February 28, 2000, he told the OECD Conference on GM Food Safety in Edinburgh, Scotland that the FDA scientists had merely been asking questions about the various issues involved in bioengineered food. Maryanski was unpleasantly surprised when Druker, who was a member of the conference, stood up and invited the audience to read the FDA memos that were posted on his organization's website. They could see for themselves that the agency's scientists were not merely asking questions; many of their statements were quite emphatic about the unique", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:deception10pg.txt:9:f67731f5bf8e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9234, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "deception10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "deception10pg", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "Conference on GM Food Safety in Edinburgh, Scotland that the FDA scientists had merely been asking questions about the various issues involved in bioengineered food.

They could see for themselves that the agency's scientists were not merely asking questions; many of their statements were quite emphatic about the unique risks of GM foods. Maryanski, other FDA officials, and representatives throughout the U.S. government continue to claim there is overwhelming consensus among scientists that GM foods are safe. In an Oct. 1991 letter to a Canadian official, however, Maryanski himself had admitted that this was not true. He said, \"there are a number of specific issues... for which a scientific consensus does not exist currently, especially the need for specific toxicology tests.\" Maryanski also said, \"I think the question of the potential for some substances to cause allergenic reactions is particularly difficult to predict.\" [[33]](#_edn33) Commenting on statements made by FDA scientists, the *New York Times* wrote. \"The scientists were displaying precisely the concerns that Monsanto executives from the 1980's had anticipated -- and indeed had considered reasonable. But now, rather than trying to address those concerns, Monsanto, the industry and official Washington were dismissing them as the insignificant worries of the uninformed.\" [[34]](#_edn34) Many scientists who understood the dangers, however, were not convinced by the FDA's assurances. Geneticist David Suzuki, for example, said, \"Any politician or scientist who tells you these products are safe is either very stupid or lying. The experiments have simply not been done.\" [[35]](#_edn35) A January 2001 report from an expert panel of the Royal Society of Canada likewise supported the conclusions of the FDA scientists. **The Royal Society of Canada report said it was \"scientifically unjustifiable\" to presume that GM foods are safe.** The report explains that the \"default prediction\" for any GM foods is that \"expression of a new gene (and its products) ... will be accompanied by a range of collateral changes in expression of other genes, changes in the pattern of proteins produced and/or changes in metabolic activities.\" This could result in novel toxins or other harmful substances. The report emphasized the need for safety testing, looking for short and long-term human toxicity, allergenicity, and other health effects. The panel began their comprehensive 245-page report by quoting the editors of the UK's *Nature Biotechnology*. \"The risks in biotechnology are undeniable, and they stem from the unknowable in science and commerce. It is prudent to recognize and address those risks, not compound them by overly optimistic or foolhardy behavior.\" [[36]](#_edn36) FDA veterinarian Richard Burroughs described the changes he saw at the FDA. \"There seemed to be a trend in the place toward approval at any price. It went from a university-like setting", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:deception10pg.txt:10:403aff3e3aef", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9235, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "deception10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "deception10pg", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "their comprehensive 245-page report by quoting the editors of the UK's *Nature Biotechnology*. \"The risks in biotechnology are undeniable, and they stem from the unknowable in science and commerce.

It went from a university-like setting where there was independent scientific review to an atmosphere of 'approve, approve, approve.\" He said, \"the thinking is, 'How many things can we approve this year?' Somewhere along the way they abdicated their responsibility to the public welfare.\" [[37]](#_edn37) **A congressional aide said, \"At FDA morale stinks. Hundreds of people have either retired or quit in disgust. All the best people, who believed in working on behalf of public health, have gone.\"** Dan Glickman, former Secretary of Agriculture, describes the government's pro-biotech mind-set. \"It was almost immoral to say that it wasn't good because it was going to solve the problems of the human race and feed the hungry and clothe the naked.\" He said, \"You felt like you were almost an alien, disloyal, by trying to present an open-minded view.... So I pretty much spouted the rhetoric... It was written into my speeches.\" [[38]](#_edn38) **Chapter 6: Rolling the Dice With Allergies ** An infant girl in England broke out in cold sores from drinking soymilk, but was tested as \"not allergic\" to normal soy. Was she allergic to something in GM soy instead? Perhaps it was the increased amount of the allergen-trypsin inhibitor-found in Monsanto's Roundup Ready soybeans? **Could this also explain why soy allergies in the UK jumped by 50 percent after Roundup Ready soy was introduced? **It's difficult to say, because although scientists have confirmed that deadly allergies can be transferred into foods via genetic engineering, there are no robust allergy tests done on GM foods. This was brought to the public's attention only after StarLink had been blamed for severe, potentially fatal allergic reactions. It took the FDA nearly a year to develop a test to see if StarLink was allergenic. The test was so poorly designed and unreliable, even the EPA rejected the results. **Excerpts:** In March 1999, the York Nutritional Laboratory, Europe's leading specialists on food sensitivity, reported that soy allergies skyrocketed over the previous year, jumping 50 percent. The increase propelled soy into the top ten list of allergens for the first time in the 17 years of testing. York scientists tested 4,500 people for allergic reactions to a wide range of foods. In previous years, soy affected 10 percent of consumers. Now, 15 percent reacted with a range of chronic illnesses, including irritable bowel syndrome, digestion problems, and skin complaints, as well as neurological problems, chronic fatigue syndrome, headaches and lethargy.

Now, 15 percent reacted with a range of chronic illnesses, including irritable bowel syndrome, digestion problems, and skin complaints, as well as neurological problems, chronic fatigue syndrome, headaches and lethargy. Researchers confirmed the link with soy by detecting increased levels of antibodies in the blood. Furthermore, the soy tested in the study was likely to contain significant percentages of the genetically modified Roundup Ready variety. The fact that GM soy had just entered the food supply was not lost to the researchers, who, according to the *Daily Express*, \"said their findings provide real evidence that GM food could have a tangible, harmful impact on the human body.\" A spokesman said, \"We believe this raises serious new questions about the safety of GM foods.\" The British Medical Association had already \"warned that the technology may lead to the emergence of new allergies.\" With the York's research in hand, now British scientists urged their government to impose an immediate ban on GM food until further testing evaluated their safety. Pathologist Michael Antoniou said that the increased allergic responses \"points to the fact that far more work is needed to assess their safety. At the moment no allergy tests are carried out before GM foods are marketed.\" [[39]](#_edn39) At a business lunch with co-workers, 35-year-old Grace Booth dined on three chicken enchiladas, which she later recalled were very good. Within about fifteen minutes, however, something went wrong. She felt hot, itchy. Her lips swelled; she lost her voice and developed severe diarrhea. \"I felt my chest getting tight, it was hard to breathe,\" recalled Booth. \"She didn't know but she was going into shock,\" reported CBS news. \"I thought, oh my God, what is happening to me? I felt like I was going to die.\" Her co-workers called an ambulance . . . . [[40]](#_edn40) Booth didn't know what had caused her nearly deadly allergic reaction. But this was September 2000 and within a few days she heard the news. A genetically modified corn product called StarLink, a potential allergen not approved for human consumption, was discovered in tacos, tortillas, and other corn products. More than 300 items were eventually recalled from the grocery store shelves in what was to become one of the world's biggest GM food debacles. **Chapter 7: Muscling the Media** **The biotech industry uses its considerable resources to mold public opinion on genetically modified foods. In addition to promoting a one-sided image of the foods as safe and necessary, they stifle coverage about health and environmental damage.** For example, a Fox TV station canceled a news series, a publisher canceled", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:deception10pg.txt:12:4d34faa45aac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9237, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "deception10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "deception10pg", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "More than 300 items were eventually recalled from the grocery store shelves in what was to become one of the world's biggest GM food debacles. **Chapter 7: Muscling the Media** **The biotech industry uses its considerable resources to mold public opinion on genetically modified foods.

Other stories in this chapter describe how the industry manipulated news that *was* reported. **Excerpt:** A national TV commercial showed a montage of smiling Asian children, caring doctors, rice paddies, and a narrator who says that golden rice can 'help prevent blindness and infection in millions of children' suffering from vitamin-A deficiency.\" [[42]](#_edn42) *Time* magazine went so far as to claim on their cover, \"This rice could save a million kids a year.\" The biotech company Syngenta claims one month of a delay in marketing Golden Rice, would cause 50,000 children to go blind. [[43]](#_edn43) The biotech industry had found its poster child, genetically engineered rice that makes its own beta-carotene-a precursor to vitamin A. In his *New York Times Magazine* article, \"The Great Yellow Hype,\" Michael Pollan says that golden rice impales Americans on the horns of a moral dilemma: \"if we don't get over our queasiness about eating genetically modified food, kids in the third world will go blind.\" \"Yet the more one learns about biotechnology's Great Yellow Hope,\" Pollan continues, \"the more uncertain seems its promise.\" [[44]](#_edn44) A closer look reveals some interesting omissions in the industry's numbers. According to a Greenpeace report, golden rice provides so little vitamin A, \"a two-year-old child would need to eat seven pounds per day.\" [[45]](#_edn45) Likewise, an adult would need to eat nearly twenty pounds to get the daily-recommended dose. \"This whole project is actually based on what can only be characterized as intentional deception,\" writes Benedikt Haerlin, former international coordinator of Greenpeace's genetic engineering campaign. \"We recalculated their figures again and again. We just could not believe serious scientists and companies would do this.\" [[46]](#_edn46) Even the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, which funded development of golden rice, said \"the public-relations uses of golden rice have gone too far\" and are misleading the public and media. He adds, \"We do not consider golden rice the solution to the Vitamin A deficiency problem.\" [[47]](#_edn47) There are other considerations as well. No published study has confirmed that the human body could actually convert the beta-carotene in golden rice. Also other nutrients such as fat and protein, often lacking in the diets on malnourished children, are needed in order to absorb Vitamin A. And it is not clear whether the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:deception10pg.txt:13:6cd745086887", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9238, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "deception10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "deception10pg", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "too far\" and are misleading the public and media. He adds, \"We do not consider golden rice the solution to the Vitamin A deficiency problem.\" [[47]](#_edn47) There are other considerations as well. No published study has confirmed that the human body could actually convert the beta-carotene in golden rice. Also other nutrients such as fat and protein, often lacking in the diets on malnourished children, are needed in order to absorb Vitamin A. And it is not clear whether the genes from the daffodil, which are used to create golden rice, will transfer known allergens from the flower. [[48]](#_edn48) The biotech proponents also admit that to persuade people to eat yellow rice may require an educational campaign. But if they are going to spend the time to educate, Pollan asks, why not instead teach \"people how to grow green vegetables [that are rich in vitamin A and other nutrients] on the margins of their rice fields, and maybe even give them the seeds to do so? Or what about handing out vitamin-A supplements to children so severely malnourished their bodies can't metabolize beta-carotene?\" Distributing supplements is precisely what the Vitamin Angel Alliance is doing. They give children who are at risk a high potency tablet, strong enough so that only two are required per year to prevent blindness. At a cost of only $.05 per tablet, only $25,000 is needed to prevent 500,000 children from going blind per year. [[49]](#_edn49) Contrast this with golden rice, which has cost more than $100 million dollars so far, and is not yet ready. Michael Khoo of Greenpeace says golden rice \"isn't about solving childhood blindness, it's about solving biotech's public relations problem.\" If the industry were truly dedicated to the problems of malnutrition and starvation, a tiny fraction of their advertising budget could have been diverted to make an enormous difference already. Khoo says, \"It is shameful that the biotech industry is using starving children to promote a dubious product.\" [[50]](#_edn50) ***Grains of Delusion*****, a research report jointly released by humanitarian organizations in Thailand, Cambodia, India, Philippines, Indonesia and Bangladesh, concluded that, \"the main agenda for golden rice is not malnutrition but garnering greater support and acceptance for genetic engineering amongst the public, the scientific community and funding agencies.** Given this reality, the promise of golden rice should be taken with a pinch of salt.\" [[51]](#_edn51) **Chapter 8: Changing Your Diet** This chapter describes all the sources of GM foods and explains how to remove them from your diet.

Kennedy then had his scientific advisor look into the issue. The book was eventually \"credited with beginning the American environmental movement, the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the 1972 ban on DDT.\" [[52]](#_edn52) **Officials around the world who are in charge of GM food policy need to be made aware of the foods' dangers and of how their approval was based on politics, not science.

The revelations in this book might change that.** **Epilogue** This section ties in recent events with a summary of some of the salient points from the book. **Excerpt:** **There are the numerous ways in which industry researchers apparently doctored their studies to avoid finding problems with GM foods.** For example, Aventis heated StarLink corn four times longer than standard before testing for intact protein; Monsanto fed mature animals diets with only one tenth of their protein derived from GM soy; researchers injected cows with one forty-seventh the amount of rbGH before testing the level of hormone in the milk and pasteurized milk 120 times longer than normal to see if the hormone was destroyed; and Monsanto used stronger acid and more than 1,250 times the amount of a digestive enzyme recommended by international standards to prove how quickly their protein degraded. **Cows that got sick were dropped from Monsanto's rbGH studies, while cows that got pregnant before treatment were counted as support that the drug didn't interfere with fertility; differences in composition between Roundup Ready soy and natural soy were omitted from a published paper; antibody reactions by rats fed rbGH were ignored by the FDA; and deaths from rats fed the FlavrSavr tomato remain unexplained.** Overturning a myth is not easy and cannot be accomplished by only a few individuals.

I didn't read it until today as the couple times I saw it, the title didn't grab me. When a friend forwarded it to me today, I finally read it and was amazed! The Senate's Republican leadership, the CIA, and the Army all want the truth exposed on the torture cover-ups and are willing to push to make this happen! Amazingly, when I clicked on the link my friend sent to confirm that this article was indeed from UPI, it had disappeared from the UPI website. This is highly unusual. So I did a Google search on the title. The first item on the list was the UPI website, but when I clicked there, the article was gone. When I clicked on the \"Cached\" link on the lower right hand of the entry, however, the article still shows up as from the UPI website. Looking through the Google results, I saw that the only major US paper to pick up this article was the *Washington Times *(fourth Google entry)*.* I clicked on the link only to find it had disappeared from their website as well! I do a lot of research, but have never seen recently reported articles disappear like this. Both articles show up still in the Google cache (an earlier recording of the article made by Google). You can confirm this for yourself by going to [Google](http://www.google.com) and typing \"Army, CIA want torture truths exposed\" (use quotation marks). First click on the articles, and then on the \"Cached\" link at the lower right hand of the selection. I suspect someone doesn't want this article widely read! Below is the URL of the original UPI article, though it is no longer posted there. The second link below is to the excellent alternative news website, Common Dreams, which still has the article posted. In spite of the fact that this article appears to have been suppressed, the truth continues to come out big time. As you likely know, George Tenet, the director of the CIA announced his resignation on Thursday. Then yesterday (Friday, June 5th) the CIA's deputy director of operations announced his resignation (see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3775423.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3775423.stm)).

Over the past weekend and into this week, devastating new allegations have emerged putting Stephen Cambone, the first Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, firmly in the crosshairs and bringing a new wave of allegations cascading down on the head of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, when he scarcely had time to catch his breath from the previous ones. Even worse for Rumsfeld and his coterie of neo-conservative true believers who have run the Pentagon for the past 3 years, three major institutions in the Washington power structure have decided that after almost a full presidential term of being treated with contempt and abuse by them, it's payback time. Those three institutions are: The United States Army, the Central Intelligence Agency and the old, relatively moderate but highly experienced Republican leadership in the United States Senate. None of those groups is chopped liver: Taken together they comprise a devastating Grand Slam. The spearhead for the new wave of revelations and allegations - but by no means the only source of them - is veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh. In a major article published in the New Yorker this week and posted on to its Web-site Saturday, Hersh revealed that a high-level Pentagon operation code-named Copper Green \"encouraged physical coercion and sexual humiliation\" of Iraqi prisoners. He also cited Pentagon sources and consultants as saying that photographing the victims of such abuse was an explicit part of the program meant to force the victims into becoming blackmailed reliable informants. Hersh further claimed in his article that Rumsfeld himself approved the program and that one of his four or five top aides, Cambone, set it up in Baghdad and ran it. These allegations of course are anathema to the White House, Rumsfeld and their media allies. In a highly unusual step for any newspaper, the editorially neo-conservative tabloid New York Post ran an editorial Monday seeking to ridicule and discredit Hersh. However, it presented absolutely no evidence to query, let alone discredit the substance of his article and allegations. Instead, the New York Post editorial inadvertently pointed out one, but by no means all, of the major sources for Hersh's information. The editorial alleged that Hersh had received much of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:disappearedarticle.txt:1:4c5442624a9f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9245, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "disappearedarticle.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "disappearedarticle", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "House, Rumsfeld and their media allies. In a highly unusual step for any newspaper, the editorially neo-conservative tabloid New York Post ran an editorial Monday seeking to ridicule and discredit Hersh. However, it presented absolutely no evidence to query, let alone discredit the substance of his article and allegations. Instead, the New York Post editorial inadvertently pointed out one, but by no means all, of the major sources for Hersh's information. The editorial alleged that Hersh had received much of his material from the CIA. Based on the material Hersh quoted, his legendary intelligence community contacts were probably sources for some of his information. However, Hersh has also enjoyed close personal relations with many now high-ranking officers in the United States Army, going all the way back to his prize-winning coverage and scoops in Vietnam more than 30 years ago. Indeed, intelligence and regular Army sources have told UPI that senior officers and officials in both communities are sickened and outraged by the revelations of mass torture and abuse, and also by the incompetence involved, in the Abu Ghraib prison revelations. These sources also said that officials all the way up to the highest level in both the Army and the Agency are determined not to be scapegoated, or allow very junior soldiers or officials to take the full blame for the excesses. President George W. Bush in his weekly radio address Saturday claimed that the Abu Ghraib abuses were only \"the actions of a few\" and that they did not \"reflect the true character of the Untied States armed forces.\" But what enrages many serving senior Army generals and U.S. top-level intelligence community professionals is that the \"few\" in this case were not primarily the serving soldiers who were actually encouraged to carry out the abuses and even then take photos of the victims, but that they were encouraged to do so, with the Army's well-established safeguards against such abuses deliberately removed by high-level Pentagon civilian officials. Abuse and even torture of prisoners happens in almost every war on every side. But well-run professional armies, and the U.S. Army has always been one, take great pains to guard against it and limit it as much as possible. Even in cases where torture excesses are regarded as essential to extract tactical information and save lives, commanders in most modern armies have taken care to limit such \"dirty work\" to very small units, usually from special forces, and to keep it as secret as possible. For senior Army professionals know that allowing patterns of abuse and torture to metastasize in any army is annihilating to its morale and tactical effectiveness. Torturers usually make lousy combat soldiers, which is why combat soldiers in every major army hold them in contempt. Therefore, several U.S. military officers told UPI, the idea of using regular Army soldiers, including some even just from the Army Reserve", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:disappearedarticle.txt:2:f22b4a91102f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9246, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "disappearedarticle.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "disappearedarticle", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "small units, usually from special forces, and to keep it as secret as possible. For senior Army professionals know that allowing patterns of abuse and torture to metastasize in any army is annihilating to its morale and tactical effectiveness. Torturers usually make lousy combat soldiers, which is why combat soldiers in every major army hold them in contempt. Therefore, several U.S. military officers told UPI, the idea of using regular Army soldiers, including some even just from the Army Reserve or National Guard, and encouraging them to inflict such abuses ran contrary to received military wisdom and to the ingrained standards and traditions of the U.S. Army. The widespread taking of photographs of the victims of such abuses, they said, clearly revealed that civilian \"amateurs\" and not regular Army or intelligence community professionals were the driving force in shaping and running the programs under which these abuses occurred. Hersh has spearheaded the waves of revelations of shocking abuse. But other major U.S. media organizations are now charging in behind him to confirm and extend his reports. They are able to do so because many senior veteran professionals in both the CIA and the Army were disgusted by the revelations of the torture excesses. Now they are being listened to with suddenly receptive ears on Capitol Hill. Republican members in the House of Representatives have kept discipline and silence on the revelations. But with the exception of the increasingly isolated and embarrassed Senate Republican Leader, Bill Frist of Tennessee, other senior mainstream figures in the GOP Senate majority have refused to go along with any cover-up. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Richard Lugar of Indiana, Pat Roberts of Kansas and John Warner of Virginia have all been outspoken in their condemnation of the torture excesses. And they did so even before the latest, most far-reaching and worst of the allegations and reports surfaced. Warner, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, lost no time in hauling Rumsfeld before it to testify. The pattern of the latest wave of revelations is clear: They are coming from significant numbers of senior figures in both the U.S. military and intelligence services. They reflect the disgust and contempt widely felt in both communities at the excesses; and at long last, they are being listened to seriously by senior Republican, as well as Democratic, senators on Capitol Hill. Rumsfeld and his team of top lieutenants have therefore now lost the confidence, trust and respect of both the Army and intelligence establishments. Key elements of the political establishment even of the ruling GOP now recognize this. Yet Rumsfeld and his lieutenants remain determined to hang on to power, and so far President Bush has shown every sign of wanting to keep them there. The scandal, therefore, is far from over.

He was in Thailand on Dec. 26th, the date that will be etched in the memories of many millions in Asia who forever lost loved ones and saw tragedy beyond comprehension. We who live far removed get only a glimpse of the tragic reality from our television sets and newspapers. We simply cannot imagine what it is like to be in the midst of this tangle of dead bodies rotting under the tropical sun, all victims of a still unfolding disaster spread along hundreds of miles of now destroyed coastland. So many hoping desperately that their loved ones might still be alive, yet having to search through putrid corpses knowing that their worst fears have more than likely come true.... As soon as the killer wave hit, Bill became a man on a mission. Completely forgetting about the extended vacation and rich adventures he had experienced, he set immediately to do everything he could to help in this time of great need. A former military man, his excellent organization skills came in handy. He soon found himself organizing and coordinating a small army of foreign volunteers doing their very best to alleviate the massive suffering. I've been on Bill's email list ever since he left on his trip almost a year ago. He's shared many fascinating experiences, from meeting a king and royal family, to leisurely beach holidays, to times of deep spiritual retreat with special friends. But what is happening now has put all of that into the seemingly distant past. Now is the time for action. I share with you below a recent email Bill sent out. A sense of exhaustion is felt in his words, yet there is deep inspiration in the face of great adversity here. May we all be inspired to rise to the highest and best of which we are capable in times of great need. And let us continue to send prayers and whatever support we can afford. Here's his email: Hi all, Thank you for all the love and support. I'm okay. Very tired, working very hard. I helped create and now run the Foreign Volunteers Center, some 350 people from many countries who ache to help. Here's some highlights: New Year's - no one said Happy New Year. We didn't know what to say. I sat quietly in my room and prayed.

The tropical climate is hell on decomposition. I helped. I lasted about 6 or 7 hours until I saw something that was too much. I stopped and got help. I called my Dad. He helped more. We've got counseling for the volunteers, thank God. The Thai's and professionals have now taken over; no more of our volunteers work with the dead. Thank God for that too. Translators, hospital visitors, distributors of information, food, supplies; truck loaders, data base creators and compilers, hand holders, listeners, counselors, volunteer directors, coordinators of every kind, all these and more the volunteers do daily. Bangkok - a falang came to create a childrens' home for the newly orphaned Bulgarian embalmers gave me their card...\"we're going to our hotel to rest, call us and we'll come right back.\" Denmark - a special forces trooper formed a team and flew to a remote island to help a distressed family search for loved ones for two days. America - A flight attendant from California took leave and flew here, just to help. Hungary - Zoldt, a big beautiful man, one day in the temple, next with an embassy, next creating a data base in Hungarian...wow Mike - origins unknown, leading a cleanup effort in a remote town Amy - American living in Thailand going to villages, assessing needs for food, clothes, cooking utensils, bare basics, then gets and delivers them. Her friends pour money into her bank account, she pours it into the villagers. Japan, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Holland, England, Canada, Mexico, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Poland the list goes on - each pouring their light into this dark time. Sadly, many survivors work tirelessly, driving themselves. We offer counseling. They just work. It helps them for now. Their stories stagger me. There is too much to tell, but this gives a snapshot of the foreigner's efforts. You cannot imagine the numbers and efforts of the Thais themselves. Its amazing.

For a very special treat in commemoration of all those who lost their lives and families in this disaster, I invite you to enjoy the beautiful five-minute song and slide show titled \"We are one family\" at [http://www.hiddengifts.org/we_are_one/](http://www.hiddengifts.org/we_are_one/) For those with a dial-up connection, the download will take about five minutes, but it's worth the wait. As an ever increasing number of people remember that we are all one family, we will see ever more powerful shifts in this world towards love and cooperation. For those interested in making a contribution to relieve the immense physical and emotional suffering resulting from this disaster, I recommend the following two organizations as being the best in the usage of their resources: [http://www.nonviolenceinternational.net/](http://www.nonviolenceinternational.net/) Non-violence International had an office in Aceh, the worst his area of Indonesia. They lost office workers.

Yet rather than look within, most prefer to look outward for wisdom, thus sustaining a dependence on a vast hierarchy that stretches between the individual and the Divine. In all our wanderings away from the Divine, humankind has obscured its most compelling features through a persistent belief in limitations arising out of the controlling mechanisms of this hierarchy. The Divine dances outside of the confines of any hierarchical structures. It is complete within itself, and has a singular purpose of demonstrating the collective potential of all life within the universe. It is the archetype of perfection. It is the standard bearer of each soul's innate design and ultimate destiny. The essence of the Divine is far beyond mental conception, yet humanity's tendency is to resort to the limiting language of the hierarchical paradigm to define and understand it. **The Hierarchical Paradigm: Searching for Connection and Wholeness** When people are unaware of their inner wisdom and wholeness, they tend to search for order and security outside themselves. Uncertain of their place within the hierarchical order of the world, they define themselves based upon their insecurities. Individuals thus become only pieces of their wholeness and like shards of glass from a beautiful vase, they bear little resemblance to their aggregate beauty. Within the hierarchy, many in high positions of power have taken advantage of our collective insecurities in attempting to guide the development of all humankind. They have obscured the direct connection between the individual and the Divine through a variety of means designed to intercede between our inner essence and our divine source. **Each individual can come to know themselves to be free of all forms of hierarchical control.** This is not to imply that we should not trust others or join together in bonds of friendship and community. It is simply a reminder that relative truth is constantly shifting in the hands of those who desire to control. And even when the motive for their controlling behaviors may be of good will, it is still a form of control. When the revealers of \"truth\" within the hierarchy withhold and suppress information, they are usually positioning themselves to maintain or acquire more power rather than to disseminate empowerment to all. The desire for connection and wholeness is a fuel that drives us to seek out and explore the hierarchical paradigm. This inner longing provides us with the motivation to seek help and guidance from a specific group within the hierarchy, and in so doing, cultivate a sense of belonging and connection. Furthermore, the hierarchical paradigm is a stage whereby we develop a sense of connection to some grand, encompassing vision. This is why", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:divinewisdomunderstanding.txt:0:a30986cf482e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9256, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "divinewisdomunderstanding.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "divinewisdomunderstanding", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "rather than to disseminate empowerment to all.

This inner longing provides us with the motivation to seek help and guidance from a specific group within the hierarchy, and in so doing, cultivate a sense of belonging and connection. Furthermore, the hierarchical paradigm is a stage whereby we develop a sense of connection to some grand, encompassing vision. This is why the hierarchy nurtures prophets who point toward a greater vision. Spiritual leaders are able to peer deeply beneath the surface reality of life and experience how intricately connected every life form is, and how the composite of all life is intelligent far beyond measure. These visionary leaders can thus interpret reality through their personal abilities to perceive and express life's dimensional depth and limitless intelligence. Yet no one is able to articulate life's full dimensional depth and breadth with the tools of language. They can only, at best, describe their interpretation or their impressions. In actuality, all of us are able to peer beneath the surface reality of life and perceive a unique vision of the universe. We require only time and intention to develop our own interpretations. And this is precisely what many great spiritual leaders have taught. Life's deeper essence is not an absolute to be experienced by the chosen few, but an evolving, dynamic intelligence that wears as many faces as there are life forms.** No group or people has the exclusive portal into the universe by which the Divine expresses itself in all its majesty. The portal is open and available to all, because [the Divine is within all things](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#seeing).** Those recognized as great prophets each produced a vision of the universe beyond what was currently defined by the hierarchy. Because their interpretations were articulated with authority and depth of insight, they became a target of debate among various groups in the hierarchy. This debate then created a polarity of belief. A sympathetic constituency emerged to defend and embellish their leader's interpretation, while established groups held it in contempt of previously held beliefs. Invariably, the leader's vision became confined and shaped into dogma by followers who desired to create a new religion or sect. Thus, this infusion of fresh insight quietly receded into the hands of the hierarchy, where its deeper meaning was obscured by the very fact that it was incorporated into a rigid structure that both protected and promoted it. **The Transformation Paradigm: Inner Wisdom and Understanding** A new paradigm is emerging that promotes a clear connection of individual consciousness to the compelling features of the Divine without the intervention of a hierarchy. This is when the fables and myths of history step into the light and become known as they were originally intended.

This is when the fables and myths of history step into the light and become known as they were originally intended. This is the time when language will be transformed into a new form of communication that breaks down all barriers of control. Personal transformation, through the awakening of inner wisdom and understanding, is the pathway into wholeness. The transformation paradigm is initiated simply by the recognition that rather than the dependency-inducing ways of the hierarchical paradigm, there are accelerated, independent pathways that bypass the hierarchy and lead to self-mastery. These new pathways lead to the divine wisdom and understanding that is present within all of us. This wisdom can be accessed through the practice of three [principles of transformation](https://www.WantToKnow.info/transformation): seeing the Divine in all, nurturance of life, and gratitude. The application of these life principles disengages individuals from the controlling elements of the hierarchy, thus initiating the transformation experience. As there are relative truths, there are relative freedoms.** As individuals evolve through the hierarchical process, an ever-increasing sense of freedom is gained, yet external forces continue to exert control through limiting language, confining belief systems, and more.** These controlling influences lead to continued reliance upon the hierarchy as it unceasingly attempts to impose a sense of inequality between us. The underlying equation of the hierarchical paradigm is: individual + hierarchy = God connection. In the case of personal transformation it is: individual + inner wisdom and understanding = divine equality with all. **The Synthesis Paradigm: Integration ** The time has come to integrate the dominant paradigm of the hierarchy with the liberating transformation paradigm. This integration occurs naturally once we have fully explored the two paradigms and develop a synthesis paradigm whereby transformation is attained by searching for connection and wholeness through our own inner wisdom and understanding. **It is this combination of release from dependency on the hierarchy and transformation from within that initiates the synthesis paradigm.** Once we take responsibility for our own transformation and integration, it does not mean that the hierarchy is to be shunned or avoided. The hierarchy is quite benign as a manipulative force and merely represents one important stage in the journey toward wholeness. What is being set in motion now is the initial preparation for these paradigm shifts. More specifically, these paradigms will be simultaneously played out over the coming years. As always, it will be the choice of each one of us as to which paradigm we embrace in our journey. All of the highest imaginings of humanity are yet unaware of our deepest foundation.

We have sought the upper reaches of the building, yet remain unaware of the foundation's design. It is here, at the very core of existence that the Divine is bursting forth with its creative energy while simultaneously reintegrating with its invitation to wholeness. It is here that equality is realized, not in the lofty places of relative truth lodged in the hierarchy, but rather in the deepest part of the foundational plan of life's original source and ultimate destiny. The origin and destiny of existence is the tone of equality in life. [Listen for this tone](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#seeing) - this frequency of vibration - and follow it back into the very foundation from whence all things arise and return.

That's the way some adults look at troubled kids. Maybe you've heard the saying, \"A bird with a broken wing will never fly as high.\" I'm sure that T. J. Ware was made to feel this way almost every day in school. By high school, T. J. was the most celebrated troublemaker in his town. Teachers literally cringed when they saw his name posted on their classroom lists for the next semester. He wasn't very talkative, didn't answer questions and got into lots of fights. He had flunked almost every class by the time he entered his senior year, yet was being passed on each year to a higher grade level. Teachers didn't want to have him again the following year. T. J. was moving on, but definitely not moving up. I met T. J. for the first time at a weekend leadership retreat. All the students at school had been invited to sign up for ACE training, a program designed to have students become more involved in their communities. T. J. was one of 405 students who signed up. When I showed up to lead their first retreat, the community leaders gave me this overview of the attending students: **\"We have a total spectrum represented today, from the student body president to T. J. Ware, the boy with the longest arrest record in the history of town.\" Somehow, I knew that I wasn't the first to hear about T. J.'s darker side as the first words of introduction.** At the start of the retreat, T. J. was literally standing outside the circle of students, against the back wall, with that \"go ahead, impress me\" look on his face. He didn't readily join the discussion groups, didn't seem to have much to say. But slowly, the interactive games drew him in. The ice really melted when the groups started building a list of positive and negative things that had occurred at school that year. T. J. had some definite thoughts on those situations. The other students in T. J.'s group welcomed his comments. **All of a sudden T. J. felt like a part of the group, and before long he was being treated like a leader.** He was saying things that made a lot of sense, and everyone was listening.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:dontjudgeabook.txt:0:d6b9e4de2bbe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9265, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "dontjudgeabook.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "dontjudgeabook", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "in.

J. felt like a part of the group, and before long he was being treated like a leader.** He was saying things that made a lot of sense, and everyone was listening. T. J. was a smart guy, and he had some great ideas. The next day, T. J. was very active in all the sessions. By the end of the retreat, he had joined the Homeless Project team. He knew something about poverty, hunger and hopelessness. The other students on the team were impressed with his passionate concern and ideas. They elected T. J. co-chairman of the team. The student council president would be taking his instruction from T. J. Ware. When T. J. showed up at school on Monday morning, he arrived to a firestorm. A group of teachers were protesting to the school principal about his being elected co-chairman. The very first communitywide service project was to be a giant food drive, organized by the Homeless Project team. These teachers couldn't believe that the principal would allow this crucial beginning to a prestigious, three-year action plan to stay in the incapable hands of T. J. Ware. They reminded the principal, \"He has an arrest record as long as your arm. He'll probably steal half the food.\" Mr. Coggshall reminded them that the purpose of the ACE program was to uncover any positive passion that a student had and reinforce its practice until true change can take place. The teachers left the meeting shaking their heads in disgust, firmly convinced that failure was imminent. **Two weeks later, T. J. and his friends led a group of 70 students in a drive to collect food. They collected a school record: 2,854 cans of food in just two hours. It was enough to fill the empty shelves in two neighborhood centers, and the food took care of needy families in the area for 75 days.** The local newspaper covered the event with a full-page article the next day. That newspaper story was posted on the main bulletin board at school, where everyone could see it. T. J.'s picture was up there for doing something great, for leading a record-setting food drive. Every day he was reminded about what he did. He was being acknowledged as leadership material. T. J. started showing up at school every day and answered questions from teachers for the first time. He led a second project, collecting 300 blankets and 1,000 pairs of shoes for the homeless shelter. The event he started now yields 9,000 cans of food in one day, taking care of 70 percent of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:dontjudgeabook.txt:1:014ca4f2fe57", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9266, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "dontjudgeabook.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "dontjudgeabook", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "doing something great, for leading a record-setting food drive.

But once it has healed, it can fly higher than the rest. T. J. got a job. He became productive. He is flying quite nicely these days. **Note:** This story showing so well how it is best not to judge a book by its cover is taken from the inspiring book series [Chicken Soup for the Soul](http://www.chickensoup.com).

According to a new report by the [Center for Public Integrity](http://www.publicintegrity.org/rx/), congressmen are outnumbered two to one by lobbyists for an industry that spends roughly a $100 million a year in campaign contributions and lobbying expenses to protect its profits. **One reason those profits have exceeded Wall Street expectations is the Medicare prescription drug bill.** It was passed three-and-a-half years ago, but as ***60 Minutes*** correspondent **Steve Kroft** reports, its effects are still reverberating through the halls of Congress, providing a window into how the lobby works. The unorthodox roll call on one of the most expensive bills ever placed before the House of Representatives began in the middle of the night, long after most people in Washington had switched off C-SPAN and gone to sleep. ** The only witnesses were congressional staffers, hundreds of lobbyists, and U.S. Representatives like Dan Burton, R-Ind., and Walter Jones, R-N.C. ** **\"The pharmaceutical lobbyists wrote the bill,\" says Jones. \"The bill was over 1,000 pages. And it got to the members of the House that morning, and we voted for it at about 3 a.m. in the morning.\" ** Why did the vote finally take place at 3 a.m.? \"Well, I think a lot of the shenanigans that were going on that night, they didn't want on national television in primetime,\" according to Burton. **\"I've been in politics for 22 years,\" says Jones, \"and it was the ugliest night I have ever seen in 22 years.\" ** The legislation was the cornerstone of Republican's domestic agenda and would extend limited prescription drugs coverage under Medicare to 41 million Americans, including 13 million who had never been covered before. **At an estimated cost of just under $400 billion over 10 years, it was the largest entitlement program in more than 40 years, and the debate broke down along party lines. ** [Editorial note:", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:drugcompanycorruption.txt:0:35382d686d45", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9268, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "drugcompanycorruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "drugcompanycorruption", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Jones, \"and it was the ugliest night I have ever seen in 22 years.\" ** The legislation was the cornerstone of Republican's domestic agenda and would extend limited prescription drugs coverage under Medicare to 41 million Americans, including 13 million who had never been covered before. **At an estimated cost of just under $400 billion over 10 years, it was the largest entitlement program in more than 40 years, and the debate broke down along party lines. ** [Editorial note: Usually Republicans are against entitlement programs while Democrats support them. Why was it the opposite in this case?] But when it came time cast ballots, the Republican leadership discovered that a number of key Republican congressmen had defected and joined the Democrats, arguing that the bill was too expensive and a sellout to the drug companies. Burton and Jones were among them. \"They're suppose to have 15 minutes to leave the voting machines open and it was open for almost three hours,\" Burton explains. \"The votes were there to defeat the bill for two hours and 45 minutes and we had leaders going around and gathering around individuals, trying to twist their arms to get them to change their votes.\" **Jones says the arm-twisting was horrible. \"We had a good friend from Michigan, Nick Smith, and they threatened to work against his son who wanted to run for his seat when he retired,\" he recalls. \"I saw a woman, a member of the House, a lady, crying when they came around her, trying to get her to change her votes. It was -it was ugly.\" ** When the prescription drug bill finally passed shortly before dawn, in the longest roll call in the history of the House of Representatives, much of the credit went to former Congressman Billy Tauzin, R-La., who steered it through the house. \"It's just a messy process,\" Tauzin says. \"I mean, the old adage about if you like sausage or laws, you should not watch either one of them being made is true. It's a messy process.\" Tauzin says that the voting machines were open for three hours \"because the vote wasn't finished.\" As for arms being twisted? \"People were being talked to,\" he says. And of Walter Jones' comment that it was the \"ugliest night\" he had \"ever seen in politics in 22 years?\" \"Well, he's a young member,\" counters Tauzin with a laugh. \"Had he been around for 25 years, he'd have seen some uglier nights.\" It certainly wasn't ugly for the drug lobby which invested more than $10 million in campaign contributions during the last election and has been a source of lucrative employment opportunities for congressmen when they leave office. **Former senators Dennis Deconcini, D-Ariz., and Steve Symms, R-Idaho, and former congressmen like Tom Downey, D-N.Y.; Vic Fazio, D-Calif.; Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., and former House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., all registered", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:drugcompanycorruption.txt:1:1b522e8fd075", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9269, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "drugcompanycorruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "drugcompanycorruption", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "he been around for 25 years, he'd have seen some uglier nights.\" It certainly wasn't ugly for the drug lobby which invested more than $10 million in campaign contributions during the last election and has been a source of lucrative employment opportunities for congressmen when they leave office. **Former senators Dennis Deconcini, D-Ariz., and Steve Symms, R-Idaho, and former congressmen like Tom Downey, D-N.Y.; Vic Fazio, D-Calif.; Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., and former House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., all registered as lobbyists for the drug industry and worked on the prescription drug bill. ** \"I can tell you that when the bill passed, there were better than 1,000 pharmaceutical lobbyists working on this,\" says Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. Dingell has been in Congress for 52 years and is the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee which shares jurisdiction over Medicare. He says the bill would not have passed without the efforts of the drug lobby. \"There is probably a lotta truth in it that the bill was stacked in their benefit. And it's probably also true that it was written by their lobbyists,\" he says. Says Jones: \"You couldn't even walk to the steps of the Capitol without having somebody, maybe one or two, coming up to you to say, 'Can't you change your vote? Can't you vote for this bill?' \" **Why was the drug lobby was so interested in this bill and what did it have to gain? Ron Pollack the executive director of [Families USA](http://www.familiesusa.org), a nonpartisan health care watchdog group, says it all boiled down to a key provision in the legislation. It prohibited Medicare and the federal government from using its vast purchasing power to negotiate lower prices directly from the drug companies. ** \"The key goal was to make sure there'd be no interference in the drug companies' abilities to charge high prices and to continue to increase those prices,\" says Pollack. Pollack says there's no question that this was prompted by the pharmaceutical lobby. \"They were the ones who wanted to make sure Medicare could charge high prices and to continue to increase those prices,\" he said. The drug industry says that competition among private insurance plans that service the Medicare program help keep prices low. But Families USA reported in a January study that **Medicare patients are being charged nearly 60 percent more for the top 20 drugs than veterans pay under a program run by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. ** For example, Lipitor, a popular cholesterol drug, the cheapest Medicare price is $785 for a years supply - 50 percent more than the VA's price of $520. **For Zocor, another cholesterol drug, the best Medicare price is $1,485 for a years supply.

Or what was the idea, the rationale behind not giving the government the ability to negotiate drug prices?\" asks Kroft. Burton says it was simply that the drug companies didn't want it. \"They wanted to make as much as money as possible. And if there's negotiation, like there is in other countries around the world, then they're gonna have their profit margin reduced,\" he says. Before the vote, Congress was told the program would cost a whopping $395 billion over the first 10 years. In fact, Medicare officials already knew it was going to cost a lot more. Burton said he and others were misled. **\"Within two weeks after the bill was passed, everybody knew it was gonna cost well over $500 billion,\" he says. \"And many members of the Congress [who] had voted for it said, 'I would never have voted for it had I known that.' \" Medicare Chief Actuary Richard Foster later told Congress that he revised the cost estimate to $534 before the vote, but was told to withhold the new numbers if he wanted to keep his job. ** During a Congressional hearing, Foster stated: \"It struck me there was a political basis for making that decision. I considered that inappropriate and, in fact, unethical.\" Foster said the person who told him to withhold Congress from getting the revised estimates was Medicare boss Tom Scully. **Scully was the administration's lead negotiator on the prescription drug bill, and at the time was also negotiating a job for himself with a high-powered Washington law firm, where he became a lobbyist with the pharmaceutical industry. ** \"He was negotiating for his job at the same time that the Medicare legislation was being considered. He wound up taking this job 10 days after the president signed this legislation,\" says Pollack. It is but one example of the incestuous relationship between Congress and the industry, and just one of the reasons the pharmaceutical lobby almost never loses a political battle that affects its bottom line. Former Congressman Billy Tauzin, who helped push the prescription drug bill through the House, didn't disagree.

Has the bill been good for the drug industry? \"It's been good for the patients whom the drug industry represents ...\" Tauzin says. \"In terms of profits - [for the drug companies] and volumes, yes.\" Says Kroft: \"Your old friend, John Dingell, says that of the 1,500 bills over the last 8 years dealing with pharmaceutical issues, the drug companies almost, without exception, have gotten what they wanted.\" \"Yeah ... I would think he's correct. They've done fairly well,\" replies Tauzin. Why has this lobby been so successful? The former congressman says he believes it's because they stood for the right things. If Tauzin sounds a lot like a lobbyist for the drug industry, that's because now he is. **Just a few months after the prescription drug bill passed, Tauzin began discussions with the pharmaceutical industry to become its chief lobbyist in Washington.** He says it was one of several lucrative offers he's received just before he got some very bad news. \"I got a call from a doctor in Bethesda who said, 'You got cancer. And it's extremely rare. And it could kill ya.' And then everything changed,\" Tauzin says. Tauzin had a cancerous tumor removed from his intestines and was treated with a new medicine, called Avastin, that had never been used before on that form of cancer. The treatment was successful, and as a result Tauzin says he felt he owed his life to the drug industry. After serving out his congressional term, he accepted a $2 million-a-year job dollar as president of PhRMA - Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. \"There was an extraordinary moment when my wife literally looked me in the eye and said, 'Look, you're gonna do well wherever you go, Billy ... You got a lot a great offers ... And maybe you oughta think about working for the people that struggle everyday to try to invent the medicines that save lives like yours.' \"And that was a pretty important moment in my life,\" Tauzin says. \"And it was the moment I decided that this was the work I wanted to do - headaches and all.\" Jones and Burton agree that the perception of Tauzin's move is not good. \"I mean, when you're pushing so hard for a bill that's controversial and you have to keep the machine open for three hours to get the one vote necessary to pass it, and then, within a matter of months you go to work for the industry that's gonna", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:drugcompanycorruption.txt:4:d9679a943839", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9272, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "drugcompanycorruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "drugcompanycorruption", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "it was the moment I decided that this was the work I wanted to do - headaches and all.\" Jones and Burton agree that the perception of Tauzin's move is not good. \"I mean, when you're pushing so hard for a bill that's controversial and you have to keep the machine open for three hours to get the one vote necessary to pass it, and then, within a matter of months you go to work for the industry that's gonna benefit from it, it does cause you some concern,\" says Burton. They are not the only ones cynical about the decision. **\"You push this bill through that produces a windfall for the drug companies. And then a short time later, you go to work for the drug lobby at a salary of $2 million. That doesn't look good,\" says Kroft. ** \"There was nothing I could've done in my life after leaving Congress that wouldn't have had - I didn't have some impact on in 25 years in Congress ... If that looks bad to you, have at it,\" Tauzin says. \"That's the truth.\" In fairness to Tauzin and former Medicare chief Tom Scully, they weren't the only public officials involved with the prescription drug bill who later went to work for the pharmaceutical industry. Just before the vote, Tauzin cited the people who had been most helpful in getting it passed. Among them: John McManus, the staff director of the Ways and Means subcommittee on Health. Within a few months, he left Congress and started his own lobbying firm. Among his new clients was PhRMA, Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Merck. Linda Fishman, from the majority side of the Finance Committee, left to become a lobbyist with the drug manufacturer Amgen. Pat Morrisey, chief of staff of the Energy and Commerce Committee, took a job lobbying for drug companies Novartis and Hoffman-La Roche. Jeremy Allen went to Johnson and Johnson. Kathleen Weldon went to lobby for Biogen, a Bio-tech company. Jim Barnette left to lobby for Hoffman-La Roche. **In all, at least 15 congressional staffers, congressmen and federal officials left to go to work for the pharmaceutical industry, whose profits were increased by several billion dollars. ** **\"I mean, they - they have unlimited resources. Unlimited,\" Burton says. \"And when they push real hard to get something accomplished in the Congress of the United States, they can get it done.\" ** In January, one of the first things the new Democratic House of Representatives did was to make it mandatory for Medicare to negotiate lower prices with the drug companies.

Drawing on her own work and on her thoughtful analysis of research, company financial statements, and investigative reports into drug development and marketing, Angell writes with the unambiguous and unyielding style that *Journal* readers came to expect and trust. By Angell's account, the current slide toward the commercialization and corruption of clinical research coincided with the election of President Ronald Reagan in 1980 and the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, a new set of laws that permitted and encouraged universities and small businesses to patent discoveries from research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Research paid for by the public to serve the public instantly became a private, and salable, good, one that is producing drug sales of more than $200 billion a year. Commercialization had both specific and broad effects. Readers of this journal and others are familiar with investigations into the control that research sponsors at pharmaceutical companies exert on the design and analysis of clinical trials (including the distortion of primary outcome measures in trials) and the issue of reporting, nonreporting, and biased reporting of results. Angell reminds us of the increasingly cozy relationships between big industry and the faculties of universities. **Not only are narcissistic donors renaming the medical schools; they are buying access to the best minds of their faculties.** Angell's examples of the large consulting fees paid by industry to individual faculty members and to NIH scientists and directors are astounding. The broader effects are felt in the commercialization of universities, medical faculties, and our profession. In 2000, in a letter written in response to Angell's *Journal* editorial, \"Is Academic Medicine for Sale?\" a reader supplied the answer: \"No. The current owner is very happy with it.\" **The increasing intrusion of industry into medical education and the almost complete domination of continuing medical education (especially regarding drugs) by the marketing departments of large pharmaceutical companies are a scandal.** The same companies also spend heavily to lobby governments. According to Angell, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, **the pharmaceutical industry's U.S. trade association has \"the largest lobby in Washington,\"** which in 2002 employed 675 lobbyists (including 26 former members of Congress) at a cost of more than $91 million. The result has been above-average growth in corporate profits during both Republican and Democratic administrations. **The most recent and perplexing lobbying effort caused Congress explicitly to prohibit Medicare from using its huge purchasing power to get lower prices for drugs**, thus opening up a dollar pipeline, in the form of higher drug prices, directly from taxpayers to corporate coffers. These changes, along with the cave-in by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 that permitted direct-to-consumer advertising to bypass mention in their ads of all but the most serious side effects, have further augmented profits. The overall effect has been a corruption not only of science but also of the dissemination of science.

Angell documents that, contrary to what they claim, large pharmaceutical companies have \"paltry output\" in innovative research. In fact, as permitted by Bayh-Dole, pharmaceutical companies buy discoveries coming out of the basic-science enterprises, including universities and publicly funded granting agencies. **The real costs of research on drugs by pharmaceutical companies are much less than the oft-quoted $800 million or so per new drug brought to market. **Most of their research is on me-too drugs -unoriginal, tax-deductible (and thus paid for in lost taxes by the public), and mostly unnecessary, except for corporate profits and executive bonuses. The Big Pharma companies are, in essence, manufacturing and marketing companies. Angell's concluding chapter, the least convincing one in an otherwise fascinating and penetrating book, contains the solutions, all of them predictable (and probably unattainable): control me-too drugs, re-empower the FDA, oversee Big Pharma's clinical research, curb patent length and abuse, keep Big Pharma out of medical education, make company financial statements transparent (so we can tell what the costs of research really are, as distinct from marketing), and impose price controls or guidelines. Granted, the problems are so prevalent and the corporate tentacles so entwined with our way of being that it is hard to see what else to recommend. **But perhaps Angell is right. We must change the way we manage research and the development and distribution of new drugs. Not only are health and health care at risk, but so are the research enterprise and the reputations of universities and governments. The integrity of scientific research is too important to be left to the invisible hand of the marketplace.** John Hoey, M.D. *[john.hoey@cma.ca](mailto:john.hoey@cma.ca)* **See our archive of revealing news articles at ****[**https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles)**** ** Your tax-deductible donations, however large or small, help greatly to support this important work.

In both countries, clinical drug tests are paid for by the pharmas, who tweak the trials' design for the best possible results.

The drugs are approved for marketing by regulators, whose salaries are mostly financed by [the pharmaceutical companies]. The medicines are then prescribed by doctors routinely courted with pharma gifts - from free pens to family skiing holidays - meant to persuade them to change their prescribing habits.\" This article shows how the Internet has forced the drug companies to begin to report the all the facts on their studies and funding.

Companies, they said, could use the intimate understanding so acquired to address customers' needs and preferences, on the companies' terms. What no one foresaw was the shocking extent to which the internet would change the terms of trade between corporations and society. Certainly not that one of the world's largest drug companies, which is among the richest and most influential industries of all time, would be the first victim of the shift. The crisis that began the containment of pharma power is a runaway rate of drug injury. In England alone, reactions to drugs that led to hospitalisation followed by death are estimated at 5,700 a year and could actually be closer to 10,000, according to a study in The British Medical Journal in July. The researchers reckon that adverse drug reactions are costing the NHS 466m [US$ 850 million] a year. Drug injury has been worrying experts for decades. But after the thalidomide tragedies of the 1950s, the subject failed to catch fire for politicians and the public until the recent antidepressant controversy. Last month, that debate made headlines when Britain's GlaxoSmithKline, the world's second-largest pharma, denied any wrongdoing, but agreed to pay $2.5m to settle a lawsuit filed by the State of New York accusing it of fraud for concealing evidence of its antidepressant Seroxat's potential for harming children, while doing them no measurable good. In a sequel last week, a group of about two dozen American parents sued GSK seeking refunds for treatment of their children with the drug. The GSK suit created the tipping point in the pharmas' change of fortune and has revealed the force behind it. The formal complaint drew heavily on research by public health campaigners and consumer advocates about the hazards of antidepressant use. These activists had toiled in deepest obscurity - some of them, for a decade - until their discoveries were featured on a Panorama programme, 'Secrets of Seroxat', in autumn 2002. A follow-up broadcast the next spring, 'Emails from the edge', analysed 1,370 messages from viewers about the first programme, mostly from people reporting antidepressant withdrawal reactions including shock-like sensations in their heads, and thoughts about self-mutilation, violence and suicide. The outcry that followed forced GSK to make a stunning admission. In June 2003, it corrected its prescribing instructions for Seroxat, **revising its estimate of the risk of withdrawal symptoms from one in 500 to one in four**.

In June 2003, it corrected its prescribing instructions for Seroxat, **revising its estimate of the risk of withdrawal symptoms from one in 500 to one in four**. Infinitely more frightening than that reluctant confirmation of a drug's potential for harm was that in the years GSK spent denying it, this pharma had the backing of institutions that we, the public, rely on to protect us from poisoning by prescription. The Royal College of Psychiatrists had insisted only a year earlier that 'there is no evidence that antidepressant drugs can cause dependence syndromes'; a patient information leaflet approved by a regulatory body also said as much. The events that led to Seroxat's exposure would seem to suggest that it was television power that forced GSK to recant. But it was really the internet that allowed public health activists to do an end run around GSK's and the medical authorities' denials of the drug's risks. An explosion of websites dedicated to vivid accounts of antidepressant reactions told these campaigners about hundreds of thousands affected by a problem that officially did not exist. The internet was 'groaning with evidence'; over time, the 'cover-up became more obvious as the weight of scientific evidence got stronger and public protest grew'. Those are quotations from a magisterial history and analysis of the antidepressant crisis by two leading campaigners, Charles Medawar and Anita Hardon, in *Medicines Out of Control?,* a new book recommended by the Lancet as essential reading for members of the parliamentary committee examining pharma influence on health policy, whose hearings began last week. Health campaigners trying to decide what the pharmas could reasonably be blamed for shared vast stores of data by - among other means - encyclopaedic technical postings on their websites. Some of these sites also feature open access to years of correspondence between the activists and regulatory officials and pharma executives. Postings like these have allowed rapid international co-ordination between the campaigners. Pharmas bent on redeeming their reputations have suddenly begun to use the internet to publish what they once fought for the right to conceal. GSK's first notable response to the filing of the recent lawsuit was to start posting both negative and positive findings from drug tests on its web site.

I realized that for thousands of years this world has been focused on judgmental duality. The mass consensus has long judged most everything in terms of light vs. darkness, good vs. evil, us vs. them. We've been indoctrinated to embrace the light, while avoiding and separating ourselves from darkness, as it is evil. As a result of this judgmental duality, we've ended up in many deep conflicts and wars both in the world and inside of ourselves. I sense that humanity is now on the brink of a paradigm shift. It is time now to embrace both light and darkness, both good and evil, both us and them. It is time to recognize that all of these are simply aspects or manifestations of the same divine spirit, of God, of the All That Is. It's time to open to darkness, evil, and \"them\" as our long-neglected brothers, as divine manifestations of God who can help us to learn and grow. By opening to the darkness, I'm not in the least suggesting that we unleash our base desires and do whatever we want to whoever we want. We need to stop disempowering behaviors whenever possible. I'm suggesting, rather, that we do our best to accept, understand, and learn from the darkness, which causes negative behaviors. I'm suggesting that even as we stop negative behaviors, we open to seeing beyond the behavior to the divine spark at the essence of all beings. In doing this, we allow for deep healing to occur. By accepting and embracing the essence of all people and all parts of ourselves as divine, we open the doors to deep healing and love for all of us. The new paradigm pierces the veil of judgment to see the absolute divinity that lies deep within each of us. No matter how \"evil\" some people or some parts of ourselves may appear from the outside, deep down we are all love. We are all divine. The darkness is a divine teacher with its own divine purpose. We are all here to learn from and love each other. By welcoming back these lost parts of ourselves--these parts of ourselves we have long judged, blamed, and avoided--we not only allow for deep healing, we invite a deep transformation of all humanity into divine beings capable of powerfully spreading love around the planet. I am deeply committed to helping birth this new paradigm by living it as consciously as I can every day and every moment of my life. I invite all who resonate with this to join me. I invite you all to join in transcending the old paradigm of judgmental duality.

The first of two articles below reveals serious problems in various parts of the U.S. economy. It is my belief that the power elite are very possibly planning an economic crash. If you explore the great stock market crash of 1929, you will find that though the vast majority of investors lost large amounts of money, that money did not disappear. It was simply transferred into the hands of the ultra-rich who knew what was coming. The second article shows that the elite are cashing in now. We could be in for some economically depressing times in the near future, though there are too many factors to be certain. Looking at this spiritually, I believe that as long as we both collectively and individually choose to deny or suppress the existence of dark forces both out in the world and within ourselves, the activity of those dark forces is going to increase. If we continue to ignore these forces for much longer, we may find ourselves in a great crisis. The sooner we are willing to acknowledge these dark forces and deal with them in a way that supports what's best for all on the planet, the smoother this transition will be. This, of course, is speculation on my part, but it is speculation based on a lot of deep inside knowledge. I invite each of us to open to acknowledging the dark, hidden places both in ourselves and in the world. You can do this on a personal level through deep prayer and introspection, and on the global level through exploring the reliable, verifiable information on our website at [https://www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) and the many links provided.

Fed Governor Susan Bies says Congress spends like it's dipping into \"a cookie jar.\" St. Louis Fed President William Poole says Social Security is in jeopardy.** In the last two months, Greenspan and at least seven other Fed officials have warned lawmakers about tax and spending policies that have led to record budget and current account gaps. As Greenspan begins in January his last year atop the central bank, the comments suggest that Fed members are concerned his successor will have less room to guide an economic expansion should they have to raise interest rates to counter a plunging dollar or surge in spending. \"If you get to a point of fairly significant long-term structural budget deficits, it begins to impact on the level of long-term interest rates,\" Greenspan told the House Budget Committee on Sept. 8. That means the government must pay higher rates to borrow money, leading to even higher deficits, he said. \"If you get into that sort of debt maelstrom, it is a very difficult issue to get out of,\" he said.

That means the government must pay higher rates to borrow money, leading to even higher deficits, he said. \"If you get into that sort of debt maelstrom, it is a very difficult issue to get out of,\" he said. Budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001 helped Greenspan orchestrate the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. When the boom ended in 2001, low inflation allowed the Fed to cut the benchmark rate to 1 percent, the lowest since 1958, limiting the recession to just eight months. Then the surpluses evaporated. President Bush, who will choose the next Fed chairman, won passage of $1.85 trillion in tax cuts and raised spending for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Defense spending rose 12.4 percent in fiscal 2004 to $437 billion, the Congressional Budget Office said. **The budget deficit widened to a record $413 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, with government spending rising 6.2 percent from the previous year. The deficit amounted to about 3.6 percent of the country's $11.8 trillion gross domestic product, the highest percentage since 1993.** Yesterday, the Treasury reported a $57.3 billion budget deficit in October, narrower than the $69.5 billion shortfall in October 2003, as spending declined. Social Security, the main government-funded retirement program, will spend more money than it takes in starting in 2018, according to a report by the program's trustees. A report by trustees of Medicare, a federal health-insurance program, shows that their hospital insurance fund spending will exceed income by 2012. \"There are a number of things that are just extraordinary, beginning with the fiscal imbalance,\" said Rep. Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican and former head of the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees the Fed. \"The Fed has less credible discretion the more out of whack fiscal policy gets.\" While crude oil prices slipped to $47.37 a barrel this week, oil is still more than 50 percent higher than it was a year ago. Janet Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco, said the surge would result in a temporary boost in broad inflation and, as long as prices stay high, a tax on U.S. consumers. Greenspan said that tax amounted to about $88.5 billion this year, equal to 0.75 percentage points of the gross domestic product. Former Dallas Fed President Robert McTeer flagged the record $166.2 billion deficit in the United States' current account, the broadest measure of trade, as a threat to stability. **\"The current account deficit is going to cause problems,\" said McTeer, who resigned Nov. 4 from the Fed to run Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. \"Flows will turn against us, and there will be a crisis that will result in rapidly rising interest rates", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:economiccrisis.txt:2:53a3b6c3c715", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9286, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "economiccrisis.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "economiccrisis", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "points of the gross domestic product.

Other fiscal problems loom. The costs of Social Security and Medicare are likely to balloon as the 84 million members of the baby-boom generation -- those born between 1946 and 1964 -- begin to retire in 2010, pushing federal government obligations higher, even as the taxpaying work force shrinks. \"If we have promised more than our economy has the ability to deliver to retirees without unduly diminishing real income gains of workers, as I fear we may have, we must recalibrate our public programs so that pending retirees have time to adjust through other channels,\" Greenspan said in an Aug. 27 speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo. \"If we delay, the adjustments could be abrupt and painful.\" **Fed Governor Bies blamed lawmakers for sometimes spending taxpayers' money for political gain during the past four years. \"The part of it that has gotten me so upset is that in this whole election debate, nobody's been talking about the spending side,\" she said last month.** [http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/business/10414803.htm](http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/business/10414803.htm) - Miami's largest newspaper **Rampant Insider Selling Raises Red Flags** **RACHEL BECK**** ****Associated Press** **NEW YORK**** - ****Talk about a double standard.

Some stock sales may just be routine or may be executives wanting to free up money to cover personal expenses or to help pay the taxes on shares they buy after exercising options. And in some sectors, namely technology, stock compensation is often the bulk of executive pay, so they sell their stock for income. In addition, November has historically been a busy time for insider selling. That's because it comes after most companies have reported their third-quarter earnings and restrictions for selling have been lifted. In addition, some executives sell in November for tax purposes. Still, insider-trading trackers at Thomson Financial say the recent selling bonanza is \"particularly noteworthy.\" **Some $6.6 billion in insider stock sales took place last month, the highest level since the $7.7 billion in sales tallied in August 2000, according to Thomson. Contrast that with the $144 million worth of stock that was bought by insiders last month.** **The most selling came from in the financial sector, where executives sold $882 million of their own stock in November, and health care companies, whose insiders sold $734 million worth of shares. Selling in both sectors was double the five-year monthly average**, according to Thomson. On a company-specific basis, consider what has gone on at networking company Avocent Corp., where company statements seem to contradict insiders' actions. On Nov. 1, the company announced a buyback plan for up to two million shares and said in a news released that the purchase of the stock \"represents a solid investment for our shareholders.\" Apparently, the company's insiders seemed to have ignored that memo. In the month following the announcement, they sold 578,565 shares out of an aggregate of 645,756 insider shares sold during the last 12 months, according to Vickers Weekly Insider, a newsletter that tracks trading by company executives. There was no buying during that time period. To be fair, much of the selling came as executives exercised their stock options, not surprising given that its shares have climbed 30 percent in the last two months reaching their highest level since last winter. In addition, the company's officers were blocked from making stock transactions from December 2003 through April of this year because of Avocent's acquisition of OSA Technologies Inc.,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:economiccrisis.txt:4:350f719f14c0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9288, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "economiccrisis.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "economiccrisis", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "Insider, a newsletter that tracks trading by company executives.

In addition, the company's officers were blocked from making stock transactions from December 2003 through April of this year because of Avocent's acquisition of OSA Technologies Inc., according to vice president and chief accounting officer Edward Blankenship. Yet, as Vickers editor David Coleman points out: \"If they thought the stock would continue to climb, wouldn't it be in their interest to hold on to it rather than immediately get out?\" Looking beyond companies where executives say one thing but do something else, Coleman points to other warning signs that investors should use to gauge potentially negative signs associated with insider selling. He suggests looking out for insiders who have sold their stock at times that don't coincide with when they exercise options, or those who sell above and beyond the amount that they have exercised. Sometimes, though, investors refuse to heed such warnings. Take, for instance, the surge in shares of homebuilder NVR Inc., which has seen its stock jump from just over $432 a share at the start of the year to now trade about $730 apiece. That rise has come despite expectations for a slowdown in the housing market as interest rates begin to climb. Also troublesome with that giant stock run-up is that NVR's insiders have been bailing out of the stock big time. They have sold more than $220 million in shares this year alone. Among those selling: NVR CEO Dwight Schar, who hasn't purchased any stock since June 2002, only exercised just over 83,000 shares this year and has sold about 265,000 shares at a market value of about $155 million, according to Thomson. The company declined to comment on its insider selling, said NVR spokesman Dan Malzahn. At least so far, NVR's investors have ignored the insiders' moves, and haven't been hurt by that decision. Whether that luck continues will surely be tested in the months ahead. ** See our archive of revealing news articles at ****[**https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles) ** Your tax-deductible donations, however large or small, help greatly to support this important work.

I sometimes wondered whether the outcome might have been orchestrated by some secret inner circle of power brokers who knew exactly what they were doing.** By Perkins' account, he was recruited and trained by just such a circle. He served their cause until he defected in a fit of conscience and, later, decided to spill the beans. *Confessions* tells stories of deals Perkins helped to broker with key oil exporting countries such as Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, Ecuador and Colombia. Naming names, he explains in riveting detail exactly how the system works - and illuminates the reality behind the hostility of those the United States now condemns as terrorists. Perkins' job as chief economist for Chas. T. Main, a secretive consulting firm with close ties to the U.S. intelligence and corporate communities, was much like that of an Enron accountant. **He cooked the books in a gigantic international con game. More specifically, he produced and defended grossly inflated projections of economic growth that were then used to justify super-sized infrastructure projects financed with debts to foreign banks that could never be repaid.** Intentionally making unpayable loans to foreign governments may seem the work of fools, but the money flowed directly into the bottom lines of well-connected U.S. construction and energy companies like Bechtel and Halliburton, and the perpetual debts gave the U.S. government a stranglehold over the economic and political resources of the indebted nations. **The ruling classes of the debtor nations who benefited rarely objected; the people the projects displaced had no voice.** Selling bogus projections was specialized work that required the social skills of a con man and the ethics of a hired killer. By Perkins' account, recruiters from the National Security Agency (NSA), one of the U.S. intelligence services, decided he fit the bill. Of particular interest is Perkins' story of his role in the deal that tied Saudi Arabia to U.S. interests, created a financial and political alliance between the House of Saud and the House of Bush, and led to a partnership that channeled billions of dollars to Osama bin Laden. Under this agreement, the Saudis hold their oil earnings in U.S. Treasury bonds. The Treasury Department pays the interest on these bonds directly to favored U.S. corporations, with which it contracts to modernize Saudi Arabia's physical infrastructure. In return the U.S. government uses its political and military clout to keep the Saudi royal family in power. **According to Perkins, the Saudi agreement was to be a model for Iraq, but Saddam Hussein refused to play - which explains why George W. Bush was so intent on invading Iraq to remove him from office.** The war was simply a different means to the same outcome.

Bush was so intent on invading Iraq to remove him from office.** The war was simply a different means to the same outcome. Effective control of Iraqi oil reserves was transferred to U.S. hands. Bechtel, Halliburton and other corporate Bush cronies received billions in new contracts. Perhaps, as implied by Perkins' experience, the assault on the world's poor was orchestrated out of some super-secret NSA project office charged with recruiting and training economic hit men. Or perhaps it was the unintentional consequence of playing out elite interests. In the end it makes little difference. The power brokers and their minions win, and hundreds of millions of losers are left to choose between death and slavery. Either way, it's important to address the deeper cultural and institutional causes of what is a spreading global disaster. It's here that Perkins misses a key point. \"The fault lies not in the institutions themselves, but in our perceptions of the manner in which they function and interact with one another, and of the role their managers play in that process...,\" he writes. \"Imagine if the Nike swoosh, McDonald's arches and Coca-Cola logo became symbols of companies whose primary goals were to clothe and feed the world's poor in environmentally beneficial ways.\" Yes, the perceptions are important, but so are the institutions. Perkins should by now be aware of two historic truths:** 1) Between the demands of financial markets and legal interpretations of the fiduciary responsibility of corporate officers, global for-profit corporations face strong pressures to maximize returns to their shareholders without regard to social or environmental consequences; **and 2) Any unaccountable concentration of institutional power is an invitation to the very corruption he so skillfully documents. *[David C.

Despite repeated official claims to the contrary, electronic voting machines are not now and have never been safe. Many polling places using electronic voting machines still require no paper trail, which means it is often not possible to know whether or not there was any manipulation. These articles also show that tabulating machines which collect data from the voting machines can also be easily manipulated from a distance. Please spread the word and join in demanding greater accountability, transparency, and a paper trail for all electronic voting machines.

The systems were not initially designed with robust security in mind, and even where security features were included, experts have found them to be poorly implemented with glaring holes. But for as long as experts have warned about security problems, voting machine makers and election officials have denied that the machines can be remotely hacked. Election officials also assert that routine procedures they perform would detect if someone altered transmitted votes or machine software. Experts, however, say ... that vendor claims about security can't be trusted. **\"Vendors have absolutely fumbled every single attempt in security,\"** says Jacob D. Stauffer, vice president of operations for Coherent Cyber, who has conducted voting-machine security assessments for California's secretary of state for a decade. Stauffer and colleagues ... found the voting machines and election-management systems to be rife with security problems. Attackers could theoretically intercept unofficial results as they're transmitted on election night - or, worse, use the modem connections to reach back into election machines at either end and install malware or alter election software and official results. **Note:** For more along these lines, explore the excellent, reliable resources provided in our [Elections Information Center](https://www.wanttoknow.info/electionsinformation). **Hackers Breach U.S. Voting Machines in 90 Minutes in DEF CON Competition** **2017-07-30, *Newsweek*** [http://www.newsweek.com/hackers-breach-usvoting-machines-90-minutes-def-con-c...](http://www.newsweek.com/hackers-breach-usvoting-machines-90-minutes-def-con-competition-643858) **Hackers were able to successfully breach the software of U.S. voting machines in less than two hours at a competition in Las Vegas.

[According to the*Register*](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/07/29/us_voting_machines_hacking/), the hackers at the DEF CON conference Friday were given voting machines, and competed to access them by physically breaking them open and hacking them remotely. Some devices had remote ports, which could be used to insert devices with malicious software, others insecure WiFi connections, or outdated software such as Windows XP, rendering them exposed to hacking attacks. The machines, manufactured by companies including Diebold, Sequoia and Winvote equipment, were purchased over eBay or at government auctions. In June, the Intercept published leaked NSA documents showing that Russian agents hacked a U.S. voting systems manufacturer in the weeks leading to last year's presidential election. NSA contractor Reality Leigh Winner, 25, was subsequently charged with removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet. \"Without question, our voting systems are weak and susceptible. Thanks to the contributions of the hacker community today, we've uncovered even more about exactly how,\" said Jake Braun, the Chief Executive Officer of Cambridge Global Advisors and Managing Director of Cambridge Global Capital, who designed the hacking competition. **Note:** Read an [enlightening analysis](https://www.opednews.com/articles/It-Doesn-t-Take-a-Russian-by-Bob-Fitrakis-Cross-Check-Crosscheck-Voter-Disenfranchisement_Election-Theft-170617-485.html) of elections hacking in the US which raises many serious questions.

D.H.S. has now conducted remote-scanning and on-site assessments of state and county election systems. These [measures] don't address core vulnerabilities in voting machines or the systems used to program them. And they ignore the fact that **many voting machines that elections officials insist are disconnected from the internet - and therefore beyond the reach of hackers - are in fact accessible by way of the modems they use to transmit vote totals on election night.** Add to this the fact that states don't conduct robust postelection audits ... and there's a good chance we simply won't know if someone has altered the digital votes in the next election. How did our election system get so vulnerable, and why haven't officials tried harder to fix it? The answer, ultimately, comes down to politics and money: **The voting machines are made by well-connected private companies that wield immense control over their proprietary software, often fighting vigorously in court to prevent anyone from examining it when things go awry.** The stakes are high.

Diebold's voting-machine business is now owned by the Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems, whose e-voting machines are used in about 22 states. Roger Johnston and Jon Warner from Argonne National Laboratory's Vulnerability Assessment Team demonstrate three different ways an attacker could tamper with, and remotely take full control, of the e-voting machine simply by attaching what they call a piece of \"alien electronics\" into the machine's circuit board. **The electronic hacking tool consists of a $1.29 microprocessor and a circuit board that costs about $8. Together with the $15 remote control, which enabled the researchers to modify votes from up to a half-mile away, the whole hack runs about $26. ** **Note:** Why isn't this making news headlines?

The U.S. hasn't been the only one trying to interfere in other countries' elections.

Who are these people? According to the report, most of these big contributors live in exclusive neighborhoods where they have private security guards instead of public police officers, private health facilities rather than public parks and pools. Most send their kids and grand kids to elite private schools rather than public schools. They fly in private jets and get driven in private limousines rather than rely on public transportation. They don't have to worry about whether Social Security or Medicare will be there for them in their retirement because they've put away huge fortunes. It's doubtful that most of these 158 are contributing to these campaigns out of the goodness of their hearts. They're largely making investments, just the way they make other investments. And the success of these investments depends on whether their candidates get elected, and will lower their taxes even further, expand tax loopholes, shred health and safety and environmental regulations so their companies can make even more money, and cut Social Security and Medicare and programs for the poor - and thereby allow these 158 and others like them to secede even more from the rest of our society. **These people are, after all, are living in their own separate society.

I'm talking about the dangers facing our democracy. First, income in America is now more concentrated in fewer hands than it has been in 80 years. Almost a quarter of total income generated in the United States is going to the top 1 percent of Americans. **The top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans now earn as much as the bottom 120 million of us.** Who are these people? They're top executives of big corporations and Wall Street, hedge-fund managers and private equity managers. Hundreds of millions of dollars are pouring into advertisements for and against candidates - without a trace of where the dollars are coming from. They're laundered through a handful of groups. Most Americans are in trouble. Their jobs, incomes, savings and even homes are on the line. They need a government that's working for them, not for the privileged and the powerful. Yet their state and local taxes are rising. And their services are being cut. There's no jobs bill to speak of. Washington says nothing can be done. There's no money left. No money? **The marginal income tax rate on the very rich is the lowest it has been in more than 80 years. Under President Dwight Eisenhower ... it was 91 percent. Now it's 36 percent. **We're losing our democracy to a different system.

Most of the votes were cast on paper ballots that were scanned into computerized vote-counting machines, which happen to have been manufactured by a company Mr. Hagel used to run. Mr. Matulka, suspicious of Senator Hagel's ties to the voting machine company, demanded a hand recount of the paper ballots. Nebraska law did not allow it, he was informed. In his primary race in 1996, Mr. Hagel, who had lived in Virginia for 20 years, beat the state attorney general by nearly two to one. In the general election, he defeated the governor, who had been elected two years earlier in a landslide. **In 2002, against Mr. Matulka, he won more than 80 percent of the vote. What gets conspiracy theorists excited is not just Mr. Hagel's prodigious wins, but his job before jumping into the 1996 race: heading American Information Systems, the manufacturer of the machines that count 85 percent of Nebraska's votes.** Rob Behler ... who helped prepare Georgia's machines for the 2002 election, says secret computer codes were installed late in the process. Votes ''could have been manipulated,'' he says, and the election thrown. Among the growing ranks of electronic-voting skeptics ... Mr. Hagel's wins in 1996 and 2002 have taken on mythic status.

About half of those named are African-Americans. They had the right to vote, but they never made it to the balloting booths. When we left off our Florida story two weeks ago, The Observer discovered that Harris's office had ordered the elimination of 8,000 Florida voters on the grounds that they had committed felonies in other states. None had. Harris bought the bum list from a company called ChoicePoint, a firm whose Atlanta executive suite and boardroom are filled with Republican funders. ChoicePoint, we have learned, picked up the list of faux felons from state officials in ... Texas. In fact, it was a roster of people who, like their Governor, George W, had committed nothing more than misdemeanours. **Most of those targeted to have their names 'scrubbed' from the voter roles were African-Americans, Hispanics and poor white folk, likely voters for Vice-President Gore. Add it up. The dead-wrong Texas list, the uncorrected 'corrected' list, plus the out-of-state ex-con list. It's enough to swing a presidential election.** **Note:** The entire article at the above link is highly recommended.

But those 80+ instances of the U.S. interfering with other nations elections does not include regime change efforts**. In the 1970s in Chile, the CIA conducted a botched kidnapping of General René Schneider, the Chilean Army's commander-in-chief, that resulted in Schneider's death. The plot was an effort to undermine the presidency of Salvador Allende, which may have fueled the violent coup that led to Allende's overthrow. In 1974, [Henry Kissinger was quoted](https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr58XN0uEEQC&pg=PA107#v=onepage&q&f=false) in *Newsweek*, saying about Chile: \"I don't see why we have to let a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people.\" Levin's tally also does not include covert coup d'etats where our government overthrows a foreign leader like the the U.S. did in Iran in 1953 or in Guatemala in 1954.

Minutes earlier, Fox News called the key battleground state of Ohio for President Obama, sealing his re-election. But as the network took live shots of jubilant Obama supporters camped outside the Obama re-election headquarters in Chicago celebrating their victory, Karl Rove began building a case against the call his employer network had just made. Rove explained that when Fox called Ohio, only 74% of the vote was in, showing President Obama with a lead of roughly 30,000 votes. But, as Rove contended, with 77% reporting according to the Ohio Secretary of State office, the President's lead had been slashed to just 991 votes. \"We gotta be careful about calling the thing,\" Rove said. Rove was supremely confident that the numbers coming in from Ohio throughout the night that favored President Obama weren't indicative of who would win Ohio when all the votes were ultimately tabulated by the state's computers**.** With a quarter of the vote still out there, Rove was anticipating a shift to the Right just after 11 pm, which, coincidentally, is exactly what happened in 2004.

The 10-count indictment, unsealed Thursday, accused the defendants of a conspiracy from March 2002 until November 2006 that violated the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The defendants were also indicted for extortion, mail fraud, obstruction of justice, conspiracy to injure voters' rights and conspiracy to commit voter fraud.** According to the indictment, these alleged criminal actions affected the outcome of federal, local, and state primary and general elections in 2002, 2004, and 2006.** Clay County Circuit Court Judge Russell Cletus Maricle, 65, and school superintendent Douglas C.

In hundreds of instances ... they [have failed] unpredictably, and in extremely strange ways; voters report that their choices \"flip\" from one candidate to another before their eyes; machines crash or begin to count backward; votes simply vanish. Most famously, in the November 2006 Congressional election in Sarasota, Fla., touch-screen machines recorded an 18,000-person \"undervote\" for a race decided by fewer than 400 votes. The earliest critiques of digital voting booths came from the fringe - disgruntled citizens and ... computer geeks - but** the fears have now risen to the highest levels of government. One by one, states are renouncing the use of touch-screen voting machines. California and Florida decided to get rid of their electronic voting machines last spring, and last month, Colorado decertified about half of its touch-screen devices.** Also last month, Jennifer Brunner, the Ohio secretary of state, released a report in the wake of the Cuyahoga crashes arguing that touch-screens \"may jeopardize the integrity of the voting process.\" She was so worried she is now forcing Cuyahoga to scrap its touch-screen machines and go back to paper-based voting - before the Ohio primary, scheduled for March 4. Michael Shamos, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University who has examined voting-machine systems for more than 25 years, estimates that about 10 percent of the touch-screen machines \"fail\" in each election. **Note:** 10% of the machines fail, yet many still believe the results from previous elections were accurate. **Important Note: **Explore our [full index](https://www.WantToKnow.info/indexnewsarticles) to revealing excerpts of key major media news articles on several dozen engaging topics.

Each of the more than 100 machines the researchers looked at were vulnerable to at least some kind of attack**, said Georgetown professor Matt Blaze, one of the Def Con Voting Village's organizers. As in previous years, the Voting Village collected versions of voting equipment used around the country, much of it ordered from eBay, and invited all of the more than 35,000 attendees of the Def Con hacker conference, which took place in Las Vegas in August, to see what kind of holes they could find. Some of machines were found to be vulnerable to remote attack and one electronic pollbook had a hidden ethernet cable to connect it to the internet. The issue is less that skilled hackers can break into election equipment, Blaze told CNN, and more that elections systems as a whole need to both minimize risk and double-check election results with paper ballots ... and risk-limiting audits. **Report: Election Vendors Are 'Prime Targets,' Need Oversight** **2019-11-12, ABC News/Associated Press** [https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/report-election-vendors......](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/report-election-vendors-prime-targets-oversight-66933590) **The private companies that make voting equipment and build and maintain voter registration databases lack any meaningful federal oversight despite the crucial role they play in U.S. elections, leaving the nation's electoral process vulnerable to attack,** according to a new report.

The systems were not initially designed with robust security in mind, and even where security features were included, experts have found them to be poorly implemented with glaring holes. But for as long as experts have warned about security problems, voting machine makers and election officials have denied that the machines can be remotely hacked. Election officials also assert that routine procedures they perform would detect if someone altered transmitted votes or machine software. Experts, however, say ... that vendor claims about security can't be trusted. **\"Vendors have absolutely fumbled every single attempt in security,\"** says Jacob D.

But critics might point out the U.S. has done similar things. **The U.S. has a long history of attempting to influence presidential elections in other countries - it's done so as many as 81 times between 1946 and 2000, according to a database amassed by political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University**. That number doesn't include military coups and regime change efforts following the election of candidates the U.S. didn't like, notably those in Iran, Guatemala and Chile. Levin defines intervention as \"a costly act which is designed to determine the election results [in favor of] one of the two sides.\" These acts, carried out in secret two-thirds of the time, include funding the election campaigns of specific parties, disseminating misinformation or propaganda, training locals of only one side in various campaigning or get-out-the-vote techniques, helping one side design their campaign materials, making public pronouncements or threats in favor of or against a candidate, and providing or withdrawing foreign aid.

The U.S. hasn't been the only one trying to interfere in other countries' elections. Russia attempted to sway 36 foreign elections from the end of World War II to the turn of the century - meaning that, in total, at least one of the two great powers of the 20th century intervened in about 1 of every 9 competitive, national-level executive elections in that time period. **The Crisis of Election Security** **2018-09-26, *New York Times*** [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/magazine/election-security-crisis-midterms...](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/magazine/election-security-crisis-midterms.html) As the 2018 elections approach, the American intelligence community is issuing increasingly dire warnings about potential interference from Russia and other countries. D.H.S. has now conducted remote-scanning and on-site assessments of state and county election systems. These [measures] don't address core vulnerabilities in voting machines or the systems used to program them. And they ignore the fact that **many voting machines that elections officials insist are disconnected from the internet - and therefore beyond the reach of hackers - are in fact accessible by way of the modems they use to transmit vote totals on election night.** Add to this the fact that states don't conduct robust postelection audits ... and there's a good chance we simply won't know if someone has altered the digital votes in the next election. How did our election system get so vulnerable, and why haven't officials tried harder to fix it? The answer, ultimately, comes down to politics and money: **The voting machines are made by well-connected private companies that wield immense control over their proprietary software, often fighting vigorously in court to prevent anyone from examining it when things go awry.** The stakes are high. But the focus on Russia, or any would-be election manipulators, ignores the underlying issue - the myriad vulnerabilities that riddle the system and the ill-considered decisions that got us here. **Note:** Why is it that the U.S. government is not allowed to have oversight over the companies that build and maintain voting machines and databases? What if one or more of them is bought off by a foreign or event domestic interest? Isn't this crazy?

Almost a quarter of total income generated in the United States is going to the top 1 percent of Americans. **The top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans now earn as much as the bottom 120 million of us.** Who are these people? They're top executives of big corporations and Wall Street, hedge-fund managers and private equity managers. Hundreds of millions of dollars are pouring into advertisements for and against candidates - without a trace of where the dollars are coming from. They're laundered through a handful of groups. Most Americans are in trouble. Their jobs, incomes, savings and even homes are on the line. They need a government that's working for them, not for the privileged and the powerful. Yet their state and local taxes are rising. And their services are being cut. There's no jobs bill to speak of. Washington says nothing can be done. There's no money left. No money? **The marginal income tax rate on the very rich is the lowest it has been in more than 80 years. Under President Dwight Eisenhower ... it was 91 percent.

Yes, the U.S. meddles in other countries elections.

But those 80+ instances of the U.S. interfering with other nations elections does not include regime change efforts**. In the 1970s in Chile, the CIA conducted a botched kidnapping of General René Schneider, the Chilean Army's commander-in-chief, that resulted in Schneider's death. The plot was an effort to undermine the presidency of Salvador Allende, which may have fueled the violent coup that led to Allende's overthrow.

The attack was concluded in minutes. **Elections could be vulnerable at myriad strike points, among them the software that aggregates the precinct vote totals, and the voter registration rolls that are increasingly digitized. But the threat, the cyber experts say, starts with the machines that tally the votes** and crucially keep a record of them - or, in some cases, don't. It's not just the voting machines themselves - it's the desktop and laptop computers that election officials use. And the computers that aggregate the results together from all of the optical scans.

Minutes earlier, Fox News called the key battleground state of Ohio for President Obama, sealing his re-election. But as the network took live shots of jubilant Obama supporters camped outside the Obama re-election headquarters in Chicago celebrating their victory, Karl Rove began building a case against the call his employer network had just made. Rove explained that when Fox called Ohio, only 74% of the vote was in, showing President Obama with a lead of roughly 30,000 votes. But, as Rove contended, with 77% reporting according to the Ohio Secretary of State office, the President's lead had been slashed to just 991 votes. \"We gotta be careful about calling the thing,\" Rove said. Rove was supremely confident that the numbers coming in from Ohio throughout the night that favored President Obama weren't indicative of who would win Ohio when all the votes were ultimately tabulated by the state's computers**.** With a quarter of the vote still out there, Rove was anticipating a shift to the Right just after 11 pm, which, coincidentally, is exactly what happened in 2004.

Long was no stranger to rigged votes. This time around, however, the fix delivered by his machine was blatant and sloppy: **his favored amendments won unanimously in sixteen New Orleans precincts and garnered identical vote totals in twenty-eight others.** Eugene Stanley, the incorruptible district attorney for Orleans Parish, presented evidence of fraud to a grand jury. Louisiana's attorney general, the less morally encumbered Gaston Porterie, stepped in to sabotage the case for Long. Nonetheless, two judges demanded a recount, at which point Governor O. K. Allen obliged Long by declaring martial law. Intimidated jurors found themselves sorting ballots under the supervision of National Guardsmen, who stood by to \"protect\" them with machine guns. When this effort failed, another grand jury was convened. Their eventual finding of a massive conspiracy led to the indictment of 513 New Orleans election officials. Once again, Long used his", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:elections__elections_corruption.txt:0:f14d039120fd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9338, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "elections__elections_corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "elections__elections_corruption", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Porterie, stepped in to sabotage the case for Long.

When this effort failed, another grand jury was convened. Their eventual finding of a massive conspiracy led to the indictment of 513 New Orleans election officials. Once again, Long used his famous powers of persuasion. At his behest, the Louisiana legislature modified the state's election law, giving ex post facto protection to the defendants. Election rigging, Long might have quipped, had become downright exhausting. But it worked. **From the earliest days of the republic, American politicians (and much of a cynical populace) saw vote rigging as a necessary evil. Since the opposition was assumed to be playing equally dirty, how could you avoid it?** Most Americans would probably have confessed to a grudging admiration for New York City's [Tammany Hall machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall), which bought off judges, politicians, and ward captains, ensured the suppression of thousands of votes, and controlled Democratic Party nominations for more than a century. **By the beginning of the last century, however, sentiment had begun to shift.** In 1915, the Supreme Court ruled that vote suppression could be federally prosecuted. In Terre Haute, Indiana, more than a hundred men had already been indicted for conspiring to fix the 1914 elections for mayor, sheriff, and circuit judge. The incumbent sheriff and judge went to jail for five years, and Mayor [Donn M. Roberts](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D10FF3E5A15738DDDAA0994DC405B858DF1D3) was sentenced to six years in Leavenworth. Roberts and his gang, declared the New York Times, had failed to grasp that \"what is safe and even commendable one year may be dangerous and reprehensible the next.\" Almost overnight, commonplace corruption had become unacceptable, and vote rigging a serious crime. It took a strongman like Huey Long to remain an exception to the rule. But the overall trajectory seemed to point toward reform, accountability, and security. In 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment was passed, seventy-two years after Elizabeth Cady Stanton first demanded women's suffrage - the right that would, in Stanton's words, \"secure all others.\" By the 1960s, Northern Democrats abandoned their Southern allies and pushed to end the mass suppression of black votes below the Mason-Dixon line. With the Voting Rights Act of 1965, many Americans began to believe that the bad old days of stolen elections might soon be behind us. **But as the twentieth century came to a close, a brave new world of election rigging emerged, on a scale that might have prompted Huey Long's stunned admiration.

We have actually lost the ability to verify election results. The use of computers in elections began around the time of the Voting Rights Act.** Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the use of optical scanners to process paper ballots became widespread, usurping local hand counting. **The media, anxious to get on the air with vote totals, hailed the faster and more efficient computerized count. In the twenty-first century, a new technology became ubiquitous: Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting, which permits touchscreen machines and does not require a paper trail. Old-school ballot-box fraud at its most egregious was localized and limited in scope. But new electronic voting systems allow insiders to rig elections on a statewide or even national scale. And whereas once you could catch the guilty parties in the act, and even dredge the ballot boxes out of the bayou, the virtual vote count can be manipulated in total secrecy. **By means of proprietary, corporate-owned software, just one programmer could steal hundreds, thousands, potentially even millions of votes with the stroke of a key.** It's the electoral equivalent of a drone strike. Symbolically speaking, this era was inaugurated by Chuck Hagel, an unknown millionaire who ran for one of Nebraska's U.S. Senate seats in 1996. Initially Hagel trailed the popular Democratic governor, Ben Nelson, who had been elected in a landslide two years earlier. Three days before the election, however, a poll conducted by the Omaha World-Herald showed a dead heat, with 47 percent of respondents favoring each candidate. David Moore, who was then managing editor of the Gallup Poll, told the paper, \"We can't predict the outcome.\" Hagel's victory in the general election, invariably referred to as an \"upset,\" handed the seat to the G.O.P. for the first time in eighteen years. Hagel trounced Nelson by fifteen points. Even for those who had factored in the governor's deteriorating numbers and a last-minute barrage of negative ads, this divergence from pre-election polling was enough to raise eyebrows across the nation. **Few Americans knew that until shortly before his election, [Hagel had been chairman](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,124914,00.html) of the company whose computerized voting machines would soon count his own", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:elections__elections_corruption.txt:2:5ab83fb72a9b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9340, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "elections__elections_corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "elections__elections_corruption", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "referred to as an \"upset,\" handed the seat to the G.O.P. for the first time in eighteen years.

Hagel stepped down from his post just two weeks before announcing his candidacy. Yet he retained millions of dollars in stock in the McCarthy Group, which owned ES&S. And Michael McCarthy, the parent company's founder, was Hagel's campaign treasurer. Whether Hagel's relationship to ES&S ensured his victory is open to speculation. But the surprising scale of his win awakened a new fear among voting-rights activists and raised a disturbing question: Who controls the new technology of Election Night? \"Why would someone who owns a voting-machine company want to run for office?\" asked Charlie Matulka, a Democrat who contested Hagel's Senate seat in 2002. Speaking at a press conference shortly before the election, he added: \"Is this the fox guarding the henhouse?\" A construction worker with limited funding and name recognition, Matulka was obviously a less formidable competitor than Nelson. Still, Hagel won an astonishing 83 percent of the vote - among the largest margins of victory in any statewide race in Nebraska's history. And with nearly 400,000 registered Democrats on the rolls, Matulka managed to scrape up only 70,290 votes. Hagel had never actually disclosed his financial ties to ES&S, and Matulka requested an investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee. His request was rejected. Equally futile was his call for a hand count of the ballots, since a state law specified that recounts had to be conducted using the very same \"vote-counting device\" that was used to begin with - in this case, the ES&S optical scanners. Meanwhile, **the new millennium, far from delivering a democratic promised land, presented Americans with the debacle of the 2000 presidential election, whose fate hung absurdly on \"hanging chads\" - the little pieces of punched-out ballot so contentiously examined during the monthlong recount. Few Americans knew (and many still do not know) that a faulty computer memory card triggered this fiasco. ** Late on Election Night, Al Gore's total in Volusia County, Florida, suddenly dropped when one precinct reported 16,000 negative votes. Fox News was immediately prompted by Florida governor Jeb Bush to call the election for his brother. On his way to a 3 a.m. public concession, Gore changed course when a campaign staffer discovered that he was actually ahead in Volusia County by 13,000 votes. But the damage was done.

Gore was cast as a sore loser in a hostile media environment. His effort to obtain a recount was described by Sean Hannity on Fox News as an attempt to \"steal the election.\" Meanwhile, George W. Bush invoked his duty to get on with the business of running the country. The rest, as they say, is history. We are now in the midst of yet another election season. And as November 6 approaches, only one thing is certain: American voters will have no ability to know with certainty who wins any given race, from dogcatcher to president. Nor will we know the true results of ballot initiatives and referenda affecting some of the most vital issues of our day, including fracking, abortion, gay marriage, GMO-food labeling, and electoral reform itself. Our faith-based elections are the result of a new Dark Age in American democracy, brought on, paradoxically, by technological progress. The spread of computerized voting has carried with it an enormous potential for electronic skulduggery. In 2003, Bev Harris, a citizen sleuth and the author of Black Box Voting: Ballot Tampering in the 21st Century, made a shocking and game-changing discovery: Diebold, then one of the primary manufacturers of voting machines, had left the 40,000 files that made up its Global Election Management System (GEMS) on a publicly accessible website, entirely unprotected. Diebold was never able to explain how its proprietary tabulation program ended up in such an exposed position. Harris downloaded the files, and programmers worldwide pounced, probing the code for weaknesses. \"The wall of secrecy,\" said Harris, \"began to crumble.\" GEMS turned out to be a vote rigger's dream. According to Harris's analysis, it could be hacked, remotely or on-site, using any off-the-shelf version of Microsoft Access, and password protection was missing for supervisor functions. Not only could multiple users gain access to the system after only one had logged in, but unencrypted audit logs allowed any trace of vote rigging to be wiped from the record. The public unmasking of GEMS by an average citizen (who was not a programmer herself) served as a belated wake-up call to the world's leading computer-security experts, who finally turned their attention to America's most widely used voting systems. **Damning reports have since been issued by researchers from Johns Hopkins, Princeton, Rice, and Stanford Universities, the Brennan Center for Justice, and the Government Accountability Office** (none of them institutions hospitable to \"tinfoil hat\" conspiracy theorists). Experts describe appalling security flaws, from the potential", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:elections__elections_corruption.txt:4:523b15949848", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9342, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "elections__elections_corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "elections__elections_corruption", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "of GEMS by an average citizen (who was not a programmer herself) served as a belated wake-up call to the world's leading computer-security experts, who finally turned their attention to America's most widely used voting systems. **Damning reports have since been issued by researchers from Johns Hopkins, Princeton, Rice, and Stanford Universities, the Brennan Center for Justice, and the Government Accountability Office** (none of them institutions hospitable to \"tinfoil hat\" conspiracy theorists). Experts describe appalling security flaws, from the potential for system-wide vote-rigging viruses to the use of cheap, easily replicated keys - the same kind used on jukeboxes and hotel minibars - to open the machines themselves. **In 2005, the nonpartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform, chaired by Jimmy Carter and James Baker, stated unequivocally that the greatest threats to secure voting are insiders with direct access to the machines:** \"There is no reason to trust insiders in the election industry any more than in other industries.\" As recently as September 2011, a team at the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory hacked into one of Diebold's old Accuvote touchscreen systems. Their report asserted that anyone with [$26 in parts](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-it-only-takes-26-hack-voting-machine) and an eighth-grade science education would be able to manipulate the outcome of an election. \"This is a national security issue,\" wrote the Argonne team leader, Roger Johnston, using the sort of language that would normally set off alarm bells in our security-obsessed culture. Yet** his warning has gone unheeded, and the Accuvote-TSX, now manufactured by ES&S, will be used in twenty states by more than 26 million voters in the 2012 general election.** Johnston's group also breached a system made by another industry giant, Sequoia, using the same \"man in the middle\" hack - a tiny wireless component that is inserted between the display screen and the main circuit board - which requires no knowledge of the actual voting software. The Sequoia machine will be used in four states by nearly 9 million voters in 2012. Why did a physicist choose to hack into voting machines? \"This was basically a weekend project,\" Johnston told me, expressing his amazement at the meager funding available to examine America's voting systems. \"We did it because a lot of people looking at the machines are cybersecurity experts and programmers - and when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. They were largely looking at sophisticated, cyber-based attacks. But there are simple physical attacks, as we proved, that are easier to do and harder to prevent.\" The voting-machine companies never responded to the Argonne reports. \"That's not unusual,\" says Johnston. \"The manufacturers seem to be in denial on some of these issues.\" Why the denial? There are at least 3.9 billion good reasons. In 2002, George W. Bush signed the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), offering states $3.9 billion in subsidies to modernize their election administration and equipment, purportedly in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:elections__elections_corruption.txt:5:bc2285414850", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9343, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "elections__elections_corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "elections__elections_corruption", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "are simple physical attacks, as we proved, that are easier to do and harder to prevent.\" The voting-machine companies never responded to the Argonne reports. \"That's not unusual,\" says Johnston. \"The manufacturers seem to be in denial on some of these issues.\" Why the denial?

Bush signed the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), offering states $3.9 billion in subsidies to modernize their election administration and equipment, purportedly in response to Florida's hanging-chad fiasco of 2000. HAVA mandated that every polling place provide at least one voting system that allowed disabled people to vote with the same \"privacy and independence\" accorded to nondisabled voters. Thanks to confusing language in HAVA itself, and even a misleading report issued by the Congressional Research Service, one might easily assume that the mandate called for the purchase of DRE machines. In this way, the blind and visually impaired were unwittingly used as pawns to advance the agenda of the voting-machine industry. One election supervisor claims that Diebold went so far as to send him threatening letters after he sought out less expensive alternatives to service the disabled, even when these machines were compatible with Diebold's systems. This was not the only deception surrounding the rollout of these electoral Trojan horses. In a 2007 Dan Rather exposé, [The Trouble with Touch Screens](http://www.bradblog.com/?p=4960), seven whistle-blowers at Sequoia charged that company executives had forced them to use inferior paper stock for ballots during the 2000 election. What's more, said the whistle-blowers, they had been instructed to misalign the chads on punch cards destined for the Democratic stronghold of Palm Beach County. \"My own personal opinion was the touchscreen-voting system wasn't getting off the ground like they would hope,\" said Greg Smith, a thirty-two-year Sequoia employee. \"So, I feel like they deliberately did all this to have problems with the paper ballots.\" Such blockbuster allegations are perhaps unsurprising given the group of Beltway insiders who helped to pass HAVA. One central player was former Republican representative Bob Ney of Ohio, sentenced in 2006 to thirty months in prison for crimes connected with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff - whose firm was paid at least $275,000 by Diebold. **HAVA's impact has been huge, accelerating a deterioration of our electoral system that most Americans have yet to recognize, let alone understand. We are literally losing our ballot - the key physical proof of our power as citizens.** Even a former major elections official has heaped scorn upon HAVA's mission. DeForest Soaries was appointed by George W. Bush to head the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), which HAVA created to oversee security standards for new voting devices. Soaries stepped down in 2005, calling his office a \"charade\" and claiming that he had been deceived by both the White House and Congress.

Washington politicians, Soaries declared in a 2006 radio interview, have apparently concluded that our voting system can't be all that bad - after all, it got them elected. \"But there's an erosion of voting rights implicit in our inability to trust the technology that we use,\" he added. \"And if we were another country being analyzed by America, we would conclude that this country is ripe for stealing elections and for fraud.\" **The sheer unreliability of this new technology is only half the problem. The other half is a series of mergers and acquisitions that have further centralized the voting-machine industry over the past decade or so. Election Day is now dominated by a handful of secretive corporations with interlocking ownership, strong partisan ties to the far right, and executives who revolve among them like beans in a shell game.** Bob and Todd Urosevich are hardly household names. Yet the two brothers have succeeded in monopolizing American election technology for decades through a pair of supposedly competing corporations: the Ohio-based Diebold and the Nebraska-based ES&S. The latter was founded by the Urosevich brothers in 1979 and is headquartered in Omaha, where it has an Ayn Rand-flavored corporate address on John Galt Boulevard. It is also, let us recall, the same company that may have won Chuck Hagel his Senate seat. **Diebold became the most infamous name in the industry in 2003, when its CEO, Walden O'Dell, a top fund-raiser for George W. Bush, made a jaw-dropping [public promise](https://www.WantToKnow.info/031109nytimes) to \"deliver\" Ohio's electoral votes to Bush.** The following year, California banned Diebold's touchscreen system, and Secretary of State Kevin Shelley blasted the company as \"fraudulent,\" \"despicable,\" and \"deceitful.\" O'Dell stepped down in 2005, right before the filing of a class-action suit that accused Diebold of fraud, insider trading, and slipshod quality control. Concerned about its tarnished brand, the company removed its label from the front of voting machines. Then Diebold went one step further and changed the name of its voting-machine division to Premier Election Solutions. In 2009, Diebold, which makes ATMs and other security systems, got out of the elections business altogether, selling Premier to ES&S. Here was a windfall for the Urosevich brothers in more than one sense: Bob had decamped to Diebold in 2002, when the company bought Global Election Systems, where he then served as president. Todd, meanwhile, remained at ES&S. This cozy arrangement was disrupted by a Justice Department antitrust intervention, which forced ES&S to split ownership", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:elections__elections_corruption.txt:7:930a2b62b279", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9345, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "elections__elections_corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "elections__elections_corruption", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "to Premier Election Solutions.

Todd, meanwhile, remained at ES&S. This cozy arrangement was disrupted by a Justice Department antitrust intervention, which forced ES&S to split ownership of Premier with Dominion, the next big name in election technology. A month later, the deck was shuffled once again with Dominion's purchase of Sequoia. **Between them, Dominion and ES&S now count the majority of American ballots. There are, of course, newer technologies in development, including Web-based voting. This latest innovation is being peddled by the Spanish-owned Scytl, which named Bob Urosevich managing director of its Americas division in 2006.** One would think (or hope) that a private industry entrusted with America's votes would require the highest degree of personal integrity from its employees. As it happens, many of the key staffers behind our major voting-machine companies have been accused or convicted of a dizzying array of white-collar crimes, including conspiracy, bribery, bid rigging, computer fraud, tax fraud, stock fraud, mail fraud, extortion, and drug trafficking. In 2001, for example, a grand jury [indicted Philip Foster](http://www.sptimes.com/News/110801/State/Voting_machine_scanda.shtml), Sequoia's southern regional sales manager, for malfeasance and conspiring to launder money. During the previous decade, he had facilitated a kickback scheme that funneled payments to a Louisiana elections official, who purchased Sequoia equipment while winking at millions of dollars in overcharges. The scheme, which also involved Foster's brother-in-law and fellow Sequoia employee David Philpot, was hardly an advertisement for the company. Yet Foster, who gained immunity for his testimony against the elections official, not only avoided jail time but was promoted to vice president of sales administration and strategies at Sequoia. **One high achiever actually got his start in prison. [Jeffrey Dean](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-critics-convicted-felons-worked-electronic-voting-companies)'s vote-by-mail software - developed while Dean was serving a sentence for twenty-three counts of embezzlement - came to dominate the U.S. absentee-voting market. Once out of prison, Dean launched his own ballot-printing company with [narcotics trafficker John Elder](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-2-felons-roles-county-elections-questioned-).** They later sold it to Global Election Systems, where, readers will recall, Bob Urosevich served as president and COO, before the company was sold to Diebold. This leads us to a crazy-making realization. **Although many felons (and prior felons) can't cast a ballot in America ... these particular felons are apparently free to design and manage our entire elections industry.** **Since the American Revolution, election fraud has been attempted by every major political party,** with frequent intraparty allegations, such as the claim of Ron Paul delegates that the rules were rigged against them at this year's Republican National Convention.

To say that Democrats haven't committed their fair share of what were once quaintly called \"shenanigans\" would be disingenuous. Huey Long was a Democrat, as was virtually every candidate ever floated by Tammany Hall, not to mention Lyndon Johnson - whose election to the U.S. Senate in 1948, according to Robert Caro's Means of Ascent, relied on flagrant vote tampering. Still, the main beneficiary of recent trends in election stealing seems to be the American right. This is no accident. As the twenty-first century unfolds, American politics continues to veer precipitously to the right, even as the demographic base for such a shift - older white conservative males - keeps shrinking. **The engine of this seismic movement is a strategic alliance of corporate interests promoted by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. empire and orchestrated by Karl Rove and the Koch-funded American Legislative Exchange Council.** And meanwhile, the American right has in recent years been empowered by a slew of upset victories that range from unexpected to implausible, and that have frequently been accompanied by technical failures and anomalies, which are swept under the rug as rapidly as possible. In 2002, the G.O.P. regained control of the Senate with such victories. In Georgia, for example, Diebold's voting machines reported the defeat of Democratic senator Max Cleland. Early polls had given the highly popular Cleland a solid lead over his Republican opponent, Saxby Chambliss, a favorite of the Christian right, the NRA, and George W. Bush (who made several campaign appearances on his behalf). As Election Day drew near, the contest narrowed. Chambliss, who had avoided military service, ran attack ads denouncing Cleland - a Silver Star recipient who lost three limbs in Vietnam - as a traitor for voting against the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Two days before the election, a Zogby poll gave Chambliss a one-point lead among likely voters, while the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Cleland maintained a three-point advantage with the same group. Cleland lost by seven points. In his 2009 autobiography, he accused computerized voting machines of being \"ripe for fraud.\" Patched for fraud might have been more apt. In the month leading up to the election, Diebold employees, led by Bob Urosevich, applied a mysterious, uncertified software patch to 5,000 voting machines that Georgia had purchased in May. **\"We were told that it was intended to fix the clock in the system, which it didn't do,\" Diebold consultant and whistle-blower Chris Hood recounted in a 2006 Rolling Stone", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:elections__elections_corruption.txt:9:42b3776abbd2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9347, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "elections__elections_corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "elections__elections_corruption", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "2009 autobiography, he accused computerized voting machines of being \"ripe for fraud.\" Patched for fraud might have been more apt.

It was an unauthorized patch, and they were trying to keep it secret from the state. . . . We were told not to talk to county personnel about it. I received instructions directly from [Bob] Urosevich. It was very unusual that a president of the company would give an order like that and be involved at that level.\" Two years later, of course, John Kerry lost the presidency in Ohio. In this key swing state, election monitors were besieged by complaints of G.O.P. orchestrated voter suppression, intimidation, and fraud. Myriad voting-machine anomalies were reported, including \"glitches\" that flipped votes from Kerry to Bush. A phony terror alert in Republican Warren County (the FBI later denied issuing any such warning) allowed officials to move ballots illegally to an auxiliary building and count them out of public view. Presiding over the election was the Republican secretary of state, J. Kenneth Blackwell, a fiercely partisan fundamentalist Christian who also served as co-chair of Ohio's Committee to Re-Elect George W. Bush. The exhaustive evidence of voting irregularities in Ohio was documented in a [2005 report](http://www.openvotingconsortium.org/files/Conyersreport.pdf) commissioned by Representative John Conyers, \"Preserving Democracy: What Went Wrong in Ohio.\" At the time of that report, however, a major piece of the puzzle was still missing: the role of G.O.P. computer guru Michael Connell. Connell was the Bush campaign's chief IT strategist. He was also a zealous anti-abortion activist whose two Ohio-based companies built websites and email systems for the Republican National Committee, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, and many of the most powerful figures in the G.O.P., including Karl Rove, Jeb Bush, and Jack Abramoff. It was one of Connell's websites that reported the surprising (many say unbelievable) surge of votes in Ohio that handed George W. Bush the White House for the second time. **In 2004, Connell was hired by Blackwell to design a website that would post Ohio election results to the public. Connell's contract also required that he create a \"mirror site\" that would kick in to display the vote totals if the official Ohio servers were overwhelmed by Election Day traffic.** For the latter portion of the job, he turned to SmarTech, a little-known company headquartered in Chattanooga, Tennessee. SmarTech was as partisan as Connell himself, and the company's servers hosted hundreds of high-profile Republican", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:elections__elections_corruption.txt:10:a863fb9550d3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9348, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "elections__elections_corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "elections__elections_corruption", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "hired by Blackwell to design a website that would post Ohio election results to the public.

SmarTech was as partisan as Connell himself, and the company's servers hosted hundreds of high-profile Republican websites (and, later on, an assortment of anti-Obama websites). Four years later, Ohio attorney (and former Republican) Cliff Arnebeck began gathering evidence to file a racketeering claim against Karl Rove, which included the charge that Rove had masterminded the theft of the 2004 election. \"We detected a pattern of criminal activity,\" Arnebeck told the British journalist Simon Worrall. \"We identified Connell as a key witness, as the implementer for Rove.\" On November 3, 2008, he took a sworn deposition from Connell, who had repeatedly tried to quash Arnebeck's subpoena. **Initially Connell denied any role in choosing SmarTech to host the mirror site. Questioned further, he admitted that he \"may have\" made use of the Tennessee servers,** but denied any knowledge of whether the mirror site had even been activated in 2004. His job, he insisted, was simply to display vote counts, \"taking the public results as they are currently being reported and aggregating them into totals.\" In fact, the SmarTech site went into action at 11:14 p.m. on Election Day. At this point, Arnebeck believes, the data being routed to Tennessee was used by G.O.P. partisans to target Ohio counties that were ripe for vote tampering. \"The SmarTech people may have been guiding the manipulation of paper ballots in places like Warren County,\" Arnebeck told me. Others argue that SmarTech's role was far more insidious and involved partisan control of the total vote count. Stephen Spoonamore, an IT specialist (and Republican) who has consulted on cybersecurity for Boeing, MasterCard, the Navy, and the State Department, has studied the electronic \"architecture map\" used by Ohio during the 2004 election. He speculates that SmarTech might have been able to use Connell's interface to gain access to and modify vote totals. In a sworn affidavit, Spoonamore said that the \"variable nature of the story\" and \"lack of documentation available\" would, for any of his banking clients, provoke \"an immediate fraud investigation.\" **Arnebeck hoped to have Connell testify in open court against Rove.

Whether Rove and his collaborators orchestrated the electronic theft of the 2004 election will likely never be known. Still, Election Day exit polls make a compelling case that somebody may have been tampering with the presidential vote count, in Ohio and elsewhere. **Late on Election Day, John Kerry showed an insurmountable lead in exit polling, and many considered his victory all but certified. Yet the final vote tallies in thirty states deviated widely from exit polls, with discrepancies favoring George W. Bush in all but nine. The greatest disparities were concentrated in battleground states - particularly Ohio.** **In one Ohio precinct, exit polls indicated that Kerry should have received 67 percent of the vote, but the certified tally gave him only 38 percent. The odds of such an unexpected outcome occurring only as a result of sampling error are 1 in 867,205,553.** To quote Lou Harris, who has long been regarded as the father of modern political polling: \"Ohio was as dirty an election as America has ever seen.\" The statistically anomalous shifting of votes to the conservative right has become so pervasive in post-HAVA America that it now has a name of its own. Experts call it the \"red shift.\" The [Election Defense Alliance](http://electiondefensealliance.org/) (EDA) is a nonprofit organization specializing in election forensics - a kind of dusting for the fingerprints of electronic theft. It is joined in this work by a coalition of independent statisticians, who have compared decades of computer-vote results to exit polls, tracking polls, and hand counts. Their findings show that when disparities occur, they benefit Republicans and right-wing issues far beyond the bounds of probability. \"We approach electoral integrity with a nonpartisan goal of transparency,\" says EDA executive director Jonathan Simon. \"But there is nothing nonpartisan about the patterns we keep finding.\" Simon's verdict is confirmed by David Moore, a former vice president and managing editor of Gallup: \"What the exit polls have consistently shown is stronger Democratic support than the election results.\" Wouldn't American voters eventually note the constant disparity between poll numbers and election outcomes, and cry foul? They might - except that polling numbers, too, are being quietly shifted. Exit-poll data is provided by the National Election Pool, a corporate-media consortium consisting of the three major television networks plus CNN, Fox News, and the Associated Press. The NEP relies in turn on two companies, Edison Research and Mitofsky International, to conduct and analyze the actual polling. However, **few Americans realize that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:elections__elections_corruption.txt:12:70f042f63fb2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9350, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "elections__elections_corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "elections__elections_corruption", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "American voters eventually note the constant disparity between poll numbers and election outcomes, and cry foul?

The NEP relies in turn on two companies, Edison Research and Mitofsky International, to conduct and analyze the actual polling. However, **few Americans realize that the final exit polls on Election Day are adjusted by the pollsters - in other words, weighted according to the computerized-voting-machine totals.** When challenged on these disparities, pollsters often point to methodological flaws. Within days of the 2004 election, Warren Mitofsky (who invented exit polls in 1967) appeared on television to unveil what became known as the \"reluctant Bush responder\" theory: \"We suspect that the main reason was that the Kerry voters were more anxious to participate in our exit polls than the Bush voters.\" But some analysts and pollsters insist this theory is entirely unproven. \"I don't think the pollsters have really made a convincing case that it's solely methodological,\" Moore told me. In Moore's opinion, the NEP could resolve the whole issue by making raw, unadjusted, precinct-level data available to the public. \"Our great, free, and open media are concealing data so that it cannot be analyzed,\" Moore charges. Their argument that such data is proprietary and would allow analysts to deduce which votes were cast by specific individuals is, Moore insists, \"specious at best.\" He adds: \"They have a communal responsibility to clarify whether there is a vote miscount going on. But so far there's been no pressure on them to do so.\" Some argue that the Democratic victories in 2006 and 2008 disprove the existence of the red shift. However, this may be a misinterpretation of complex political upheavals that occurred in each of those election years. While Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives in 2006, and the White House in 2008, post election analyses did in fact suggest extensive red-shift rigging. But in both election cycles, these efforts simply failed to overcome eleventh-hour events so negative that they drastically undercut the projected wins for the G.O.P. In 2006, it was the exposure of Republican representative Mark Foley's sexual advances toward male congressional pages, and the long-standing cover-up of his behavior by G.O.P. leadership. The scandal swirling around the outwardly homophobic Foley broke in a very ugly and public way, engulfing the entire party and causing a free fall in its polling numbers. The Democratic margin in the Cook Generic Congressional Ballot poll, which had been at 9 percent in early October, jumped to 26 percent by the week of the election.

The collapse of Lehman Brothers months before the 2008 elections had a similar effect on John McCain's numbers. Pre-election polls showed that the American public blamed the Republicans for the imploding financial markets. \"These political sea changes swamped a red shift that turned out to be under-calibrated,\" argues Jonathan Simon, who speculates that Barack Obama actually won by a historic landslide, driven by an overwhelming backlash against the policies of the Bush Administration. By 2010, the electoral map was once again littered with upset victories that tipped the balance of power in America back toward the right. In Massachusetts, it was Tea Party candidate Scott Brown who achieved what the New York Times called an \"extraordinary upset\" in his race for the late Ted Kennedy's seat - and thereby erased the Democrats' filibuster-proof supermajority in the Senate. A little more than an hour after the polls closed on January 19, the Associated Press declared that Brown had defeated Attorney General Martha Coakley, becoming the state's first Republican senator in thirty years. By most accounts, Coakley, who was initially favored to win, ran a lackluster campaign. And her opponent was riding a wave of populist discontent with the Obama Administration. Yet even Brown's victory, widely predicted by January 19, raised some questions about voting technology. According to the EDA, in all seventy-one locations where ballots were counted by hand under public observation - more than 65,000 ballots in all - Coakley beat her opponent by 2.8 percent. Their analysis also showed that computer-counted communities were more Democratic by registration and historically less likely to support Republican candidates. In Florida, **Rick Scott was elected governor in November after an historically close race** with his opponent, Alex Sink. Scott, a millionaire and Tea Party favorite, squeaked through with a 1.15 percent margin of victory, representing just 61,550 votes, after a number of Dominion machines in Hillsborough County failed to upload results. In the wake of what was described as a memory-card glitch, election workers manually rescanned about 38,000 early-voting ballots, without any supervision by the public or the press. Sink, who needed only 35,000 more votes to trigger a mandatory recount, conceded the following day. Further darkening Florida's electoral atmosphere was Scott's record of legal travails. He had narrowly avoided indictment in the late 1990s for his role as CEO of Columbia/HCA, a private health-care company. HCA eventually admitted to substantial criminal conduct and paid a record $1.7 billion to the federal government.

Two years later, he targeted 180,000 registered voters in an attempt to purge noncitizens from Florida's voter rolls. Many of the state's sixty-seven county election supervisors refused to carry out the purge.** Leon County supervisor Ion Sancho called it un-American behavior. \"This is an example of partisan manipulation of the process to try to affect the outcome,\" he told me. \"It's sad but true.\" In Wisconsin in 2010, the new Tea Party governor-elect, Scott Walker, unveiled a violently corporatist agenda destined for legal challenge - ensuring that the 2011 race for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court would be of crucial importance. **The election was ultimately decided by Waukesha county clerk Kathy Nickolaus, who \"discovered\" 14,300 votes on her computer late on Election Night. **This windfall handed the victory to the conservative incumbent, Justice David Prosser, for whom Nickolaus had worked for seven years. Prosser later joined the court's majority in upholding Walker's union-busting legislation, stripping workers of their collective-bargaining rights in the birthplace of the Progressive movement. There is, finally, South Carolina's 2010 race for U.S. Senate, which Republican Jim DeMint won with 78 percent of the vote. What is mysterious is not the ultimate outcome, but the Democratic primary that preceded it, which tossed up a fairly fortuitous opponent for DeMint: Alvin Greene, an unemployed thirty-two-year-old accused sex offender living in his father's basement. Greene, often described as \"incoherent,\" ran no campaign: no website, no appearances at Democratic events, not even a yard sign. Yet he miraculously beat his opponent in the Democratic primary, former judge and four-term state legislator Vic Rawl, by an 18 percent margin.** Voters and campaign workers reported that the ES&S touchscreen machines \"flipped\" votes to Greene all day long. Meanwhile, the absentee ballots - which were counted by hand - told a different story. In half of the state's forty-six counties, there was a 10 percent disparity between absentee ballots and those counted by machine; **in Lancaster County, Rawl won 84 percent of the absentee vote.

Rawl lodged a formal protest and requested a new primary. That was quickly knocked down by the executive committee of the South Carolina Democratic Party - and DeMint sailed to a rout in November. In the weeks following the South Carolina spectacle, the press engaged in round after round of analytic Twister, avoiding the most obvious question: Had another extremist just gained federal office on the basis of a rigged election? Their silence, however, was nothing unusual. In his [2011 paper](http://www.opednews.com/articles/To-The-American-Media-Tim-by-Jonathan-Simon-110408-959.html) \"To the American Media: Time to Face the Reality of Election Rigging,\" Jonathan Simon accuses the press of maintaining a Mafia-style omert on the subject. \"The gruesome truth,\" he writes, \"is that American elections can be rigged, and are being rigged, because the American media treats election rigging as something that - all evidence notwithstanding - could never happen here.\" **Few people know this better than NYU professor Mark Crispin Miller, whose books [Fooled Again](http://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Again-Real-Electoral-Reform/dp/0465045804/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1351630757&sr=8-1&keywords=miller+fooled+again) and [Loser Take All](http://www.amazon.com/Loser-Take-All-Subversion-Democracy/dp/0978843142/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1351630757&sr=8-3&keywords=miller+fooled+again) document a wide assortment of G.O.P. vote-stealing tricks in every major election from 2000 to 2006. When the books were published, he told me, \"I got no interviews and almost no reviews, despite the wealth of evidence I'd gathered. The corporate media was silent. But the left-wing press was hostile.\"** Indeed, his colleagues on the left seem most reluctant of anyone to grapple with the concept of large-scale election tampering. \"I know Michael Moore, Noam Chomsky, Rachel Maddow,\" Miller says. \"I've tried for years to get them to concede that possibility, but they won't do even that. There's clearly a profound unease at work. They just can't go there.\" Why? No doubt the fear of being branded a conspiracy theorist inhibits many - that term having long served as a cudgel to suppress discussion of all sorts of crimes against democracy. **As Miller puts it, \"There is no more exquisite method of silencing dissent, or shutting down inconvenient inquiry, than to charge someone with conspiracy theory.\"** Like their counterparts in the media, Democrats in office today appear unwilling to defend what matters most. They stand in complicit silence as improbable results are spat from the innards of unaccountable voting machines. \"For Democratic legislators and candidates, openly questioning the integrity of American democracy feels like committing political suicide,\" says Ben Ptashnik. A former Vermont state senator, Ptashnik ran for office in 1996 specifically to spearhead the state's Clean Elections Act - whose provisions were largely struck", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:elections__elections_corruption.txt:16:709bba7d39b9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9354, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "elections__elections_corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "elections__elections_corruption", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "theory.\"** Like their counterparts in the media, Democrats in office today appear unwilling to defend what matters most.

A former Vermont state senator, Ptashnik ran for office in 1996 specifically to spearhead the state's Clean Elections Act - whose provisions were largely struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court nearly a decade after its passage. Ptashnik believes that election rigging remains an untouchable phenomenon in American politics. \"Very few leaders are willing to fight it, which is probably why Kerry backed off in 2004. But the evidence is piling up. Democrats have to get their heads out of the sand and realize we're looking at our worst nightmare: Karl Rove's projected forty-year G.O.P. dynasty.\" Ptashnik speaks with particular bluntness about the state of American democracy. \"Today, Karl Rove and the Koch brothers are pushing a corporatist, anti-union agenda,\" he says, \"cynically allying with anti-immigrant nativists and Christian fundamentalists.\" He compares the situation to that of Germany during the 1930s, when anticommunism drove industrialists and much of the working class into the arms of fascism. It is Germany, however, that has now become the standard-bearer for clean elections. In 2009, that nation's constitutional court upheld the basic principle of the public nature of democratic elections. By ruling that the vote count must be something the public can authenticate - and without any specialized expertise - the decision directly challenged the use of computers in elections. **Ireland followed suit in June 2012, sending all its electronic voting machines to the scrap heap. Minister for the Environment Phil Hogan called the computerized voting system a poorly conceived, scandalous waste of money and said he was \"glad to bring this sorry episode to a conclusion on behalf of the taxpayer.\"** The November elections will be a watershed for American democracy. A handful of contested Senate seats stand between a right-wing juggernaut and a moderate-progressive counterforce. A few battleground states - notably Florida, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin - hold the key to the presidential election, which may determine the ideological balance of the Supreme Court for decades to come. Mitt Romney is regarded tepidly by the right wing of his own party. His Mormon faith and the moderate positions he took as governor of Massachusetts have limited his ability to rally the activist base. Consequently, even a weakened Obama may prove too powerful an incumbent to rig out of the White House. But if the Republicans gain complete control of Congress, they can probably render Obama toothless for his second term and blame him for the economic upheavals that are sure to come in the next four years.

Their focus, then, will probably be on the Senate, where Democrats still hold a precarious edge. No matter how cynical we may have become about our elections, doing nothing to secure an accurate vote count is not an option. It may be too late to completely prevent vote rigging in the 2012 election. But the spotlight of increased public scrutiny may deter the most brazen acts of fraud - and perhaps dissuade those who believe that shifting votes by minuscule percentages in the electronic dark will go unseen. Where paper ballots still exist, we can demand that local election clerks allow them to be counted by hand before they leave the precinct. Organizing citizen volunteer groups to count them may be necessary. Sheila Parks, who founded the [Center for Hand-Counted Paper Ballots](http://www.handcountedpaperballots.org/), has also urged citizens with legal standing to file injunctions to impound ballots, memory cards, and even voting machines after the polls close. \"This prevents tampering with any of these items after an election,\" she told me, \"and gives us access to them with a secure chain of custody.\" Staring at the outside of a black-box voting system and attempting to detect fraud, however, will not ultimately produce clean elections. It is an exercise in futility if we do not take the next steps now. In preparation for the 2014 election, we must demand that our representatives pass comprehensive election reform, including publicly financed races and a secure, transparent vote count. **A privatized, secret ballot count must be viewed as a violation of our civil rights. Once that principle is clear, as it is now in Germany and Ireland, the rest will naturally follow. If we the people do not feel the outrage, or lack the courage to fight for this most basic right of American self-governance, who will?** **Note:** The above article is available to subscribers on the Harper's website at [this link](http://harpers.org/archive/2012/11/how-to-rig-an-election/).

A search on a good search engine can make this easy. For example, you might do a search on \"California November 2016 elections endorsements\" (without the quotation marks). Place your own state or province name at the beginning of this string of words. You can also add to this string of search terms your favorite political party, newspaper, or whatever organization you most respect to find their recommendations and endorsements. Add the word \"propositions\" and/or \"measures\" if your ballot includes these. This process can save you time no matter what country, state, or province in which you live. **You can use a similar method for propositions or measures and for candidates in local elections as well, where party affiliations are not always mentioned.** I searched for Alameda County, where I live, and found the below Democratic, Republican, and Green party endorsements. I first searched and found each party's website for my county by using the search terms \"alameda county democratic/republican/green party.\" I then searched on these official party websites for their endorsements page.

Many don't realize that the current U.S. Constitution, originally created in 1787, gave the right to vote only to white male landowners, a relatively small percentage of the population. The right to vote for all men, for all races, and for women was not easily won. The women's suffrage movement is a remarkable example of this. Read this shocking tale of what some women in the United States had to go through to get the right to vote. As you read, may you be inspired to deepen your commitment in this modern day to play your part in building a brighter future for us and for our children. We've come a long way, baby, and we have yet a long way to go.

Remember, it was not until 1920 that women were granted the right to go to the polls and vote. In the spring of 1917, members of the National Woman's Party (NWP) began picketing the White House and the Capitol as part of a campaign for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing universal suffrage. By mid-June, NWP leader Alice Paul had been warned by the chief of police that further demonstrations would lead to arrests. In the following months, many were arrested. Some were tried and sentenced to sixty days in Occoquan Workhouse in suburban Virginia. These women were innocent and defenseless, but they were jailed nonetheless for picketing the White House and carrying signs asking for the right to vote.

Paddy wagon detains women picketers Lucy Burns beaten and chained One fateful November night while still in jail, many of these brave women were subjected to the wrath of the male institution. Forty prison guards wielding clubs and their warden's blessing went on a rampage against the 33 women wrongly convicted of 'obstructing sidewalk traffic.' And by the end of the night, they were barely alive. They beat Lucy Burns, chained her hands to the cell bars above her head and left her hanging for the night, bleeding and gasping for air. They hurled Dora Lewis into a dark cell, smashed her head against an iron bed and knocked her out cold. Her cellmate, Alice Cosu, thought Lewis was dead. She suffered a heart attack. Additional affidavits describe the guards dragging, beating, choking, slamming, pinching, and kicking the women. Thus unfolded the 'Night of Terror' on Nov. 15, 1917, when the warden at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia ordered his guards to teach a lesson to the suffragists imprisoned there because they dared to picket Woodrow Wilson's White House for the right to vote. Dora Lewis knocked out Alice Paul force fed For weeks, the women's only water came from an open pail. Their food - if you can call it that - was infested with terrible vermin. When picket leader Alice Paul embarked on a hunger strike, they tied her to a chair, forced a tube down her throat and poured liquid into her until she vomited. She was tortured like this for weeks until word was smuggled out to the press. So, refresh my memory. Some women won't vote because - why, exactly? We have carpool duties? We have to get to work? Our vote doesn't matter? It's raining? Last week, a friend of mine went to a sparsely attended screening of HBO's new movie '[Iron Jawed Angels](http://www.amazon.com/Iron-Jawed-Angels-Hilary-Swank/dp/B00026L9CU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1291143799&sr=8-1).' It is a graphic depiction of the battle these women waged so that I could pull the curtain at the polling booth and have my say. I am ashamed to say I needed the reminder. My friend Wendy, who is my age and studied women's history, saw the HBO movie, too. When she stopped by my desk to talk about it, she looked angry. She was angry - with herself. 'One thought kept coming back to me as I watched that movie,' she said. 'What would those women think of the way I use, or don't use, my right to vote?

I wish all history, social studies and government teachers would include this movie in their curriculum. I want it shown anywhere women gather. I realize this isn't our usual idea of socializing, but we are not voting in the numbers that we should be, and I think a little shock therapy is in order. It is jarring in this stirring film to watch President Wilson and his cronies try to persuade a psychiatrist to declare Alice Paul insane, so that she could be permanently institutionalized. And it is inspiring to watch the doctor refuse. Alice Paul was strong, he said, and brave. That didn't make her crazy. The doctor admonished the men: 'Courage in women is often mistaken for insanity.'

Dora Lewis knocked out Alice Paul force fed For weeks, the women's only water came from an open pail. Their food - if you can call it that - was infested with terrible vermin. When picket leader Alice Paul embarked on a hunger strike, they tied her to a chair, forced a tube down her throat and poured liquid into her until she vomited. She was tortured like this for weeks until word was smuggled out to the press. So, refresh my memory. Some women won't vote because - why, exactly? We have carpool duties? We have to get to work? Our vote doesn't matter? It's raining? Last week, a friend of mine went to a sparsely attended screening of HBO's new movie '[Iron Jawed Angels](http://www.amazon.com/Iron-Jawed-Angels-Hilary-Swank/dp/B00026L9CU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1291143799&sr=8-1).' It is a graphic depiction of the battle these women waged so that I could pull the curtain at the polling booth and have my say. I am ashamed to say I needed the reminder. My friend Wendy, who is my age and studied women's history, saw the HBO movie, too. When she stopped by my desk to talk about it, she looked angry. She was angry - with herself. 'One thought kept coming back to me as I watched that movie,' she said. 'What would those women think of the way I use, or don't use, my right to vote? All of us take it for granted now, not just younger women, but those of us who seek to learn.' The right to vote, she said, had become valuable to her 'all over again.'

And it is inspiring to watch the doctor refuse. Alice Paul was strong, he said, and brave. That didn't make her crazy. The doctor admonished the men: 'Courage in women is often mistaken for insanity.'

Please pass on this powerful information which is so vital to the future of democracy. **A Brief History of Computerized Election Fraud in America** By Victoria Collier Squadrons of shiny new touch screen Trojan horses are being rolled into precincts across America. Not, as we are told, to make voting easier or more accurate. The real reason America is being flooded with billions of dollars worth of paperless **computerized voting machines** is so that no one will be able to prove vote fraud. These machines are not just unverifiable, they **are secretly programmed. Their software is not open to scrutiny by election officials or computer experts. They are also equipped with modems accessible by computer, telephone, and satellite**. We the People are responsible for taking back the control of our democratic process. No one else will do it for us. We cannot afford to be naive, or uneducated at this time in history. In order to fully understand the extent of the corruption we are dealing with, and to avoid making dangerous mistakes based on ignorance, we must understand the history, and the power structure, behind vote fraud in America. I grew up with two men who spent twenty-five years investigating vote fraud in America: James and Kenneth Collier, my father and uncle. **Their book, *****Votescam: The Stealing of America***** was published in 1992 and immediately banned by the major book chains**, which listed the book as \"out of print\" and actively worked to prevent its sale. *Votescam* chronicles the Collier brother's groundbreaking investigation into America's multi-billion dollar election rigging industry, and the corporate government and media officials who control it. [First [eight chapters](http://www.constitution.org/vote/votescam__.htm) available free online] The Votescam investigation began in 1970, in -- surprise! -- Dade County, Florida, where Ken ran for Congress (with Jim as his campaign manager). Ken was rigged out of the election through a vote scam, which the Colliers later discovered was used throughout the country for decades. It went like this: The local newscaster would announce during the broadcast of election returns that the election \"computer has broken down.\" Instead of giving official returns from the county courthouse, the networks would be running", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:electionsfraud.txt:0:6fe4bbe2e9e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9370, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "electionsfraud.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "electionsfraud", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "began in 1970, in -- surprise! -- Dade County, Florida, where Ken ran for Congress (with Jim as his campaign manager).

It went like this: The local newscaster would announce during the broadcast of election returns that the election \"computer has broken down.\" Instead of giving official returns from the county courthouse, the networks would be running vote \"projections\" for the rest of the night. Jim and Ken, who had garnered 30 percent of the vote, noticed that when the vote totals came back on the screen after the announcement, they had mysteriously lost 15 percentage points. They didn't get another vote for the rest of the night. When they examined the \"official\" election results from for the September primary, October run-off and November final election in Dade County, the record listed a total of 141,000 votes cast for the governors race in each election. **The exact same number of total votes were cast for three elections with a different number of candidates running each time.** The same identical figures were listed for the Senate race in the primary, run-off and final election. This, of course, is a statistical impossibility. When they compared the \"official\" vote results with a print-out of the vote \"projections\" broadcast by the TV networks on the final election night, they found that **channel 4 had \"projected\" with near perfect accuracy the results of 40 races with 250 candidates only 4 minutes after the polls closed**. **Channel 7 came even closer; at 9:31 pm, they \"projected\" the final vote total for a race at 96,499 votes. When the Colliers checked the \"official\" number . . . it was also 96,499.**** **The networks then made the astonishing claim that the results from a single voting machine somewhere in Dade County were run through a computer program in order to get these vote projections. Elton Davis was the computer programmer responsible for the magic formula that could convert one machine's vote results into near perfect projected vote totals for 40 races and 250 candidates. When Jim and Ken confronted Davis in his office at the University of Miami, he responded: \"You'll never prove it, now get out.\" Finally the networks claimed that members of the League of Women Voters were out in the field on election night, calling in vote totals to channels 4 and 7. When the Colliers confronted the head of the League, Joyce Deiffenderfer, she admitted that there were no LWV members out in the field that night. She broke down crying, saying \"I don't want to get caught up in this thing. When the TV networks claimed that the courthouse computer had broken down, and they would no longer be reporting actual vote totals, they were lying. They had never been", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:electionsfraud.txt:1:2bb8c63cb40e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9371, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "electionsfraud.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "electionsfraud", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "election night, calling in vote totals to channels 4 and 7.

When the TV networks claimed that the courthouse computer had broken down, and they would no longer be reporting actual vote totals, they were lying. They had never been reporting actual vote totals. The final shoe dropped months later when an official press release appeared from Dade data processing chief, Leonard White, which stated emphatically: **The county computer at the courthouse was never down, and it was never slow.**** **This was the beginning. The Collier brothers had slammed their boat into the tip of a giant iceberg. As they continued to investigate, they were horrified to discover vote fraud collusion among key individuals in every branch and on every level of the American political system. Those who were not benefiting from the fraud were too afraid to fight it. Their search for justice led to dead-ends. Their lives were threatened. They were vilified as conspiracy theorists by the mainstream press . . . and yet they persevered. **The next quarter century was spent compiling a wealth of** **FBI documented evidence** **proving that elections in the United States have come under the tight control of a handful of powerful and corrupt people.** Jim and Ken both died young during the 90's, as heroes to many thousands who heard them speak on the radio and at political meetings across the country. They helped to guide individuals and groups working for clean elections in their communities. The Collier's last hope was that *Votescam* would be used as evidence in a serious Congressional investigation into election fraud. Many people still in power have yet to be held accountable for their role in aiding and abetting vote fraud. I'll give you two important examples. Famous Miami lawyer Ellis Rubin brought the original Votescam evidence to the **Florida assistant State Attorney at the time, Janet Reno**. The evidence included the shaved wheels of lever voting machines, forged canvass sheets, and pre-printed vote tally sheets. **Reno refused to prosecute, claiming falsely that the statue of limitations had run out on the crime.** Years later, Rubin would tell my father that behind closed doors Reno had stated that she could not prosecute. Why? Because she would bring down many of the most powerful people in the state. Another notable Votescam criminal can now be found sitting on the bench of the highest court in the nation. **Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, while still a Federal Appeals Judge, single handedly destroyed what would have been an historic lawsuit** filed against Justice Department lawyer Craig Donsanto, who had refused to prosecute the extensive vote fraud evidence brought to him", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:electionsfraud.txt:2:f3ddba70becf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9372, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "electionsfraud.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "electionsfraud", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "that she could not prosecute.

The evidence included videotape of the League of Women voters tampering with ballots in a close door vote \"counting\" session. The women were illegally punching holes in already cast ballots. I'd like to offer a brief list of important lessons learned from twenty-five years of fighting vote fraud in the trenches. **Secret vote counting is illegal.** Counting faster is not a justification for counting secretly. Lever machines were the first to appear, and they were riggable in a number of ways. One could rig the lever machine itself, or the electronic scanning machines that counted the ballots. Computerized voting machines are the easiest to rig. Their software is not open to public scrutiny, or the scrutiny of Election Supervisors. **There are nearly infinite ways to program the machines to count votes fraudulently.** Since they are accessible by modem, they can be controlled from a remote, centralized location. **Voting machine companies operate with no federal oversight**, certification process, standards or restrictions. Just two companies -- Election Systems and Software (ES&S) and Diebold Voting Systems -- now control about 80% of the vote count in the U.S. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have been complicit in vote rigging for decades, to their mutual benefit. **Vote rigging is NOT a partisan issue.** The corporate major media networks play a vital role in perpetrating and covering up vote fraud. Election Day media polls are untrustworthy at best. The gravest error of judgment these days comes from those vote reformers who honestly believe that the answer to the butterfly ballot and hanging chad problems in the 2000 election is to embrace the ballot-less computerized voting machine. With the ballot-less computer, there is no way to recount, no way to prove any discrepancy, inaccuracy or fraud. **Just the fact that companies like ES&S and Diebold would even make a ballot-less machine should be cause for a Congressional investigation**. (There are also many other reasons to investigate them. For a detailed examination of these sinister corporations, check out [http://www.blackboxvoting.org](http://www.blackboxvoting.org)) A most grave error of judgment also comes from those who think that returning to a hand-counted paper ballot system is somehow impossible. **An MIT/Cal Tech study done in 2001 shows that manually counted paper ballots are the most accurate system out of the 5 systems used in the last 4 presidential elections.

They are totally verifiable, and first-world nations across the globe still use them, including Canada which counted their last presidential election in four hours.**** **The bottom line is that a computerized vote count is a secret vote count, and that's illegal.**** Technology cannot supercede the constitutional and mandatory provisions of election law, which require open and verifiable elections. There is no way to do a public vote count with computers. The count must be done by hand, in public, video-taped, aired live on television, and the results posted on the precinct wall -- just like they used to be. Ballots should be counted on the same day as the voting takes place, making it much more difficult to alter ballots. Hand counted paper ballots and eternal vigilance are the only hope left for us. *A long time writer and political activist, Victoria Collier continues to educate the public on the subject of vote fraud in place of her father and uncle.* ** For an engaging HBO documentary available free on elections fraud: [https://www.WantToKnow.info/electionsvideodocumentary](https://www.WantToKnow.info/electionsvideodocumentary)** For other reliable, verifiable information and resources in our Elections Information Center: [https://www.WantToKnow.info/electionsinformation](https://www.WantToKnow.info/electionsinformation) [http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/electionsfraud&title=](http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/electionsfraud&title=) **What you can do:** Inform your media and political representatives of this important information on elections fraud.

Diebold's voting-machine business is now owned by the Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems, whose e-voting machines are used in about 22 states. Roger Johnston and Jon Warner from Argonne National Laboratory's Vulnerability Assessment Team demonstrate three different ways an attacker could tamper with, and remotely take full control, of the e-voting machine simply by attaching what they call a piece of \"alien electronics\" into the machine's circuit board. **The electronic hacking tool consists of a $1.29 microprocessor and a circuit board that costs about $8. Together with the $15 remote control, which enabled the researchers to modify votes from up to a half-mile away, the whole hack runs about $26. ** **Voting Machines Put U.S. Democracy at Risk** CNN News, Sept. 20, 2006, [http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/09/19/Dobbs.Sept20](http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/09/19/Dobbs.Sept20) There is little assurance your vote will count. As we've been reporting almost nightly...for more than a year, electronic voting machines are placing our democracy at risk. These machines time and again have been demonstrated to be extremely vulnerable to tampering and error, and many of them have no voter-verified paper trail. Only 27 states have laws requiring the use of voter-verified paper trails. During the 2004 presidential election, one voting machine...added nearly 3,900 additional votes.

Four swing states - Pennsylvania, Virginia, Colorado, and Florida - rely to varying degrees on paperless machines. Alex Halderman, a researcher at the University of Michigan, and a colleague at Princeton University hacked into a paperless touch-screen voting machine in 2010 and installed the video game Pac-Man. Similarly, he and Princeton researchers in 2006 demonstrated that if someone could get a few minutes' unattended access to a paperless machine, that person could install a software virus that could spread to other machines and switch those machines' votes before deleting all traces of itself. **For a savvy hacker, the time and access needed to infect a machine is so small that it could be done while in a voting booth.** A hacker could in theory use the Internet to target an e-voting machine company, which would then unknowingly infect its own machines when it serviced them. It's impossible to know if newer machines and software are really secure because their source code is largely unavailable for analysis. Voting-equipment makers frequently say their software is a trade secret. **Major Problems at Polls Feared** *Washington Post,* Sept. 17, 2006, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content...](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/16/AR2006091600885.html) In Maryland last Tuesday, a combination of human blunders and technological glitches caused long lines and delays in vote-counting.

Felten and graduate students Ariel Feldman and Alex Halderman...say they designed software capable of modifying all records, audit logs and counters kept by the voting machine, ensuring that a careful forensic examination would find nothing wrong. **Note:** The full paper is posted on Princeton's website along with an excellent video demonstrating how election results can easily be corrupted: [http://itpolicy.princeton.edu/voting](http://itpolicy.princeton.edu/voting).

Get ready for cheating chips and doctored drives. I am a computer scientist. I own seven Macintosh computers, one Windows machine and a Palm Treo 700p. So why am I advocating the use of 17th-century technology for voting in the 21st century? While computers are very proficient...we should not rely on computers alone to count votes. The people who program them make mistakes. They are more vulnerable to manipulation than most people realize. **A power glitch could cause a hard disk to fail or a magnetic card that holds votes to permanently lose its data. In a 2003 election in Boone County, Ind., [voting machines] recorded 144,000 votes in one precinct populated with fewer than 6,000 registered voters.** Consider one simple mode of attack...called overwriting the boot loader. An attacker can, for example, make the machine count every fifth Republican vote as a Democratic vote, swap the vote outcome at the end of the election or produce a completely fabricated result. To stage this attack, a night janitor at the polling place would need only a few seconds' worth of access to the computer's memory card slot. [And] you can't easily discover if they've been tinkered with. It's one thing to suspect that officials have miscounted hanging chads, but something else entirely for people to wonder whether a corrupt programmer working behind the scenes has rigged a computer to help his side. **Activists Sue to Block Electronic Voting** ABC News/Associated Press, July 13, 2006, [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics,,,](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=2188430) Computerized voting was supposed to be the cure for ballot fiascos such as the 2000 presidential election, but activist groups say it has only worsened the problem.

States are adopting rules that make it hard, and financially perilous, for nonpartisan groups to register new voters. Florida recently reached a new low when it actually bullied the League of Women Voters into stopping its voter registration efforts in the state. The Legislature did this by adopting a law that seems intended to scare away anyone who wants to run a voter registration drive. In Washington, a new law prevents people from voting if the secretary of state fails to match the information on their registration form with government databases. There are many reasons that names, Social Security numbers and other data may not match, including typing mistakes. Colorado recently imposed criminal penalties on volunteers who slip up in registration drives. **Protecting the integrity of voting is important, but many of these rules seem motivated by a partisan desire to suppress the vote...rather than to make sure that those who are entitled to vote [can] do so. ** **Will Your Vote Count in 2006?** *Newsweek,* May 29, 2006, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12888600/site/newsweek](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12888600/site/newsweek) A report by Finnish security expert Harri Hursti analyzed Diebold voting machines for an organization called", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:electionsmanipulations.txt:4:e4e6352eec42", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9382, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "electionsmanipulations.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "electionsmanipulations", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "including typing mistakes.

Hursti found unheralded vulnerabilities in the machines. **Experts are calling them the most serious voting-machine flaws ever documented. It requires only a few minutes of pre-election access to a Diebold machine to open the machine and insert a PC card that...could reprogram the machine to give control to the violator.** The machine could go dead on Election Day or throw votes to the wrong candidate. Worse, it's even possible for such ballot-tampering software to trick authorized technicians into thinking that everything is working fine, an illusion you couldn't pull off with pre-electronic systems. If it so happens that someone not supposed to use the machine-or an election official who wants to put his or her thumb on the scale of democracy-takes advantage of this fast track to fraud, that's not Diebold's problem. \"When you're using a paperless voting system, there is no security,\" says David Dill, a Stanford professor who founded the election-reform organization [Verified Voting](http://www.verifiedvoting.org/). **A New Election Lawsuit in Florida** *Time*, May 18, 2006, [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1195517,00.html](http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1195517,00.html) The League of Women Voters has been signing up voters ever since women won the right to vote. But now, for the first time in the League's storied history, a branch of the organization has shut down its operations to protest a new Florida law that the League claims will have a chilling effect on voter registration. The League...joined several other pubic interest and labor groups, including the Florida AFL-CIO, in challenging the constitutionality of the law. They are asking the U.S. District Court to immediately suspend the fines which the groups say could bankrupt their voter registration budgets. **The challenged law imposes civil fines of $250 for each voter registration application submitted more than 10 days after it is collected, $500 for each application submitted after any voter registration deadline, and $5,000 for each application [not] submitted.** **Reversing Course on Electronic Voting** *Wall Street Journal*, May 12, 2006, [http://online.wsj.com/public/article...](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB114739688261250925-q5rh2ocioxu6mgjmS6bZPCZL0HY_20060610.html) Some advocates of a 2002 law mandating upgrades of the nation's voting machinery now worry the overhaul is making things worse.

The maverick elections supervisor in Leon County, Fla., last year helped show that electronic voting machines from one of the major manufacturers are vulnerable...and would allow election workers to alter vote counts without detection. Now, however, Sancho may be paying an unexpected price for his whistle-blowing: None of the state-approved companies here will sell him the voting machines the county needs. \"I believe I'm being singled out for punishment by the vendors,\" he said. The trouble began last year when Sancho allowed a Finnish computer scientist to test Leon County's Diebold voting machines. **Some tests...showed that elections workers could alter the vote tallies by manipulating the removable memory cards in the voting machines, and do so without detection. **California elections officials arranged for experts to perform a similar analysis of the Diebold machines and also found them vulnerable-noting a wider variety of flaws than Sancho.** A spokesman said Diebold will not sell to Sancho without assurances that he will not permit more such tests, which the company considers a reckless use of the machines.** **The Business of Voting** *New York Times,* Dec. 18, 2005, [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/opinion/18sun2.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/opinion/18sun2.html?ex=1292562000&en=a0314a4ed36ebaa1&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) Diebold, the controversial electronic voting machine manufacturer, is coming off a tumultuous week. Its chief executive, Walden O'Dell, resigned. It was hit with a pair of class-action lawsuits charging insider trading and misrepresentation, and a county in Florida concluded that Diebold's voting machines could be hacked. The counting of votes is a public trust. Diebold, whose machines count many votes, has never acted as if it understood this. Mr. O'Dell made national headlines when he wrote a fund-raising letter before the 2004 election expressing his commitment to help deliver the electoral votes of Ohio-where Diebold is based, and where its machines are used-to President Bush. **The company was accused of installing improperly certified software, which is illegal, in a 2002 governor's race in Georgia.

Wellstone was often labeled the most progressive member of Senate. **On the Voting Machine Makers' Tab** *New York Times*, Sept. 12, 2004, [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/12/opinion/12sun2.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/12/opinion/12sun2.html?ex=1252728000&en=dda9313c18e02663&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland) Some of electronic voting's loudest defenders have been state and local election officials. Many of those same officials have financial ties to voting machine companies. Officials from Georgia, California and Texas argued that voter-verifiable paper trails...are impractical.** Former secretaries of state from Florida and Georgia have signed on as lobbyists for Election Systems and Software and Diebold Election Systems. When Bill Jones left office as California's secretary of state in 2003, he quickly became a consultant to Sequoia Voting Systems. His assistant secretary of state took a full-time job there.** The list goes on. While they may sincerely think that electronic voting machines are so trustworthy that there is no need for a paper record of votes, their views have to be regarded with suspicion until their conflicts are addressed. **Secretive Testing Firms Certify Nation's Vote Count Machines** MSNBC/Associated Press* ,* Aug. 23, 2004, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id...](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5762054/from/RL.4/) **The three companies that certify the nation's voting technologies operate in secrecy, and refuse to discuss flaws in the machines.

Paid hackers had little trouble casting multiple votes and taking over the machines' vote-recording mechanisms. Computer-security experts [who tried] to foil the safeguards and interfere with an election...were disturbingly successful. They were able to change votes from a remote location. The [Maryland study](http://www.raba.com/press/TA_Report_AccuVote.pdf) shows convincingly that more security is needed for electronic voting, starting with voter-verified paper trails. Maryland's 16,000 machines all have identical locks...which can be opened by any one of 32,000 keys. The security team had no trouble making duplicates...although that proved unnecessary since one team member picked the lock in \"approximately 10 seconds.\" Diebold, the machines' manufacturer, rushed to issue a self-congratulatory [press release](http://www.companyboardroom.com/releasetext.asp?ticker=dbd&coid=106584&client=cb&release=489744) with the headline \"Maryland Security Study Validates Diebold Election Systems Equipment.\" **The study's authors were shocked to see their findings spun so positively.** **Note:** How is Diebold able to brag about its success when the tests clearly failed.

The difficult questions are: Did Governor Jeb Bush, his Secretary of State Katherine Harris, and her Director of Elections, Clayton Roberts, know they had wrongly barred 22,000 black, Democrat voters before the elections? After the elections, did they use their powers to prevent the count of 20,000 votes for the Democrats? Altogether, it looks like this cost the Democrats about 22,000 votes in Florida, which George Bush won by only 537 votes. In all, Palm Beach voting machines misread 27,000 ballots. Jeb Bush's Secretary of State, Katharine Harris, stopped them counting these votes by hand. **Note:** You can watch a video of this and more fascinating information at the BBC link above.

Voter advocate Bev Harris alleged Tuesday that managers of a subsidiary of Diebold Inc., one of the country's largest voting equipment vendors, included a cocaine trafficker, a man who conducted fraudulent stock transactions, and a programmer jailed for falsifying computer records. The programmer, Jeffrey Dean, wrote and maintained proprietary code used to count hundreds of thousands of votes as senior vice president of Global Election Systems Inc. Diebold purchased GES in January 2002. **According to a public court document released before GES hired him, Dean served time in a Washington correctional facility for stealing money and tampering with computer files in a scheme that \"involved a high degree of sophistication and planning.\"** The former GES is Diebold's wholly owned subsidiary, Global Election Management Systems, which produces the operating system that touch-screen voting terminals use. **For Those Who Want to Go Deeper:** If you are ready to explore the dark underbelly of the elections problem, the link below provides key excerpts from a riveting article which goes much deeper than you will find in media reports.

The paper clips weren't even necessary, since all 32,000 keys supplied by Diebold for the machines are identical, allowing any key to open all of the machines.

In hundreds of instances ... they [have failed] unpredictably, and in extremely strange ways; voters report that their choices \"flip\" from one candidate to another before their eyes; machines crash or begin to count backward; votes simply vanish. Most famously, in the November 2006 Congressional election in Sarasota, Fla., touch-screen machines recorded an 18,000-person \"undervote\" for a race decided by fewer than 400 votes. The earliest critiques of digital voting booths came from the fringe - disgruntled citizens and ... computer geeks - but the fears have now risen to the highest levels of government. One by one, states are renouncing the use of touch-screen voting machines. California and Florida decided to get rid of their electronic voting machines. Colorado decertified about half of its touch-screen devices. **Michael Shamos, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University who has examined voting-machine systems for more than 25 years, estimates that about 10 percent of the touch-screen machines \"fail\" in each election.** **Note:** 10% of the machines fail, yet many still believe the results from previous elections were accurate. **A Single Person Could Swing an Election** **2006-06-28, *Washington Post*** [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/27/AR20060627014...](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/27/AR2006062701451.html) To determine what it would take to hack a U.S. election, a team of cybersecurity experts turned to a fictional battleground state called Pennasota.

No one mentioned that eight years ago, the [Project for a New American Century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnac) called for \"a new Pearl Harbor\" that could move the American people to accept the neoconservative vision of militarized global domination. Then 9/11 happened, lifting George W. Bush from the shadows of a disputed election to the heights of a \"war presidency.\" Bush has taken on unprecedented powers since the events of 9/11. On that day, the president issued his \"Declaration of Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks\" under the authority of the National Emergencies Act. This declaration, which can be rescinded by joint resolution of Congress, has instead been extended six times. In 2007, the declaration was quietly strengthened with the issuance of **National Security Presidential Directive 51, **which** gave the president the authority to do whatever he deems necessary in a vaguely defined \"catastrophic emergency,\" including everything from canceling elections to suspending the Constitution to launching a nuclear attack.** **Not a single congressional hearing was held on this directive.** **U.S. media have lost the will to dig deep** **2007-04-27, *Los Angeles Times*** [http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-palast27apr27,0,5178561.story](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-palast27apr27,0,5178561.story) **In an e-mail uncovered and released by the House Judiciary Committee last month, Tim Griffin, once Karl Rove's right-hand man, gloated that \"no [U.S.] national press picked up\" a BBC Television story reporting that the Rove team had developed an elaborate scheme to challenge the votes of thousands of African Americans in the 2004 election.** Griffin wasn't exactly right.

Texas-based Premier Elections Solutions [formerly Diebold Inc.] last week alerted at least 1,750 jurisdictions across the country that special precautions are needed to address the problem in tabulation software affecting all 19 of its models dating back a decade. Voting experts reacted skeptically to the company's assertion that election workers' routine crosschecks of ballot totals would have spotted any instances where its servers failed to register some precinct vote totals when receiving data from multiple memory cards. Like nearly all of the nation's modern voting equipment, Premier's products were declared \"qualified\" under a voluntary testing process overseen from the mid 1990s until 2005 by the National Association of State Election Directors. Computer scientists, some state officials and election watchdog groups allege that the NASED-sponsored testing system was a recipe for disaster, shrouded in secrecy, and allowing equipment makers to help design the tests. As a result, charged Susan Greenhalgh, a spokeswoman for watchdog group [Voter Action](http://www.voteraction.org/), **the systems on which Americans will decide the race between Barack Obama and John McCain in November are \"scandalously flawed\"' and \"the integrity of this election is in question.\"** **Note:** Why isn't this important news being picked up by other major media? **Opinion: Let's impeach e-voting** **2008-09-08, *Computerworld*** [http://computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyN...](http://computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=security&articleId=325032%20%3Chttp://computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=security&articleId=325032) Were software patches that didn't fix problems but instead changed results applied to electronic voting machines in two Georgia counties? Were the patches applied at the instruction of a top Diebold executive, without informing local election officials? This charge has been leveled several times since a rather surprising election in which two Democratic candidates had comfortable leads in polls just before Election Day yet lost by substantial margins. Of course, there's a strong correlation between your degree of suspicion of those results and which party you support. But we should all be frightened if there's no way to prove that tampering didn't occur. And when voting machines are electronic, paperless and proprietary, it's all but impossible to do a recount or check for errors in a way that can uncover a malicious hack. Election consultant Chris Hood told *Rolling Stone* magazine that he was working for Diebold in Georgia in 2002 when **the head of the company's election division arrived to distribute a patch to workers. That code was applied to only about 5,000 machines in two counties. Hood says it was an unauthorized patch that was kept hidden from state officials.

As we've been reporting almost nightly ... for more than a year, electronic voting machines are placing our democracy at risk. These machines time and again have been demonstrated to be extremely vulnerable to tampering and error, and many of them have no voter-verified paper trail. Only 27 states have laws requiring the use of voter-verified paper trails. 15 states [have] no mandated requirements for safeguarding your vote. During the 2004 presidential election, one voting machine ... added nearly 3,900 additional votes to Bush's total. Officials caught the machine's error because only 638 voters cast presidential ballots at that precinct, but in a heavily populated district, can we really be sure the votes will be counted correctly?** [In] the May primary election in Cuyahoga County, Ohio ... the electronic voting machines' four sources of vote totals -- individual ballots, paper trail summary, election archives and memory cards -- didn't even match up.** The report concluded that relying on the current system for Cuyahoga County's more than 1.3 million people should be viewed as \"a calculated risk.\" Are we really willing to risk our democracy? A 2005 Government Accountability Office report on electronic voting confirmed the worst fears of watchdog groups and election officials. \"There is evidence that some of these concerns have been realized and have caused problems with recent elections, resulting in the loss and miscount of votes.\" That is simply unacceptable. Congress and the White House need to immediately take steps to assure the integrity of electronic voting with paper trails that could be audited in any recount. **Note:** For lots more reliable, verifiable information on the various aspects of the elections cover-up, see [https://www.WantToKnow.info/electionsinformation](https://www.WantToKnow.info/electionsinformation) **In Search of Accurate Vote Totals** **2006-09-05, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/05/opinion/05tue1.html?ex=1315108800&en=c05607...](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/05/opinion/05tue1.html?ex=1315108800&en=c0560775e07d9ee0&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) It's hard to believe that nearly six years after the disasters of Florida in 2000, states still haven't mastered the art of counting votes accurately.

But on May 28, she nearly approved it - without her knowledge, and without her presence on the Assembly floor. As the roll call began, Hayashi was engaged in a budget subcommittee meeting on the Capitol's fourth floor. Suddenly, two floors below, the light next to her name on the big electronic voting board in the Assembly chamber turned green, a \"yes\" vote. Seconds later, it turned red. Then green. Red. Green. Finally, after 22 seconds of alternating colors, the space next to Hayashi's name went blank. While there are conflicting accounts of exactly what caused this dizzying sequence, this much is clear: Two people had their hands on Hayashi's voting switches during the roll call on AB2818 - and one was acting against her will. **\"Ghost voting\" was not the only disturbing episode as the Assembly took up 316 bills in the three days leading up to the deadline for measures to pass their house of origin.

Tens of thousands of voters, scattered across more than 25 states, encountered serious problems at the polls. The difficulties led to shortages of substitute paper ballots and long lines that caused many voters to leave without casting ballots. Voting experts say it is impossible to say how many votes were not counted that should have been. In Florida alone, the discrepancies ... amount to more than 60,000 votes. **In Colorado, as many as 20,000 people gave up trying to vote ... as new online systems for verifying voter registrations crashed repeatedly. In Arkansas, election officials tallied votes three times in one county, and each time the number of ballots cast changed by more than 30,000.** Election experts say that with electronic voting machines, the potential consequences of misdeeds or errors are of a [great] magnitude. A single software error can affect thousands of votes, especially with machines that keep no paper record. In Ohio, thousands of voters were turned away or forced to file provisional ballots by poll workers puzzled by voter-identification rules. In Pennsylvania, the machines crashed or refused to start, producing many reports of vote-flipping [where] voters press the button for one candidate but a different candidate's name appears on the screen. In Ohio, even a congressman, Steve Chabot, a Republican, was turned away from his polling place because the address listed on his driver's license was different than his home address. **When Votes Disappear** **2006-11-24, *New York Times*** [http://select.nytimes.com/2006/11/24/opinion/24krugman.html](http://select.nytimes.com/2006/11/24/opinion/24krugman.html) There were many problems with voting in this election.

In at least one Congressional race, the evidence strongly suggests that paperless voting machines failed to count thousands of votes, and that the disappearance of these votes delivered the race to the wrong candidate. [In] Florida's 13th Congressional District .. according to the official vote count, the Republicans [won] narrowly. The problem is that the official vote count isn't credible. In much of the 13th District, the voting pattern looks normal. But in Sarasota County, which used touch-screen voting machines ... almost 18,000 voters - nearly 15 percent of those who cast ballots using the machines - supposedly failed to vote for either candidate in the hotly contested Congressional race. That compares with undervote rates ranging from 2.2 to 5.3 percent in neighboring counties. The Herald-Tribune of Sarasota ... interviewed hundreds of voters.** About a third of those interviewed by the paper reported that they couldn't even find the Congressional race on the screen. Moreover, more than 60 percent of those interviewed ... reported that they did cast a vote in the Congressional race - but that this vote didn't show up on the ballot summary page. **An Orlando Sentinel examination of other votes cast by those who supposedly failed to cast a vote ... shows that they strongly favored Democrats, and Mr. Buchanan won the official count by only 369 votes. For the nation as a whole, the important thing isn't who gets seated to represent Florida's 13th District. It's whether the voting disaster there leads to legislation requiring voter verification and a paper trail. I've been shocked at how little national attention the mess in Sarasota has received. **Counting the Vote, Badly** **2006-11-16, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/16/opinion/16thur1.html?ex=1321333200&en=73e0e...](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/16/opinion/16thur1.html?ex=1321333200&en=73e0ed5c9c6e54b2&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) Last week's elections provided a lot of disturbing news about the reliability of electronic voting. In a Congressional race ... Sarasota County [Florida] reported that more than 18,000 people, or one in eight, did not choose either candidate. That \"undervote\" of nearly 13 percent is hard to believe, given that only about 2.5 percent of absentee voters did not vote. Ms. Jennings trails Mr. Buchanan by about 400 votes. The serious questions about the Buchanan - Jennings race only add to the high level of mistrust that many people already feel about electronic voting. **Congress has resisted all appeals to pass a law that would ensure that electronic voting is honest and accurate across the nation.

Is there a similar plan for the upcoming elections? This week NOW examines documents and evidence that points to **a Republican Party plan designed to keep Democrats from voting, allegedly by targeting people based on their race and ethnicity with key battleground states like Ohio and Florida of particular interest. \"It was a partisan, discriminatory attempt to challenge voters of color,\"** Eddie Hailes, a senior attorney for [The Advancement Project](http://www.advancementproject.org/), a civil rights group, told NOW. Was the White House involved? David Iglesias, one of the fired U.S. Attorneys, thinks so: \"It's reprehensible. It's unethical, it's unlawful. It may very well be criminal.\" Iglesias told NOW he was repeatedly urged by his superiors at the Justice Department to investigate allegations of false voter registrations. After his investigations came up short, Iglesias said Republican officials got angry and complained to White House aide Karl Rove. Soon after Iglesias lost his job. As a result of allegations by Iglesias and others, Congress is investigating whether the White House acted unlawfully. While Attorney General Alberto Gonzales refused to answer many questions about the controversy as he testified before the Senate this week, Iglesias told NOW he believes the White House is keeping documents from Congress to protect the Bush Administration. \"That's why there has been such a circling of the wagons around Karl Rove and Harriet Miers and Sarah Taylor.

Cumulatively, these irregularities, which affected hundreds of thousand of votes and voters in Ohio, raise grave doubts regarding whether it can be said the Ohio electors selected on December 13, 2004, were chosen in a manner that conforms to Ohio law, let alone federal requirements and constitutional standards.*** ***This report, therefore, makes three recommendations: (1) consistent with the requirements of the United States Constitution concerning the counting of electoral votes by Congress and Federal law implementing these requirements, there are ample grounds for challenging the electors from the State of Ohio; (2) Congress should engage in further hearings into the widespread irregularities reported in Ohio; we believe the problems are serious enough to warrant the appointment of a joint select Committee of the House and Senate to investigate and report back to the Members; and (3) Congress needs to enact election reform to restore our people's trust in our democracy. These changes should include putting in place more specific federal protections for federal elections, particularly in the areas of audit capability for electronic voting machines and casting and counting of provisional ballots, as well as other needed changes to federal and state election laws.*** ***With regards to our factual finding, in brief, we find that there were massive and unprecedented voter irregularities and anomalies in Ohio. In many cases these irregularities were caused by intentional misconduct and illegal behavior, much of it involving Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, the co-chair of the Bush-Cheney campaign in Ohio.*** ***First, in the run up to election day, the following actions by Mr. Blackwell, the Republican Party and election officials disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of Ohio citizens,*** predominantly minority and Democratic voters: **The misallocation of voting machines led to unprecedented long lines that disenfranchised scores, if not hundreds of thousands, of predominantly minority and Democratic voters.** This was illustrated by the fact that the Washington Post reported that in Franklin County, \"27 of the 30 wards with the most machines per registered voter showed majorities for Bush. At the other end of the spectrum, six of the seven wards with the fewest machines delivered large margins for Kerry.\" *(See Powell and Slevin, supra).* Among other things, the conscious failure to provide sufficient voting machinery violates the Ohio Revised Code which requires the Boards of Elections to \"provide adequate facilities at each polling place for conducting the election.\" **Mr. Blackwell's decision to restrict provisional ballots resulted in the disenfranchisement of tens,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:electionsreform.txt:1:5fe18735bf87", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9415, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "electionsreform.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "electionsreform", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "per registered voter showed majorities for Bush.

(ii) Warren County locked out public observers from vote counting citing an FBI warning about a potential terrorist threat, yet the FBI states that it issued no such warning; (iii) the voting records of Perry county show significantly more votes than voters in some precincts, significantly less ballots than voters in other precincts, and voters casting more than one ballot; (iv) in Butler county a down ballot and underfunded Democratic State Supreme Court candidate implausibly received more votes than the best funded Democratic Presidential candidate in history; (v) in Cuyahoga county, poll worker error may have led to little known thirdparty candidates receiving twenty times more votes than such candidates had ever received in otherwise reliably Democratic leaning areas; (vi) in Miami county, voter turnout was an improbable and highly suspect 98.55 percent, and after 100 percent of the precincts were reported, an additional 19,000 extra votes were recorded for President Bush. ***Third, in the post-election period we learned of numerous irregularities in tallying provisional ballots and conducting and completing the recount*** that disenfanchised thousands of voters and call the entire recount procedure into question (as of this date the recount is still not complete): **Mr. Blackwell's failure to articulate clear and consistent standards for the counting of provisional ballots resulted in the loss of thousands of predominantly minority votes.** In Cuyahoga County alone, the lack of guidance and the ultimate narrow and arbitrary review standards significantly contributed to the fact that 8,099 out of 24,472 provisional ballots were ruled invalid, the highest proportion in the state. ***Mr. Blackwell's failure to issue specific standards for the recount contributed to a lack of uniformity in violation of both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clauses.*** We found innumerable irregularities in the recount in violation of Ohio law, including (i) counties which did not randomly select the precinct samples;

and (iv) counties which prevented witnesses for candidates from observing the various aspects of the recount. **The voting computer company Triad has essentially admitted that it engaged in a course of behavior during the recount in numerous counties to provide \"cheat sheets\" to those counting the ballots.** The cheat sheets informed election officials how many votes they should find for each candidate, and how many over and under votes they should calculate to match the machine count. In that way, they could avoid doing a full county-wide hand recount mandated by state law. ** See our archive of revealing news articles at [https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles) ** Your tax-deductible donations, however large or small, help greatly to support this important work.

For the excellent website of Bev Harris, featured in this video, see Black Box Voting at [this link](http://www.blackboxvoting.org/). **HBO Video Documentary: *Hacking Democracy*** Electronic voting machines count about 87% of the votes cast in America today. But are they reliable? Are they safe from tampering? **From a current congressional hearing to persistent media reports that suggest misuse of data and even outright fraud, concerns over the integrity of electronic voting are growing by the day. **And if the voting process is not secure, neither is America's democracy. The timely, cautionary documentary *Hacking Democracy* exposes gaping holes in the security of America's electronic voting system. In the 2000 presidential election, an electronic voting machine recorded minus 16,022 votes for Al Gore in Volusia County, Fla. While fraud was never proven, the faulty tally alerted computer scientists, politicians and everyday citizens to the very real possibility of computer hacking during elections. **In 2002, Seattle grandmother and writer Bev Harris asked officials in her county why they had acquired electronic touch screen systems for their elections. Unsatisfied with their explanation, she set out to learn about electronic voting machines on her own.** In the course of her research, which unearthed hundreds of reported incidents of mishandled voting information, Harris stumbled across an \"online library\" of the Diebold Corporation, discovering a treasure trove of information about the inner-workings of the company's voting system. Harris brought this proprietary \"secret\" information to computer security expert Dr. Avi Rubin of Johns Hopkins University, who determined that the software lacked the necessary security features to prevent tampering. Her subsequent investigation took her from the trash cans of Texas to the secretary of state of California and finally to Florida, where a \"mini-election\" to test the vulnerability of the memory cards used in electronic voting produced alarming results. As the scope of her mission grew, Harris drew on the expertise of other computer science experts, politicians and activists, among them: Andy Stephenson, candidate for", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:electionsvideodocumentary.txt:0:822f1b3422bd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9419, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "electionsvideodocumentary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "electionsvideodocumentary", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "University, who determined that the software lacked the necessary security features to prevent tampering. Her subsequent investigation took her from the trash cans of Texas to the secretary of state of California and finally to Florida, where a \"mini-election\" to test the vulnerability of the memory cards used in electronic voting produced alarming results. As the scope of her mission grew, Harris drew on the expertise of other computer science experts, politicians and activists, among them: Andy Stephenson, candidate for secretary of state in Washington state; Susan Bernecker, Republican candidate in New Orleans; Kathleen Wynne, an activist from Cleveland; Dr. Herbert Thompson, chief security strategist, Security Innovation, Inc.; Ion Sancho, supervisor of elections for Leon County, Fla.; and Harri Hursti, a computer-security analyst. Academics, public officials and others seen in interview footage include: Deanie Lowe, supervisor of elections, Volusia County, Fla.; Mark Radke, marketing director of Diebold; David Cobb, presidential candidate, Green Party; and Rep. Stephanie Tubbs-Jones of Ohio. Diebold software, or other software like it, is installed in thousands of counties across 32 states. David Dill, professor of computer science at Stanford, says the problem is that there are \"lots of people involved in writing the software, and lots of people who could have touched the software before it went into that machine.** If one of those people put something malicious in the software and it's distributed to all the machines, then that one person could be responsible for changing tens of thousands of votes, maybe even hundreds of thousands, across the country.\" ** In Florida, Leon County supervisor of elections Ion Sancho presided over a trial \"mini-election\" to see if the vote could be hacked without being detected. Before votes were actually cast, computer analyst Harri Hursti \"stuffed the ballot box\" by entering votes on the computer's memory card. Then, after votes were cast, the results displayed when the same memory card was entered in the central tabulating program indicated that fraud was indeed possible. In other words,** by accessing a memory card before an election, someone could change the results - a claim Diebold had denied was possible. ** **Ultimately, Bev Harris' research proved that the top-secret computerized systems counting the votes in America's public elections are not only fallible, but also vulnerable to undetectable hacking, from local school board contests to the presidential race.** With the electronic voting machines of three companies - Diebold, ES&S and Sequoia - collectively responsible for around 80 percent of America's votes today, the stakes for democracy are high.

Not, as we are told, to make voting easier or more accurate. The real reason America is being flooded with billions of dollars worth of paperless **computerized voting machines** is so that no one will be able to prove vote fraud. These machines are not just unverifiable, they **are secretly programmed. Their software is not open to scrutiny by election officials or computer experts. They are also equipped with modems accessible by computer, telephone, and satellite**. We the People are responsible for taking back the control of our democratic process. No one else will do it for us. We cannot afford to be naive, or uneducated at this time in history. In order to fully understand the extent of the corruption we are dealing with, and to avoid making dangerous mistakes based on ignorance, we must understand the history, and the power structure, behind vote fraud in America.

[First [six chapters](https://web.archive.org/web/20170803101125/http://www.votescam.org:80/votescam_chapters) available free online] The Votescam investigation began in 1970, in -- surprise! -- Dade County, Florida, where Ken ran for Congress (with Jim as his campaign manager). Ken was rigged out of the election through a vote scam, which the Colliers later discovered was used throughout the country for decades. It went like this: The local newscaster would announce during the broadcast of election returns that the election \"computer has broken down.\" Instead of giving official returns from the county courthouse, the networks would be running vote \"projections\" for the rest of the night. Jim and Ken, who had garnered 30 percent of the vote, noticed that when the vote totals came back on the screen after the announcement, they had mysteriously lost 15 percentage points. They didn't get another vote for the rest of the night. When they examined the \"official\" election results from for the September primary, October run-off and November final election in Dade County, the record listed a total of 141,000 votes cast for the governors race in each election. **The exact same number of total votes were cast for three elections with a different number of candidates running each time.** The same identical figures were listed for the Senate race in the primary, run-off and final election. This, of course, is a statistical impossibility. When they compared the \"official\" vote results with a print-out of the vote \"projections\" broadcast by the TV networks on the final election night, they found that **channel 4 had \"projected\" with near perfect accuracy the results of 40 races with 250 candidates only 4 minutes after the polls closed**. **Channel 7 came even closer; at 9:31 pm, they \"projected\" the final vote total for a race at 96,499 votes. When the Colliers checked the \"official\" number . . . it was also 96,499.** The networks then made the astonishing claim that the results from a single voting machine somewhere in Dade County were run through a computer program in order to get these vote projections. Elton Davis was the computer programmer responsible for the magic formula that could convert one machine's vote results into near perfect projected vote totals for 40 races and 250 candidates. When Jim and Ken confronted Davis in his office at the University of Miami, he responded: \"You'll never prove it, now get out.\" Finally the networks claimed that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:electronicvoting.txt:3:2837993339c4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9425, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "electronicvoting.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "electronicvoting", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "from a single voting machine somewhere in Dade County were run through a computer program in order to get these vote projections.

When Jim and Ken confronted Davis in his office at the University of Miami, he responded: \"You'll never prove it, now get out.\" Finally the networks claimed that members of the League of Women Voters were out in the field on election night, calling in vote totals to channels 4 and 7. When the Colliers confronted the head of the League, Joyce Deiffenderfer, she admitted that there were no LWV members out in the field that night. She broke down crying, saying \"I don't want to get caught up in this thing.\" When the TV networks claimed that the courthouse computer had broken down, and they would no longer be reporting actual vote totals, they were lying. They had never been reporting actual vote totals. The final shoe dropped months later when an official press release appeared from Dade data processing chief, Leonard White, which stated emphatically: **The county computer at the courthouse was never down, and it was never slow.** This was the beginning. The Collier brothers had slammed their boat into the tip of a giant iceberg. As they continued to investigate, they were horrified to discover vote fraud collusion among key individuals in every branch and on every level of the American political system. Those who were not benefiting from the fraud were too afraid to fight it. Their search for justice led to dead-ends. Their lives were threatened. They were vilified as conspiracy theorists by the mainstream press . . . and yet they persevered. **The next quarter century was spent compiling a wealth of** **FBI documented evidence** **proving that elections in the United States have come under the tight control of a handful of powerful and corrupt people.** Jim and Ken both died young during the 90's, as heroes to many thousands who heard them speak on the radio and at political meetings across the country. They helped to guide individuals and groups working for clean elections in their communities. The Collier's last hope was that *Votescam* would be used as evidence in a serious Congressional investigation into election fraud. Many people still in power have yet to be held accountable for their role in aiding and abetting vote fraud. I'll give you two important examples. Famous Miami lawyer Ellis Rubin brought the original Votescam evidence to the **Florida assistant State Attorney at the time, Janet Reno**. The evidence included the shaved wheels of lever voting machines, forged canvass sheets, and pre-printed vote tally sheets. **Reno refused to prosecute, claiming falsely that the statue of limitations had run out on the crime.** Years", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:electronicvoting.txt:4:af8d74c7baac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9426, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "electronicvoting.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "electronicvoting", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "in power have yet to be held accountable for their role in aiding and abetting vote fraud.

Why? Because she would bring down many of the most powerful people in the state. Another notable Votescam criminal can now be found sitting on the bench of the highest court in the nation. **Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, while still a Federal Appeals Judge, single handedly destroyed what would have been an historic lawsuit** filed against Justice Department lawyer Craig Donsanto, who had refused to prosecute the extensive vote fraud evidence brought to him by the Colliers. The evidence included videotape of the League of Women voters tampering with ballots in a close door vote \"counting\" session. The women were illegally punching holes in already cast ballots. I'd like to offer a brief list of important lessons learned from twenty-five years of fighting vote fraud in the trenches. **Secret vote counting is illegal.** Counting faster is not a justification for counting secretly. Lever machines were the first to appear, and they were riggable in a number of ways. One could rig the lever machine itself, or the electronic scanning machines that counted the ballots. Computerized voting machines are the easiest to rig. Their software is not open to public scrutiny, or the scrutiny of Election Supervisors. **There are nearly infinite ways to program the machines to count votes fraudulently.** Since they are accessible by modem, they can be controlled from a remote, centralized location. **Voting machine companies operate with no federal oversight**, certification process, standards or restrictions. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have been complicit in vote rigging for decades, to their mutual benefit. **Vote rigging is NOT a partisan issue.** The corporate major media networks play a vital role in perpetrating and covering up vote fraud. Election Day media polls are untrustworthy at best. The gravest error of judgment these days comes from those vote reformers who honestly believe that the answer to the butterfly ballot and hanging chad problems in the 2000 election is to embrace the ballot-less computerized voting machine. With the ballot-less computer, there is no way to recount, no way to prove any discrepancy, inaccuracy or fraud. **Just the fact that companies like ES&S and Diebold would even make a ballot-less machine should be cause for a Congressional investigation**. A most grave error of judgment also comes from those who think that returning to a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:electronicvoting.txt:5:1783aecd4551", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9427, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "electronicvoting.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "electronicvoting", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "that the answer to the butterfly ballot and hanging chad problems in the 2000 election is to embrace the ballot-less computerized voting machine.

A most grave error of judgment also comes from those who think that returning to a hand-counted paper ballot system is somehow impossible. **An MIT/Cal Tech study done in 2001 shows that manually counted paper ballots are the most accurate system out of the 5 systems used in the last 4 presidential elections. **They are totally verifiable, and first-world nations across the globe still use them, including Canada which counted their last presidential election in four hours. **The bottom line is that a computerized vote count is a secret vote count, and that's illegal.** Technology cannot supercede the constitutional and mandatory provisions of election law, which require open and verifiable elections. There is no way to do a public vote count with computers. The count must be done by hand, in public, video-taped, aired live on television, and the results posted on the precinct wall -- just like they used to be. Ballots should be counted on the same day as the voting takes place, making it much more difficult to alter ballots. Hand counted paper ballots and eternal vigilance are the only hope left for us. *About the author: A long time writer and political activist, Victoria Collier continues to educate the public on the subject of vote fraud in place of her father and uncle. * **Final Note** For reliable, verifiable information on other major cover-ups which directly affect our democracy, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/).

The Central Intelligence Agency is the best place to work in the United States. No federal agency has a smarter, more dedicated or harder-working set of individuals than the CIA's women and men. I had intended to work at the CIA for the duration of my career, and I left it with deep regret and a great sense of personal loss. I was neither forced out nor pressed to resign. Resigning was my decision alone. I cannot state these facts more clearly, and I fiercely deny the accusations that I am a disgruntled former employee. I am, however, a disgruntled American - one who decided that being a good citizen was no longer compatible with being a good member of the CIA's Senior Intelligence Service. I do not profess a broad expertise in international affairs, but **between January 1996 and June 1999 I was in charge of running operations against Al Qaeda from Washington. When it comes to this small slice of the large U.S. national security pie, I speak with firsthand experience (and for several score of CIA officers) when I state categorically that during this time senior White House officials repeatedly refused to act on sound intelligence that provided multiple chances to eliminate Osama bin Laden - either by capture or by U.S. military attack.

When it comes to this small slice of the large U.S. national security pie, I speak with firsthand experience (and for several score of CIA officers) when I state categorically that during this time senior White House officials repeatedly refused to act on sound intelligence that provided multiple chances to eliminate Osama bin Laden - either by capture or by U.S. military attack. I witnessed and documented, along with dozens of other CIA officers, instances where life-risking intelligence-gathering work of the agency's men and women in the field was wasted.** Because of classification issues, I argued this point only obliquely in my book \"Imperial Hubris,\" but it is a fact - and fortunately, no American has to depend on my word alone. The 9/11 commission report documents most of the occasions on which senior U.S. bureaucrats and policymakers had the chance to attack Bin Laden in 1998-1999. It is mystifying that the American public has not been outraged over these missed opportunities. In the most memorable and cloying moment of the 9/11 commission's public hearings, former White House terrorism advisor Richard Clarke apologized to the American people for the failure of the U.S. intelligence community to protect them. This statement has become, like the 9/11 report, American scripture - carved in stone, literally true and unquestionable. Clearly, Clarke had the duty to apologize for the government's ineffectiveness as regards terrorism, but I reject his intimation that the clandestine service failed the nation. Now, I must add that I was never charged with deciding whether to act against Bin Laden. That decision properly belongs solely to senior White House officials. **However, as a now-private American citizen, it is my right to question their judgment; I am entitled to know why the protection of Americans - most selfishly, my own children and grandchildren - was not the top priority of the senior officials who refused to act on the opportunities to attack Bin Laden provided by the clandestine service.** **Each of these officials have publicly argued that the intelligence was not \"good enough\" to act, but they almost always neglect to say that they were repeatedly advised that the intelligence was not going to get better and that Bin Laden was going to kill thousands of Americans if he was not stopped.** At each opportunity provided by the clandestine service, senior bureaucrats and policymakers decided not to act. The 9/11 report documents the fact that the chances to capture or attack Bin Laden were passed by because there were worries that shrapnel might hit a mosque and offend Muslim opinion; that a United Arab Emirates prince meeting Bin Laden clandestinely in the Afghan desert might be killed; and that the CIA might be accused of assassination if Bin Laden was killed in an effort to capture him. Of course, it is not", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:eliminatebinladen.txt:1:a79049b2ced7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9431, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "eliminatebinladen.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "eliminatebinladen", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "and policymakers decided not to act.

Of course, it is not my opinion but that of the American people that counts. Perhaps a starting point is for Americans to ask why no member of Congress' Graham-Goss investigation or the Kean-Hamilton commissioners ever directly asked Clarke, former national security advisor Samuel R. \"Sandy\" Berger, CIA Director George J. Tenet, former FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, former Secretary of State William S. Cohen or any of the rest of the witnesses why they never erred on the side of protecting Americans; why international opinion was ultimately more important than the Americans who leaped from the World Trade Center; and why the intelligence was \"good enough\" to save the life of an Arab prince dining with bin Laden, but not \"good enough\" to cause the government to act on behalf of Americans. At day's end, it may be worth pausing the intelligence reform process long enough to determine what role personal failure, bureaucratic warfare - which the Department of Defense continues waging today - and a lack of moral courage played in getting the United States to 9/11. Lacking this accounting, the debate over intelligence reform will, I believe, simply lock into place a bureaucratic mind-set that believes intelligence is never \"good enough\" to take a risk to protect the lives of Americans. **See our archive of revealing news articles at ****[**https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles)** Your tax-deductible donations, however large or small, help greatly to support this important work.

Yet the corporations and utilities promoting them are going all out to keep you in the dark around the danger of these meters. The excellent, award-winning documentary, \"Take Back Your Power,\" (available free at link below) reveals how we are all being subtly and not so subtly manipulated into compliance. The film starts off with two riveting segments. First up is captivating footage of a county commission meeting where commissioners pose hard questions to a PUC (public utility commission) representative on whether the utility had looked into the health risks and dangers of smart meters. The utility representative tries to avoid answering every time, yet thanks to hard-hitting questions by several commissioners,** it is all too clear that either the PUC had not done any safety assessment, or even worse, did the studies and was concealing the incriminating results.** After this eye-opening scene, the documentary shifts to startling video clips of two cases where individuals had their homes broken into by workers ordered to put in smart meters, even though the customers didn't want them. One guy actually caught the utility worker breaking in his door on film using his cell phone video. Numerous cases are also presented of individuals who became ill very likely as a result of the electromagnetic radiation put out by these meters. Great ideas are given at the conclusion of this compelling film on what we, as citizens, can do to expose what is going on and stop the forced implementation of this dangerous technology.

By taking advantage of the powerful tools of email and the Internet, we are creating a better world. **The Energy Crisis - Little Known Facts Make a Big Difference** In traditional physics, we are taught that according to the first law of thermodynamics, energy can be neither created nor destroyed. In the highly sophisticated world of quantum physics, however, we find that **many of the traditional laws of physics no longer apply**. For instance, scientists have discovered that there is no such thing as a pure vacuum. Within what was thought to be a pure vacuum, they have found that miniscule subatomic particle-antiparticle pairs frequently appear out of nowhere, only to disappear a very short time later. **Even in the near-perfect vacuum of outer space, energy is spontaneously being created and destroyed all the time.** [Zero-point energy](http://www.calphysics.org/zpe.html) is the energy that exists in or arises out of zero, out of nothingness, out of the vacuum. The topic of zero point energy is being intensely studied and debated by a number of physicists and other scientists (go to your favorite search engine and type in \"zero point energy\"). **Some top scientists theorize that there is infinite potential for cheap, usable energy within the zero-point field.** In fact, a number of respected scientists claim it is possible to tap this field and to develop devices which output more energy than is input. This process is called over-unity (another good one for your search engine).

This process is called over-unity (another good one for your search engine). Many conservative scientists claim this is impossible, while others state that they have already developed devices which successfully demonstrate this principle. **They claim to have invented devices that produce more energy than is required to run them!** How can this be? You might think that such inventions would be hailed and trumpeted loudly on the front page of all newspapers. The problem is that if these inventions were released to the public, those in power would suddenly have much less control over energy and our oil-based economy. **The power elites of the world realize that a cheap or free energy source in the hands of the general public could change the power dynamics of the entire world.** **This is exactly why we find that there is a major cover-up around these devices.** Personal inventor friends of ours who have such inventions have experienced some of the consequences of this cover-up. These include intimidation, bribery, the preventing of the issuance of patents based on national security grounds, debunking by \"experts,\" buying and shelving of technology, arrest, theft of property, and even murder of inventors.

In this eye-opening book, 20 award-winning journalists describe in detail how they were prevented by corporate media ownership from reporting major, revealing news stories. These courageous journalists have won numerous awards, including several Emmys and a Pulitzer. **This message is sent with the hope of strengthening democracy and building a brighter future for all of us.** **Kristina Borjesson-CBS, Emmy award winner**. Pierre Salinger announced on Nov. 8, 1996, that he'd received documents proving that a US Navy missile had accidentally downed TWA flight 800. That same day, FBI's Jim Kallstrom called a press conference. At one point, a man raised his hand and asked why the Navy was involved in the investigation while a possible suspect. \"Remove him!\" Kallstrom yelled. Two men leapt over to the questioner and grabbed him by the arms. There was a momentary chill in the air after the guy had been dragged out of the room. Kallstrom and entourage acted as if nothing had happened. Jim Kallstrom was later hired by CBS.

His reply: \"We paid $3 billion dollars for these TV stations. We'll tell *you* what the news is. The news is what *we *say it is!\" After we refused, Fox's general manager presented an agreement that would give us a full year of salary, and benefits worth close to $200,000 in \"consulting jobs,\" but with strings attached: no mention of how Fox covered up the story and no opportunity to ever expose the facts. After declining, we were fired. (pp. 213 - 219) **Monika Jensen-Stevenson-Emmy-winning producer for *60 minutes***. Robert Garwood-14 years a prisoner of the Vietnamese-was found guilty in the longest court-martial in US history. At the end of the court-martial, there seemed no question that he was a monstrous traitor. In 1985, Garwood was speaking publicly about something that had never made the news during his court-martial. He knew of other American prisoners in Vietnam long after the war was over. My sources included outstanding experts like former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency General Tighe and returned POWs like Captain McDaniel, who held the Navy's top award for bravery. With such advocates, it was hard not to consider the possibility that prisoners (some 3,500) had in fact been kept by the Vietnamese as hostages to make sure the US would pay the more than $3 billion in war reparations. (pp. 255, 256) **Gary Webb-*San Jose Mercury News*, Pulitzer Prize winner. **In 1996, I wrote a series of stories that began this way: A Bay Area drug ring sold tons of cocaine to the Crips and Bloods gangs of LA and funneled millions in drug profits to a guerilla army run by the CIA. The cocaine that flooded in helped spark a crack explosion in urban America. The story developed a momentum all of its own, despite a virtual news blackout from the major media. Ultimately, it was public pressure that forced the national newspapers into the fray. The *Washington Post*, *New York Times*, and *Los Angeles Times* published stories, but spent little time exploring the CIA's activities.

Below is a sample of just two of these documents and one scientific article taken from the excellent mind control summary on the informative website [www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info/). By spreading this revealing information, we now have the opportunity to powerfully work together for a brighter future. A declassified CIA document dated 7 Jan 1953 describes the experimental creation of multiple personality in two 19-year old girls: \"These subjects have clearly demonstrated that they can pass from a fully awake state to a deep hypnotic state by telephone, by receiving written matter, or by the use of code, signal, or words, and that control of those hypnotized can be passed from one individual to another without great difficulty. **It has also been shown by experimentation with these girls that they can act as unwilling couriers for information purposes**.\" ([CIA Mori ID 190684](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol10pg#_edn1), 1/7/53) Another document dated 10 Feb 1954 describes an experiment on the creation of unsuspecting assassins: \"Miss [deleted] was instructed (having previously expressed a fear of firearms) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken miss [deleted] (now in a deep hypnotic sleep).

Miss [deleted] expressed absolute denial that the foregoing sequence had happened.\" ([CIA Mori ID 190691](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol10pg#_edn8), 2/10/54) In a 1971 *Science Digest *article, Dr. G.H. Estabrooks states, \"By the 1920's clinical hypnotists learned to split certain individuals into multiple personalities like Jeckyl-Hydes. During WWII, I worked this technique with a Marine lieutenant I'll call Jones. I split his personality into Jones A and Jones B. Jones A, once a 'normal' working Marine, became entirely different. He talked communist doctrine and meant it. He was welcomed enthusiastically by communist cells, and was deliberately given a dishonorable discharge. Jones B was the deeper personality, knew all the thoughts of Jones A, and was 'imprinted' to say nothing during conscious phases. **All I had to do was hypnotize him, get in touch with Jones B, and I had a pipeline straight into the Communist camp.\"** (*Science Digest, April 1971, pp. 44-50)* These are just three of the many disturbing experiments which reveal severe abuse of power on unsuspecting citizens for over 50 years now.

Just 50 years ago computers were huge, multi-million dollar monsters capable of only rudimentary mathematical problems. Today, the portable laptop on which I'm typing can perform functions literally millions of times faster and more complex than its ancestors, and connect me instantly to anyone in the world with Internet access. In engineering and materials science, we have gone from basic woods and metals to sophisticated plastics, fiber optics, nanotechnology, and other high-tech manmade materials and technologies that perform all kinds of functions which would have been considered miraculous 100 years ago. Television, movies, microwave ovens, air conditioning, radar, and gameboys didn't even exist then. In astronomy, biology, medicine, agriculture, genetics, electronics, and most any other field you can think of, we are not only generations, but light years ahead in both knowledge and applications of what was available 100, and sometimes even 50 years ago. **Now consider the areas of energy and transportation, and the oil and automobile industries in particular.** **Technological progress in these sectors has moved at a snail's pace compared to the fields mentioned above.** Most cars and trucks still use the same internal combustion engine on which the Model T depended 100 years ago. And while the [Model T](https://www.WantToKnow.info/030604fordmodelt25mpg) boasted gas mileage of 25 MPG in 1908, average fuel economy for 2013 according to the EPA was only 24.7 MPG.\" And when it comes to energy, most of the world still depends largely on huge, polluting coal and oil generation plants not much more efficient than those of 100 years ago. **How can it be that we've had such dramatic, almost miraculous advances in so many fields, while the energy and transportation sectors have made so little progress? **Could it be that greed and the desire for economic and political control by the [power elite of the world](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) have kept the profit-rich energy and transportation sectors from developing as rapidly as they might have in a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__050711carmileageaveragempg.txt:0:e4e6e4d8e2a9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9443, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__050711carmileageaveragempg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__050711carmileageaveragempg", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "coal and oil generation plants not much more efficient than those of 100 years ago. **How can it be that we've had such dramatic, almost miraculous advances in so many fields, while the energy and transportation sectors have made so little progress? **Could it be that greed and the desire for economic and political control by the [power elite of the world](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) have kept the profit-rich energy and transportation sectors from developing as rapidly as they might have in a more open climate, where big money and political clout did not suppress technological breakthroughs? Genius inventors for the past 100 years have made remarkable discoveries of new, more efficient energy sources, only to find their inventions either suppressed or not given the attention and funding needed to break us free of our dependence on archaic coal and oil-based technologies. Consider [Nikola Tesla](http://www.pbs.org/tesla/index.html), the genius inventor of AC current, fluorescent light, and laser beams, who has over 700 patents to his name. Tesla proved in 1900 that the Earth itself could be used as a very cheap conductor of electricity. He successfully [lighted 200 lamps](http://www.teslasociety.com/biography.htm) without wires from a distance of 25 miles. Why wasn't Tesla's wireless electricity developed and spread around the world? His main financial supporter, banking tycoon J.P.

So far, the company has committed to building just 2,600. Critics, including some people who love the Rav4 EV, say Toyota made it only to comply with California regulations that force automakers to sell zero-pollution cars. **\"Everyone agrees it's a wonderful car,\" said Felix Kramer, founder of [CalCars](http://www.calcars.org/), a plug-in vehicle advocacy group. \"Too bad there's not enough.\" That suspicion comes from experience. Toyota made an electric version of the Rav4 once before, building 1,484 of the small SUVs between 1997 and 2003. Then the company killed the program, after California changed its zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) rules. The new Rav4 EV ... boasts ferocious acceleration, plenty of power and a low center of gravity thanks to the big battery pack hidden in the floor. It's not a luxury car, but the interior is comfortable and plush, tricked out with a touch-screen and heated seats. Those so inclined can take the Rav4 EV from a standstill to 60 mph in 7 seconds. The car gets a solid 125 miles on a fully charged battery pack, and an easy-to-read number on the dash constantly reminds you how many miles you have left. **Note:** Once again a major car manufacturer produces a great electric vehicle only to suppress it. Remember \"[Who Killed the Electric Car](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-who-killed-electric-car)\", the movie on GM's EV1 which was killed despite major consumer interest?

The ES3 - the initials stand for Eco Spirit - achieves 104mpg in the official European fuel consumption tests, a record for a four-seat car. Some months ago I drove this prototype and not only is it even more economical than the special \"3 litre\" (three litres of fuel for every 100km travelled, or 94mpg) versions of the Audi A2 and VW Lupo that sell in Germany, but the Toyota is more lively and responsive and would be very acceptable as an everyday car. **Note:** The Toyota Eco Spirit was the talk of the fuel economy car industry in 2002, when this article was published. **At over 100 MPG and with the lowest exhaust emissions and a very reasonable sticker price, the Eco Spirit's debut was widely anticipated.

One tank of gas, literally, lasts him two months. He is freezing the price of gas by freezing something else. David Hutchison is a Cryogenics expert. He built this Cryo-Process himself. A few years ago he began an experiment on his hybrid Honda, freezing the engine components. The results were a fuel-efficiency dream. **A hybrid Honda typically gets really great gas mileage anyway, around 50 miles to the gallon, but David Hutchison's cryogenically tempered engine has been known to get close to 120 miles a gallon.** Racers have picked up on David's trick of cryogenically freezing car parts.

But for some students, this summer was the culmination of years of hard work in a 2,400-mile solar car race from Plano, Texas to Calgary, Alberta. Fifteen teams of students drove photovoltaic-powered cars across the North American Solar Challenge finish line in Calgary Tuesday, led by the University of Michigan Solar Car Team and its vehicle, Continuum. **Michigan's victory, which took about 51 hours and 42 minutes on the road, is its fifth NASC championship.** The school also won the last NASC, in 2005. Jeff Ferman, the race manager for Michigan, talked about how rewarding it was to enter Calgary and be greeted by 40,000 people.\"The streets were lined with people,\" he said. \"There were people on overpasses with tripods taking pictures.\" The Michigan team led almost the entire race from Texas, trailing only on the first day of driving when it had to stop to fix a minor electrical problem. But that 20-minute stop was the only time it had to pull over to make repairs, which team members said was one reason they did so well. **Note:** If you do the math, this amazing solar powered car built by college students averaged 46.5 mph over a 2,400 mile course!

The traders and plant operator laugh and plot in a display that seems to prove the theory that years before the energy crisis, Enron manipulated markets. \"They had to do a rolling blackout through the town and there was a red light there he didn't see,\" one Enron trader says on tape. \"That's beautiful,\" a second voice responds. **Enron secretly shut power plants down so they could cause, and then cash in on, the crisis. Enron also pulled power out of states like California, causing emergency conditions to worsen. \"Sorry California,\" an Enron trader says. \"I'm bringing all our power out of state today.\"** Plant operators were coached on how to lie to officials. \"We want you guys to get a little creative...\" one voice says on the tape, \"and come up with a reason to go down.\" The \"shut downs\" and \"pull outs\" triggered sky high power prices. \"We're just making money hand over fist!\" one voice is heard saying on the tape.

Skeptics say Kanzius's radio generator is sucking up far more energy than it's creating, making it a carnival trick at best. For now, Kanzius is tuning out the hubbub. Diagnosed with leukemia in 2002, he began building his radio-wave blaster the next year, soon after a relapse. If he could seed a person's cancerous cells with nanoscopic metal particles and blast them with radio waves, perhaps he could kill off the cancer while sparing healthy tissue. **The saltwater phenomenon happened by accident when an assistant was bombarding a saline-filled test tube with radio waves and bumped the tube, causing a small flash. Curious, Kanzius struck a match. \"The water lit like a propane flame,\"** he recalls. \"People said, 'It's a crock. Look for hidden electrodes in the water,' \" says Penn State University materials scientist Rustum Roy, who visited [Kanzius] in his lab in August after seeing the feat on Google Video. A demo made Roy a believer. \"This is discovery science in the best tradition,\" he says. Meanwhile, researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center have made progress using Kanzius's technology to fight cancer in animals.

Yet they never recanted their belief in their work. A recent segment on CBS's *60 Minutes* now may be providing vindication. You can watch and/or read the text of this fascinating 12-minute segment below, which mentions that even the Pentagon has now stated that the cold fusion phenomenon is real. **Yet even back in 1989, dozens of scientists were getting positive results in attempting to duplicate the cold fusion experiments. The work of these scientists was suppressed.** Most of them were mocked and ridiculed, with some even having to leave their work as a result. [Hundreds more later joined](https://web.archive.org/web/20110210171328/http://www.peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:Cold_Fusion) the little-known cold fusion movement, only to find that they, too, were scoffed at by their colleagues. Even though their carefully conducted experiments showed striking anomalies and excess heat as a result of apparent fusion happening near room temperature, these scientists had great difficulty finding any funding for further verification. Dr. Eugene Mallove was the Chief Science Writer at MIT when the cold fusion news broke in 1989. [The story](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#mallove) of his personal involvement is quite revealing. \"One day while at MIT, I inadvertently was looking through some piles of paper by physicists doing their repeat of the [cold fusion] experiment. To my utter astonishment, I can remember sitting at my desk and seeing two sheets of paper. **The July 10 control experiment showed in the raw data excess heat. But then, on July 13, it was shifted completely. It was altered. Clear fraud-no question.** I asked for a review at MIT. I got nowhere. Yet today, MIT data is held up.\" Here's a quote from a [Nov. 16, 2004 article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54964-2004Nov16.html) in the *Washington Post* on another convert to cold fusion: \"Brilliant,\" \"genius\" and \"reclusive\" were words used to describe [SRI scientist Peter] Hagelstein. 20 years ago ... he made his mark designing the X-ray laser that was to be the centerpiece of Reagan's \"Star Wars\" anti-ballistic missile system.

As Hagelstein explains it, leading physicists came out swiftly and prematurely against cold fusion. He has seen enough cold fusion data to convince him that the science is clearly real. [After exploring cold fusion], Hagelstein faced a series of personal reverses. He has tenure at MIT, but he never made full professor. When his funding ran out, he eventually lost his lab space, his secretary, even his office. There is much more to the cold fusion debate than most people know. The media has only rarely focused on the many successes in the field.

But then, just as quickly as it was announced, it was discredited. So thoroughly, that cold fusion became a catch phrase for junk science. Well, a funny thing happened on the way to oblivion - for many scientists today, cold fusion is hot again. \"We can yield the power of nuclear physics on a tabletop. The potential is unlimited. That is the most powerful energy source known to man,\" researcher Michael McKubre told 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley. **McKubre says he has seen that energy more than 50 times in cold fusion experiments he's doing at SRI International, a respected California lab that does extensive work for the government. ** McKubre is an electro-chemist who imagines, in 20 years, the creation of a clean nuclear battery. \"For example, a laptop would come pre-charged with all of the energy that you would ever intend to use. You're now decoupled from your charger and the wall socket,\" he explained. The same would go for cars. \"The potential is for an energy source that would run your car for three, four years, for example. And you'd take it in for service every four years and they'd give you a new power supply,\" McKubre told Pelley. \"Power stations?\" Pelley asked. \"You can imagine a one for one plug in replacement for nuclear fuel rods. And the difference only would be that at the end of the lifetime of that fuel rod, you didn't have radioactive waste that needed to be disposed of,\" McKubre replied. He showed 60 Minutes just how simple the experiment looks; there are only three main ingredients. First, there is palladium, a metal in the platinum family. Second, one needs a kind of hydrogen called deuterium which is found in seawater. **\"Deuterium is essentially unlimited. There is ten times as much energy in a gallon of sea water, from the deuterium contained within it, than there is in a gallon of gasoline,\" he explained.** The palladium is placed in water containing deuterium and the third ingredient is an electric current. The experiment is wrapped in insulation and instruments. They're looking for what they call \"excess heat.\" In other words, is more energy coming out than the electric current puts in? No one knows exactly how excess heat would be generated, but McKubre showed 60 Minutes what he thinks is happening. At the atomic level, palladium looks like a lattice and the electricity drives the deuterium to the palladium. \"They sit on the surface and they pop inside the lattice,\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__cold_fusion_reactor.txt:2:661eff6b6fd0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9454, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__cold_fusion_reactor.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__cold_fusion_reactor", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "current.

At the atomic level, palladium looks like a lattice and the electricity drives the deuterium to the palladium. \"They sit on the surface and they pop inside the lattice,\" he explained, using an artist's rendition of the lattice. McKubre believes there is a nuclear reaction - possibly a fusion process like what happens in the sun, but occurring inside the metal, at a slower rate, and without dangerous radiation. Scientists today like to call it a nuclear effect rather than cold fusion. **At least 20 labs working independently have published reports of excess heat - heat up to 25 times greater than the electricity going in. ** \"This little piece of palladium metal has about a third as much energy as the battery in your automobile. So very small volumes, very small masses can produce large amounts of energy,\" he explained, holding a small piece of palladium foil weighing just 0.3 grams. **McKubre has been working on this since that first discredited claim of cold fusion made headlines 20 years ago. \"To work on this issue is almost to put your scientific credibility at risk and I wonder why you've done it?\" Pelley asked. \"My belief is that if there's a one percent chance that Fleischmann and Pons were correct, and I now believe that possibility is 99 percent. I have a duty to work on it,\" he replied. ** Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons amazed the world in 1989 with their cold fusion news conference at the University of Utah. Fleischmann in particular was one of the world's leading electro-chemists, and the announcement of room temperature fusion set the world on fire. Immediately, prestigious labs at MIT and Caltech rushed to reproduce the experiment, but didn't get the same results as Fleischmann and Pons. [Note: Dr. Eugene Mallove worked at MIT at the time. He was stunned to see with his own eyes that the original figures in the MIT experiments showed clear excess heat when they came across his desk as science editor there, yet days later they were changed - a clear fabrication to debunk cold fusion. [Read his statement here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#mallove).] The careers of Fleischmann and Pons were destroyed as quickly as a nuclear flash - names once linked to a Nobel Prize were forgotten by nearly everyone. And most of the scientific world today is happy to leave it that way. \"I'm still waiting for the water heaters. I'm still waiting for the thing that will produce heat on demand,\" Richard Garwin, one of the most respected physicists in the world, told Pelley.

And most of the scientific world today is happy to leave it that way. \"I'm still waiting for the water heaters. I'm still waiting for the thing that will produce heat on demand,\" Richard Garwin, one of the most respected physicists in the world, told Pelley. In the 1950s, he helped design the most successful fusion experiment of all time: the hydrogen bomb. \"It was unfortunately, a very successful experiment,\" Garwin told Pelley. Garwin was a critic of Martin Fleischmann back in 1989. And he has seen reports on the research that's been done since. He thinks McKubre is mistaken. Asked why, Garwin said, \"I think probably he measures the input power wrong.\" It's one of the most common criticisms of cold fusion experiments - that the amount of electricity going in and the heat coming out are simply mismeasured. \"It's possible, it is possible, that I have been mismeasuring energy for 20 years, but I think it extremely unlikely. A very large number of people have been making these measurements and measurements of current, voltage, temperature, resistance they're some of the simplest measurements that a physicist or a physical scientist will measure,\" McKubre said. But there's another problem that critics point out:** the experiments produce excess heat at best 70 percent of the time; it can take days or weeks for the excess heat to show up. And it's never the same amount of energy twice.** \"I require that you be able to make one of these things, replicate it, put it here. It heats up the cup of tea. I'll drink the tea. Then you make me another cup of tea. And I'll drink that too. That's not it,\" Garwin said. He told Pelley that for him to become a believer, the process would have to work 100 percent of the time. But McKubre said, \"Our critics often complain that we can't boil water to make tea. We could have, in fact, boiled 64 gallons of water and made 1,000 cups of tea, had we chosen to do so.\" No one's sure why the experiments can't be consistently reproduced. McKubre thinks it has something to do with how the palladium is prepared. He's working with an Italian government lab called ENEA where some of the most reliable palladium is made. **With so many open questions, 60 Minutes wanted to find out whether cold fusion is more than a tempest in a teapot.

We asked Duncan to go with 60 Minutes to Israel, where a lab called Energetics Technologies has reported some of the biggest energy gains yet. Duncan spent two days examining cold fusion experiments and investigating whether the measurements were accurate. Asked what he thought when he left the Israeli lab, Duncan told Pelley, \"I thought, 'Wow. They've done something very interesting here.'\" He crunched the numbers himself and searched for an explanation other than a nuclear effect. **\"I found that the work done was carefully done, and that the excess heat, as I see it now, is quite real,\" Duncan said.** Asked if was surprised that he'd hear himself saying that, Duncan told Pelley, \"Very much. I never thought I'd say that.\" **And we've found that the Pentagon is saying it too. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA, did its own analysis and 60 Minutes obtained an internal memo that concludes there is \"no doubt that anomalous excess heat is produced in these experiments.\"** Asked if he feels vindicated after all these years, McKubre told Pelley with a smile, \"I don't have any real need for vindication. I know what I've seen.\" \"That was a pretty big smile on your face though,\" Pelley pointed out. \"It's good. It's not bad. Certainly it's good,\" McKubre replied. **Now the Pentagon is funding more experiments at the naval research lab in Washington, D.C. and at McKubre's lab in California.** 60 Minutes wondered what Richard Garwin would think of the Defense Department's appraisal. \"The experiments leave 'no doubt that anomalous, excess heat is produced,'\" Pelley told Garwin. \"Well, that's a statement,\" Garwin said. \"I am living proof that there's doubt. Now, they can say that there, that excess heat is being produced. But they can't say there's no doubt. All they can say is they don't doubt. But I doubt.\" \"If you ask me, is this going to have any impact on our energy policy, it's impossible to say, because we don't fundamentally understand the process yet.

But to say, because we don't fundamentally understand the process and that's why we're not going to study it, is like saying, 'I'm too sick to go to the doctor,'\" Duncan argued. \"You know, I wonder how you feel about going public endorsing this phenomenon on 60 Minutes when maybe 90 percent, I'm guessing, of your colleagues think that it's crackpot science?\" Pelley asked. \"I certainly was among those 90 percent before I looked at the data. And I can see where they'll be very concerned when they see this piece. All I have to say is: read the published results. Talk to the scientists. Never let anyone do your thinking for you,\" he replied. There was one more scientist 60 Minutes wanted to find, a man who left America in disgrace and retired with his wife to the English countryside. Martin Fleischmann, the man who announced cold fusion to the world, is hindered by years, diabetes, Parkinson's disease and maybe a little bitterness. At home, he pulled out an improved version of his experiment, something that he was working on when he was hounded out of science. \"When you hold that in your hand and you think back on what's happened these last 20 years, what do you think?\" Pelley asked. \"A wasted opportunity,\" Fleischman replied. He thinks this way because it was discredited at the time. He told Pelley he has two regrets: calling the nuclear effect \"fusion,\" a name coined by a competitor, and having that news conference, something he says the University of Utah wanted. \"Now that you know that your experiments have been replicated and, and improved upon in labs all over the world I wonder, do you see a day when homes will be powered by these cells, when cars will be powered by these cells?\" Pelley asked. \"I think so. It wouldn't take very long to implement this,\" Fleischman replied, laughing. \"You make me feel that I should take a part in this?\" \"I'm getting you interested again?\" Pelley asked. \"Yes,\" Fleischmann replied, laughing. \"The potential is exciting.\" **What you can do: ** Inform your media and political representatives of this important information.

The handsets were heavy, batteries didn't last long, coverage was patchy, and the cost per minute was exorbitant. The experts are saying the same about solar energy now. They say that solar is inefficient, too expensive to install, and unreliable, and will fail without government subsidies. They too are wrong. Solar will be as ubiquitous as cellular phones are. **Futurist Ray Kurzweil notes that solar power has been doubling every two years for the past 30 years - as [costs have been dropping](https://ir.citi.com/0VFn8pAlSfpGN2Wvrl9Xyw0pCPR9RMYnkFXt9PUmplv0ocaKEg9%2f4rbcivOrB9MHJZN%2bPX%2f51Ew%3d). He says solar energy is only six doublings - or less than 14 years - away from meeting 100 percent of today's energy needs. By Kurzweil's estimates, inexpensive renewable sources will provide more energy than the world needs in less than 20 years**. In places such as Germany, Spain, Portugal, Australia, and the Southwest United States, residential-scale solar production has already reached \"[grid parity](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2014/03/25/grid-parity-why-electric-utilities-should-struggle-to-sleep-at-night/)\" with average residential electricity prices. In other words, it costs no more in the long term to install solar panels than to buy electricity from utility companies. The prices of solar panels have fallen 75 percent in the past five years alone and will fall much further as the technologies to create them improve and scale of production increases. By 2020, solar energy will be price-competitive with energy generated from fossil fuels on an unsubsidized basis in most parts of the world. Within the next decade, it will cost a fraction of what fossil fuel-based alternatives do.

That's what BlackLight Power, a 25-employee firm in Cranbury, N.J., says it can do. The only problem: Most scientists say that company's technology violates the basic laws of physics. Such skepticism doesn't daunt Dr. Randell Mills, a Harvard-trained physician and founder of BlackLight, who recently claimed that he has created a working fuel cell using the world's most pervasive element: the hydrogen found in water. Mills says he has a market-ready product: a fuel cell that produces a chemical reaction to alter hydrogen atoms. The fuel cell releases heat that turns water into steam, which drives electric turbines. The working models in his lab generate 50 kilowatts of electricity - enough to power six or seven houses. But these, Mills says, can be scaled [up] to drive a large, electric power plant. **The inventor claims this electricity will cost less than 2 cents per kilowatt-hour, which compares to a national average of 8.9 cents.** Mills developed the patented cocktail that enables the reaction - a solid fuel made of hydrogen and a sodium hydride catalyst - only a year ago. (He recently posted instructions on the company's Web site, [blacklightpower.com](http://www.blacklightpower.com)). Now that the device is ready for commercialization, he says, BlackLight is negotiating with several utilities and architecture and engineering firms. **The business, Mills says, has attracted $60 million in funding from wealthy individuals, investment firms ... and it is no longer seeking money. **BlackLight's board of directors reads like a Who's Who of finance and energy leaders. **Note:** For two *New York Times* articles showing the viability of this amazing technology, [click here](http://www.nytimes.com/external/venturebeat/2008/10/21/21venturebeat-blacklight-power-bolsters-its-impossible-cla-99377.html) and [here](http://www.nytimes.com/external/gigaom/2008/10/21/21gigaom-blacklight-validates-physics-defying-hydrogen-pow-12760.html).

Two types of atoms, typically a light element and a heavier metal, seem to fuse together, releasing pure heat that can be converted into electricity. The process is an attractive energy solution for two reasons: Unlike in nuclear fission, the reaction doesn't give off dangerous radiation. Unlike the fusion processes that take place in the sun, cold fusion doesn't require extremely high temperatures. In April ... Rossi and fellow physicist Sergio Focardi successfully demonstrated the device for a group of Swedish physicists. At the demo in October, after an initial energy input of 400 watts into each module, each one then produced a sustained, continuous output of 10 kilowatts (470 kW altogether) for three to four hours. Peter Hagelstein, an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science and one of the most mainstream proponents of cold fusion research, thinks the process may involve vibrational energy in the metal's lattice driving nuclear transitions that lead to fusion. **Note:** For lots more on this exciting development, [click here](http://www.peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:Andrea_A._Rossi_Cold_Fusion_Generator_%28E-Cat%29).

Cold fusion would end our dependence on the Middle East and stop those greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. It would change everything. But then, just as quickly as it was announced, it was discredited. So thoroughly, that cold fusion became a catch phrase for junk science.

This year, **more than 500 students from North and South America were on hand to stretch the boundaries of fuel efficiency. So who came out on top? The student team from Laval University, with an astonishing 2,757.1 miles per gallon, equivalent to 1,172.2 kilometres per liter, won the grand prize in the \"Prototype\" category.** And in the \"UrbanConcept\" category - new to the Americas event this year - the team from Mater Dei High School took the grand prize by achieving 433.3 mpg, equivalent to 184.2 km/l. With 44 participating teams at track competition was steep. This year's challenge brought together a number of returning teams determined to beat the 2,843 mpg (1,208 km/l) record set by Mater Dei High School (Evansville, Ind.) in 2008, combined with a number of new teams adding fresh innovation and vehicle designs to the competition. \"The Shell Eco-marathon is a platform for students to let their imaginations run wild,\" said Mark Singer, global project manager for the Shell Eco-marathon. \"By encouraging these students to build vehicles with greater energy efficiency, we hope this will help inspire others; and together we can find solutions that will help meet the global energy challenge.\" **Note:** CNBC removed this article for some reason.

Why so little media attention to this most exciting race for top gas mileage? And if high school students can build a car that gets over 2,500 mpg, what's up with Detroit? Could big business be suppressing, or at the very least ignoring these inspiring inventions? **Taming the Gas-Hogging SUV** **2008-06-09, ABC News** [http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/GlobalWarming/story?id=5028894](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/GlobalWarming/story?id=5028894) Johnathan Goodwin walks to the back of his auto conversion shop in Wichita, Kan., and lifts up a gas nozzle connected to a huge cube-shaped container. The orange stuff he's pumping is the key to his company's mission: converting the worst gas-gulping SUVs into cleaner, meaner machines. \"This is 100 percent canola oil, refined to biodiesel,\" Goodwin said. His well-maintained shop is a bit like a showroom for that much-maligned symbol of environmental ruin: the Hummer. The silver H-1 - which Goodwin says gets 60 miles per gallon - has already been modified to run on biodiesel, diesel, vegetable oil, gasoline, ethanol, hydrogen, natural gas and propane. On a standard gasoline-to-biodiesel conversion, Goodwin starts by taking a new nine-mile-per-gallon Hummer and removing the original gas engine. In goes an off-the-shelf GM Duramax engine that runs on diesel fuel. A few extra modifications and a tank full of biodiesel later, the Hummer - now boasting 500 horsepower and getting about 20 miles per gallon - is ready for the road. He offers a couple of lower-cost options, including a fuel vaporizer for $1,000 that he says boosts fuel economy by 30 percent, and a $500 software download that reprograms diesel engines to get up to an additional seven miles per gallon. **His work has many wondering why the big automakers can't simply reconfigure their assembly lines to make their own cars run as efficiently as Goodwin does. \"I don't know why GM hasn't done it,\" says Goodwin. \"But I can tell you that all the parts that I use for the conversion - 95 percent - are all GM parts. I'm not reinventing anything.\"** **Note:** For lots more powerful and inspiring information on this breakthrough technology and kits you can order, [click here](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/120/motorhead-messiah.html). **Researcher sets saltwater on fire** **2007-11-14, CNN** [http://edition.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/11/14/saltwater.fire/](http://edition.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/11/14/saltwater.fire/) Last winter, inventor John Kanzius was already attempting one seemingly impossible feat -- building a machine to cure cancer with radio waves -- when his device inadvertently succeeded in another: He made saltwater catch fire.

[TV footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGg0ATfoBgo) of his bizarre discovery has been burning up the blogosphere ever since, drawing crackpots and Ph.D.s alike into a raging debate. Can water burn? And if so, what good can come of it? Some people gush over the invention's potential for desalinization or cheap energy. Briny seawater, after all, sloshes over most of the planet's surface, and harnessing its heat energy could power all sorts of things. Skeptics say Kanzius's radio generator is sucking up far more energy than it's creating, making it a carnival trick at best. For now, Kanzius is tuning out the hubbub. Diagnosed with leukemia in 2002, he began building his radio-wave blaster the next year, soon after a relapse. If he could seed a person's cancerous cells with nanoscopic metal particles and blast them with radio waves, perhaps he could kill off the cancer while sparing healthy tissue. **The saltwater phenomenon happened by accident when an assistant was bombarding a saline-filled test tube with radio waves and bumped the tube, causing a small flash. Curious, Kanzius struck a match. \"The water lit like a propane flame,\"** he recalls. \"People said, 'It's a crock. Look for hidden electrodes in the water,' \" says Penn State University materials scientist Rustum Roy, who visited [Kanzius] in his lab in August after seeing the feat on Google Video. A demo made Roy a believer. \"This is discovery science in the best tradition,\" he says. Meanwhile, researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center have made progress using Kanzius's technology to fight cancer in animals. They published their findings last month in the journal Cancer. **Note:** For other compelling articles on this fascinating invention, see recent articles in the [Los Angeles Times](http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/02/nation/na-cancer2), [ABC News](http://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3810892), and especially [Medical News Today](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/87746.php).

About two thirds of the power is siphoned off to run the converter; the rest can be used on-site for heating or electricity, or sold back to the utility grid.** Even a blackout would not stop the operation of the facility. New York City is already paying an astronomical $90 a ton to get rid of its trash. According to Startech, a few 2,000-ton-per-day plasma-gasification plants could do it for $36. Sell the syngas and surplus electricity, and you'd actually net $15 a ton. But the decision-making bureaucracy can be slow, and it is hamstrung by the politically well-connected waste-disposal industry.

Sridhar ... says he knows it works because he originally invented a similar device for NASA. He really is a rocket scientist. He invented a new kind of fuel cell, which is like a very skinny battery that always runs. Sridhar feeds oxygen to it on one side, and fuel on the other. The two combine within the cell to create a chemical reaction that produces electricity.

And that the legendary Thomas Alva Edison devised today's electrical power system? \"We were taught wrong,\" said Toby Grotz, president of the [International Tesla Society](http://www.teslasociety.com/). Two years before Marconi demonstrated his wireless radio transmission, [Nikola Tesla] performed an identical feat at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago. **On June 21, 1943, in the case of Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. vs. the United States, the Supreme Court ruled that that Tesla's radio patents had predated those of the Italian genius.** To be sure, Edison invented the incandescent light bulb. But he powered it and all of his other projects with inefficient direct current (DC) electricity. It was Tesla who discovered how to use the far more powerful phased form of alternating current (AC) electricity that is virtually the universal type of electricity employed by modern civilization. There are indications that Tesla also discovered many of the devices ... for the Pentagon's controversial Star Wars antimissile defense system. \"Tesla dreamed of supplying limitless amounts of power freely and equally available to all persons on Earth,\" said Grotz. And he was convinced he could do so by broadcasting electrical power across large distances just as radio transmits far smaller amounts of energy. **[Tesla's] tests ... caused lights to burn as much as 26 miles away, according to news reports of the time. ** **Note:** Tesla was written out of history texts likely because he advocated providing methods for extremely cheap electricity available to everyone.

That's grid parity. It exists when an alternative energy source generates electricity at a cost matching the price of power from the electric grid. As grid parity becomes increasingly common, renewable energy could transform our world and slow the effects of climate change. Advances in solar panels and battery storage will make it more realistic for consumers to dump their electric utility, and power their homes through solar energy. **A 2013 Deutsche Bank report said that 10 states are currently at grid parity: Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Vermont. Germany, Spain, Portugal and Australia have reached grid parity. This shift has benefited from a dramatic drop in the price of solar panels, which dropped 97.2 percent from 1975 to 2012.** As solar energy gets cheaper, traditional electric utilities are doing the opposite. The cost of maintaining the electric grid has gotten more expensive, but reliability hasn't improved. If customers leave electric utilities, it starts a downward spiral. Fewer customers will mean higher rates, which encourages remaining customers to jump ship for a solar-battery system. Energy upstarts are led by forward thinkers with disruptive track records and eyes on society's big problems. NRG Energy chief executive David Crane ... highlighted the climate change concerns in a recent letter to shareholders: \"The day is coming when our children sit us down ... look us straight in the eye, with an acute sense of betrayal and disappointment in theirs, and whisper to us, 'You knew... and you didn't do anything about it.

Forget about fancy batteries, regenerative braking, and alternative fuels. Instead, make a car that's elegant in its minimalism and efficiency. **The Loremo's German designers revisited the basics - engine efficiency, low weight, and minimal drag - to create a car that offers fuel-efficiency in the neighborhood of 130 to 150 miles per gallon. The Loremo is likely to dazzle drivers not with its acceleration, but with its ability to drive from New York to L.A. with only three stops at the pump.** Loremo stands for low resistance mobile, and its engineers have stuck obsessively to this idea. By building the car around a 2-cylinder turbodiesel engine, and cutting back on weight, drag, and other excess fat such as side-opening doors, the Loremo puffs out a mere 50 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer. This is about 40 grams less per kilometer than the tiny diesel smart. According to its creators, this will make the Loremo the most efficient production car ever sold. If the Loremo showed up as a concept on an auto show pedestal, it would certainly garner some attention. But the Loremo is not a car for dreamers; not only will it enter mass production next year, it will sport a base price attainable by mortal motorists: 15,000 euros (about U.S. $22,000). After its 2009 release in Europe, the Loremo will be redesigned to reach the North American market the following year. A $30,000, 3-cylinder GT model will also become available, offering better acceleration (0-60 in roughly 10 seconds, vs. 16 for the base model). Both hybrid and fully electric versions are also in the works. **Miracle material graphene can distil booze, says study** **2012-01-27, BBC News** [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16747208](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16747208) Membranes based on the \"miracle material\" graphene can be used to distil alcohol, according to a new study in *Science* [magazine]. An international team created the membrane from graphene oxide - a chemical derivative of graphene. They have shown that the membrane blocks the passage of several gases and liquids, but lets water through. This joins a long list of fascinating and unusual properties associated with graphene and its derivatives.

That source of hydrocarbons seeps up through the earth's layers and slowly replenishes oil sources. In other words, it turns the fossil-fuel paradigm upside down. Thomas Gold, a respected astronomer and professor emeritus at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, has held for years that **oil is actually a renewable, primordial syrup continually manufactured by the Earth under ultrahot conditions and tremendous pressures. As this substance migrates toward the surface, it is attacked by bacteria, making it appear to have an organic origin dating back to the dinosaurs**, he says. That ... raises the tantalizing possibility that oil may not be the limited resource it is assumed to be. In 2008 ... a group of Russian and Ukrainian scientists [said] that oil and gas don't come from fossils; they're synthesized deep within the earth's mantle by heat, pressure, and other purely chemical means, before gradually rising to the surface. The idea that oil comes from fossils \"is a myth\" that needs changing according to petroleum engineer Vladimir Kutcherov, speaking at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. \"All kinds of rocks could have oil and gas deposits.\" Alexander Kitchka of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences estimates that 60 percent of the content of all oil is abiotic in origin and not from fossil fuels. **Note:** For more on the intriguing abiotic oil theory, [click here](http://freeenergynews.com/Directory/Theory/SustainableOil/). **Solar Panel Drops to $1 per Watt** **2009-02-26, *Popular Mechanics*** [http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4306443.html](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4306443.html) **A long-sought solar milestone was eclipsed on Tuesday, when Tempe, Ariz.-based First Solar Inc. announced that the manufacturing costs for its thin-film photovoltaic panels had dipped", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__energy-news-articles.txt:13:f5269aace32b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9473, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__energy-news-articles.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__energy-news-articles", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "oil and gas deposits.\" Alexander Kitchka of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences estimates that 60 percent of the content of all oil is abiotic in origin and not from fossil fuels. **Note:** For more on the intriguing abiotic oil theory, [click here](http://freeenergynews.com/Directory/Theory/SustainableOil/). **Solar Panel Drops to $1 per Watt** **2009-02-26, *Popular Mechanics*** [http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4306443.html](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4306443.html) **A long-sought solar milestone was eclipsed on Tuesday, when Tempe, Ariz.-based First Solar Inc. announced that the manufacturing costs for its thin-film photovoltaic panels had dipped below $1 per watt for the first time.** With comparable costs for standard silicon panels still hovering in the $3 range, it's tempting to conclude that First Solar's cadmium telluride (CdTe) technology has won the race. But if we're concerned about the big picture (scaling up solar until it's a cheap and ubiquitous antidote to global warming and foreign oil) a forthcoming study from the University of California-Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggests that neither material has what it takes compared to lesser-known alternatives such as-we're not kidding-fool's gold. Even if the solar cell market were to grow at 56 percent a year for the next 10 years-slightly higher than the rapid growth of the past year-photovoltaics would still only account for about 2.5 percent of global electricity, LBNL researcher Cyrus Wadia says. \"First Solar is great, as long as we're talking megawatts or gigawatts,\" he says. \"But as soon as they have to start rolling out terawatts, that's where I believe they will reach some limitations.\" Even the current rate of growth won't be easy to sustain. Despite the buck-per-watt announcement, First Solar's share price plummeted more than 20 percent on Wednesday, thanks to warnings from CEO Mike Ahearn about the effect of the credit crisis on potential solar customers-as much as 10 to 15 percent of current orders might default. **Note:** Solar energy costs have dropped consistently and steadily over the past 30 years. In the late 1970s solar energy cost [$100 per watt](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/2804574/Monday-view-Cheap-solar-power-poised-to-undercut-oil-and-gas-by-half.html). The price will almost certainly continue to drop. The [*San Francisco Chronicle*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050818solarenergynanotechnology) reported in 2005 that \"the electricity currently provided by utilities ... averages $1 per watt.\" Why isn't it being trumpeted loudly worldwide in the media that solar energy is reaching parity with traditional energy sources? Could it be that powerful interests don't want solar energy to be competitive with oil and nuclear? **Blacklight Power bolsters its impossible claims of a new renewable energy source** **2008-10-21, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/external/venturebeat/2008/10/21/21venturebeat-blacklig...](http://www.nytimes.com/external/venturebeat/2008/10/21/21venturebeat-blacklight-power-bolsters-its-impossible-cla-99377.html) Ask nearly any physicist if it's possible for a hydrogen atom to enter a lower energy state than the ground, or resting, state they hold in nature, and you're likely to get an unequivocal \"no\".

[TV footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGg0ATfoBgo) of his bizarre discovery has been burning up the blogosphere ever since, drawing crackpots and Ph.D.s alike into a raging debate. Skeptics say Kanzius's radio generator is sucking up far more energy than it's creating, making it a carnival trick at best. For now, Kanzius is tuning out the hubbub. Diagnosed with leukemia in 2002, he began building his radio-wave blaster the next year, soon after a relapse. If he could seed a person's cancerous cells with nanoscopic metal particles and blast them with radio waves, perhaps he could kill off the cancer while sparing healthy tissue. **The saltwater phenomenon happened by accident when an assistant was bombarding a saline-filled test tube with radio waves and bumped the tube, causing a small flash. Curious, Kanzius struck a match. \"The water lit like a propane flame,\"** he recalls. \"People said, 'It's a crock. Look for hidden electrodes in the water,' \" says Penn State University materials scientist Rustum Roy, who visited [Kanzius] in his lab in August after seeing the feat on Google Video. A demo made Roy a believer. \"This is discovery science in the best tradition,\" he says. Meanwhile, researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center have made progress using Kanzius's technology to fight cancer in animals. They published their findings last month in the journal Cancer. **Note:** For other compelling articles on this fascinating invention, see articles in the [Los Angeles Times](http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/02/nation/na-cancer2), [ABC News](http://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3810892), and especially [Medical News Today](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/87746.php).

New Media Reports **New Energy Invention Goes Open Source And the Power of the New Media ** Dear friends, I have been following the new energy movement closely for seven years now. One of the most courageous leaders of the new energy movement, Sterling Allan, has become a personal friend who I highly respect for his integrity and his excellent [open source website](http://peswiki.com) packed with valuable information on alternate energy sources and new energy inventions. **On March 18th, Sterling began reporting on a fascinating magnetic motor that has recently been developed which, according to its inventor, runs without any external input. ** I've been following this development closely and included links for those interested in the special note at the end of our recent weekly news summaries. Sterling is fairly convinced that this device is the real deal. The inventor, who goes by the name Mylow, has been very open and transparent in revealing everything that he is doing. He has posted [detailed videos](http://peswiki.com/index.php/OS:MYLOW:Videos) on exactly how he made this magnetic motor and allowed Sterling to publicize it widely. Sterling has been in frequent phone contact with Mylow over the past couple weeks. He has even helped him to get better magnets to improve the functioning of the device. Then last weekend, Sterling emailed saying that **a strange, intimidating man showed up in Mylow's home the evening of April 2nd. He confiscated the motor.** Yet strangely, this man returned later with the motor slightly damaged and warnings not to pursue this \"toy.\" If this is true, we have a clear example of suppression of a powerful new energy technology. I recently began work as a citizen reporter at the online news service examiner.com, partially for the reason that when breaking stories like this occur, I can quickly make the news available to a wide audience over the Internet. Unlike WantToKnow.info, news reports on examiner.com are included in Google News searches within 12 hours or so of posting. Examiner.com reports also often show up very high in rankings on search engines. To read the examiner.com article I wrote on this fascinating new energy invention and the intimidation shortly after it occurred (good links included) [click here](http://www.examiner.com/x-6495-National-Intelligence-Examiner~y2009m4d3-Amazing-new-energy-invention-confiscated-Could-transform-energy-generation-worldwide). Yet strangely, this particular article on Mylow's invention did not and does not show up in the Google news search (articles usually remain for about a month). Of ten articles I've written so far at examiner.com, all but two of them have shown up in Google News searches. You can test this for yourself by going to the link below, which lists all articles I've written.

Now try \"new energy invention\" in your search, or any other words from the title of my article, \"Amazing new energy invention confiscated: Could transform energy generation worldwide.\" You will see that it does not show up in the news search. So why is it that this fascinating article on a new energy invention which could revolutionize our world does not appear anywhere in the news search? Is this just a coincidence? **Could someone be monitoring and filtering certain key items out of news searches?** As I do a lot of Google news searches to compile the information we send to you, I have previously come to suspect that there is some form of censorship in their news searches. This furthers my suspicions, though we can't know for certain. **The New Media: Breaking Through Censorship ** Many of us have felt for a long time that the old media is fading and a new, citizen-based media is gradually replacing it. Many alternative news websites are growing in popularity as newspapers around the world are losing readership, with some even closing. One of the most exciting developments is citizen-based reporting on certain online news websites. On these informative sites, caring citizens report the news directly without the censorship of major media editors and corporate ownership. Though examiner.com only started a year ago, citizen-based reporting has already had a powerful influence for a number of years all over the world. **One of the first citizen-based news services, [OhmyNews](http://english.ohmynews.com) in South Korea, played a decisive role in the 2002 loss of the two establishment presidential candidates, and the victory of political outsider [Roh Moo Hyun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roh_Moo-hyun), who went on to serve as president until 2008.** As shown in its slogan, \"Every Citizen is a Reporter,\" OhmyNews is a powerful example of what online citizen journalism can do. After being elected, Roh granted his first media interview to OhmyNews. You can read about this in an excellent *New York Times* article [available here](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/06/world/online-newspaper-shakes-up-korean-politics.html).

Examiner.com has a wide reach, as it is already one of the most popular websites on the Internet, ranked in the [top 2,000](http://alexa.com/siteinfo/examiner.com) out of about 200 million websites now on the world wide web. **Almost anyone with writing skill and a passion can become a citizen reporter at examiner.com.** If we can get large numbers of caring, dedicated people to sign up as reporters - people who are aware of the deeper politics of our world and committed to building a brighter future - we can more easily spread the news far and wide. I invite any of you with writing skill and a passion for spreading the news to sign up and join me and many others as citizens reporters who are building a brighter future.

If you have any problem with this, please don't mention me as the referrer, but do sign up, as I am not doing this for the money. Yet, I am amazed that examiner.com actually pays their reporters, too. You receive one penny for every page view you receive on articles you write. One of my articles has already received over 2,400 visits, so I will receive $24 for those visits. Two of my friends who got me started on this are earning about $1,000/month as examiner.com reporters now. The money is certainly nice, particularly as I've had very little income in the past five years due to volunteering most of my time and energy for PEERS. I've actually donated $25,000 of my limited retirement savings to support PEERS. Yet much more important than the income is the opportunity here to make a difference in our world. **I invite you to join me in becoming a citizen reporter and help to open people's eyes around the world to the deeper realities and to the many ways we can make a difference and build a better world. **To sign up as a reporter, [click here](http://www.examiner.com/about_examiner/).

My Early Life ** The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs. This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded. But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements. Speaking for myself, I have already had more than my full measure of this exquisite enjoyment, so much that for many years my life was little short of continuous rapture. I am credited with being one of the hardest workers and perhaps I am, if thought is the equivalent of labor, for I have devoted to it almost all of my waking hours. But if work is interpreted to be a definite performance in a specified time according to a rigid rule, then I may be the worst of idlers. Every effort under compulsion demands a sacrifice of life-energy. I never paid such a price. On the contrary, I have thrived on my thoughts.

In attempting to give a connected and faithful account of my activities in this series of articles which will be presented with the assistance of the Editors of the ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER and are chiefly addrest to our young men readers, I must dwell, however reluctantly, on the impressions of my youth and the circumstances and events which have been instrumental in determining my career. **Our first endeavors are purely instinctive, promptings of an imagination vivid and undisciplined. As we grow older reason asserts itself and we become more and more systematic and designing. But those early impulses, tho not immediately productive, are of the greatest moment and may shape our very destinies. Indeed, I feel now that had I understood and cultivated instead of suppressing them, I would have added substantial value to my bequest to the world. But not until I had attained manhood did I realize that I was an inventor. ** **This was due to a number of causes. In the first place I had a brother who was gifted to an extraordinary degree-one of those rare phenomena of mentality which biological investigation has failed to explain. His premature death left my parents disconsolate.** We owned a horse which had been presented to us by a dear friend. It was a magnificent animal of Arabian breed, possest of almost human intelligence, and was cared for and petted by the whole family, having on one occasion saved my father's life under remarkable circumstances. My father had been called one winter night to perform an urgent duty and while crossing the mountains, infested by wolves, the horse became frightened and ran away, throwing him violently to the ground. It arrived home bleeding and exhausted, but after the alarm was sounded immediately dashed off again, returning to the spot, and before the searching party were far on the way they were met by my father, who had recovered consciousness and remounted, not realizing that he had been lying in the snow for several hours. This horse was responsible for my brother's injuries from which he died. I witnest the tragic scene and altho fifty-six years have elapsed since, my visual impression of it has lost none of its force. The recollection of his attainments made every effort of mine seem dull in comparison. **Anything I did that was creditable merely caused my parents to feel their loss more keenly.

The recollection of his attainments made every effort of mine seem dull in comparison. **Anything I did that was creditable merely caused my parents to feel their loss more keenly. So I grew up with little confidence in myself. But I was far from being considered a stupid boy,** if I am to judge from an incident of which I have still a strong remembrance. One day the Aldermen were passing thru a street where I was at play with other boys. The oldest of these venerable gentlemen-a wealthy citizen-paused to give a silver piece to each of us. Coming to me he suddenly stopt and commanded, \"Look in my eyes.\" I met his gaze, my hand outstretched to receive the much valued coin, when, to my dismay, he said, \"No, not much, you can get nothing from me, you are too smart.\" They used to tell a funny story about me. I had two old aunts with wrinkled faces, one of them having two teeth protruding like the tusks of an elephant which she buried in my cheek every time she kist me. Nothing would scare me more than the prospect of being hugged by these as affectionate as unattractive relatives. It happened that while being carried in my mother's arms they asked me who was the prettier of the two. After examining their faces intently, I answered thoughtfully, pointing to one of them, \"This here is not as ugly as the other.\" Then again, **I was intended from my very birth for the clerical profession and this thought constantly opprest me. I longed to be an engineer but my father was inflexible.** He was the son of an officer who served in the army of the Great Napoleon and, in common with his brother, professor of mathematics in a prominent institution, had received a military education but, singularly enough, later embraced the clergy in which vocation he achieved eminence. He was a very erudite man, a veritable natural philosopher, poet and writer and his sermons were said to be as eloquent as those of Abraham a Sancta-Clara. He had a prodigious memory and frequently recited at length from works in several languages. He often remarked playfully that if some of the classics were lost he could restore them. His style of writing was much admired. He penned sentences short and terse and was full of wit and satire. The humorous remarks he made were always peculiar and characteristic. Just to illustrate, I may mention one or two instances. Among the help there was a cross-eyed man called Mane, employed to do work around the farm. He was chopping wood one day.

As he swung the axe my father, who stood nearby and felt very uncomfortable, cautioned him, \"For God's sake, Mane, do not strike at what you are looking but at what you intend to hit.\" On another occasion he was taking out for a drive a friend who carelessly permitted his costly fur coat to rub on the carriage wheel. My father reminded him of it saying, \"Pull in your coat, you are ruining my tire.\" He had the odd habit of talking to himself and would often carry on an animated conversation and indulge in heated argument, changing the tone of his voice. A casual listener might have sworn that several people were in the room. Altho I must trace to my mother's influence whatever inventiveness I possess, the training he gave me must have been helpful. It comprised all sorts of exercises-as, guessing one another's thoughts, discovering the defects of some form or expression, repeating long sentences or performing mental calculations. These daily lessons were intended to strengthen memory and reason and especially to develop the critical sense, and were undoubtedly very beneficial. **My mother descended from one of the oldest families in the country and a line of inventors. Both her father and grandfather originated numerous implements for household, agricultural and other uses.** She was a truly great woman, of rare skill, courage and fortitude, who had braved the storms of life and past thru many a trying experience. When she was sixteen a virulent pestilence swept the country. Her father was called away to administer the last sacraments to the dying and during his absence she went alone to the assistance of a neighboring family who were stricken by the dread disease. All of the members, five in number, succumbed in rapid succession. She bathed, clothed and laid out the bodies, decorating them with flowers according to the custom of the country and when her father returned he found everything ready for a Christian burial. **My mother was an inventor of the first order and would, I believe, have achieved great things had she not been so remote from modern life and its multifold opportunities. She invented and constructed all kinds of tools and devices and wove the finest designs from thread which was spun by her.** She even planted the seeds, raised the plants and separated the fibers herself.

She worked indefatigably, from break of day till late at night, and most of the wearing apparel and furnishings of the home was the product of her hands. When she was past sixty, her fingers were still nimble enough to tie three knots in an eyelash. **There was another and still more important reason for my late awakening. In my boyhood I suffered from a peculiar affliction due to the appearance of images, often accompanied by strong flashes of light, which marred the sight of real objects and interfered with my thought and action. They were pictures of things and scenes which I had really seen, never of those I imagined. When a word was spoken to me the image of the object it designated would present itself vividly to my vision and sometimes I was quite unable to distinguish whether what I saw was tangible or not. ** This caused me great discomfort and anxiety. None of the students of psychology or physiology whom I have consulted could ever explain satisfactorily these phenomena. They seem to have been unique altho I was probably predisposed as I know that my brother experienced a similar trouble. The theory I have formulated is that the images were the result of a reflex action from the brain on the retina under great excitation. They certainly were not hallucinations such as are produced in diseased and anguished minds, for in other respects I was normal and composed. To give an idea of my distress, suppose that I had witnest a funeral or some such nerve-racking spectacle. Then, inevitably, in the stillness of night, a vivid picture of the scene would thrust itself before my eyes and persist despite all my efforts to banish it. Sometimes it would even remain fixt in space tho I pushed my hand thru it. If my explanation is correct, it should be able to project on a screen the image of any object one conceives and make it visible. Such an advance would revolutionize all human relations. I am convinced that this wonder can and will be accomplished in time to come; I may add that I have devoted much thought to the solution of the problem. **To free myself of these tormenting appearances, I tried to concentrate my mind on something else I had seen, and in this way I would often obtain temporary relief; but in order to get it I had to conjure", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt:4:7c0c8373141d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9488, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "make it visible.

It was not long before I found that I had exhausted all of those at my command; my \"reel\" had run out, as it were, because I had seen little of the world-only objects in my home and the immediate surroundings. As I performed these mental operations for the second or third time, in order to chase the appearances from my vision, the remedy gradually lost all its force. Then I instinctively commenced to make excursions beyond the limits of the small world of which I had knowledge, and I saw new scenes. ** **These were at first very blurred and indistinct, and would flit away when I tried to concentrate my attention upon them, but by and by I succeeded in fixing them; they gained in strength and distinctness and finally assumed the concreteness of real things. I soon discovered that my best comfort was attained if I simply went on in my vision farther and farther, getting new impressions all the time, and so I began to travel-of course, in my mind. Every night (and sometimes during the day), when alone, I would start on my journeys-see new places, cities and countries-live there, meet people and make friendships and acquaintances and, however unbelievable, it is a fact that they were just as dear to me as those in actual life and not a bit less intense in their manifestations. ** **This I did constantly until I was about seventeen when my thoughts turned seriously to invention. Then I observed to my delight that I could visualize with the greatest facility. I needed no models, drawings or experiments. I could picture them all as real in my mind. Thus I have been led unconsciously to evolve what I consider a new method of materializing inventive concepts and ideas, which is radically opposite to the purely experimental and is in my opinion ever so much more expeditious and efficient.** The moment one constructs a device to carry into practise a crude idea he finds himself unavoidably engrost with the details and defects of the apparatus.

My method is different. I do not rush into actual work. When I get an idea I start at once building it up in my imagination. I change the construction, make improvements and operate the device in my mind. It is absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in thought or test it in my shop. I even note if it is out of balance. There is no difference whatever, the results are the same. In this way I am able to rapidly develop and perfect a conception without touching anything. When I have gone so far as to embody in the invention every possible improvement I can think of and see no fault anywhere, I put into concrete form this final product of my brain. Invariably my device works as I conceived that it should, and the experiment comes out exactly as I planned it. In twenty years there has not been a single exception. Why should it be otherwise? Engineering, electrical and mechanical, is positive in results. There is scarcely a subject that cannot be mathematically treated and the effects calculated or the results determined beforehand from the available theoretical and practical data. The carrying out into practise of a crude idea as is being generally done is, I hold, nothing but a waste of energy, money and time. **My early affliction had, however, another compensation. The incessant mental exertion developed my powers of observation and enabled me to discover a truth of great importance. I had noted that the appearance of images was always preceded by actual vision of scenes under peculiar and generally very exceptional conditions and I was impelled on each occasion to locate the original impulse. After a while this effort grew to be almost automatic and I gained great facility in connecting cause and effect. ** Soon I became aware, to my surprise, that every thought I conceived was suggested by an external impression. Not only this but all my actions were prompted in a similar way. In the course of time it became perfectly evident to me that I was merely an automaton endowed with power of movement, responding to the stimuli of the sense organs and thinking and acting accordingly.

I was about twelve years old when I first succeeded in banishing an image from my vision by wilful effort, but I never had any control over the flashes of light to which I have referred. They were, perhaps, my strangest experience and inexplicable. They usually occurred when I found myself in a dangerous or distressing situation, or when I was greatly exhilarated. In some instances I have seen all the air around me filled with tongues of living flame. Their intensity, instead of diminishing, increased with time and seemingly attained a maximum when I was about twenty-five years old. While in Paris, in 1883, a prominent French manufacturer sent me an invitation to a shooting expedition which I accepted. I had been long confined to the factory and the fresh air had a wonderfully invigorating effect on me. On my return to the city that night I felt a positive sensation that my brain had caught fire. I saw a light as tho a small sun was located in it and I past the whole night applying cold compressions to my tortured head. Finally the flashes diminished in frequency and force but it took more than three weeks before they wholly subsided. When a second invitation was extended to me my answer was an emphatic NO! These luminous phenomena still manifest themselves from time to time, as when a new idea opening up possibilities strikes me, but they are no longer exciting, being of relatively small intensity. When I close my eyes I invariably observe first, a background of very dark and uniform blue, not unlike the sky on a clear but starless night. In a few seconds this field becomes animated with innumerable scintillating flakes of green, arranged in several layers and advancing towards me. Then there appears, to the right, a beautiful pattern of two systems of parallel and closely spaced lines, at right angles to one another, in all sorts of colors with yellow-green and gold predominating. Immediately thereafter the lines grow brighter and the whole is thickly sprinkled with dots of twinkling light.

This picture moves slowly across the field of vision and in about ten seconds vanishes to the left, leaving behind a ground of rather unpleasant and inert grey which quickly gives way to a billowy sea of clouds, seemingly trying to mould themselves in living shapes. It is curious that I cannot project a form into this grey until the second phase is reached. Every time, before falling asleep, images of persons or objects flit before my view. When I see them I know that I am about to lose consciousness. If they are absent and refuse to come it means a sleepless night. To what an extent imagination played a part in my early life I may illustrate by another odd experience. Like most children I was fond of jumping and developed an intense desire to support myself in the air. Occasionally a strong wind richly charged with oxygen blew from the mountains rendering my body as light as cork and then I would leap and float in space for a long time. It was a delightful sensation and my disappointment was keen when later I undeceived myself. During that period I contracted many strange likes, dislikes and habits, some of which I can trace to external impressions while others are unaccountable. I had a violent aversion against the earrings of women but other ornaments, as bracelets, pleased me more or less according to design. The sight of a pearl would almost give me a fit but I was fascinated with the glitter of crystals or objects with sharp edges and plane surfaces. I would not touch the hair of other people except, perhaps, at the point of a revolver. I would get a fever by looking at a peach and if a piece of camphor was anywhere in the house it caused me the keenest discomfort. Even now I am not insensible to some of these upsetting impulses. When I drop little squares of paper in a dish filled with liquid, I always sense a peculiar and awful taste in my mouth. I counted the steps in my walks and calculated the cubical contents of soup plates, coffee cups and pieces of food - otherwise my meal was unenjoyable. **All repeated acts or operations I performed had to be divisible by three and if I mist I felt impelled to do it all over again, even if it took hours. ** **Up to the age of eight years, my character was weak and vacillating.

I had neither courage or strength to form a firm resolve. My feelings came in waves and surges and vibrated unceasingly between extremes.** My wishes were of consuming force and like the heads of the hydra, they multiplied. I was opprest by thoughts of pain in life and death and religious fear. I was swayed by superstitious belief and lived in constant dread of the spirit of evil, of ghosts and ogres and other unholy monsters of the dark. Then, all at once, there came a tremendous change which altered the course of my whole existence. Of all things I liked books the best. My father had a large library and whenever I could manage I tried to satisfy my passion for reading. He did not permit it and would fly into a rage when he caught me in the act. He hid the candles when he found that I was reading in secret. He did not want me to spoil my eyes. But I obtained tallow, made the wicking and cast the sticks into tin forms, and every night I would bush the keyhole and the cracks and read, often till dawn, when all others slept and my mother started on her arduous daily task. On one occasion I came across a novel entitled \"Abafi\" (the Son of Aba), a Serbian translation of a well known Hungarian writer, Josika. **This work somehow awakened my dormant powers of will and I began to practise self-control. At first my resolutions faded like snow in April, but in a little while I conquered my weakness and felt a pleasure I never knew before-that of doing as I willed.** In the course of time this vigorous mental exercise became second nature. At the outset my wishes had to be subdued but gradually desire and will grew to be identical. After years of such discipline I gained so complete a mastery over myself that I toyed with passions which have meant destruction to some of the strongest men. At a certain age I contracted a mania for gambling which greatly worried my parents. To sit down to a game of cards was for me the quintessence of pleasure. My father led an exemplary life and could not excuse the senseless waste of time and money in which I indulged. I had a strong resolve but my philosophy was bad.

I had a strong resolve but my philosophy was bad. I would say to him, \"I can stop whenever I please but is it worth while to give up that which I would purchase with the joys of Paradise?\" On frequent occasions he gave vent to his anger and contempt but my mother was different. She understood the character of men and knew that one's salvation could only be brought about thru his own efforts. One afternoon, I remember, when I had lost all my money and was craving for a game, she came to me with a roll of bills and said, \"Go and enjoy yourself. The sooner you lose all we possess the better it will be. I know that you will get over it.\" She was right. I conquered my passion then and there and only regretted that it had not been a hundred times as strong. I not only vanquished but tore it from my heart so as not to leave even a trace of desire. Ever since that time I have been as indifferent to any form of gambling as to picking teeth. During another period I smoked excessively, threatening to ruin my health. Then my will asserted itself and I not only stopt but destroyed all inclination. Long ago I suffered from heart trouble until I discovered that it was due to the innocent cup of coffee I consumed every morning. I discontinued at once, tho I confess it was not an easy task. In this way I checked and bridled other habits and passions and have not only preserved my life but derived an immense amount of satisfaction from what most men would consider privation and sacrifice. **After finishing the studies at the Polytechnic Institute and University I had a complete nervous breakdown and while the malady lasted I observed many phenomena strange and unbelievable. ** **II. My First Efforts At Invention** **I shall dwell briefly on these extraordinary experiences, on account of their possible interest to students of psychology and physiology and also because this period of agony was of the greatest consequence on my mental development and subsequent labors.** But it is indispensable to first relate the circumstances and conditions which preceded them and in which might be found their partial explanation.

The pressure of occupation and the incessant stream of impressions pouring into our consciousness thru all the gateways of knowledge make modern existence hazardous in many ways. **Most persons are so absorbed in the contemplation of the outside world that they are wholly oblivious to what is passing on within themselves. ** The premature death of millions is primarily traceable to this cause. Even among those who exercise care it is a common mistake to avoid imaginary, and ignore the real dangers. And what is true of an individual also applies, more or less, to a people as a whole. Witness, in illustration, the prohibition movement. A drastic, if not unconstitutional, measure is now being put thru in this country to prevent the consumption of alcohol and yet it is a positive fact that coffee, tea, tobacco, chewing gum and other stimulants, which are freely indulged in even at the tender age, are vastly more injurious to the national body, judging from the number of those who succumb. So, for instance, during my student years I gathered from the published necrologues in Vienna, the home of coffee drinkers, that deaths from heart trouble sometimes reached sixty-seven per cent of the total. Similar observations might probably be made in cities where the consumption of tea is excessive. These delicious beverages superexcite and gradually exhaust the fine fibers of the brain. They also interfere seriously with arterial circulation and should be enjoyed all the more sparingly as their deleterious effects are slow and imperceptible. Tobacco, on the other hand, is conducive to easy and pleasant thinking and detracts from the intensity and concentration necessary to all original and vigorous effort of the intellect. Chewing gum is helpful for a short while but soon drains the glandular system and inflicts irreparable damage, not to speak of the revulsion it creates. Alcohol in small quantities is an excellent tonic, but is toxic in its action when absorbed in larger amounts, quite immaterial as to whether it is taken in as whiskey or produced in the stomach from sugar. But it should not be overlooked that all these are great eliminators assisting Nature, as they do, in upholding her stern but just law of the survival of the fittest. Eager reformers should also be mindful of the eternal perversity of mankind which makes the indifferent \"laissez-faire\" by far preferable to enforced restraint. **The truth about this", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt:11:3dad34843ed2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9495, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "when absorbed in larger amounts, quite immaterial as to whether it is taken in as whiskey or produced in the stomach from sugar.

Abstinence was not always to my liking but I find ample reward in the agreeable experiences I am now making. Just in the hope of converting some to my precepts and convictions I will recall one or two. A short time ago I was returning to my hotel. It was a bitter cold night, the ground slippery, and no taxi to be had. Half a block behind me followed another man, evidently as anxious as myself to get under cover. Suddenly my legs went up in the air. In the same instant there was a flash in my brain, the nerves responded, the muscles contracted, I swung thru 180 degrees and landed on my hands. I resumed my walk as tho nothing had happened when the stranger caught up with me. \"How old are you?\" he asked, surveying me critically. \"Oh, about fifty-nine,\" I replied. \"What of it?\" \"Well,\" said he, \"I have seen a cat do this but never a man.\" About a month since I wanted to order new eyeglasses and went to an oculist who put me thru the usual tests. He lookt at me incredulously as I read off with ease the smallest print at considerable distance. But when I told him that I was past sixty he gasped in astonishment. Friends of mine often remark that my suits fit me like gloves but they do not know that all my clothing is made to measurements which were taken nearly 35 years ago and never changed. During this same period my weight has not varied one pound. In this connection I may tell a funny story. One evening, in the winter of 1885, Mr. Edison, Edward H. Johnson, the President of the Edison Illuminating Company, Mr. Batchellor, Manager of the works, and myself entered a little place opposite 65 Fifth Avenue where the offices of the company were located. Someone suggested guessing weights and I was induced to step on a scale. Edison felt me all over and said: \"Tesla weighs 152 lbs. to an ounce,\" and he guest it exactly.

Someone suggested guessing weights and I was induced to step on a scale. Edison felt me all over and said: \"Tesla weighs 152 lbs. to an ounce,\" and he guest it exactly. Stript I weighed 142 lbs. and that is still my weight. I whispered to Mr. Johnson: \"How is it possible that Edison could guess my weight so closely?\" \"Well,\" he said, lowering his voice. \"I will tell you, confidentially, but you must not say anything. He was employed for a long time in a Chicago slaughter-house where he weighed thousands of hogs every day! That's why.\" My friend, the Hon. Chauncey M. Depew, tells of an Englishman on whom he sprung one of his original anecdotes and who listened with a puzzled expression but - a year later - laughed out loud. I will frankly confess it took me longer than that to appreciate Johnson's joke. **Now, my well being is simply the result of a careful and measured mode of living and perhaps the most astonishing thing is that three times in my youth I was rendered by illness a hopeless physical wreck and given up by physicians. More than this, thru ignorance and lightheartedness, I got into all sorts of difficulties, dangers and scrapes from which I extricated myself as by enchantment. I was almost drowned a dozen times; was nearly boiled alive and just mist being cremated. I was entombed, lost and frozen. I had hair-breadth escapes from mad dogs, hogs, and other wild animals. I past thru dreadful diseases and met with all kinds of odd mishaps and that I am hale and hearty today seems like a miracle. But as I recall these incidents to my mind I feel convinced that my preservation was not altogether accidental. ** An inventor's endeavor is essentially lifesaving. Whether he harnesses forces, improves devices, or provides new comforts and conveniences, he is adding to the safety of our existence. He is also better qualified than the average individual to protect himself in peril, for he is observant and resourceful. If I had no other evidence that I was, in a measure, possest of such qualities I would find it in these personal experiences. The reader will be able to judge for himself if I mention one or two instances. On one occasion, when about 14 years old, I wanted to scare some friends who were bathing with me.

My plan was to dive under a long floating structure and slip out quietly at the other end. Swimming and diving came to me as naturally as to a duck and I was confident that I could perform the feat. Accordingly I plunged into the water and, when out of view, turned around and proceeded rapidly towards the opposite side. Thinking that I was safely beyond the structure, I rose to the surface but to my dismay struck a beam. Of course, I quickly dived and forged ahead with rapid strokes until my breath was beginning to give out. Rising for the second time, my head came again in contact with a beam. Now I was becoming desperate. However, summoning all my energy, I made a third frantic attempt but the result was the same. The torture of supprest breathing was getting unendurable, my brain was reeling and I felt myself sinking. At that moment, when my situation seemed absolutely hopeless, I experienced one of those flashes of light and the structure above me appeared before my vision. I either discerned or guest that there was a little space between the surface of the water and the boards resting on the beams and, with consciousness nearly gone, I floated up, prest my mouth close to the planks and managed to inhale a little air, unfortunately mingled with a spray of water which nearly choked me. Several times I repeated this procedure as in a dream until my heart, which was racing at a terrible rate, quieted down and I gained composure. After that I made a number of unsuccessful dives, having completely lost the sense of direction, but finally succeeded in getting out of the trap when my friends had already given me up and were fishing for my body. That bathing season was spoiled for me thru recklessness but I soon forgot the lesson and only two years later I fell into a worse predicament. There was a large flour mill with a dam across the river near the city where I was studying at that time. As a rule the height of the water was only two or three inches above the dam and to swim out to it was a sport not very dangerous in which I often indulged.

One day I went alone to the river to enjoy myself as usual. When I was a short distance from the masonry, however, I was horrified to observe that the water had risen and was carrying me along swiftly. I tried to get away but it was too late. Luckily, tho, I saved myself from being swept over by taking hold of the wall with both hands. The pressure against my chest was great and I was barely able to keep my head above the surface. Not a soul was in sight and my voice was lost in the roar of the fall. Slowly and gradually I became exhausted and unable to withstand the strain longer. Just as I was about to let go, to be dashed against the rocks below, I saw in a flash of light a familiar diagram illustrating the hydraulic principle that the pressure of a fluid in motion is proportionate to the area exposed, and automatically I turned on my left side. As if by magic the pressure was reduced and I found it comparatively easy in that position to resist the force of the stream. But the danger still confronted me. I knew that sooner or later I would be carried down, as it was not possible for any help to reach me in time, even if I attracted attention. I am ambidextrous now but then I was lefthanded and had comparatively little strength in my right arm. For this reason I did not dare to turn on the other side to rest and nothing remained but to slowly push my body along the dam. I had to get away from the mill towards which my face was turned as the current there was much swifter and deeper. It was a long and painful ordeal and I came near to failing at its very end for I was confronted with a depression in the masonry. I managed to get over with the last ounce of my force and fell in a swoon when I reached the bank, where I was found. I had torn virtually all the skin from my left side and it took several weeks before the fever subsided and I was well. These are only two of many instances but they may be sufficient to show that had it not been for the inventor's instinct I would not have lived to tell this tale. **Interested people have often asked me how and when I began to invent.** This I can only answer from my present recollection in the light of which the first attempt I recall was rather ambitious for it involved the invention of an apparatus and a method.

In the former I was anticipated but the latter was original. It happened in this way. **One of my playmates had come into the possession of a hook and fishing-tackle which created quite an excitement in the village, and the next morning all started out to catch frogs. I was left alone and deserted owing to a quarrel with this boy. I had never seen a real hook and pictured it as something wonderful, endowed with peculiar qualities, and was despairing not to be one of the party. ** **Urged by necessity, I somehow got hold of a piece of soft iron wire, hammered the end to a sharp point between two stones, bent it into shape, and fastened it to a strong string. I then cut a rod, gathered some bait, and went down to the brook where there were frogs in abundance. But I could not catch any and was almost discouraged when it occurred to me to dangle the empty hook in front of a frog sitting on a stump. At first he collapsed but by and by his eyes bulged out and became bloodshot, he swelled to twice his normal size and made a vicious snap at the hook. ** **Immediately I pulled him up. I tried the same thing again and again and the method proved infallible. When my comrades, who in spite of their fine outfit had caught nothing, came to me they were green with envy. For a long time I kept my secret and enjoyed the monopoly but finally yielded to the spirit of Christmas. Every boy could then do the same and the following summer brought disaster to the frogs. ** In my next attempt I seem to have acted under the first instinctive impulse which later dominated me - to harness the energies of nature to the service of man. I did this thru the medium of May-bugs - or June-bugs as they are called in America - which were a veritable pest in that country and sometimes broke the branches of trees by the sheer weight of their bodies. The bushes were black with them.

All went well until a strange boy came to the place. He was the son of a retired officer in the Austrian Army. That urchin ate May-bugs alive and enjoyed them as tho they were the finest blue-point oysters. That disgusting sight terminated my endeavors in this promising field and I have never since been able to touch a May-bug or any other insect for that matter. After that, I believe, I undertook to take apart and assemble the clocks of my grandfather. In the former operation I was always successful but often failed in the latter. So it came that he brought my work to a sudden halt in a manner not too delicate and it took thirty years before I tackled another clockwork again. Shortly there after I went into the manufacture of a kind of pop-gun which comprised a hollow tube, a piston, and two plugs of hemp. When firing the gun, the piston was prest against the stomach and the tube was pushed back quickly with both hands. The air between the plugs was comprest and raised to high temperature and one of them was expelled with a loud report. The art consisted in selecting a tube of the proper taper from the hollow stalks. I did very well with that gun but my activities interfered with the window panes in our house and met with painful discouragement. If I remember rightly, I then took to carving swords from pieces of furniture which I could conveniently obtain. At that time I was under the sway of the Serbian national poetry and full of admiration for the feats of the heroes. I used to spend hours in mowing down my enemies in the form of corn-stalks which ruined the crops and netted me several spankings from my mother. Moreover these were not of the formal kind but the genuine article. **I had all this and more behind me before I was six years old and had past thru one year of elementary school in the village of Smiljan where I was born.

My bashfulness was such that I would rather have faced a roaring lion than one of the city dudes who strolled about. **But my hardest trial came on Sunday when I had to dress up and attend the service. There I meet with an accident, the mere thought of which made my blood curdle like sour milk for years afterwards. It was my second adventure in a church. Not long before I was entombed for a night in an old chapel on an inaccessible mountain which was visited only once a year. It was an awful experience, but this one was worse. There was a wealthy lady in town, a good but pompous woman, who used to come to the church gorgeously painted up and attired with an enormous train and attendants. One Sunday I had just finished ringing the bell in the belfry and rushed downstairs when this grand dame was sweeping out and I jumped on her train. It tore off with a ripping noise which sounded like a salvo of musketry fired by raw recruits. My father was livid with rage. He gave me a gentle slap on the cheek, the only corporal punishment he ever administered to me but I almost feel it now. The embarrassment and confusion that followed are indescribable. I was practically ostracised until something else happened which redeemed me in the estimation of the community. An enterprising young merchant had organized a fire department. A new fire engine was purchased, uniforms provided and the men drilled for service and parade. The engine was, in reality, a pump to be worked by sixteen men and was beautifully painted red and black. One afternoon the official trial was prepared for and the machine was transported to the river. The entire population turned out to witness the great spectacle.

The fizzle was complete when I arrived at the scene. My knowledge of the mechanism was nil and I knew next to nothing of air pressure, but instinctively I felt for the suction hose in the water and found that it had collapsed. When I waded in the river and opened it up the water rushed forth and not a few Sunday clothes were spoiled. Archimedes running naked thru the streets of Syracuse and shouting Eureka at the top of his voice did not make a greater impression than myself. I was carried on the shoulders and was the hero of the day. Upon settling in the city I began a four-years' course in the so-called Normal School preparatory to my studies at the College or Real Gymnasium. During this period my boyish efforts and exploits, as well as troubles, continued. Among other things I attained the unique distinction of champion crow catcher in the country. My method of procedure was extremely simple. I would go in the forest, hide in the bushes, and imitate the call of the bird. Usually I would get several answers and in a short while a crow would flutter down into the shrubbery near me. After that all I needed to do was to throw a piece of cardboard to distract its attention, jump up and grab it before it could extricate itself from the undergrowth. In this way I would capture as many as I desired. But on one occasion something occurred which made me respect them. I had caught a fine pair of birds and was returning home with a friend. When we left the forest, thousands of crows had gathered making a frightful racket. In a few minutes they rose in pursuit and soon enveloped us. The fun lasted until all of a sudden I received a blow on the back of my head which knocked me down. Then they attacked me viciously. I was compelled to release the two birds and was glad to join my friend who had taken refuge in a cave. In the schoolroom there were a few mechanical models which interested me and turned my attention to water turbines. I constructed many of these and found great pleasure in operating them.

How extraordinary was my life an incident may illustrate. My uncle had no use for this kind of pastime and more than once rebuked me. I was fascinated by a description of Niagara Falls I had perused, and pictured in my imagination a big wheel run by the Falls. I told my uncle that I would go to America and carry out this scheme. Thirty years later I saw my ideas carried out at Niagara and marveled at the unfathomable mystery of the mind. **I made all kinds of other contrivances and contraptions but among these the arbalists I produced were the best. My arrows, when shot, disappeared from sight and at close range traversed a plank of pine one inch thick.** Thru the continuous tightening of the bows I developed skin on my stomach very much like that of a crocodile and I am often wondering whether it is due to this exercise that I am able even now to digest cobble-stones! Nor can I pass in silence my performances with the sling which would have enabled me to give a stunning exhibit at the Hippodrome. And now I will tell of one of my feats with this antique implement of war which will strain to the utmost the credulity of the reader. I was practicing while walking with my uncle along the river. The sun was setting, the trout were playful and from time to time one would shoot up into the air, its glistening body sharply defined against a projecting rock beyond. Of course any boy might have hit a fish under these propitious conditions but I undertook a much more difficult task and I foretold to my uncle, to the minutest detail, what I intended doing. I was to hurl a stone to meet the fish, press its body against the rock, and cut it in two. It was no sooner said than done. My uncle looked at me almost scared out of his wits and exclaimed \"Vade retro Satanas!\" and it was a few days before he spoke to me again. Other records, how ever great, will be eclipsed but I feel that I could peacefully rest on my laurels for a thousand years. **III.

My Later Endeavors** The Discovery of the Rotating Magnetic Field At the age of ten I entered the Real Gymnasium which was a new and fairly well equipt institution. In the department of physics were various models of classical scientific apparatus, electrical and mechanical. The demonstrations and experiments performed from time to time by the instructors fascinated me and were undoubtedly a powerful incentive to invention. I was also passionately fond of mathematical studies and often won the professor's praise for rapid calculation. This was due to my acquired facility of visualizing the figures and performing the operations, not in the usual intuitive manner, but as in actual life. **Up to a certain degree of complexity it was absolutely the same to me whether I wrote the symbols on the board or conjured them before my mental vision. But freehand drawing, to which many hours of the course were devoted, was an annoyance I could not endure. This was rather remarkable as most of the members of the family excelled in it. Perhaps my aversion was simply due to the predilection I found in undisturbed thought. Had it not been for a few exceptionally stupid boys, who could not do anything at all, my record would have been the worst.** It was a serious handicap as under the then existing educational regime, drawing being obligatory, this deficiency threatened to spoil my whole career and my father had considerable trouble in railroading me from one class to another. In the second year at that institution I became obsessed with the idea of producing continuous motion thru steady air pressure. The pump incident, of which I have told, had set afire my youthful imagination and imprest me with the boundless abilities of a vacuum. I grew frantic in my desire to harness this inexhaustible energy but for a long time I was groping in the dark. Finally, however, my endeavors crystallized in an invention which was to enable me to achieve what no other mortal ever attempted. Imagine a cylinder freely rotatable on two bearings and partly surrounded by a rectangular trough which fits it perfectly. The open side of the trough is closed by a partition so that the cylindrical segment within the enclosure divides the latter into two compartments entirely separated from each other by air-tight sliding joints. One of these compartments being sealed and once for all exhausted, the other remaining open, a perpetual rotation of the cylinder would result, at least, I thought so. A wooden model was constructed and fitted with infinite care and when I applied the pump on one side and actually observed that there was a tendency to turning, I was delirious with joy.

A wooden model was constructed and fitted with infinite care and when I applied the pump on one side and actually observed that there was a tendency to turning, I was delirious with joy. Mechanical flight was the one thing I wanted to accomplish altho still under the discouraging recollection of a bad fall I sustained by jumping with an umbrella from the top of a building. Every day I used to transport myself thru the air to distant regions but could not understand just how I managed to do it. Now I had something concrete-a flying machine with nothing more than a rotating shaft, flapping wings, and-a vacuum of unlimited power! From that time on I made my daily aerial excursions in a vehicle of comfort and luxury as might have befitted King Solomon. It took years before I understood that the atmospheric pressure acted at right angles to the surface of the cylinder and that the slight rotary effort I observed was due to a leak. Tho this knowledge came gradually it gave me a painful shock. **I had hardly completed my course at the Real Gymnasium when I was prostrated with a dangerous illness or rather, a score of them, and my condition became so desperate that I was given up by physicians.** During this period I was permitted to read constantly, obtaining books from the Public Library which had been neglected and entrusted to me for classification of the works and preparation of the catalogues. One day I was handed a few volumes of new literature unlike anything I had ever read before and so captivating as to make me utterly forget my hopeless state. They were the earlier works of Mark Twain and to them might have been due the miraculous recovery which followed. Twenty-five years later, when I met Mr. Clemens and we formed a friendship between us, I told him of the experience and was amazed to see that great man of laughter burst into tears. My studies were continued at the higher Real Gymnasium in Carlstadt, Croatia, where one of my aunts resided. She was a distinguished lady, the wife of a Colonel who was an old war-horse having participated in many battles. I never can forget the three years I past at their home. No fortress in time of war was under a more rigid discipline. I was fed like a canary bird. All the meals were of the highest quality and deliciously prepared but short in quantity by a thousand percent. The slices of ham cut by my aunt were like tissue paper.

When the Colonel would put something substantial on my plate she would snatch it away and say excitedly to him: \"Be careful, Niko is very delicate.\" I had a voracious appetite and suffered like Tantalus. But** I lived in an atmosphere of refinement and artistic taste quite unusual for those times and conditions. The land was low and marshy and malaria fever never left me while there despite of the enormous amounts of quinin I consumed.** Occasionally the river would rise and drive an army of rats into the buildings, devouring everything even to the bundles of the fierce paprika. These pests were to me a welcome diversion. I thinned their ranks by all sorts of means, which won me the unenviable distinction of rat-catcher in the community. At last, however, my course was completed, the misery ended, and I obtained the certificate of maturity which brought me to the cross-roads. During all those years my parents never wavered in their resolve to make me embrace the clergy, the mere thought of which filled me with dread. I had become intensely interested in electricity under the stimulating influence of my Professor of Physics, who was an ingenious man and often demonstrated the principles by apparatus of his own invention. Among these I recall a device in the shape of a freely rotatable bulb, with tinfoil coatings, which was made to spin rapidly when connected to a static machine. It is impossible for me to convey an adequate idea of the intensity of feeling I experienced in witnessing his exhibitions of these mysterious phenomena. Every impression produced a thousand echoes in my mind. I wanted to know more of this wonderful force; I longed for experiment and investigation and resigned myself to the inevitable with aching heart. Just as I was making ready for the long journey home I received word that my father wished me to go on a shooting expedition. It was a strange request as he had been always strenuously opposed to this kind of sport. But a few days later I learned that the cholera was raging in that district and, taking advantage of an opportunity, I returned to Gospic in disregard of my parents' wishes.

It is incredible how absolutely ignorant people were as to the causes of this scourge which visited the country in intervals of from fifteen to twenty years. They thought that the deadly agents were transmitted thru the air and filled it with pungent odors and smoke. In the meantime they drank the infected water and died in heaps. I contracted the awful disease on the very day of my arrival and altho surviving the crisis, I was confined to bed for nine months with scarcely any ability to move. My energy was completely exhausted and for the second time I found myself at death's door. In one of the sinking spells which was thought to be the last, my father rushed into the room. I still see his pallid face as he tried to cheer me in tones belying his assurance. \"Perhaps,\" I said, \"I may get well if you will let me study engineering.\" \"You will go to the best technical institution in the world,\" he solemnly replied, and I knew that he meant it. A heavy weight was lifted from my mind but the relief would have come too late had it not been for a marvelous cure brought about thru a bitter decoction of a peculiar bean. I came to life like another Lazarus to the utter amazement of everybody. **My father insisted that I spend a year in healthful physical outdoor exercises to which I reluctantly consented. For most of this term I roamed in the mountains, loaded with a hunter's outfit and a bundle of books, and this contact with nature made me stronger in body as well as in mind.** I thought and planned, and conceived many ideas almost as a rule delusive. The vision was clear enough but the knowledge of principles was very limited. In one of my inventions I proposed to convey letters and packages across the seas, thru a submarine tube, in spherical containers of sufficient strength to resist the hydraulic pressure. The pumping plant, intended to force the water thru the tube, was accurately figured and designed and all other particulars carefully worked out. Only one trifling detail, of no consequence, was lightly dismist. I assumed an arbitrary velocity of the water and, what is more, took pleasure in making it high, thus arriving at a stupendous performance supported by faultless calculations. Subsequent reflections, however, on the resistance of pipes to fluid flow determined me to make this invention public property.

Another one of my projects was to construct a ring around the equator which would, of course, float freely and could be arrested in its spinning motion by reactionary forces, thus enabling travel at a rate of about one thousand miles an hour, impracticable by rail. The reader will smile. The plan was difficult of execution, I will admit, but not nearly so bad as that of a well-known New York professor, who wanted to pump the air from the torrid to the temperate zones, entirely forgetful of the fact that the Lord had provided a gigantic machine for this very purpose. Still another scheme, far more important and attractive, was to derive power from the rotational energy of terrestrial bodies. I had discovered that objects on the earth's surface, owing to the diurnal rotation of the globe, are carried by the same alternately in and against the direction of translatory movement. From this results a great change in momentum which could be utilized in the simplest imaginable manner to furnish motive effort in any habitable region of the world. I cannot find words to describe my disappointment when later I realized that I was in the predicament of Archimedes, who vainly sought for a fixt point in the universe. At the termination of my vacation I was sent to the Polytechnic School in Gratz, Styria, which my father had chosen as one of the oldest and best reputed institutions. That was the moment I had eagerly awaited and I began my studies under good auspices and firmly resolved to succeed. My previous training was above the average, due to my father's teaching and opportunities afforded.** I had acquired the knowledge of a number of languages and waded thru the books of several libraries, picking up information more or less useful. **Then again, for the first time, I could choose my subjects as I liked, and free-hand drawing was to bother me no more. **I had made up my mind to give my parents a surprise, and during the whole first year I regularly started my work at three o'clock in the morning and continued until eleven at night, no Sundays or holidays excepted.

That almost killed my ambition; but later, after he had died, I was pained to find a package of letters which the professors had written him to the effect that unless he took me away from the Institution I would be killed thru overwork. ** **Thereafter I devoted myself chiefly to physics, mechanics and mathematical studies, spending the hours of leisure in the libraries. I had a veritable mania for finishing whatever I began, which often got me into difficulties. On one occasion I started to read the works of Voltaire when I learned, to my dismay, that there were close on one hundred large volumes in small print which that monster had written while drinking seventy-two cups of black coffee per diem. It had to be done, but when I laid aside the last book I was very glad, and said, \"Never more!\" ** My first year's showing had won me the appreciation and friendship of several professors. Among these were Prof. Rogner, who was teaching arithmetical subjects and geometry; Prof. Poeschl, who held the chair of theoretical and experimental physics, and Dr. Alle, who taught integral calculus and specialized in differential equations. This scientist was the most brilliant lecturer to whom I ever listened. He took a special interest in my progress and would frequently remain for an hour or two in the lecture room, giving me problems to solve, in which I delighted. To him I explained a flying machine I had conceived, not an illusionary invention, but one based on sound, scientific principles, which has become realizable thru my turbine and will soon be given to the world. Both Professors Rogner and Poeschl were curious men. The former had peculiar ways of expressing himself and whenever he did so there was a riot, followed by a long and embarrassing pause. Prof. Poeschl was a methodical and thoroly grounded German. He had enormous feet and hands like the paws of a bear, but all of his experiments were skillfully performed with lock-like precision and without a miss. It was in the second year of my studies that we received a Gramme dynamo from Paris, having the horseshoe form of a laminated field magnet, and a wire-wound armature with a commutator. It was connected up and various effects of the currents were shown.

It was connected up and various effects of the currents were shown. While Prof. Poeschl was making demonstrations, running the machine as a motor, the brushes gave trouble, sparking badly, and I observed that it might be possible to operate a motor without these appliances. But he declared that it could not be done and did me the honor of delivering a lecture on the subject, at the conclusion of which he remarked: \"Mr. Tesla may accomplish great things, but he certainly never will do this. It would be equivalent to converting a steadily pulling force, like that of gravity, into a rotary effort. It is a perpetual motion scheme, an impossible idea.\" But instinct is something which transcends knowledge. We have, undoubtedly, certain finer fibers that enable us to perceive truths when logical deduction, or any other willful effort of the brain, is futile. For a time I wavered, imprest by the professor's authority, but soon became convinced I was right and undertook the task with all the fire and boundless confidence of youth. I started by first picturing in my mind a direct-current machine, running it and following the changing flow of the currents in the armature. Then I would imagine an alternator and investigate the processes taking place in a similar manner. Next I would visualize systems comprising motors and generators and operate them in various ways. The images I saw were to me perfectly real and tangible. All my remaining term in Gratz was passed in intense but fruitless efforts of this kind, and I almost came to the conclusion that the problem was insolvable. In 1880 I went to Prague, Bohemia, carrying out my father's wish to complete my education at the University there. It was in that city that I made a decided advance, which consisted in detaching the commutator from the machine and studying the phenomena in this new aspect, but still without result. In the year following there was a sudden change in my views of life.** I realized that my parents had been making too great sacrifices on my account and resolved to relieve them of the burden. The wave of the American telephone had just reached the European continent and the system was to be installed in Budapest, Hungary. It appeared an ideal opportunity, all the more as a friend of our family was at the head of the enterprise.

It appeared an ideal opportunity, all the more as a friend of our family was at the head of the enterprise. It was here that I suffered the complete breakdown of the nerves to which I have referred. ** What I experienced during the period of that illness surpasses all belief. My sight and hearing were always extraordinary. I could clearly discern objects in the distance when others saw no trace of them. Several times in my boyhood I saved the houses of our neighbors from fire by hearing the faint crackling sounds which did not disturb their sleep, and calling for help. In 1899, when I was past forty and carrying on my experiments in Colorado, I could hear very distinctly thunderclaps at a distance of 550 miles. The limit of audition for my young assistants was scarcely more than 150 miles. My ear was thus over thirteen times more sensitive. Yet at that time I was, so to speak, stone deaf in comparison with the acuteness of my hearing while under the nervous strain. In Budapest I could hear the ticking of a watch with three rooms between me and the time-piece. **A fly alighting on a table in the room would cause a dull thud in my ear. A carriage passing at a distance of a few miles fairly shook my whole body. The whistle of a locomotive twenty or thirty miles away made the bench or chair on which I sat vibrate so strongly that the pain was unbearable.** The ground under my feet trembled continuously. I had to support my bed on rubber cushions to get any rest at all. The roaring noises from near and far often produced the effect of spoken words which would have frightened me had I not been able to resolve them into their accidental components. The sun's rays, when periodically intercepted, would cause blows of such force on my brain that they would stun me. I had to summon all my will power to pass under a bridge or other structure as I experienced a crushing pressure on the skull. In the dark I had the sense of a bat and could detect the presence of an object at a distance of twelve feet by a peculiar creepy sensation on the forehead. My pulse varied from a few to two hundred and sixty beats and all the tissues of the body quivered with twitchings and tremors which was perhaps the hardest to bear. A renowned physician who gave me daily large doses of Bromide of Potassium pronounced my malady unique and incurable.

A renowned physician who gave me daily large doses of Bromide of Potassium pronounced my malady unique and incurable. It is my eternal regret that I was not under the observation of experts in physiology and psychology at that time. **I clung desperately to life, but never expected to recover. Can anyone believe that so hopeless a physical wreck could ever be transformed into a man of astonishing strength and tenacity, able to work thirty-eight years almost without a day's interruption, and find himself still strong and fresh in body and mind? Such is my case. A powerful desire to live and to continue the work, and the assistance of a devoted friend and athlete accomplished the wonder. My health returned and with it the vigor of mind.** In attacking the problem again I almost regretted that the struggle was soon to end. I had so much energy to spare. **When I undertook the task it was not with a resolve such as men often make. With me it was a sacred vow, a question of life and death. I knew that I would perish if I failed.** Now I felt that the battle was won. Back in the deep recesses of the brain was the solution, but I could not yet give it outward expression. **One afternoon, which is ever present in my recollection, I was enjoying a walk with my friend in the City Park and reciting poetry. At that age I knew entire books by heart, word for word. One of these was Goethe's \"Faust.\"** The sun was just setting and reminded me of the glorious passage: \"Sie ruckt und weicht, der Tag ist uberlebt, Dort eilt sie hin und fordert neues Leben. Oh, dass kein Flugel mich vom Boden hebt Ihr nach und immer nach zu streben! Ein schoner Traum indessen sie entweicht, Ach, zu des Geistes Flugeln wird so leicht Kein korperlicher Flugel sich gesellen!\" [The glow retreats, done is the day of toil; It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring; Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil upon its track to follow, follow soaring! A glorious dream! though now the glories fade. Alas! The wings that lift the mind no aid Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me.] **As I uttered these inspiring words the idea came like a flash of lightning and in an instant the truth was revealed.

I drew with a stick on the sand the diagrams shown six years later in my address before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and my companion understood them perfectly. The images I saw were wonderfully sharp and clear and had the solidity of metal and stone, so much so that I told him: \"See my motor here; watch me reverse it.\" I cannot begin to describe my emotions. Pygmalion seeing his statue come to life could not have been more deeply moved. A thousand secrets of nature which I might have stumbled upon accidentally I would have given for that one which I had wrested from her against all odds and at the peril of my existence. ** **IV. The Discovery of the Tesla Coil and Transformer** For a while I gave myself up entirely to the intense enjoyment of picturing machines and devising new forms. It was a mental state of happiness about as complete as I have ever known in life. Ideas came in an uninterrupted stream and the only difficulty I had was to hold them fast. The pieces of apparatus I conceived were to me absolutely real and tangible in every detail, even to the minute marks and signs of wear. I delighted in imagining the motors constantly running, for in this way they presented to mind's eye a more fascinating sight. **When natural inclination develops into a passionate desire, one advances towards his goal in seven-league boots. In less than two months I evolved virtually all the types of motors and modifications of the system which are now identified with my name.** It was, perhaps, providential that the necessities of existence commanded a temporary halt to this consuming activity of the mind. I came to Budapest prompted by a premature report concerning the telephone enterprise and, as irony of fate willed it, I had to accept a position as draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office of the Hungarian Government at a salary which I deem it my privilege not to disclose! Fortunately, I soon won the interest of the Inspector-in-Chief and was thereafter employed on calculations, designs and estimates in connection with new installations, until the Telephone Exchange was started, when I took charge of the same. The knowledge and practical experience I gained in the course of this work was most valuable and the employment gave me ample opportunities for the exercise of my inventive faculties.

I made several improvements in the Central Station apparatus and perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier which was never patented or publicly described but would be creditable to me even today. **In recognition of my efficient assistance the organizer of the undertaking, Mr. Puskas, upon disposing of his business in Budapest, offered me a position in Paris which I gladly accepted. ** I never can forget the deep impression that magic city produced on my mind. For several days after my arrival I roamed thru the streets in utter bewilderment of the new spectacle. The attractions were many and irresistible, but, alas, the income was spent as soon as received. When Mr. Puskas asked me how I was getting along in the new sphere, I described the situation accurately in the statement that \"the last twenty-nine days of the month are the toughest!\" I led a rather strenuous life in what would now be termed \"Rooseveltian fashion.\" Every morning, regardless of weather, I would go from the Boulevard St. Marcel, where I resided, to a bathing house on the Seine, plunge into the water, loop the circuit twenty-seven times and then walk an hour to reach Ivry, where the Company's factory was located. There I would have a woodchopper's breakfast at half-past seven o'clock and then eagerly await the lunch hour, in the meanwhile cracking hard nuts for the Manager of the Works, Mr. Charles Batchellor, who was an intimate friend and assistant of Edison. **Here I was thrown in contact with a few Americans who fairly fell in love with me because of my proficiency in billiards. To these men I explained my invention and one of them, Mr. D. Cunningham, Foreman of the Mechanical Department, offered to form a stock company.** The proposal seemed to me comical in the extreme. I did not have the faintest conception of what that meant except that it was an American way of doing things. Nothing came of it, however, and during the next few months I had to travel from one to another place in France and Germany to cure the ills of the power plants. On my return to Paris I submitted to one of the administrators of the Company, Mr. Rau, a plan for improving their dynamos and was given an opportunity. My success was complete and the delighted directors accorded me the privilege of developing automatic regulators which were much desired.

My success was complete and the delighted directors accorded me the privilege of developing automatic regulators which were much desired. Shortly after there was some trouble with the lighting plant which had been installed at the new railroad station in Strassburg, Alsace. The wiring was defective and on the occasion of the opening ceremonies a large part of a wall was blown out thru a short-circuit right in the presence of old Emperor William I. The German Government refused to take the plant and the French Company was facing a serious loss. On account of my knowledge of the German language and past experience, I was entrusted with the difficult task of straightening out matters and early in 1883 I went to Strassburg on that mission. Some of the incidents in that city have left an indelible record on my memory. By a curious coincidence, a number of men who subsequently achieved fame, lived there about that time. In later life I used to say, \"There were bacteria of greatness in that old town. Others caught the disease but I escaped!\" The practical work, correspondence, and conferences with officials kept me preoccupied day and night, but, as soon as I was able to manage I undertook the construction of a simple motor in a mechanical shop opposite the railroad station, having brought with me from Paris some material for that purpose. **The consummation of the experiment was, however, delayed until the summer of that year when I finally had the satisfaction of seeing rotation effected by alternating currents of different phase, and without sliding contacts or commutator, as I had conceived a year before. It was an exquisite pleasure but not to compare with the delirium of joy following the first revelation. ** Among my new friends was the former Mayor of the city, Mr. Bauzin, whom I had already in a measure acquainted with this and other inventions of mine and whose support I endeavored to enlist. He was sincerely devoted to me and put my project before several wealthy persons but, to my mortification, found no response. He wanted to help me in every possible way and the approach of the first of July, 1919, happens to remind me of a form of \"assistance\" I received from that charming man, which was not financial but none the less appreciated. In 1870, when the Germans invaded the country, Mr. Bauzin had buried a good sized allotment of St. Estephe of 1801 and he came to the conclusion that he knew no worthier person than myself to consume that precious beverage.

This, I may say, is one of the unforgettable incidents to which I have referred. My friend urged me to return to Paris as soon as possible and seek support there. This I was anxious to do but my work and negotiations were protracted owing to all sorts of petty obstacles I encountered so that at times the situation seemed hopeless. Just to give an idea of German thoroness and \"efficiency,\" I may mention here a rather funny experience. An incandescent lamp of 16 c.p. was to be placed in a hallway and upon selecting the proper location I ordered the monteur to run the wires. After working for a while he concluded that the engineer had to be consulted and this was done. The latter made several objections but ultimately agreed that the lamp should be placed two inches from the spot I had assigned, whereupon the work proceeded. Then the engineer became worried and told me that Inspector Averdeck should be notified. That important person called, investigated, debated, and decided that the lamp should be shifted back two inches, which was the place I had marked. It was not long, however, before Averdeck got cold feet himself and advised me that he had informed Ober-Inspector Hieronimus of the matter and that I should await his decision. It was several days before the Ober-Inspector was able to free himself of other pressing duties but at last he arrived and a two-hour debate followed, when he decided to move the lamp two inches farther. My hopes that this was the final act were shattered when the Ober-Inspector returned and said to me: \"Regierungsrath Funke is so particular that I would not dare to give an order for placing this lamp without his explicit approval.\" Accordingly arrangements for a visit from that great man were made. We started cleaning up and polishing early in the morning. Everybody brushed up, I put on my gloves and when Funke came with his retinue he was ceremoniously received. After two hours' deliberation he suddenly exclaimed: \"I must be going,\" and pointing to a place on the ceiling, he ordered me to put the lamp there. It was the exact spot which I had originally chosen. So it went day after day with variations, but I was determined to achieve at whatever cost and in the end my efforts were rewarded.

By the spring of 1884 all the differences were adjusted, the plant formally accepted, and I returned to Paris with pleasing anticipations. One of the administrators had promised me a liberal compensation in case I succeeded, as well as a fair consideration of the improvements I had made in their dynamos and I hoped to realize a substantial sum. There were three administrators whom I shall designate as A, B and C for convenience. When I called on A he told me that B had the say. This gentleman thought that only C could decide and the latter was quite sure that A alone had the power to act. After several laps of this circulus vivios it dawned upon me that my reward was a castle in Spain. **The utter failure of my attempts to raise capital for development was another disappointment and when Mr. Batchellor prest me to go to America with a view of redesigning the Edison machines, I determined to try my fortunes in the Land of Golden Promise. ** But the chance was nearly mist. I liquefied my modest assets, secured accommodations and found myself at the railroad station as the train was pulling out. At that moment I discovered that my money and tickets were gone. What to do was the question. Hercules had plenty of time to deliberate but I had to decide while running alongside the train with opposite feelings surging in my brain like condenser oscillations. Resolve, helped by dexterity, won out in the nick of time and upon passing thru the usual experiences, as trivial as unpleasant, I managed to embark for New York with the remnants of my belongings, some poems and articles I had written, and a package of calculations relating to solutions of an unsolvable integral and to my flying machine. During the voyage I sat most of the time at the stern of the ship watching for an opportunity to save somebody from a watery grave, without the slightest thought of danger. Later when I had absorbed some of the practical American sense I shivered at the recollection and marvelled at my former folly. **I wish that I could put in words my first impressions of this country.

What I had left was beautiful, artistic and fascinating in every way; what I saw here was machined, rough and unattractive.** A burly policeman was twirling his stick which looked to me as big as a log. I approached him politely with the request to direct me. \"Six blocks down, then to the left,\" he said, with murder in his eyes. \"Is this America?\" I asked myself in painful surprise. \"It is a century behind Europe in civilization.\" When I went abroad in 1889 - five years having elapsed since my arrival here - I became convinced that it was more than one hundred years AHEAD of Europe and nothing has happened to this day to change my opinion. **The meeting with Edison was a memorable event in my life. I was amazed at this wonderful man who, without early advantages and scientific training, had accomplished so much. I had studied a dozen languages, delved in literature and art, and had spent my best years in libraries reading all sorts of stuff that fell into my hands, from Newton's \"Principia\" to the novels of Paul de Kock, and felt that most of my life had been squandered. But it did not take long before I recognized that it was the best thing I could have done. Within a few weeks I had won Edison's confidence and it came about in this way. ** The S.S. Oregon, the fastest passenger steamer at that time, had both of its lighting machines disabled and its sailing was delayed. As the superstructure had been built after their installation it was impossible to remove them from the hold. The predicament was a serious one and Edison was much annoyed. In the evening I took the necessary instruments with me and went aboard the vessel where I stayed for the night. The dynamos were in bad condition, having several short-circuits and breaks, but with the assistance of the crew I succeeded in putting them in good shape. **At five o'clock in the morning, when passing along Fifth Avenue on my way to the shop, I met Edison with Batchellor and a few others as they were returning home to retire. \"Here is our Parisian running around at night,\" he said.

But when he had gone some distance I heard him remark: \"Batchellor, this is a d-n good man,\" and from that time on I had full freedom in directing the work. ** **For nearly a year my regular hours were from 10.30 A.M. until 5 o'clock the next morning without a day's exception. Edison said to me: \"I have had many hard-working assistants but you take the cake.\" During this period I designed twenty-four different types of standard machines with short cores and of uniform pattern which replaced the old ones. The Manager had promised me fifty thousand dollars on the completion of this task but it turned out to be a practical joke. This gave me a painful shock and I resigned my position.** **Immediately thereafter some people approached me with the proposal of forming an arc light company under my name, to which I agreed. Here finally was an opportunity to develop the motor, but when I broached the subject to my new associates they said: \"No, we want the arc lamp. We don't care for this alternating current of yours.\"** In 1886 my system of arc lighting was perfected and adopted for factory and municipal lighting, and I was free, but with no other possession than a beautifully engraved certificate of stock of hypothetical value. Then followed a period of struggle in the new medium for which I was not fitted, but the reward came in the end and in April, 1887, the Tesla Electric Company was organized, providing a laboratory and facilities. The motors I built there were exactly as I had imagined them. I made no attempt to improve the design, but merely reproduced the pictures as they appeared to my vision and the operation was always as I expected. In the early part of 1888 an arrangement was made with the Westinghouse Company for the manufacture of the motors on a large scale. But great difficulties had still to be overcome. My system was based on the use of low frequency currents and the Westinghouse experts had adopted 133 cycles with the object of securing advantages in the transformation. They did not want to depart from their standard forms of apparatus and my efforts had to be concentrated upon adapting the motor to these conditions. Another necessity was to produce a motor capable of running efficiently at this frequency on two wires which was not easy of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt:36:f14e32a6817d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9520, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography", "chunk_index": 37, "text": "still to be overcome.

Another necessity was to produce a motor capable of running efficiently at this frequency on two wires which was not easy of accomplishment. At the close of 1889, however, my services in Pittsburg being no longer essential, I returned to New York and resumed experimental work in a laboratory on Grand Street, where I began immediately the design of high frequency machines. The problems of construction in this unexplored field were novel and quite peculiar and I encountered many difficulties. I rejected the inductor type, fearing that it might not yield perfect sine waves which were so important to resonant action. Had it not been for this I could have saved myself a great deal of labor. Another discouraging feature of the high frequency alternator seemed to be the inconstancy of speed which threatened to impose serious limitations to its use. I had already noted in my demonstrations before the American Institution of Electrical Engineers that several times the tune was lost, necessitating readjustment, and did not yet foresee, what I discovered long afterwards, a means of operating a machine of this kind at a speed constant to such a degree as not to vary more than a small fraction of one revolution between the extremes of load. From many other considerations it appeared desirable to invent a simpler device for the production of electric oscillations. **In 1856 Lord Kelvin had exposed the theory of the condenser discharge, but no practical application of that important knowledge was made. I saw the possibilities and undertook the development of induction apparatus on this principle. My progress was so rapid as to enable me to exhibit at my lecture in 1891 a coil giving sparks of five inches. ** On that occasion I frankly told the engineers of a defect involved in the transformation by the new method, namely, the loss in the spark gap. Subsequent investigation showed that no matter what medium is employed, be it air, hydrogen, mercury vapor, oil or a stream of electrons, the efficiency is the same. It is a law very much like that governing the conversion of mechanical energy. We may drop a weight from a certain height vertically down or carry it to the lower level along any devious path, it is immaterial insofar as the amount of work is concerned. **Fortunately however, this drawback is not fatal as by proper proportioning of the resonant circuits an efficiency of 85 per cent is attainable. Since my early announcement of the invention it has come into universal use", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt:37:096e81c5828b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9521, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography", "chunk_index": 38, "text": "law very much like that governing the conversion of mechanical energy.

Since my early announcement of the invention it has come into universal use and wrought a revolution in many departments. But a still greater future awaits it. When in 1900 I obtained powerful discharges of 100 feet and flashed a current around the globe, I was reminded of the first tiny spark I observed in my Grand Street laboratory and was thrilled by sensations akin to those I felt when I discovered the rotating magnetic field. ** **V. The Magnifying Transmitter** As I review the events of my past life I realize how subtle are the influences that shape our destinies. An incident of my youth may serve to illustrate. One winter's day I managed to climb a steep mountain, in company with other boys. The snow was quite deep and a warm southerly wind made it just suitable for our purpose. We amused ourselves by throwing balls which would roll down a certain distance, gathering more or less snow, and we tried to outdo one another in this exciting sport. Suddenly a ball was seen to go beyond the limit, swelling to enormous proportions until it became as big as a house and plunged thundering into the valley below with a force that made the ground tremble. I looked on spellbound, incapable of understanding what had happened. For weeks afterward the picture of the avalanche was before my eyes and I wondered how anything so small could grow to such an immense size. Ever since that time the magnification of feeble actions fascinated me, and when, years later, I took up the experimental study of mechanical and electrical resonance, I was keenly interested from the very start. Possibly, had it not been for that early powerful impression, I might not have followed up the little spark I obtained with my coil and never developed my best invention, the true history of which I'll tell here for the first time. \"Lionhunters\" have often asked me which of my discoveries I prize most. This depends on the point of view. Not a few technical men, very able in their special departments, but dominated by a pedantic spirit and nearsighted, have asserted that excepting the induction motor I have given to the world little of practical use. This is a grievous mistake. A new idea must not be judged by its immediate results. My alternating system of power transmission came at a psychological moment, as a long-sought answer to pressing industrial questions, and altho considerable", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt:38:84d435a862af", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9522, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "depends on the point of view.

My alternating system of power transmission came at a psychological moment, as a long-sought answer to pressing industrial questions, and altho considerable resistance had to be overcome and opposing interests reconciled, as usual, the commercial introduction could not be long delayed. Now, compare this situation with that confronting my turbine, for example. One should think that so simple and beautiful an invention, possessing many features of an ideal motor, should be adopted at once and, undoubtedly, it would under similar conditions. But the prospective effect of the rotating field was not to render worthless existing machinery; on the contrary, it was to give it additional value. The system lent itself to new enterprise as well as to improvement of the old. My turbine is an advance of a character entirely different. It is a radical departure in the sense that its success would mean the abandonment of the antiquated types of prime movers on which billions of dollars have been spent. Under such circumstances the progress must needs be slow and perhaps the greatest impediment is encountered in the prejudicial opinions created in the minds of experts by organized opposition. Only the other day I had a disheartening experience when I met my friend and former assistant, Charles F. Scott, now professor of Electrical Engineering at Yale. I had not seen him for a long time and was glad to have an opportunity for a little chat at my office. Our conversation naturally enough drifted on my turbine and I became heated to a high degree. \"Scott,\" I exclaimed, carried away by the vision of a glorious future, \"my turbine will scrap all the heat engines in the world.\" Scott stroked his chin and looked away thoughtfully, as though making a mental calculation. \"That will make quite a pile of scrap,\" he said, and left without another word! These and other inventions of mine, however, were nothing more than steps forward in certain directions. In evolving them I simply followed the inborn sense to improve the present devices without any special thought of our far more imperative necessities. **The \"Magnifying Transmitter\" was the product of labors extending through years, having for their chief object the solution of problems which are infinitely more important to mankind than mere industrial development.** **If my memory serves me right, it was in November, 1890, that I performed a laboratory experiment which was one of the most extraordinary and spectacular ever recorded in the annals of science.

In investigating the behaviour of high frequency currents I had satisfied myself that an electric field of sufficient intensity could be produced in a room to light up electrodeless vacuum tubes. Accordingly, a transformer was built to test the theory and the first trial proved a marvelous success. ** It is difficult to appreciate what those strange phenomena meant at that time. We crave for new sensations but soon become indifferent to them. The wonders of yesterday are today common occurrences. When my tubes were first publicly exhibited they were viewed with amazement impossible to describe. From all parts of the world I received urgent invitations and numerous honors and other flattering inducements were offered to me, which I declined. But in 1892 the demands became irresistible and I went to London where I delivered a lecture before the Institution of Electrical Engineers. It had been my intention to leave immediately for Paris in compliance with a similar obligation, but Sir James Dewar insisted on my appearing before the Royal Institution. I was a man of firm resolve but succumbed easily to the forceful arguments of the great Scotsman. He pushed me into a chair and poured out half a glass of a wonderful brown fluid which sparkled in all sorts of iridescent colors and tasted like nectar. \"Now,\" said he. \"you are sitting in Faraday's chair and you are enjoying whiskey he used to drink.\" In both aspects it was an enviable experience. The next evening I gave a demonstration before that Institution, at the termination of which Lord Rayleigh addressed the audience and his generous words gave me the first start in these endeavors. I fled from London and later from Paris to escape favors showered upon me, and journeyed to my home where I passed through a most painful ordeal and illness. Upon regaining my health I began to formulate plans for the resumption of work in America. Up to that time I never realized that I possessed any particular gift of discovery but Lord Rayleigh, whom I always considered as an ideal man of science, had said so and if that was the case I felt that I should concentrate on some big idea. One day, as I was roaming in the mountains, I sought shelter from an approaching storm.

One day, as I was roaming in the mountains, I sought shelter from an approaching storm. The sky became overhung with heavy clouds but somehow the rain was delayed until, all of a sudden, there was a lightning flash and a few moments after a deluge. This observation set me thinking. It was manifest that the two phenomena were closely related, as cause and effect, and a little reflection led me to the conclusion that the electrical energy involved in the precipitation of the water was inconsiderable, the function of lightning being much like that of a sensitive trigger. Here was a stupendous possibility of achievement. If we could produce electric effects of the required quality, this whole planet and the conditions of existence on it could be transformed. The sun raises the water of the oceans and winds drive it to distant regions where it remains in a state of most delicate balance. If it were in our power to upset it when and wherever desired, this mighty life-sustaining stream could be at will controlled. We could irrigate arid deserts, create lakes and rivers and provide motive power in unlimited amounts. This would be the most efficient way of harnessing the sun to the uses of man. The consummation depended on our ability to develop electric forces of the order of those in nature. It seemed a hopeless undertaking, but I made up my mind to try it and immediately on my return to the United States, in the Summer of 1892, work was begun which was to me all the more attractive, because a means of the same kind was necessary for the successful transmission of energy without wires. **The first gratifying result was obtained in the spring of the succeeding year when I reached tensions of about 1,000,000 volts with my conical coil. That was not much in the light of the present art, but it was then considered a feat. Steady progress was made until the destruction of my laboratory by fire in 1895,** as may be judged from an article by T. C. Martin which appeared in the April number of the Century Magazine. This calamity set me back in many ways and most of that year had to be devoted to planning and reconstruction. However, as soon as circumstances permitted, I returned to the task. Although I knew that higher electro-motive forces were attainable with apparatus of larger dimensions, I had an instinctive perception that the object could be accomplished by the proper design of a comparatively small and compact transformer.

Although I knew that higher electro-motive forces were attainable with apparatus of larger dimensions, I had an instinctive perception that the object could be accomplished by the proper design of a comparatively small and compact transformer. In carrying on tests with a secondary in the form of a flat spiral, as illustrated in my patents, the absence of streamers surprised me, and it was not long before I discovered that this was due to the position of the turns and their mutual action. Profiting from this observation I resorted to the use of a high tension conductor with turns of considerable diameter sufficiently separated to keep down the distributed capacity, while at the same time preventing undue accumulation of the charge at any point. The application of this principle enabled me to produce pressures of 4,000,000 volts, which was about the limit obtainable in my new laboratory at Houston Street, as the discharges extended through a distance of 16 feet. A photograph of this transmitter was published in the Electrical Review of November, 1898. **In order to advance further along this line I had to go into the open, and in the spring of 1899, having completed preparations for the erection of a wireless plant, I went to Colorado where I remained for more than one year. Here I introduced other improvements and refinements which made it possible to generate currents of any tension that may be desired.** Those who are interested will find some information in regard to the experiments I conducted there in my article, \"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\" in the Century Magazine of June, 1900, to which I have referred on a previous occasion. I have been asked by the ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER to be quite explicit on this subject so that my young friends among the readers of the magazine will clearly understand the construction and operation of my \"Magnifying Transmitter\" and the purposes for which it is intended. Well, then, in the first place, it is a resonant transformer with a secondary in which the parts, charged to a high potential, are of considerable area and arranged in space along ideal enveloping surfaces of very large radii of curvature, and at proper distances from one another thereby insuring a small electric surface density everywhere so that no leak can occur even if the conductor is bare. It is suitable for any frequency, from a few to many thousands of cycles per second, and can be used in the production of currents of tremendous volume and moderate pressure, or of smaller amperage and immense electromotive force. The maximum electric tension is merely dependent on the curvature of the surfaces on which the charged elements are situated", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt:42:6c99a90943a2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9526, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography", "chunk_index": 43, "text": "another thereby insuring a small electric surface density everywhere so that no leak can occur even if the conductor is bare. It is suitable for any frequency, from a few to many thousands of cycles per second, and can be used in the production of currents of tremendous volume and moderate pressure, or of smaller amperage and immense electromotive force. The maximum electric tension is merely dependent on the curvature of the surfaces on which the charged elements are situated and the area of the latter. **Judging from my past experience, as much as 100,000,000 volts are perfectly practicable. On the other hand currents of many thousands of amperes may be obtained in the antenna. A plant of but very moderate dimensions is required for such performances. Theoretically, a terminal of less than 90 feet in diameter is sufficient to develop an electromotive force of that magnitude while for antenna currents of from 2,000-4,000 amperes at the usual frequencies it need not be larger than 30 feet in diameter. ** In a more restricted meaning this wireless transmitter is one in which the Hertz-wave radiation is an entirely negligible quantity as compared with the whole energy, under which condition the damping factor is extremely small and an enormous charge is stored in the elevated capacity. Such a circuit may then be excited with impulses of any kind, even of low frequency and it will yield sinusoidal and continuous oscillations like those of an alternator. **Taken in the narrowest significance of the term, however, it is a resonant transformer which, besides possessing these qualities, is accurately proportioned to fit the globe and its electrical constants and properties, by virtue of which design it becomes highly efficient and effective in the wireless transmission of energy. Distance is then absolutely eliminated, there being no diminution in the intensity of the transmitted impulses. It is even possible to make the actions increase with the distance from the plant according to an exact mathematical law. ** This invention was one of a number comprised in my \"World-System\" of wireless transmission which I undertook to commercialize on my return to New York in 1900. As to the immediate purposes of my enterprise, they were clearly outlined in a technical statement of that period from which I quote: **\"The 'World-System' has resulted from a combination of several original discoveries made by the inventor in the course of long continued research and experimentation. It makes possible not only the instantaneous and precise wireless transmission of any kind of signals, messages or characters, to all parts of the world, but also the inter-connection of the existing telegraph, telephone, and other signal stations without any change in their present equipment.** By its means, for instance, a telephone subscriber here may call up and talk to any other subscriber on the Globe.

An inexpensive receiver, not bigger than a watch, will enable him to listen anywhere, on land or sea, to a speech delivered or music played in some other place, however distant. **These examples are cited merely to give an idea of the possibilities of this great scientific advance, which annihilates distance and makes that perfect natural conductor, the Earth, available for all the innumerable purposes which human ingenuity has found for a line-wire.** One far-reaching result of this is that any device capable of being operated thru one or more wires (at a distance obviously restricted) can likewise be actuated, without artificial conductors and with the same facility and accuracy, at distances to which there are no limits other than those imposed by the physical dimensions of the Globe. Thus, not only will entirely new fields for commercial exploitation be opened up by this ideal method of transmission but the old ones vastly extended. The 'World-System' is based on the application of the following important inventions and discoveries: The 'Tesla Transformer.' This apparatus is in the production of electrical vibrations as revolutionary as gunpowder was in warfare. Currents many times stronger than any ever generated in the usual ways, and sparks over one hundred feet long, have been produced by the inventor with an instrument of this kind. **The 'Magnifying Transmitter.' This is Tesla's best invention, a peculiar transformer specially adapted to excite the Earth, which is in the transmission of electrical energy what the telescope is in astronomical observation. By the use of this marvelous device he has already set up electrical movements of greater intensity than those of lightning and passed a current, sufficient to light more than two hundred incandescent lamps, around the Globe. ** ** The 'Tesla Wireless System.' This system comprises a number of improvements and is the only means known for transmitting economically electrical energy to a distance without wires. **Careful tests and measurements in connection with an experimental station of great activity, erected by the inventor in Colorado, have demonstrated that power in any desired amount can be conveyed, clear across the Globe if necessary, with a loss not exceeding a few per cent. The 'Art of Individualization.' This invention of Tesla's is to primitive 'tuning' what refined language is to unarticulated expression. It makes possible the transmission of signals or messages absolutely secret and exclusive both in the active and passive aspect, that is, non-interfering as well as non-interferable.

It makes possible the transmission of signals or messages absolutely secret and exclusive both in the active and passive aspect, that is, non-interfering as well as non-interferable. Each signal is like an individual of unmistakable identity and there is virtually no limit to the number of stations or instruments which can be simultaneously operated without the slightest mutual disturbance. 'The Terrestrial Stationary Waves.' This wonderful discovery, popularly explained, means that the Earth is responsive to electrical vibrations of definite pitch just as a tuning fork to certain waves of sound. These particular electrical vibrations, capable of powerfully exciting the Globe, lend themselves to innumerable uses of great importance commercially and in many other respects. The first 'World-System' power plant can be put in operation in nine months. With this power plant it will be practicable to attain electrical activities up to ten million horsepower and it is designed to serve for as many technical achievements as are possible without due expense. Among these the following may be mentioned: The inter-connection of the existing telegraph exchanges or offices all over the world; The establishment of a secret and non-interferable government telegraph service; The inter-connection of all the present telephone exchanges or offices on the Globe; The universal distribution of general news, by telegraph or telephone, in connection with the Press; The establishment of such a 'World-System' of intelligence transmission for exclusive private use; The inter-connection and operation of all stock tickers of the world; The establishment of a 'World-System' of musical distribution, etc.; The universal registration of time by cheap clocks indicating the hour with astronomical precision and requiring no attention whatever; The world transmission of typed or handwritten characters, letters, checks, etc.; The establishment of a universal marine service enabling the navigators of all ships to steer perfectly without compass, to determine the exact location, hour and speed, to prevent collisions and disasters, etc.; The inauguration of a system of world-printing on land and sea; The world reproduction of photographic pictures and all kinds of drawings or records. I also proposed to make demonstrations in the wireless transmission of power on a small scale but sufficient to carry conviction. Besides these I referred to other and incomparably more important applications of my discoveries which will be disclosed at some future date. **A plant was built on Long Island with a tower 187 feet high, having a spherical terminal about 68 feet in diameter.

These dimensions were adequate for the transmission of virtually any amount of energy. Originally only from 200 to 300 K.W. were provided but I intended to employ later several thousand horsepower. The transmitter was to emit a wave complex of special characteristics and I had devised a unique method of telephonic control of any amount of energy. ** **The tower was destroyed two years ago but my projects are being developed and another one, improved in some features, will be constructed.** On this occasion I would contradict the widely circulated report that the structure was demolished by the Government which owing to war conditions, might have created prejudice in the minds of those who may not know that the papers, which thirty years ago conferred upon me the honor of American citizenship, are always kept in a safe, while my orders, diplomas, degrees, gold medals and other distinctions are packed away in old trunks. If this report had a foundation I would have been refunded a large sum of money which I expended in the construction of the tower. On the contrary it was in the interest of the Government to preserve it, particularly as it would have made possible-to mention just one valuable result-the location of a submarine in any part of the world. My plant, services, and all my improvements have always been at the disposal of the officials and ever since the outbreak of the European conflict I have been working at a sacrifice on several inventions of mine relating to aerial navigation, ship propulsion and wireless transmission which are of the greatest importance to the country. Those who are well informed know that my ideas have revolutionized the industries of the United States and I am not aware that there lives an inventor who has been, in this respect, as fortunate as myself especially as regards the use of his improvements in the war. I have refrained from publicly expressing myself on this subject before as it seemed improper to dwell on personal matters while all the world was in dire trouble. I would add further, in view of various rumors which have reached me, that Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan did not interest himself with me in a business way but in the same large spirit in which he has assisted many other pioneers.

He had the highest regard for my attainments and gave me every evidence of his complete faith in my ability to ultimately achieve what I had set out to do. I am unwilling to accord to some smallminded and jealous individuals the satisfaction of having thwarted my efforts. These men are to me nothing more than microbes of a nasty disease. My project was retarded by laws of nature. The world was not prepared for it. It was too far ahead of time. But the same laws will prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success. **VI. The Art of Telautomatics** **No subject to which I have ever devoted myself has called for such concentration of mind and strained to so dangerous a degree the finest fibers of my brain as the system of which the Magnifying Transmitter is the foundation.** I put all the intensity and vigor of youth in the development of the rotating field discoveries, but those early labors were of a different character. Although strenuous in the extreme, they did not involve that keen and exhausting discernment which had to be exercised in attacking the many puzzling problems of the wireless. Despite my rare physical endurance at that period the abused nerves finally rebelled and I suffered a complete collapse, just as the consummation of the long and difficult task was almost in sight. Without doubt I would have paid a greater penalty later, and very likely my career would have been prematurely terminated, had not providence equipt me with a safety device, which has seemed to improve with advancing years and unfailingly comes into play when my forces are at an end. So long as it operates I am safe from danger, due to overwork, which threatens other inventors and, incidentally, I need no vacations which are indispensable to most people. When I am all but used up I simply do as the darkies, who \"naturally fall asleep while white folks worry.\" To venture a theory out of my sphere, the body probably accumulates little by little a definite quantity of some toxic agent and I sink into a nearly lethargic state which lasts half an hour to the minute.

Involuntarily I then turn to other work and am surprised at the freshness of the mind and ease with which I overcome obstacles that had baffled me before. After weeks or months my passion for the temporarily abandoned invention returns and I invariably find answers to all the vexing questions with scarcely any effort. In this connection I will tell of an extraordinary experience which may be of interest to students of psychology. I had produced a striking phenomenon with my grounded transmitter and was endeavoring to ascertain its true significance in relation to the currents propagated through the earth. It seemed a hopeless undertaking, and for more than a year I worked unremittingly, but in vain. This profound study so entirely absorbed me that I became forgetful of everything else, even of my undermined health. At last, as I was at the point of breaking down, nature applied the preservative inducing lethal sleep. Regaining my senses I realized with consternation that I was unable to visualize scenes from my life except those of infancy, the very first ones that had entered my consciousness. Curiously enough, these appeared before my vision with startling distinctness and afforded me welcome relief. Night after night, when retiring, I would think of them and more and more of my previous existence was revealed. The image of my mother was always the principal figure in the spectacle that slowly unfolded, and a consuming desire to see her again gradually took possession of me. This feeling grew so strong that I resolved to drop all work and satisfy my longing. But I found it too hard to break away from the laboratory, and several months elapsed during which I had succeeded in reviving all the impressions of my past life up to the spring of 1892. In the next picture that came out of the mist of oblivion, I saw myself at the Hotel de la Paix in Paris just coming to from one of my peculiar sleeping spells, which had been caused by prolonged exertion of the brain. Imagine the pain and distress I felt when it flashed upon my mind that a dispatch was handed to me at that very moment bearing the sad news that my mother was dying.

It was especially remarkable that during all this period of partially obliterated memory I was fully alive to everything touching on the subject of my research. I could recall the smallest details and the least significant observations in my experiments and even recite pages of text and complex mathematical formulae. My belief is firm in a law of compensation. The true rewards are ever in proportion to the labor and sacrifices made. This is one of the reasons why I feel certain that of all my inventions, the Magnifying Transmitter will prove most important and valuable to future generations. I am prompted to this prediction not so much by thoughts of the commercial and industrial revolution which it will surely bring about, but of the humanitarian consequences of the many achievements it makes possible. Considerations of mere utility weigh little in the balance against the higher benefits of civilization. We are confronted with portentous problems which can not be solved just by providing for our material existence, however abundantly. On the contrary, progress in this direction is fraught with hazards and perils not less menacing than those born from want and suffering.** If we were to release the energy of atoms or discover some other way of developing cheap and unlimited power at any point of the globe this accomplishment, instead of being a blessing, might bring disaster to mankind in giving rise to dissension and anarchy which would ultimately result in the enthronement of the hated regime of force. ** **The greatest good will comes from technical improvements tending to unification and harmony, and my wireless transmitter is preeminently such.** By its means the human voice and likeness will be reproduced everywhere and factories driven thousands of miles from waterfalls furnishing the power; aerial machines will be propelled around the earth without a stop and the sun's energy controlled to create lakes and rivers for motive purposes and transformation of arid deserts into fertile land. Its introduction for telegraphic, telephonic and similar uses will automatically cut out the statics and all other interferences which at present impose narrow limits to the application of the wireless. This is a timely topic on which a few words might not be amiss. During the past decade a number of people have arrogantly claimed that they had succeeded in doing away with this impediment.

I have carefully examined all of the arrangements described and tested most of them long before they were publicly disclosed, but the finding was uniformly negative. A recent official statement from the U.S. Navy may, perhaps, have taught some beguilable news editors how to appraise these announcments at their real worth. As a rule the attempts are based on theories so fallacious that whenever they come to my notice I can not help thinking in a lighter vein. Quite recently a new discovery was heralded, with a deafening flourish of trumpets, but it proved another case of a mountain bringing forth a mouse. This reminds me of an exciting incident which took place years ago when I was conducting my experiments with currents of high frequency. Steve Brodie had just jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge. The feat has been vulgarized since by imitators, but the first report electrified New York. I was very impressionable then and frequently spoke of the daring printer. On a hot afternoon I felt the necessity of refreshing myself and stepped into one of the popular thirty thousand institutions of this great city where a delicious twelve per cent beverage was served which can now be had only by making a trip to the poor and devastated countries of Europe. The attendance was large and not overdistinguished and a matter was discussed which gave me an admirable opening for the careless remark: \"This is what I said when I jumped off the bridge.\" No sooner had I uttered these words than I felt like the companion of Timotheus in the poem of Schiller. In an instant there was a pandemonium and a dozen voices cried: \"It is Brodie! \" I threw a quarter on the counter and bolted for the door but the crowd was at my heels with yells: \"Stop, Steve!\" which must have been misunderstood for many persons tried to hold me up as I ran frantically for my haven of refuge. By darting around corners I fortunately managed - through the medium of a fire-escape - to reach the laboratory where I threw off my coat, camouflaged myself as a hard-working blacksmith, and started the forge. But these precautions proved unnecessary; I had eluded my pursuers. For many years afterward, at night, when imagination turns into spectres the trifling troubles of the day, I often thought, as I tossed on the bed, what my fate would have been had that mob caught me and found out that I was not Steve Brodie!

Now the engineer, who lately gave an account before a technical body of a novel remedy against statics based on a \"heretofore unknown law of nature,\" seems to have been as reckless as myself when he contended that these disturbances propagate up and down, while those of a transmitter proceed along the earth. It would mean that a condenser, as this globe, with its gaseous envelope, could be charged and discharged in a manner quite contrary to the fundamental teachings propounded in every elemental text-book of physics. Such a supposition would have been condemned as erroneous, even in Franklin's time, for the facts bearing on this were then well known and the identity between atmospheric electricity and that developed by machines was fully established. Obviously, natural and artificial disturbances propagate through the earth and the air in exactly the same way, and both set up electromotive forces in the horizontal, as well as vertical, sense. Interference can not be overcome by any such methods as were proposed. The truth is this: in the air the potential increases at the rate of about fifty volts per foot of elevation, owing to which there may be a difference of pressure amounting to twenty, or even forty thousand volts between the upper and lower ends of the antenna. The masses of the charged atmosphere are constantly in motion and give up electricity to the conductor, not continuously but rather disruptively, this producing a grinding noise in a sensitive telephonic receiver. The higher the terminal and the greater the space encompassed by the wires, the more pronounced is the effect, but it must be understood that it is purely local and has little to do with the real trouble. In 1900, while perfecting my wireless system, one form of apparatus comprised four antennae. These were carefully calibrated to the same frequency and connected in multiple with the object of magnifying the action, in receiving from any direction. When I desired to ascertain the origin of the transmitted impulses, each diagonally situated pair was put in series with a primary coil energizing the detector circuit. In the former case the sound was loud in the telephone; in the latter it ceased, as expected, the two antennae neutralizing each other, but the true statics manifested themselves in both instances and I had to devise special preventives embodying different principles.

By employing receivers connected to two points of the ground, as suggested by me long ago, this trouble caused by the charged air, which is very serious in the structures as now built, is nullified and besides, the liability of all kinds of interference is reduced to about one-half, because of the directional character of the circuit. This was perfectly self-evident, but came as a revelation to some simple-minded wireless folks whose experience was confined to forms of apparatus that could have been improved with an axe, and they have been disposing of the bear's skin before killing him. If it were true that strays performed such antics, it would be easy to get rid of them by receiving without aerials. But, as a matter of fact, a wire buried in the ground which, conforming to this view, should be absolutely immune, is more susceptible to certain extraneous impulses than one placed vertically in the air. To state it fairly, a slight progress has been made, but not by virtue of any particular method or device. It was achieved simply by discarding the enormous structures, which are bad enough for transmission but wholly unsuitable for reception, and adopting a more appropriate type of receiver. As I pointed out in a previous article, to dispose of this difficulty for good, a radical change must be made in the system, and the sooner this is done the better. It would be calamitous, indeed, if at this time when the art is in its infancy and the vast majority, not excepting even experts, have no conception of its ultimate possibilities, a measure would be rushed through the legislature making it a government monopoly. This was proposed a few weeks ago by Secretary Daniels, and no doubt that distinguished official has made his appeal to the Senate and House of Representatives with sincere conviction. But universal evidence unmistakably shows that the best results are always obtained in healthful commercial competition. **There are, however, exceptional reasons why wireless should be given the fullest freedom of development. In the first place it offers prospects immeasurably greater and more vital to betterment of human life than any other invention or discovery in the history of man.** Then again, it must be understood that this wonderful art has been, in its entirety, evolved here and can be called \"American\" with more right and propriety than the telephone, the incandescent lamp or the aeroplane.

Enterprising press agents and stock jobbers have been so successful in spreading misinformation that even so excellent a periodical as the Scientific American accords the chief credit to a foreign country. The Germans, of course, gave us the Hertz-waves and the Russian, English, French and Italian experts were quick in using them for signaling purposes. It was an obvious application of the new agent and accomplished with the old classical and unimproved induction coil - scarcely anything more than another kind of heliography. The radius of transmission was very limited, the results attained of little value, and the Hertz oscillations, as a means for conveying intelligence, could have been advantageously replaced by sound-waves, which I advocated in 1891. Moreover, all of these attempts were made three years after the basic principles of the wireless system, which is universally employed to-day, and its potent instrumentalities had been clearly described and developed in America. No trace of those Hertzian appliances and methods remains today. We have proceeded in the very opposite direction and what has been done is the product of the brains and efforts of citizens of this country. The fundamental patents have expired and the opportunities are open to all. The chief argument of the Secretary is based on interference. According to his statement, reported in the New York Herald of July 29th, signals from a powerful station can be intercepted in every village of the world . In view of this fact, which was demonstrated in my experiments of 1900, it would be of little use to impose restrictions in the United States. As throwing light on this point, I may mention that only recently an odd looking gentleman called on me with the object of enlisting my services in the construction of world transmitters in some distant land. \"We have no money,\" he said, \"but carloads of solid gold and we will give you a liberal amount.\" I told him that I wanted to see first what will be done with my inventions in America, and this ended the interview. But **I am satisfied that some dark forces are at work, and as time goes on the maintenance of continuous communication will be rendered more difficult.

When the first results were publisht the Electrical Review stated editorially that it would become one of the \"most potent factors in the advance and civilization of mankind.\" The time is not distant when this prediction will be fulfilled. In 1898 and 1900 it was offered to the Government and might have been adopted were I one of those who would go to Alexander's shepherd when they want a favor from Alexander. At that time I really thought that it would abolish war, because of its unlimited destructiveness and exclusion of the personal element of combat. But while I have not lost faith in its potentialities, my views have changed since. War can not be avoided until the physical cause for its recurrence is removed and this, in the last analysis, is the vast extent of the planet on which we live. Only thru annihilation of distance in every respect, as the conveyance of intelligence, transport of passengers and supplies and transmission of energy will conditions be brought about some day, insuring permanency of friendly relations. **What we now want most is closer contact and better understanding between individuals and communities all over the earth, and the elimination of that fanatic devotion to exalted ideals of national egoism and pride which is always prone to plunge the world into primeval barbarism and strife. No league or parliamentary act of any kind will ever prevent such a calamity. ** These are only new devices for putting the weak at the mercy of the strong. I have exprest myself in this regard fourteen years ago, when a combination of a few leading governments - a sort of Holy Alliance - was advocated by the late Andrew Carnegie, who may be fairly considered as the father of this idea, having given to it more publicity and impetus than anybody else prior to the efforts of the President.

It is thus able to exert, independently, its colossal strength and moral force to the benefit of all, more judiciously and effectively, than as member of a league. In one of these biographical sketches, published in the ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER, I have dwelt on the circumstances of my early life and told of an affliction which compelled me to unremitting exercise of imagination and self observation. This mental activity, at first involuntary under the pressure of illness and suffering, gradually became second nature and led me finally to recognize that I was but an automaton devoid of free will in thought and action and merely responsive to the forces of the environment. Our bodies are of such complexity of structure, the motions we perform are so numerous and involved, and the external impressions on our sense organs to such a degree delicate and elusive that it is hard for the average person to grasp this fact. And yet nothing is more convincing to the trained investigator than the mechanistic theory of life which had been, in a measure, understood and propounded by Descartes three hundred years ago. But in his time many important functions of our organism were unknown and, especially with respect to the nature of light and the construction and operation of the eye, philosophers were in the dark. In recent years the progress of scientific research in these fields has been such as to leave no room for a doubt in regard to this view on which many works have been published. One of its ablest and most eloquent exponents is, perhaps, Felix Le Dantec, formerly assistant of Pasteur. Prof. Jacques Loeb has performed remarkable experiments in heliotropism, clearly establishing the controlling power of light in lower forms of organisms, and his latest book, \"Forced Movements,\" is revelatory.

But while men of science accept this theory simply as any other that is recognized, to me it is a truth which I hourly demonstrate by every act and thought of mine. The consciousness of the external impression prompting me to any kind of exertion, physical or mental, is ever present in my mind. Only on very rare occasions, when I was in a state of exceptional concentration, have I found difficulty in locating the original impulses. The by far greater number of human beings are never aware of what is passing around and within them, and millions fall victims of disease and die prematurely just on this account. The commonest every-day occurrences appear to them mysterious and inexplicable. One may feel a sudden wave of sadness and rake his brain for an explanation when he might have noticed that it was caused by a cloud cutting off the rays of the sun. He may see the image of a friend dear to him under conditions which he construes as very peculiar, when only shortly before he has passed him in the street or seen his photograph somewhere. When he loses a collar button he fusses and swears for an hour, being unable to visualize his previous actions and locate the object directly. Deficient observation is merely a form of ignorance and responsible for the many morbid notions and foolish ideas prevailing. There is not more than one out of every ten persons who does not believe in telepathy and other psychic manifestations, spiritualism and communion with the dead, and who would refuse to listen to willing or unwilling deceivers. Just to illustrate how deeply rooted this tendency has become even among the clearheaded American population, I may mention a comical incident. Shortly before the war, when the exhibition of my turbines in this city elicited widespread comment in the technical papers, I anticipated that there would. be a scramble among manufacturers to get hold of the invention, and I had particular designs on that man from Detroit who has an uncanny faculty for accumulating millions. So confident was I that he would turn up some day, that I declared this as certain to my secretary and assistants. Sure enough, one fine morning a body of engineers from the Ford Motor Company presented themselves with the request of discussing with me an important project. \"Didn't I tell you?\" I remarked triumphantly to my employees, and one of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt:56:0bc48e5e2de5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9540, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography", "chunk_index": 57, "text": "invention, and I had particular designs on that man from Detroit who has an uncanny faculty for accumulating millions.

We have formed a psychological society for the investigation of psychic phenomena and we want you to join us in this undertaking.\" I suppose those engineers never knew how near they came to being fired out of my office. Ever since I was told by some of the greatest men of the time, leaders in science whose names are immortal, that I am possesst of an unusual mind, I bent all my thinking faculties on the solution of great problems regardless of sacrifice. For many years I endeavored to solve the enigma of death, and watched eagerly for every kind of spiritual indication. But only once in the course of my existence have I had an experience which momentarily impressed me as supernatural. It was at the time of my mother's death. I had become completely exhausted by pain and long vigilance, and one night was carried to a building about two blocks from our home. As I lay helpless there, I thought that if my mother died while I was away from her bedside she would surely give me a sign. Two or three months before I was in London in company with my late friend, Sir William Crookes, when spiritualism was discussed, and I was under the full sway of these thoughts. I might not have paid attention to other men, but was susceptible to his arguments as it was his epochal work on radiant matter, which I had read as a student, that made me embrace the electrical career. I reflected that the conditions for a look into the beyond were most favorable, for my mother was a woman of genius and particularly excelling in the powers of intuition. During the whole night every fiber in my brain was strained in expectancy, but nothing happened until early in the morning, when I fell in a sleep, or perhaps a swoon, and saw a cloud carrying angelic figures of marvelous beauty, one of whom gazed upon me lovingly and gradually assumed the features of my mother.

The appearance slowly floated across the room and vanished, and I was awakened by an indescribably sweet song of many voices. In that instant a certitude, which no words can express, came upon me that my mother had just died. And that was true. I was unable to understand the tremendous weight of the painful knowledge I received in advance, and wrote a letter to Sir William Crookes while still under the domination of these impressions and in poor bodily health. When I recovered I sought for a long time the external cause of this strange manifestation and, to my great relief, I succeeded after many months of fruitless effort. I had seen the painting of a celebrated artist, representing allegorically one of the seasons in the form of a cloud with a group of angels which seemed to actually float in the air, and this had struck me forcefully. It was exactly the same that appeared in my dream, with the exception of my mother's likeness. The music came from the choir in the church nearby at the early mass of Easter morning, explaining everything satisfactorily in conformity with scientific facts. This occurred long ago, and I have never had the faintest reason since to change my views on psychical and spiritual phenomena, for which there is absolutely no foundation. The belief in these is the natural outgrowth of intellectual development. Religious dogmas are no longer accepted in their orthodox meaning, but every individual clings to faith in a supreme power of some kind. We all must have an ideal to govern our conduct and insure contentment, but it is immaterial whether it be one of creed, art, science or anything else, so long as it fulfills the function of a dematerializing force. It is essential to the peaceful existence of humanity as a whole that one common conception should prevail. While I have failed to obtain any evidence in support of the contentions of psychologists and spiritualists, I have proved to my complete satisfaction the automatism of life, not only through continuous observations of individual actions, but even more conclusively through certain generalizations. These amount to a discovery which I consider of the greatest moment to human society, and on which I shall briefly dwell. I got the first inkling of this astounding truth when I was still a very young man, but for many years I interpreted what I noted simply as coincidences.

Namely, whenever either myself or a person to whom I was attached, or a cause to which I was devoted, was hurt by others in a particular way, which might be best popularly characterized as the most unfair imaginable, I experienced a singular and undefinable pain which, for want of a better term, I have qualified as \"cosmic,\" and shortly thereafter, and invariably, those who had inflicted it came to grief. After many such cases I confided this to a number of friends, who had the opportunity to convince themselves of the truth of the theory which I have gradually formulated and which may be stated in the following few words: Our bodies are of similar construction and exposed to the same external influences. This results in likeness of response and concordance of the general activities on which all our social and other rules and laws are based. We are automata entirely controlled by the forces of the medium being tossed about like corks on the surface of the water, but mistaking the resultant of the impulses from the outside for free will. The movements and other actions we perform are always life preservative and tho seemingly quite independent from one another, we are connected by invisible links. So long as the organism is in perfect order it responds accurately to the agents that prompt it, but the moment that there is some derangement in any individual, his self-preservative power is impaired. Everybody understands, of course, that if one becomes deaf, has his eyesight weakened, or his limbs injured, the chances for his continued existence are lessened. But this is also true, and perhaps more so, of certain defects in the brain which deprive the automaton, more or less, of that vital quality and cause it to rush into destruction. A very sensitive and observant being, with his highly developed mechanism all intact, and acting with precision in obedience to the changing conditions of the environment, is endowed with a transcending mechanical sense, enabling him to evade perils too subtle to be directly perceived. When he comes in contact with others whose controlling organs are radically faulty, that sense asserts itself and he feels the \"cosmic\" pain.

The idea of constructing an automaton, to bear out my theory, presented itself to me early but I did not begin active work until 1893, when I started my wireless investigations. During the succeeding two or three years a number of automatic mechanisms, to be actuated from a distance, were constructed by me and exhibited to visitors in my laboratory. In 1896, however, I designed a complete machine capable of a multitude of operations, but the consummation of my labors was delayed until late in 1897. This machine was illustrated and described in my article in the Century Magazine of June, 1900, and other periodicals of that time and, when first shown in the beginning of 1898, it created a sensation such as no other invention of mine has ever produced. In November, 1898, a basic patent on the novel art was granted to me, but only after the Examiner-in-Chief had come to New York and witnesst the performance, for what I claimed seemed unbelievable. I remember that when later I called on an official in Washington, with a view of offering the invention to the Government, he burst out in laughter upon my telling him what I had accomplished. Nobody thought then that there was the faintest prospect of perfecting such a device. It is unfortunate that in this patent, following the advice of my attorneys, I indicated the control as being effected thru the medium of a single circuit and a well-known form of detector, for the reason that I had not yet secured protection on my methods and apparatus for individualization. As a matter of fact, my boats were controlled thru the joint action of several circuits and interference of every kind was excluded. Most generally I employed receiving circuits in the form of loops, including condensers, because the discharges of my high-tension transmitter ionized the air in the hall so that even a very small aerial would draw electricity from the surrounding atmosphere for hours. Just to give an idea, I found, for instance, that a bulb 12\" in diameter, highly exhausted, and with one single terminal to which a short wire was attached, would deliver well on to one thousand successive flashes before all charge of the air in the laboratory was neutralized. The loop form of receiver was not sensitive to such a disturbance and it", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt:60:586852006c0a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9544, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography", "chunk_index": 61, "text": "hall so that even a very small aerial would draw electricity from the surrounding atmosphere for hours.

The loop form of receiver was not sensitive to such a disturbance and it is curious to note that it is becoming popular at this late date. In reality it collects much less energy than the aerials or a long grounded wire, but it so happens that it does away with a number of defects inherent to the present wireless devices. In demonstrating my invention before audiences, the visitors were requested to ask any questions, however involved, and the automaton would answer them by signs. This was considered magic at that time but was extremely simple, for it was myself who gave the replies by means of the device. At the same period another larger telautomatic boat was constructed a photograph of which is shown in this number of the ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER. It was controlled by loops, having several turns placed in the hull, which was made entirely water-tight and capable of submergence. The apparatus was similar to that used in the first with the exception of certain special features I introduced as, for example, incandescent lamps which afforded a visible evidence of the proper functioning of the machine. These automata, controlled within the range of vision of the operator, were, however, the first and rather crude steps in the evolution of the Art of Telautomatics as I had conceived it. The next logical improvement was its application to automatic mechanisms beyond the limits of vision and at great distance from the center of control, and I have ever since advocated their employment as instruments of warfare in preference to guns. The importance of this now seems to be recognized, if I am to judge from casual announcements thru the press of achievements which are said to be extraordinary but contain no merit of novelty, whatever. In an imperfect manner it is practicable, with the existing wireless plants, to launch an aeroplane, have it follow a certain approximate course, and perform some operation at a distance of many hundreds of miles. A machine of this kind can also be mechanically controlled in several ways and I have no doubt that it may prove of some usefulness in war. But there are, to my best knowledge, no instrumentalities in existence today with which such an object could be accomplished in a precise manner. I have devoted years of study to this matter and have evolved means, making such and greater wonders easily realizable. **As stated on a previous occasion, when I was a student at", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt:61:9181496bc728", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9545, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__nikola_tesla_autobiography", "chunk_index": 62, "text": "this kind can also be mechanically controlled in several ways and I have no doubt that it may prove of some usefulness in war.

The underlying principle was sound but could not be carried into practice for want of a prime-mover of sufficiently great activity. In recent years I have successfully solved this problem and am now planning aerial machines devoid of sustaining planes, ailerons, propellers and other external attachments, which will be capable of immense speeds and are very likely to furnish powerful arguments for peace in the near future. **Such a machine, sustained and propelled entirely by reaction, is shown on page 108 and is supposed to be controlled either mechanically or by wireless energy. By installing proper plants it will be practicable to project a missile of this kind into the air and drop it almost on the very spot designated, which may be thousands of miles away. But we are not going to stop at this. **Telautomata will be ultimately produced, capable of acting as if possest of their own intelligence, and their advent will create a revolution.** As early as 1898 I proposed to representatives of a large manufacturing concern the construction and public exhibition of an automobile carriage which, left to itself, would perform a great variety of operations involving something akin to judgment. But my proposal was deemed chimerical at that time and nothing came from it. **At present many of the ablest minds are trying to devise expedients for preventing a repetition of the awful conflict which is only theoretically ended and the duration and main issues of which I have correctly predicted in an article printed in the Sun of December 20, 1914.

An independent report, meanwhile, revealed that the government downplayed the full danger in the days after the March 11 disaster and secretly considered evacuating Tokyo. Journalists given a tour of the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant on Tuesday ... saw crumpled trucks and equipment still lying on the ground. A power pylon that collapsed in the tsunami, cutting electricity to the plant's vital cooling system and setting off the crisis, remained a mangled mess.** The equipment that serves as the lifeline of the cooling system is shockingly feeble-looking. Plastic hoses cracked by freezing temperatures have been mended with tape. A set of three pumps sits on the back of a pickup truck. Along with the pumps, the plant now has 1,000 tanks to store more than 160,000 tons of contaminated water.** The Unit 3 reactor, whose roof was blown off by a hydrogen explosion, resembles an ashtray filled with a heap of cigarette butts.

The administration said the levels of the radioactive isotope xenon 133 were approximately equivalent to one-millionth the dose received from the sun, rocks or other natural sources. **The Obama administration's reluctance to detail in public what it is learning from radiation-detection operations around the damaged Fukushima Daiichi complex in Japan ... comes after statements Wednesday by the head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission that painted a grimmer picture of the nuclear crisis than Japanese officials had offered**, and suggested that the U.S. didn't trust the information coming from the Japanese government. **Note:** Shouldn't the title be something more like \"U.S. Refuses to Give Radiation Details for Fear of Industry Repercussions\"?

This is the first peer-reviewed study published in a medical journal documenting the health hazards of Fukushima. Authors Joseph Mangano and Janette Sherman note that their estimate of **14,000 excess U.S. deaths in the 14 weeks after the Fukushima meltdowns is comparable to the 16,500 excess deaths in the 17 weeks after the Chernobyl meltdown in 1986. The rise in reported deaths after Fukushima was largest among U.S. infants under age one. The 2010-2011 increase for infant deaths in the spring was 1.8 percent, compared to a decrease of 8.37 percent in the preceding 14 weeks.** The IJHS article [is] available online ... at [http://www.radiation.org](http://www.radiation.org). Internist and toxicologist Janette Sherman, MD, said: \"Based on our continuing research, the actual death count [in the US] may be as high as 18,000, with influenza and pneumonia, which were up five-fold in the period in question as a cause of death. Deaths are seen across all ages, but we continue to find that infants are hardest hit because their tissues are rapidly multiplying, they have undeveloped immune systems, and the doses of radioisotopes are proportionally greater than for adults.\" **Note:** To read the report (in pdf format) on excess mortality in the US already caused by the Fukushima meltdowns, [click here](http://www.radiation.org/reading/pubs/HS42_1F.pdf). **Japan Leader Points to Disaster Response Failures** **2012-03-03, ABC News/Associated Press** [http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/japan-leader-points-disaster-respons...](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/japan-leader-points-disaster-response-failures-15840160) **Japan's prime minister acknowledged Saturday the government failed in its response to last year's earthquake and tsunami, being too slow in relaying key information and believing too much in \"a myth of safety\" about nuclear power.** \"We can no longer make the excuse that what was unpredictable and outside our imagination has happened,\" Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said. \"Crisis management requires us to imagine what may be outside our imagination.\" Noda was speaking to reporters at his official residence ahead of the anniversary of the March 11 disaster that killed nearly 20,000 people in northeastern Japan and set off the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl.

Japan has also drawn criticism as having been slow with information about the meltdowns and about radiation leaks into the air and the ocean. \"We can say in hindsight that the government, business and scholars had all been seeped in a myth of safety,\" Noda said of the oversights in the accident. \"The responsibility must be shared.\" **Note:** For lots more from reliable sources on the corruption in the nuclear power industry, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/nuclear_powernewsarticles). **U.S. nuke regulators weaken safety rules** **2011-06-20, CBS News/Associated Press** [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/20/national/main20072497.shtml](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/20/national/main20072497.shtml) Federal regulators have been working closely with the nuclear power industry to keep the nation's aging reactors operating within safety standards by repeatedly weakening those standards, or simply failing to enforce them, an investigation by The Associated Press has found. Time after time, officials at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission have decided that original regulations were too strict, arguing that safety margins could be eased without peril. The result? Rising fears that these accommodations by the NRC are significantly undermining safety - and inching the reactors closer to an accident that could harm the public. Examples abound. **When valves leaked, more leakage was allowed - up to 20 times the original limit. When rampant cracking caused radioactive leaks from steam generator tubing, an easier test of the tubes was devised, so plants could meet standards.** Failed cables. Busted seals. Broken nozzles, clogged screens, cracked concrete, dented containers, corroded metals and rusty underground pipes - all of these and thousands of other problems linked to aging were uncovered. Not a single official body in government or industry has studied the overall frequency and potential impact on safety of such breakdowns in recent years, even as the NRC has extended the licenses of dozens of reactors. **Note:** Read this detailed report in its entirety to see the amazing range of serious problems in the US nuclear industry which have systematically been covered up by the NRC.

Bridenbaugh and two of his colleagues at General Electric resigned from their jobs after becoming increasingly convinced that the nuclear reactor design they were reviewing -- the Mark 1 -- was so flawed it could lead to a devastating accident.** Five of the six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, which has been wracked since Friday's earthquake with explosions and radiation leaks, are Mark 1s. \"The problems we identified in 1975 were that, in doing the design of the containment, they did not take into account the dynamic loads that could be experienced with a loss of coolant,\" Bridenbaugh [said]. \"The impact loads the containment would receive by this very rapid release of energy could tear the containment apart and create an uncontrolled release.\" Questions persisted for decades about the ability of the Mark 1 to handle the immense pressures that would result if the reactor lost cooling power. In 1986, for instance, Harold Denton, then the director of NRC's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, spoke critically about the design during an industry conference.

The operator and the government would also have to ensure a stable supply of workers and save them from exceeding exposure limits while keeping the long process going. They also have to figure out ways to access each containment vessel and assess the extent of damage, as well as locate holes and cracks through which cooling water is leaking and flooding the area. Another problem is huge volume of radioactive waste and debris that will come out of the plant during its dismantling process. Officials said they have not decided what to do with them and that part is not covered by the 40-year roadmap. **Note:** For lots more on corporate and government corruption from reliable sources, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/corporatecorruptionnewsarticles) and [here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/governmentcorruptionnewsarticles). **Reactor Core Melted Fully, Japan Says** **2011-12-01, *Wall Street Journal*** [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204262304577069302835999204.html](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204262304577069302835999204.html) Japan's tsunami-stricken nuclear-power complex came closer to a catastrophic meltdown than previously indicated by its operator [which on November 30] described how one reactor's molten nuclear core likely burned through its primary containment chamber and then ate as far as three-quarters of the way through the concrete in a secondary vessel. The [new] assessment-offered by Japan's government and Tokyo Electric Power Co., ... marked Japan's most sobering reckoning to date of the nuclear disaster sparked by the country's March 11 earthquake and tsunami. But it came nearly six months after U.S. and international nuclear experts and regulators had reached similar conclusions. For the first time, **Tokyo Electric ... said that nuclear-fuel rods in the complex's No. 1 reactor had likely melted completely, burning through their so-called pressure vessel and then boring through concrete at the bottom of a second containment vessel. That brought the fuel closer than previously believed to breaching the containment vessel and foundation and continuing to burn through the ground below - a scenario sometimes described as the \"China Syndrome.\"** The findings are the latest reminder of how much remains unknown about the extent of the mid-March Fukushima Daiichi accident. **Note:** For further information on the developing understanding of the severity of the meltdowns at Fukushima, see these reports at [*The Guardian*](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/02/fukushima-fuel-rods-completely-melted) and [*The New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/world/asia/meltdown-in-japan-may-have-been-worse-than-thought.html).

Across the northeast, millions of people are living with its consequences and searching for a consensus on a safe radiation level that does not exist. Experts give bewilderingly different assessments of its dangers. Some scientists say Fukushima is worse than the 1986 Chernobyl accident, with which it shares a maximum level-7 rating on the sliding scale of nuclear disasters. **Chris Busby, a professor at the University of Ulster ... said the disaster would result in more than 1 million deaths. \"Fukushima is still boiling its radionuclides all over Japan,\" he said. \"Chernobyl went up in one go. So Fukushima is worse.\"** Slowly, steadily, and often well behind the curve, the government has worsened its prognosis of the disaster. Last Friday, scientists affiliated with the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said the plant had released 15,000 terabecquerels of cancer-causing Cesium, equivalent to about 168 times the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the event that ushered in the nuclear age. [But] Professor Busby says the release is at least 72,000 times worse than Hiroshima. **Nuke plant averts shutdown from swelled Missouri** **2011-06-20, CBS News/Associated Press** [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/20/national/main20072590.shtml](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/20/national/main20072590.shtml) The bloated Missouri River rose to within 18 inches of forcing the shutdown of a nuclear power plant in southeast Nebraska but stopped and ebbed slightly [on June 20], after several levees in northern Missouri failed to hold back the surging waterway. The river has to hit 902 feet above sea level at Brownville before officials will shut down the Cooper Nuclear Plant, which sits at 903 feet, Nebraska Public Power District spokesman Mark Becker said. Becker said the river rose to 900.56 feet at Brownville on Sunday, then dropped to 900.4 feet later in the day and remained at that level Monday morning. **The Cooper Nuclear Plant is operating at full capacity Monday, Becker said. The Columbus-based utility sent a \"notification of unusual event\" to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission when the river rose to 899 feet early Sunday morning.** The declaration is the least serious of four emergency notifications established by the federal commission.

Leaks of radioactive steam and workers contaminated with radiation are just part of the disturbing catalog of accidents that have occurred over the years and been belatedly reported to the public, if at all. **In one case, workers hand-mixed uranium in stainless steel buckets, instead of processing by machine, so the fuel could be reused, exposing hundreds of workers to radiation. Two later died. \"Everything is a secret,\"** said Kei Sugaoka, a former nuclear power plant engineer in Japan who now lives in California. \"There's not enough transparency in the industry.\" In 1989 Sugaoka received an order that horrified him: edit out footage showing cracks in plant steam pipes in video being submitted to regulators. Sugaoka alerted his superiors in the Tokyo Electric Power Co., but nothing happened - for years. He decided to go public in 2000. Three Tepco executives lost their jobs. The legacy of scandals and cover-ups over Japan's half-century reliance on nuclear power has strained its credibility with the public. That mistrust has been renewed this past week with the crisis at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant. The vagueness and scarcity of details offered by the government and Tepco - and news that seems to grow worse each day - are fueling public anger and frustration. **Safe nuclear does exist, and China is leading the way with thorium** **2011-03-20, *The Telegraph* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/8393984/Saf...](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/8393984/Safe-nuclear-does-exist-and-China-is-leading-the-way-with-thorium.html) A few weeks before the tsunami struck Fukushima's uranium reactors and shattered public faith in nuclear power, China revealed that it was launching a rival technology to build a safer, cleaner, and ultimately cheaper network of reactors based on thorium. China's Academy of Sciences said it had chosen a \"thorium-based molten salt reactor system\". The liquid fuel idea was pioneered by US physicists at Oak Ridge National Lab in the 1960s. Chinese scientists claim that hazardous waste will be a thousand times less than with uranium.

The system is inherently less prone to disaster.** \"The reactor has an amazing safety feature,\" said Kirk Sorensen, a former NASA engineer at Teledyne Brown and a thorium expert. \"If it begins to overheat, a little plug melts and the salts drain into a pan. There is no need for computers, or the sort of electrical pumps that were crippled by the tsunami. The reactor saves itself,\"** he said. US physicists in the late 1940s explored thorium fuel for power. It has a higher neutron yield than uranium, a better fission rating, longer fuel cycles, and does not require the extra cost of isotope separation. The plans were shelved because thorium does not produce plutonium for bombs. As a happy bonus, it can burn up plutonium and toxic waste from old reactors, reducing radio-toxicity and acting as an eco-cleaner. **Note:** For many reports from reliable sources on promising new energy technologies, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newenergynewsarticles). **Fusion's Ups and Downs** **2010-03-23, MSNBC** [http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2010/03/23/2237165.aspx](http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2010/03/23/2237165.aspx) This week, scientists gathered at the [American Chemical Society's](http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content) spring meeting in San Francisco to turn the spotlight on a highly unorthodox path: the effect known as cold fusion. This year's session featured nearly 50 presentations - including reports on batteries and bacteria that appear to exhibit the cold-fusion effect. Back in 1989, cold fusion was heralded as a simple, inexpensive way to get a power-generating fusion reaction on a desktop. But when the experimental results couldn't be reproduced, the researchers were driven into obscurity [and] the term \"cold fusion\" became synonymous with quackery. Chemists, however, have kept up their interest in the effect. Rick Nebel [has headed] up a handful of researchers following the less-traveled path to fusion at EMC2 Fusion Development Corp. EMC2 recently created a buzz in the fusion underground by reporting on its Web site that it successfully completed a series of experiments to \"validate and extend\" earlier results. The company is now using a $7.9 million contract from the U.S. Navy to build a bigger test machine. **Nebel and his colleagues are now seeking contributions to fund the development of what they say would be a 100-megawatt fusion plant - a \"Phase 3\" effort projected to cost $200 million and take four years. \"Successful Phase 3 marks the end of fossil fuels,\" the Web site proclaims.** **Note:** For a powerful, reliable documentary showing how promising results from cold fusion were strongly suppressed, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/energycrisissolutionsvideodocumentary).

A 650-volt current passing between two electrodes rips electrons from the air, converting the gas into plasma. The plasma arc is so powerful, it disintegrates trash into its constituent elements by tearing apart molecular bonds. The system is capable of breaking down pretty much anything except nuclear waste. The only by-products are an obsidian-like glass [and] a mixture of primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide that can be converted into a variety of marketable fuels, including ethanol, natural gas and hydrogen.** Perhaps the most amazing part of the process is that it's self-sustaining.**** Once the cycle is under way, the 2,200F syngas is fed into a cooling system, generating steam that drives turbines to produce electricity. About two thirds of the power is siphoned off to run the converter; the rest can be used on-site for heating or electricity, or sold back to the utility grid.** Even a blackout would not stop the operation of the facility. New York City is already paying an astronomical $90 a ton to get rid of its trash. According to Startech, a few 2,000-ton-per-day plasma-gasification plants could do it for $36. Sell the syngas and surplus electricity, and you'd actually net $15 a ton. But the decision-making bureaucracy can be slow, and it is hamstrung by the politically well-connected waste-disposal industry. Startech isn't the only company using plasma to turn waste into a source of clean energy. A handful of start-ups-Geoplasma, Recovered Energy, PyroGenesis, EnviroArc and Plasco Energy, among others-have entered the market in the past decade. **Note:** Why isn't this amazing, proven machine and technology making front page headlines?

[TV footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OklIm5a1Lc) of his bizarre discovery has been burning up the blogosphere ever since, drawing crackpots and Ph.D.s alike into a raging debate. Can water burn? And if so, what good can come of it? Some people gush over the invention's potential for desalinization or cheap energy. Briny seawater, after all, sloshes over most of the planet's surface, and harnessing its heat energy could power all sorts of things. Skeptics say Kanzius's radio generator is sucking up far more energy than it's creating, making it a carnival trick at best. For now, Kanzius is tuning out the hubbub. Diagnosed with leukemia in 2002, he began building his radio-wave blaster the next year, soon after a relapse. If he could seed a person's cancerous cells with nanoscopic metal particles and blast them with radio waves, perhaps he could kill off the cancer while sparing healthy tissue. **The saltwater phenomenon happened by accident when an assistant was bombarding a saline-filled test tube with radio waves and bumped the tube, causing a small flash. Curious, Kanzius struck a match. \"The water lit like a propane flame,\"** he recalls. \"People said, 'It's a crock. Look for hidden electrodes in the water,' \" says Penn State University materials scientist Rustum Roy, who visited [Kanzius] in his lab in August after seeing the feat on Google Video. A demo made Roy a believer. \"This is discovery science in the best tradition,\" he says. Meanwhile, researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center have made progress using Kanzius's technology to fight cancer in animals. They published their findings last month in the journal Cancer. **Note:** For other compelling articles on this fascinating invention, see recent articles in the [Los Angeles Times](http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/02/nation/na-cancer2), [ABC News](http://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3810892), and especially [Medical News Today](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/87746.php). **BlackLight's physics-defying promise: Cheap power from water** **2008-07-02, CNN Money** [http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/01/smallbusiness/blacklight.fsb/index.htm](http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/01/smallbusiness/blacklight.fsb/index.htm) Imagine being able to convert water into a boundless source of cheap energy.

It was the announcement of cold fusion - nuclear energy like that which powers the sun - but at room temperature on a table top. It promised to be cheap, limitless and clean. Cold fusion would end our dependence on the Middle East and stop those greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. It would change everything. But then, just as quickly as it was announced, it was discredited. So thoroughly, that cold fusion became a catch phrase for junk science. Well, a funny thing happened on the way to oblivion - for many scientists today, cold fusion is hot again. \"We can yield the power of nuclear physics on a tabletop. The potential is unlimited. That is the most powerful energy source known to man,\" researcher Michael McKubre told 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley. McKubre says he has seen that energy more than 50 times in cold fusion experiments he's doing at SRI International, a respected California lab that does extensive work for the government. McKubre is an electro-chemist who imagines, in 20 years, the creation of a clean nuclear battery.** \"For example, a laptop would come pre-charged with all of the energy that you would ever intend to use. You're now decoupled from your charger and the wall socket,\" **he explained. The same would go for cars.** \"The potential is for an energy source that would run your car for three, four years, for example. And you'd take it in for service every four years and they'd give you a new power supply,\"** McKubre told Pelley. **Note:** For more and to watch the full, revealing 12-minute video clip of this segment that was strangely removed, only to be reposted after a campaign by WantToKnow.info, [click here](http://www.examiner.com/us-intelligence-in-national/cold-fusion-comeback-could-this-new-energy-source-transform-our-world-cbs-60-minutes-reports) and [here](http://www.examiner.com/us-intelligence-in-national/media-censorship-of-cold-fusion-on-the-internet-by-cbs).

This year's session featured nearly 50 presentations - including reports on batteries and bacteria that appear to exhibit the cold-fusion effect. Back in 1989, cold fusion was heralded as a simple, inexpensive way to get a power-generating fusion reaction on a desktop. But when the experimental results couldn't be reproduced, the researchers were driven into obscurity [and] the term \"cold fusion\" became synonymous with quackery. Chemists, however, have kept up their interest in the effect. Rick Nebel [has headed] up a handful of researchers following the less-traveled path to fusion at EMC2 Fusion Development Corp. EMC2 recently created a buzz in the fusion underground by reporting on its Web site that it successfully completed a series of experiments to \"validate and extend\" earlier results. The company is now using a $7.9 million contract from the U.S. Navy to build a bigger test machine. **Nebel and his colleagues are now seeking contributions to fund the development of what they say would be a 100-megawatt fusion plant - a \"Phase 3\" effort projected to cost $200 million and take four years. \"Successful Phase 3 marks the end of fossil fuels,\" the Web site proclaims.** **Note:** For a powerful, reliable documentary showing how promising results from cold fusion were strongly suppressed, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/energycrisissolutionsvideodocumentary). **Taming the Gas-Hogging SUV** **2008-06-09, ABC News** [http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/GlobalWarming/story?id=5028894](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/GlobalWarming/story?id=5028894) Johnathan Goodwin walks to the back of his auto conversion shop in Wichita, Kan., and lifts up a gas nozzle connected to a huge cube-shaped container. The orange stuff he's pumping is the key to his company's mission: converting the worst gas-gulping SUVs into cleaner, meaner machines. \"This is 100 percent canola oil, refined to biodiesel,\" Goodwin said. His well-maintained shop is a bit like a showroom for that much-maligned symbol of environmental ruin: the Hummer.

Their one goal was to see how far they can get these amazing machines to travel on a minuscule amount of fuel. While we might be delirious if we managed 40 miles (64 kilometres) to the gallon (4.5 litres) pottering about town in our super minis, these people are not happy until they have seen the mileometer click through the thousands. The teams have a choice of petrol or diesel, with solar assistance permitted for the first time this year. A car is allowed three 40-minute runs. It must average at least 15 mph (24 kph) after which the stewards at the meeting calculate the machine's fuel efficiency. \"The top fuel teams do about 10 miles, which is six laps on the club circuit at Silverstone,\" says the event's fuel manager Geoff Houlbrook. \"They do that on less than 10 millilitres which is just two teaspoons of fuel.\" The entries come from all over Europe.

It was a sports-economy car - one that combines performance and practicality under one hood. But as CBS News correspondent Steve Hartman reports in this week's Assignment America, the car that buyers have been waiting decades [for] comes from an unexpected source and runs on soybean bio-diesel fuel to boot. **A car that can go from zero to 60 in four seconds and get more than 50 miles to the gallon would be enough to pique any driver's interest.

Forget about fancy batteries, regenerative braking, and alternative fuels. Instead, make a car that's elegant in its minimalism and efficiency. **The Loremo's German designers revisited the basics - engine efficiency, low weight, and minimal drag - to create a car that offers fuel-efficiency in the neighborhood of 130 to 150 miles per gallon. The Loremo is likely to dazzle drivers not with its acceleration, but with its ability to drive from New York to L.A. with only three stops at the pump.** Loremo stands for low resistance mobile, and its engineers have stuck obsessively to this idea. By building the car around a 2-cylinder turbodiesel engine, and cutting back on weight, drag, and other excess fat such as side-opening doors, the Loremo puffs out a mere 50 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer. This is about 40 grams less per kilometer than the tiny diesel [smart](http://autos.msn.com/browse/Smart.aspx). According to its creators, this will make the Loremo the most efficient production car ever sold. If the Loremo showed up as a concept on an auto show pedestal, it would certainly garner some attention. But the Loremo is not a car for dreamers; not only will it enter mass production next year, it will sport a base price attainable by mortal motorists: 15,000 euros (about U.S. $22,000). After its 2009 release in Europe, the Loremo will be redesigned to reach the North American market the following year. A $30,000, 3-cylinder GT model will also become available, offering better acceleration (0-60 in roughly 10 seconds, vs. 16 for the base model). Both hybrid and fully electric versions are also in the works. **Toyota smashes fuel economy record** **2002-10-20, *London Times*** [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,588-451038,00.html](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,588-451038,00.html) Tucked away on the Toyota stand you will find a cheeky little coupé that looks sporty but whose *raison d'être* is fuel economy, the lowest exhaust emissions and ease of recycling. **The ES3 - the initials stand for Eco Spirit - achieves 104mpg in the official European fuel consumption tests, a record for a four-seat car.** Some months ago I drove this prototype and not only is it even more economical than the special \"3 litre\" (three litres of fuel for every 100km travelled, or 94mpg) versions of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__renewable_energy_inventions_clean_green.txt:9:c956afd44708", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9567, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__renewable_energy_inventions_clean_green.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__renewable_energy_inventions_clean_green", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "a cheeky little coupé that looks sporty but whose *raison d'être* is fuel economy, the lowest exhaust emissions and ease of recycling. **The ES3 - the initials stand for Eco Spirit - achieves 104mpg in the official European fuel consumption tests, a record for a four-seat car.** Some months ago I drove this prototype and not only is it even more economical than the special \"3 litre\" (three litres of fuel for every 100km travelled, or 94mpg) versions of the Audi A2 and VW Lupo that sell in Germany, but the Toyota is more lively and responsive and would be very acceptable as an everyday car.

As a teenager in the late 1970s, I remember well my best friend's dad telling us about the invention of a friend of his which greatly increased car mileage. His friend was thrilled when an oil company bought the invention and exclusive rights to it for a very large sum. He fully expected to see his name heralded in news headlines before long. Yet he was later disgusted when the invention was completely suppressed. And in 2002, a good friend of mine owned a seven-million dollar company developing an amazing invention which would have revolutionized car engines. I was on the phone with him almost every day as he had bizarre things happen like his phone service strangely disconnected for days, a bullet fired through his office window, his office and home ransacked, and more. Eventually, using strange legal loopholes, his company was taken over by a member of his own board of directors, who unbeknownst to him was on the payroll of big oil. **If an invention surfaces which suddenly doubles gas mileage, oil companies stand to lose literally billions of dollars. Is it really surprising then that numerous exciting inventions which could have revolutionized the energy industry have been suppressed over the years?** The major media articles below present many breakthrough inventions which should be making top headlines. It is only a matter of time until one of these amazing suppressed inventions breaks through.

Sridhar ... says he knows it works because he originally invented a similar device for NASA. He really is a rocket scientist. He invented a new kind of fuel cell, which is like a very skinny battery that always runs. Sridhar feeds oxygen to it on one side, and fuel on the other. The two combine within the cell to create a chemical reaction that produces electricity. There's no need for burning or combustion, and no need for power lines from an outside source. \"It's cheaper than the grid, it's cleaner than the grid.\" **Twenty large, well-known companies have quietly bought and are testing Bloom boxes in California. The first customer was Google.** Four units have been powering a Google datacenter for 18 months. They use natural gas, but half as much as would be required for a traditional power plant.

That's what BlackLight Power, a 25-employee firm in Cranbury, N.J., says it can do. The only problem: Most scientists say that company's technology violates the basic laws of physics. Such skepticism doesn't daunt Dr. Randell Mills, a Harvard-trained physician and founder of BlackLight, who recently claimed that he has created a working fuel cell using the world's most pervasive element: the hydrogen found in water. Mills says he has a market-ready product: a fuel cell that produces a chemical reaction to alter hydrogen atoms.

Two types of atoms, typically a light element and a heavier metal, seem to fuse together, releasing pure heat that can be converted into electricity. The process is an attractive energy solution for two reasons: Unlike in nuclear fission, the reaction doesn't give off dangerous radiation. Unlike the fusion processes that take place in the sun, cold fusion doesn't require extremely high temperatures. In April ... Rossi and fellow physicist Sergio Focardi successfully demonstrated the device for a group of Swedish physicists. At the demo in October, after an initial energy input of 400 watts into each module, each one then produced a sustained, continuous output of 10 kilowatts (470 kW altogether) for three to four hours. Peter Hagelstein, an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science and one of the most mainstream proponents of cold fusion research, thinks the process may involve vibrational energy in the metal's lattice driving nuclear transitions that lead to fusion. **Note:** For lots more on this exciting development,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__suppressed_inventions.txt:2:c81c21c71fd7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9572, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__suppressed_inventions.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__suppressed_inventions", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "in October, after an initial energy input of 400 watts into each module, each one then produced a sustained, continuous output of 10 kilowatts (470 kW altogether) for three to four hours.

It was the announcement of cold fusion - nuclear energy like that which powers the sun - but at room temperature on a table top. It promised to be cheap, limitless and clean. Cold fusion would end our dependence on the Middle East and stop those greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. It would change everything. But then, just as quickly as it was announced, it was discredited. So thoroughly, that cold fusion became a catch phrase for junk science. Well, a funny thing happened on the way to oblivion - for many scientists today, cold fusion is hot again. \"We can yield the power of nuclear physics on a tabletop. The potential is unlimited. That is the most powerful energy source known to man,\" researcher Michael McKubre told 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley. McKubre says he has seen that energy more than 50 times in cold fusion experiments he's doing at SRI International, a respected California lab that does extensive work for the government. McKubre is an electro-chemist who imagines, in 20 years, the creation of a clean nuclear battery.** \"For example, a laptop would come pre-charged with all of the energy that you would ever intend to use. You're now decoupled from your charger and the wall socket,\" **he explained. The same would go for cars.** \"The potential is for an energy source that would run your car for three, four years, for example. And you'd take it in for service every four years and they'd give you a new power supply,\"** McKubre told Pelley. **Note:** For more and to watch the full, revealing 12-minute video clip of this segment that was strangely removed, only to be reposted after a campaign by WantToKnow.info, [click here](http://www.examiner.com/us-intelligence-in-national/cold-fusion-comeback-could-this-new-energy-source-transform-our-world-cbs-60-minutes-reports) and [here](http://www.examiner.com/us-intelligence-in-national/media-censorship-of-cold-fusion-on-the-internet-by-cbs).

[TV footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OklIm5a1Lc) of his bizarre discovery has been burning up the blogosphere ever since, drawing crackpots and Ph.D.s alike into a raging debate. Can water burn? And if so, what good can come of it? Some people gush over the invention's potential for desalinization or cheap energy. Briny seawater, after all, sloshes over most of the planet's surface, and harnessing its heat energy could power all sorts of things. Skeptics say Kanzius's radio generator is sucking up far more energy than it's creating, making it a carnival trick at best. For now, Kanzius is tuning out the hubbub. Diagnosed with leukemia in 2002, he began building his radio-wave blaster the next year, soon after a relapse. If he could seed a person's cancerous cells with nanoscopic metal particles and blast them with radio waves, perhaps he could kill off the cancer while sparing healthy tissue. **The saltwater phenomenon happened by accident when an assistant was bombarding a saline-filled test tube with radio waves and bumped the tube, causing a small flash.

A 650-volt current passing between two electrodes rips electrons from the air, converting the gas into plasma. The plasma arc is so powerful, it disintegrates trash into its constituent elements by tearing apart molecular bonds. The system is capable of breaking down pretty much anything except nuclear waste. The only by-products are an obsidian-like glass [and] a mixture of primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide that can be converted into a variety of marketable fuels, including ethanol, natural gas and hydrogen.** Perhaps the most amazing part of the process is that it's self-sustaining.**** Once the cycle is under way, the 2,200F syngas is fed into a cooling system, generating steam that drives turbines to produce electricity. About two thirds of the power is siphoned off to run the converter; the rest can be used on-site for heating or electricity, or sold back to the utility grid.** Even a blackout would not stop the operation of the facility. New York City is already paying an astronomical $90 a ton to get rid of its trash. According to Startech, a few 2,000-ton-per-day plasma-gasification plants could do it for $36. Sell the syngas and surplus electricity, and you'd actually net $15 a ton. But the decision-making bureaucracy can be slow, and it is hamstrung by the politically well-connected waste-disposal industry.

The mileage standards are still 27.5 m.p.g.** Except for minor tweaks, Congress has refused to raise fuel efficiency requirements or close a gaping loophole that lets S.U.V.'s and pickups be measured by a more lenient standard. **Note:** Thank you *New York Times* for pointing out what so few have bothered to mention. In the U.S., it is not the automotive industry that determines fuel mileage standards, but rather Congress. Whenever Congress has raised the mileage standard, industry complies and average mileage increases. When the standards are not raised, average car mileage for new cars stays the same. Yet Congress has refused to significantly raise the standards since 1985, despite the increasing talk of an energy crisis. Why?

Their one goal was to see how far they can get these amazing machines to travel on a minuscule amount of fuel. While we might be delirious if we managed 40 miles (64 kilometres) to the gallon (4.5 litres) pottering about town in our super minis, these people are not happy until they have seen the mileometer click through the thousands. The teams have a choice of petrol or diesel, with solar assistance permitted for the first time this year. A car is allowed three 40-minute runs. It must average at least 15 mph (24 kph) after which the stewards at the meeting calculate the machine's fuel efficiency. \"The top fuel teams do about 10 miles, which is six laps on the club circuit at Silverstone,\" says the event's fuel manager Geoff Houlbrook. \"They do that on less than 10 millilitres which is just two teaspoons of fuel.\" The entries come from all over Europe. Some teams use advanced materials like titanium and carbon fibre. Some of the machines built by schoolchildren are made from parts of old sewing and washing machines. \"It's fun but it's also science,\" says BBC Top Gear presenter and racing driver Tiff Needell. \"It's like an experiment with people learning how to save energy.\" **Note:** Some of these amazing vehicles built in 1999 were \"[built by schoolchildren](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060303carenginebreakthrough),\" yet the auto industry still can't come up with a car that get's 100 mpg?

And that the legendary Thomas Alva Edison devised today`s electrical power system? \"We were taught wrong,\" said Toby Grotz, president of the [International Tesla Society](http://www.teslasociety.com/). Two years before Marconi demonstrated his wireless radio transmission, [Nikola Tesla] performed an identical feat at the 1893 World`s Fair in Chicago. **On June 21, 1943, in the case of Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. vs. the United States, the Supreme Court ruled that that Tesla`s radio patents had predated those of the Italian genius.** To be sure, Edison invented the incandescent light bulb. But he powered it and all of his other projects with inefficient direct current (DC) electricity. It was Tesla who discovered how to use the far more powerful phased form of alternating current (AC) electricity that is virtually the universal type of electricity employed by modern civilization. There are indications that Tesla also discovered many of the devices ... for the Pentagon`s controversial Star Wars antimissile defense system. \"Tesla dreamed of supplying limitless amounts of power freely and equally available to all persons on Earth,\" said Grotz. And he was convinced he could do so by broadcasting electrical power across large distances just as radio transmits far smaller amounts of energy. **[Tesla's] tests ... caused lights to burn as much as 26 miles away, according to news reports of the time. ** **Note:** Nikola Tesla was virtually written out of history texts likely because he advocated providing methods for extremely cheap electricity available to everyone. He successfully transmitted electricity through the air to lights 26 miles away. Yet the rich energy power brokers of his time could not stand for this. Only the little known Supreme Court ruling mentioned above restored his claim as original inventor of the radio.

Thomas Gold, a respected astronomer and professor emeritus at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, has held for years that **oil is actually a renewable, primordial syrup continually manufactured by the Earth under ultrahot conditions and tremendous pressures. As this substance migrates toward the surface, it is attacked by bacteria, making it appear to have an organic origin dating back to the dinosaurs**, he says. That ... raises the tantalizing possibility that oil may not be the limited resource it is assumed to be. In 2008 ... a group of Russian and Ukrainian scientists [said] that oil and gas don't come from fossils; they're synthesized deep within the earth's mantle by heat, pressure, and other purely chemical means, before gradually rising to the surface. The idea that oil comes from fossils \"is a myth\" that needs changing according to petroleum engineer Vladimir Kutcherov, speaking at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. \"All kinds of rocks could have oil and gas deposits.\" Alexander Kitchka of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences estimates that 60 percent of the content of all oil is abiotic in origin and not from fossil fuels. **Note:** For more on the intriguing abiotic oil theory, [click here](http://freeenergynews.com/Directory/Theory/SustainableOil/). **Solar Panel Drops to $1 per Watt** **2009-02-26, *Popular Mechanics*** [http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4306443.html](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4306443.html) **A long-sought solar milestone was eclipsed on Tuesday, when Tempe, Ariz.-based First Solar Inc. announced that the manufacturing costs for its thin-film photovoltaic panels had dipped below $1 per watt for the first time.** With comparable costs for standard silicon panels still hovering in the $3 range, it's tempting to conclude that First Solar's cadmium telluride (CdTe) technology has won the race. But if we're concerned about the big picture (scaling up solar until it's a cheap and ubiquitous antidote to global warming and foreign oil) a forthcoming study from the University of California-Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggests that neither material has what it takes compared to lesser-known alternatives such as-we're not kidding-fool's gold. Even if the solar cell market were to grow at 56 percent a year for the next 10 years-slightly higher than the rapid growth of the past year-photovoltaics would still only account for about 2.5 percent of global electricity, LBNL researcher Cyrus Wadia says. \"First Solar is great, as long as we're talking megawatts or gigawatts,\" he says. \"But as soon as they have to start rolling out terawatts, that's where I believe they will reach some limitations.\" **Note:** Solar energy costs have dropped consistently and steadily over the past 30 years.

It was a sports-economy car - one that combines performance and practicality under one hood. But as CBS News correspondent Steve Hartman reports in this week's Assignment America, the car that buyers have been waiting decades [for] comes from an unexpected source and runs on soybean bio-diesel fuel to boot. **A car that can go from zero to 60 in four seconds and get more than 50 miles to the gallon would be enough to pique any driver's interest. So who do we have to thank for it. Ford? GM? Toyota? No - just Victor, David, Cheeseborough, Bruce, and Kosi, five kids from the auto shop program at West Philadelphia High School.** The five kids ... built the soybean-fueled car as an after-school project. It took them more than a year - rummaging for parts, configuring wires and learning as they went. As teacher Simon Hauger notes, these kids weren't exactly the cream of the academic crop. \"If you give kids that have been stereotyped as not being able to do anything an opportunity to do something great, they'll step up,\" he says. Stepping up is something the big automakers have yet to do. They're still in the early stages of marketing hybrid cars while playing catch-up to the Bad News Bears of auto shop. \"We made this work,\" says Hauger. \"We're not geniuses.

It advances a unified concept governing our awareness of reality, explains the generation of this reality, and describes the factors which mold it into the numerous forms in which we find it. To some extent it is not a \"first\" attempt. For centuries philosophers and scientists have, with varying degrees of success, framed hypotheses with the same considered objective. It may be said that such attempts at a unified understanding of the universe is a natural result of man's inquisitiveness and his searching need of the ultimate order. **THE NEW SCIENCE is unique, however, in bringing into play not only those factors which are usually considered as physical and material, but also the more subtle yet no less important influence of the mental and spiritual.** The work was produced after many years of thought and investigation. Existing concepts were considered in all their scope and depth. It is the belief of many that numerous \"clues\" were obtained from civilizations much more advanced than ours. Some of the more physical aspects were confirmed by actual experiment and the less tangible considerations tested against observable data and evaluated for consistency. At this point, a few words about the author would seem appropriate. Wilbert Brockhouse Smith was born at Lethbridge, in the Province of Alberta, Canada on the 17th of February, 1910. He exhibited early in life an eager interest in the nature of things. At the age of 15, he wrote a treatise dealing with the controversial concept of perpetual motion. He was also the author of several scientific novels. After having obtained his S. SC. And M. Sc. Degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Columbia in 1933 and 1934, he spent four years on the staff of radio station CJOR in Vancouver, BC, where he became chief engineer. In 1939 he joined the Department of Transport of Canada, where he continued his work in the field of broadcasting and ...

We observe and speculate; we look and sometimes we find; we ask many questions and get many answers.

Many shining nuggets of Truth lie buried at our feet and if we are not too proud to dig we will find them. There are certain fundamental Truths in this Universe, and if we are prepared to accept them we can use them as tools for its better Understanding. **No principal can be described or satisfactorily defined except in terms of concepts which are more basic, until one basic concept is reached which in itself cannot be defined at all, but which will define all other concepts.** The Universe contains no anomalies, and the appearance of an anomaly is warning that our understanding is inadequate. Mathematics must be the servant of Understanding and not its master. Equations, by their very nature, cannot discover; they can only yield relationships derived from the initial statements and which were inherently in them when they were stated. Truth is not hidden; it is available to all and is the same for all. Apparent differences must be due to inadequate understanding. **Chapter I** **The Basic Concept** Whatever might be the origin of this Universe, of one thing we can be reasonably sure, that it is within \"nothing at all\". If it \"started\", then it must have started from nothing at all. It always was. This \"it\" has nothing at all around it. Whatever there might be beyond this \"nothing at all\", we have no way of knowing, for we are within it and of this Universe, and have no concept beyond it. This idea of nothing at all is a most difficult one to come to grips with, but it is an absolute necessity to an understanding of even the first ideas of cosmology. Nothing at all means exactly what it says: NOTHING AT ALL; no space, no time, no substance, no energy, no change. To approach it one must slough off all reality and proceed deliberately into the void of nothingness. It is something extremely personal which must be experienced by the individual as a basic exercise; it is something which cannot be \"taught\". Most people recoil from the idea of nothing at all, feeling that it is akin to annihilation, which it is.

It is something extremely personal which must be experienced by the individual as a basic exercise; it is something which cannot be \"taught\". Most people recoil from the idea of nothing at all, feeling that it is akin to annihilation, which it is. But we must know of \"nothing at all\" before we can understand the basic concept upon which our Universe is built. Subsequent lessons are futile without this basic understanding. Having become aware of nothing at all, **there is only awareness and nothing at all.** Awareness injects into nothing at all a concept which will render it unique. Since no concept of any kind can be defined except in terms of that which is more basic, this Concept cannot be defined. We may use it only in defining concepts which are less basic. Since this Concept is the basis of our Universe, its derivatives must be the basic parameters of it, and in itself it must remain the nameless Reality. We do not know if this basic Reality exists independently from Awareness or whether one is the consequence of the other; or whether in the final analysis they are in fact one and the same. In any case we do know, or think that we know, that Reality does exist, and we are aware of it. But we do not know how far beyond us the Awareness extends, so we must either postpone this determination pending a better understanding, or accept the statements by other entities who are presumably more advanced than we are that Awareness is universal and extends throughout all Reality and has a particular relationship thereto which will be discussed later. **Our physical senses are very limited such that we can observe directly only certain aspects of our Universe, and these only within strictly limited ranges.** However, as our understanding increases, we are able to devise ways and means for extending our senses both in range and scope, which in turn leads to better understanding. But **we must always remember in thus extending our senses to distinguish between the language of observation and its translation into the language of our senses, lest we miss the phenomenon while inspecting its effect**. Also, since the information we get through extensions of our senses is essentially \"second hand\", we must be doubly sure that it is truly what we think it is, that it is in fact \"the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\" There are two ways of learning, memorizing and understanding.

Understanding, however, allows one to KNOW. It is not limited to material which has already been assimilated. Further, understanding can extrapolate while memory cannot even interpolate. Therefore, in dealing with the Basic Concept of the Universe which is Nothing-At-All, mere memory is not good enough; understanding must be used, otherwise the whole exercise is meaningless and we cannot KNOW. In striving to attain the knowledge of Nothing-At-All and the basic concept of Reality within it, words are hopelessly inadequate because by their very nature words are merely symbols in which there is some degree of common understanding. As yet we have no words for that which is basic, we must attain the understanding of it and then carry this understanding into whatever language we find convenient. But however we may approach the subject, the understanding of it is entirely personal. As one of the people from \"elsewhere\" once stated, \"I cannot teach you; I can only help you to learn!\" **Chapter II** **The Quadrature Concept** Having understood Nothing-At-All and the basic concept of Reality within it, we must next understand the relationship of Awareness to these concepts. **Whether or not Awareness and Reality are one and same is probably the Creator's secret, but to us at least they seem to be separate, and through the one, we observe the other.** Realizing that at this stage we have not yet even approached the basic or derived parameters of the Universe, we have no understood framework within which to explore the relationship of Awareness to Reality. Also, since the only basic concept we have at this stage is the nameless one injected into Nothing-At-All, it is only this which we can use to define the higher concepts. Therefore, the only possible understanding of the relationship of Awareness to reality must be determined from that which is inherent within the understanding of both. We could define the Quadrature Concept as the relationship of Awareness to Reality. To some a definition of this nature may be adequate, but it would carry little or no understanding, and great difficulties would arise later when this concept is needed to understand the derivation and relationships between the twelve fundamental parameters. Therefore, a little time and effort spent at this stage to understand this relationship will pay large dividends later. Through the symbology of words and through analogy an attempt will be made to bracket this concept and bring it into approximate focus,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:4:20d2c8eaebcf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9588, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "a definition of this nature may be adequate, but it would carry little or no understanding, and great difficulties would arise later when this concept is needed to understand the derivation and relationships between the twelve fundamental parameters.

Through the symbology of words and through analogy an attempt will be made to bracket this concept and bring it into approximate focus, and after that, only individual and personal effort can bring it into precise focus so that understanding is attained. Our personal experience with awareness is largely confined to the operation of our senses. If we see something and can see all sides of it, we usually have a pretty good idea of what it looks like. Also, if we can feel it all over, we can conclude quite a bit about its shape, temperature, texture, etc. We get even more information from any sounds which it may make, or any smells which it may exude. We may even want to taste it. If we can get at it sufficiently to use most or all of our senses on it, we can form a pretty good idea of what it is, such that if we met it again we would probably recognize it. What then is the mechanism by which our awareness obtains this information? If we find ourselves in a certain situation, such as being caught out in a storm, our senses respond to certain stimuli and we arrive at certain conclusions. Thereafter we have a degree of understanding of that particular situation and would have no trouble recognizing or identifying it if we ever met it again. Emotional responses, stemming sometimes from very restricted stimulation, can be distinguished and identified, and to a certain degree passed along to others if they are coded through their own experience to receive such information. Under these circumstances, we can say that such emotions are \"understood\". But just what is the relationship of Awareness to them? When we get into the area of abstracts such as mathematics, physical relationships and the like, logic and intuition extend the range and scope of our senses, but there still exists that mysterious relationship between Awareness and Reality. In the transcendental area involving extra sensory perception, estannation, and those other capabilities of the mind which as yet are only vaguely appreciated, we also find a definite and determinable relationship between Awareness and Reality. In fact, anything about which we can think, if it in any way involves an aspect of the universe, must implicate and make use of this relationship.

In the ultimate, **the Quadrature Concept is the link by which Awareness observes and Understands Reality.** **Mathematics is a discipline in which many people have a fair understanding, and within which one facet of the Quadrature Concept manifests most elegantly. Geometry, complex algebra, and vectors all make use of a special relationship in which one line is at right angles to another. Various properties, some of which are obvious and some which are not so obvious, have been ascribed to this quadrature relationship between lines. In fact, whole mathematical philosophies have been developed around this relationship. Their practical application has given us electrical current, radio, aeronautics, and many others. ** **In mathematics the Quadrature Concept manifests as two lines mutually at right angles, or to a line which has been subjected to an operation by the square root of minus one from its previous position. Successive operations yield relationships which are the cornerstones of various branches of mathematics. But the universal Quadrature Concept extends much beyond its mere mathematical application, interesting though this may be, and is in fact the Concept which links Awareness with the Concept which is fundamental.** **Chapter III** **The Space Fabric** Our Universe appears to us as an enormous, tremendously complicated system, with myriads of actions and reactions, functions and functional derivatives, and it is hard to realize that it is all a manifestation of a single basic concept in Nothing-At-All. We suspect, correctly, that there must be many \"layers\" or \"levels\" between the basic concept and what we observe around us. It is up these levels that we must work our way to an understanding of the universe, rather than downwards. Anyone who is at all familiar with modern physics is, no doubt, appalled at its complexity, confused by the many correction and perturbation factors, and amazed at the many weird theories propounded in all sincerity to explain observations in terms of \"established principles\". Anomalies are the rule rather than the exception, and the amount of data which just won't fit is colossal. All in all it is fairly obvious that this view of the Universe is bogging down and we are in reality conjuring up a mathematical monstrosity and raising it to Deity status. It is truly the modern Golden Calf. It is much more difficult to conceive of a universe which is basically highly complex, but breaking down into simpler units, than to conceive of a Universe in which everything is built up of different aspects and combinations of these aspects of a single basic Reality. Therefore, why not tread again the path which was trodden by the Creator when", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:6:17b47e88392d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9590, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "in reality conjuring up a mathematical monstrosity and raising it to Deity status.

Therefore, why not tread again the path which was trodden by the Creator when the universe was established, and start as he did with Nothing-At-All and place therein the single basic Concept of Reality and study that which may be derived from it. We were unable to establish the point of whether or not there is any interdependence between Reality and Awareness, and we may never be able to do so, but we must take it that they both do in fact exist, otherwise the whole exercise becomes meaningless and all is illusion. Therefore, insofar as we are concerned, the Reality of the Universe exists as we are aware of it. **The first degree of awareness of the basic concept is length.** This is a bold statement and although many other combinations of words could be used the MEANING is identical. Again, the understanding of this parameter is a personal matter, and the mere reiteration of a formula will never convey understanding. Hence another personal visit into Nothing-At-All and a first hand view of the basic concept is called for. The viewing should be by means of the Quadrature Concept and, if correctly carried out to the exclusion of all else, that which is viewed will be the concept of length. This is the First Parameter, or as it might fairly be put at this point, the First Dimension. [Planck's Constant, *L] **Now, if the Quadrature Concept is again applied to the basic Concept of Reality, taking into account the already established Parameter of Length, then Area will be established, which is the Second Parameter. This Area is the true Second Dimension, thus making Volume the true Third Dimension.** For similar reasons another Length at right angles to the other two could not qualify. **Hence, Awareness of the basic concept of Reality, through successive applications of the Quadrature Concept has established a fabric of three Parameters, Length, Area and Volume, containing One, Two, and Three conventional Dimensions. This is the Space Fabric, and establishes a place for the Universe, which is at once simple and possible of understanding.** There is no need for Warps, Foreshortenings, and all the other attachments appended to Space by conventional science to avoid facing the Universe as the Creator faced it, from the viewpoint of Nothing-At-All. At this point it may be well to say something about Zero and Infinity.

At this point it may be well to say something about Zero and Infinity. Originally these were mathematical concepts which gradually became established in our consciousness, even though to most people they never had any real meaning. Mathematically, it is possible to evolve quite satisfactory definitions for Zero and infinity, and so long as they are confined to mathematics, we can get along with them quite well. But when we try to become aware of zero or infinity as a personal experience, we find it most difficult. It is only through the Quadrature Concept that we can become aware of these two extremes at all. But if we do view them \"in quadrature\", we find them quite understandable; in fact, they become as real as any other numbers. **We can say that Zero is the smallest number in which our Awareness has any interest, and that Infinity is the largest number in which our Awareness has any interest. If we have the same degree of interest in Zero as we have in Infinity, we will find that Unity is exactly half way between. This is quite apart from any scale of measurement and is a most important relationship. It is because *nothing in the universe is absolute except the basic concept of reality itself*. **Even geometrical relationships are tempered by the means by which we become aware of them. In establishing the Space Fabric, we have understood only the concepts which result from the application of the Quadrature Concept to the basic Concept of Reality. While we immediately recognize the results of these operations as the space within which we dwell, we must avoid implying other properties to it than can be derived directly from the basic premises. In other words, we have only space, with nothing in it. Anything which we may subsequently define within Space must be derived by further applications of the Quadrature Concept if it is to have any meaning. A further word may be said about scales of measurement. Within the space just described, there are no scales of measurement, and any positioning of awareness must of necessity be entirely arbitrary with one position being quite as good as any other. Relative positioning must of course remain relative regardless of how many positions may be established. A corollary of this is that Space is linear no matter where we investigate it, and this relationship must be accepted as fundamental. **Chapter IV** **The Field Fabric** In establishing the Space Fabric, the basic Concept of Reality was operated upon successively by the Quadrature Concept, giving the concepts of Length, Area", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:8:6379c3054232", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9592, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "be entirely arbitrary with one position being quite as good as any other.

Further operations with the Quadrature Concept will yield more relationships which, when established, may be recognized as parameters of the Universe in which Awareness finds itself. Since the relationships established to constitute the Field Fabric do not impinge upon our awareness as directly as does Space, except in their composite forms, some sort of language is needed to facilitate Understanding. To those having a mathematical background this presents no particular problem since the relationships are merely those of established Vector Algebra. To those not having such a background, understanding must be obtained through appreciation of the meanings of the actual words used. In any case, if the basic principles already set forth have been adequately understood, there should not be too great difficulty. A visualization of what is going on, extending upwards from Nothing-At-All as the Quadrature Concept is applied successively to Reality and its derivatives, is really what is called for. **The application of the Quadrature Concept to the Third Parameter yields a further parameter which we might describe as Density or gradient. This is really an expression of how Reality is distributed in Space. Vectorially it is the scalar view by awareness of the Volumetric parameter of Reality. It is the scale against which any change in Reality must be gauged. The Fourth Parameter is therefore essentially Change, the true Fourth Dimension.** There are many interesting implications which will be studied later in more detail. **If the Quadrature Concept is applied again, another partially familiar vectorial quantity results, namely Divergence, or the stable condition in which Awareness finds Reality. This is the Fifth Parameter,** which also presents some interesting implications which will be studied later. **The Sixth Parameter is developed by still another application of the Quadrature Concept to Reality, which gives the vectorial quantity Curl, or Deviation of Reality, which is essentially the dynamic aspect of Reality as perceived by Awareness.** At this point it is fairly obvious that our Universe is poly-dimensional in the truest sense of the word, even though the dimensions are not quite what we fancied they ought to be. They are more correctly parameters and are aspects of Reality established by Awareness through the mechanism of the Quadrature Concept.

Again, **we cannot say whether or not Reality could exist without Awareness, but we believe that they are actually separate manifestations of the same thing, and one is incomplete without the other.** In any case, so long as we are aware of our Universe, it must be through the Parameters which are inherent in it. And there are six more of them making twelve Parameters in all, after which the system closes on itself. These Twelve Parameters are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the Universe as we are aware of it. Although there is a smooth relationship following in the development of the various parameters, we find that they fall naturally into four fabrics of three parameters each. Just as each parameter has its unique characteristic, so each fabric has its own unique characteristics, which include those of the individual parameters and the interrelationships between them. It should be noted that in the development of the three parameters in the field fabric, the Quadrature Concept was applied in each case to the previously established parameter, and in its broader sense. This should not be confused with the mathematical manipulation of multiplying the previously established parameter by the square root of minus one, as this is an operation which will subsequently be employed and is similar to parallel processes which go on in the space fabric. While this distinction is fairly obvious in the space fabric, it may not be so obvious in the field fabric. Let us next look at those aspects of the Universe which impinge upon our awareness and which may possibly be identified with the parameters of the field fabric. **The Fourth Parameter, Change, reaches our awareness through our concept of Time, although we have here mistaken the shadow for the substance and vice versa.** A field is a region which has a unique characteristic. The space fabric, in displaying the characteristic of Change, has a unique characteristic, so that this characteristic which so appears can qualify as a field. But the field must be \"somewhere\". The space fabric fills this need, just as Area is necessary for the evolution of the concept of Volume. Suppose **we call this field of Change a Tempic Field to give it a name of its own, so that we can study its relationship to those things which impinge upon our awareness**. Inspection of the Concept shows that if the Change is great, the tempic field must be great.

Inspection of the Concept shows that if the Change is great, the tempic field must be great. But we associate Change with our Concept of Time, which is something against which we gauge a rate of change. Expressed mathematically, this rate can be written as dS/dt which expresses the manner in which something changes with respect to time. More explicitly this should be written as TS where T is the tempic field operator, and S is the aspect of Reality upon which it operates. A convenient, though only partially adequate description of the Tempic Field is \"Frequency\", since we recognize frequency as being a certain number of somethings per unit of time. It is dimensionally the reciprocal of Time. Heretofore we have always considered Time as an immutable flow against which everything involving Change could be measured, whereas, it is really the converse which is true; **Change is the basic concept and Time its derivative.** Unfortunately, our mathematics are geared to the Time concept and will require considerable reworking to fit them into this more precise concept. But when this is done, there will result a most elegant simplification in all the analysis involving time. In the meantime, **the transition in thinking can be made less painful if we merely regard Time as the consequence of the existence of a Tempic Field, **and this is by no means fixed. It may be interesting at this point to mention something about the velocity of light. This quantity is generally recognized to be something rather basic in our universe, being the \"rate at which space changes with time\". But when viewed in the light of this new field concept, it is merely the tempic field intensity, or how the tempic field is distributed in space. We have been told that light doesn't \"travel\"; it \"is\", which is an idea not at all foreign to the field concept. Of course, it follows that the velocity of light will be a constant only under conditions of constant tempic field. As this field changes, so will the velocity of light change. Having had a superficial look at the Tempic Field and its derivation, we may now allow our Awareness to inspect the next parameter, which is Divergence, to see if it is something which can be recognized. Previously we noted that Reality had to extend to infinity from zero in order to establish Space and that unity, so far as Awareness was concerned, lay half way between.

With the application of the Quadrature Concept to the parameter of Change or Tempic Field, Divergence is established, from which we derive a starting point at zero and a finish at infinity. Between these two limits and through unity there is divergence, which we can recognize as the Electric Field, but with the exception that there is no point charge at the zero. Our Awareness, however, established the \"charge\" at radius unity, with exactly one half of it being \"inside\" and the other half being \"outside\". The real significance of this boundary will be apparent when we study the tenth parameter. **When Divergence was established by Awareness, the Quadrature Concept was applied to the Tempic Field, so we may expect within the electric field two quantities, scalar and vector, or quantity and its manner of distribution.** These attributes we recognize immediately as pertaining to the electric fields with which we have experience. While the Tempic field is purely scalar, the application of the Quadrature Concept gave it an aspect which is vectorial in establishing the Electric Field, in that it now has \"direction\" as well as \"quantity\". In dealing with this parameter, both these aspects should always be included. Otherwise the analysis is bound to be incomplete. In other words, mere vectorial summation is not sufficient, and the scalar values must also be integrated. Also, we must get away from the idea that they are the manifestation of the fifth parameter from zero to infinity and in themselves are the reality. When Awareness inspects Divergence through the Quadrature Concept and establishes Curl, similar appreciation results, and **we see in Curl many of the characteristics of the Magnetic Field.** But again, we have a boundary within which is half the reality and outside of which is the other half. We call that within (or without) this boundary the magnetic moment. But again we cannot establish a point source. Also, dealing with magnetic fields, we must always include the scalar as well as the vectorial aspects. Just as Area has Length incorporated in it, and Volume has Area incorporated in it, so has the Electric Field the Tempic Field incorporated in it. Each of these three fields are mutually at right angles to each other. The three fields together are the manifestation of Reality in the Field Fabric as perceived by Awareness. **The interrelationships between these various fields manifests to our Awareness as Matter and Energy,** and the great variety of these manifestations is well known to us. **Chapter V** **The Control Fabric** The complete understanding", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:12:0697a3597306", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9596, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "has Area incorporated in it, so has the Electric Field the Tempic Field incorporated in it.

The three fields together are the manifestation of Reality in the Field Fabric as perceived by Awareness. **The interrelationships between these various fields manifests to our Awareness as Matter and Energy,** and the great variety of these manifestations is well known to us. **Chapter V** **The Control Fabric** The complete understanding of the Control Fabric is not easy, chiefly because by their very nature, our mathematics cannot be applied to it directly, and any analysis must be indirect. However, it is hoped that with some understanding of the Fabric, suitable mathematics will be evolved to deal with it. In any case, it should be realized the Understanding comes with increasing Awareness. If the basic concepts are understood, the rest will follow. Awareness, inspecting Reality, notices that the Tempic Field is to some extent everywhere, and except for any arbitrarily prescribed reference point is largely homogenous. The Electric Field, however, does have a reference point of its own, but other than this, it spreads out everywhere. The magnetic Field, in addition to having both the foregoing characteristics, has another one, namely orientation. **If the Quadrature Concept is applied to the Magnetic Field, it will be found that its orientation can be anything, or in other words, it is Random. **The probability of finding it in any particular orientation is exactly the same as for any other orientation. And while the Field itself has a unique characteristic, its display is strictly random. While this is a rather over-simplified derivation of the Seventh Parameter, it may be sufficient to guide thinking in the direction of its appreciation. And as has been said previously, this appreciation is purely personal. **In all previous applications of the Quadrature Concept by Awareness, the matter of choice did not arise, as how the Concept was applied did not make any difference. However, with the application of the Quadrature Concept to the magnetic Field, this is no longer the case, and a condition of asymmetry has been introduced which makes it necessary to decide how the Concept shall be applied. In fact, the application of the Concept is in itself a definition of the Eighth parameter, which is that of Decision, or Free Will.** **The Ninth parameter, however, again establishes symmetry, and leads to a concept of Sequence, or Order, or Specific Arrangement.** **Up to the Eighth Parameter, Awareness was largely in the position of Observer, and was unable to make any difference in the scheme of things in the Understanding of what happened when the Quadrature Concept was successively applied to the Basic Concept. However, with the Eighth Parameter, Awareness became part of the Scheme in that a difference could result.

However, with the Eighth Parameter, Awareness became part of the Scheme in that a difference could result. It is at this level that Free Will is exercised, even though we may have many ideas to the contrary. It is through this characteristic that we are able to control at least a part of this universe.** Increased understanding will of course make possible extension of control, to the extent that our Awareness actually does Understand. There is a price tag on this control through Free Will, however, in that the next application of the Quadrature Concept establishes a pattern which persists right around the cycle, and sequences are established which are directly consequential of the application of the Eighth Parameter. In our relationship with the Universe we see all sorts of applications of the Control Fabric, from Random, through Free Will and into Sequence, as well as all sorts of combinations of them. Again, as was the case in the lower fabrics, each Parameter includes the lower Parameters as well as extending the Concept to include a new one. Therefore, it follows that all higher Parameters than the Eighth will be subject to modification by Awareness, with proper Understanding. The modification will be the consequence of the operation on the asymmetry of the Field Fabric, and its consequences will be felt right up to the Twelfth Parameter. **Chapter VI** **The Percipitation Fabric** **Once Awareness has understood through the application of the Quadrature Concept, the establishment of the first nine Parameters, the further application of this Concept yields three more Parameters which bring Matter and Energy as we know them into being.** Again, as in the Third or Control Fabric, we have no tools except our own Awareness and understanding to follow through the evolvement of this Fabric. The two higher Fabrics require much more sophisticated manipulations than our mathematics are capable of to show the relationships existing between the lower Parameters and Fabrics and the higher ones. At our stage of evolvement we can reach them only through personal mental activity aided by hints and direction from others who have already passed this way. **The application of the Quadrature Concept to the Parameter of Sequence yields the Tenth Parameter, Form. It was previously mentioned that there is a unique value between zero and infinity called Unity, where exactly half the Reality is \"inside\" and half is \"outside\".

While it is true for formal mathematics and may be so established, it is also universally true outside of this discipline, that no amount of manipulation can alter the value of unity and it always remains the fulcrum about which all other values pivot, regardless of scale.** The Tenth Parameter attaches a special significance to this value in that it becomes the apparent boundary of Reality. It is at once apparent that there is no prescription of any \"absolute\" quantity of Reality, or any scale of dimensions at all in this derivation. Therefore it follows that any and all Reality will manifest Form such that its apparent boundary will manifest half of the Reality inside and half outside. We do not know, and may never know, the total amount of Reality in the Universe, but the Form of the Universe will be such that half the Reality is inside and half outside. At the other extreme, the smallest bit of Reality that we can discern will also have this characteristic of one half being inside and the other half outside. **The next application of the Quadrature Concept yields the Parameter of Multiplicity, where more than one Form is established. Remembering that each Parameter contains within itself all lower Parameters, any and all deviations will reflect in the higher parameters.** The Eleventh Parameter will allow individualization in Form as a consequence. This may not be at once obvious, but it is the mechanism by which the various bits and pieces of matter and energy came into being, actually a coagulation of substance out of the basic Reality. **When the Quadrature Concept is again applied, there results the Parameter of Aggregation, or Assembly of bits into a Purposeful Structure. In this region resides the recognizable universe**, animate and inanimate. It is the degree of exercise of Free Will that distinguishes between these two realms. **Further application of the Quadrature Concept merely offsets the universe from itself, which is the same as another linear dimension or First Parameter and the system closes on itself. Therefore, within the Universe as we are aware of it, there are only these Twelve Parameters. They are the necessary and sufficient conditions for our Universe as we know it. All of which we are aware can be defined in terms of these Parameters, and it is the duty and responsibility of Science to do so.** Having established twelve Parameters through our Awareness observing the Basic Reality through the Quadrature Concept, the question naturally arises regarding the place of Awareness in the Universe.

Since none of the Parameters in any way establishes Awareness, yet Awareness observes all twelve, it must occupy some unique position relative thereto. This is true, but its understanding is not aided by the Reality of the universe and again it becomes a personal matter. The following analogy may assist in visualizing to some extent the relative structure of the universal parameters and Awareness. Consider a sphere which is completely surrounded by twelve other spheres of the same size. All the spheres are in contact, and all the outer spheres are in contact with the inner. Only three spheres and the inner sphere can have mutual contact under any one circumstance. Radius of these three spheres may be mutually at right angles and the radius of the inner sphere may be in line with any one of these. Depending on the starting point and progression, all spheres may be inspected sequentially, without any preference. A quadrature relationship is possible between any three spheres, including the central one. All these relationships are valid with respect to the relationships existing among the twelve parameters and Awareness. **Chapter VII** **The Basic Particle** Establishing the Twelve Parameters of the Universe, in their four Fabrics of Three Parameters each, makes it possible to study from the point of view of the Creator the evolution of the basic building blocks out of which our Universe is constructed. Considering the evolution of one particle only, we need go no higher than the first seven parameters, actually holding the seventh constant. The higher Parameters enter the scene only when we want to do something with the particle so established. **The first three Parameters set up a framework in space within which the particle will appear. The next three will provide the wherewithal with which to make it. We can work with Length, Area and Volume, Tempic, Electric and Magnetic Fields, and all needed relationships between them. Our result will of course not be a true particle, because the higher Parameters will not have been applied;** for example, it will not display Form, but will be diffuse from zero to infinity. In the establishment of the Space Fabric, the repeated application of the Quadrature Concept stepped up the available dimensions to three, but it also made possible all sorts of quadrature relationships within this framework. Similarly, in the establishment of the Field Fabric, three field regions were established with quadrature relationships between them. Furthermore,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:16:84be4142655c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9600, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "a true particle, because the higher Parameters will not have been applied;** for example, it will not display Form, but will be diffuse from zero to infinity.

Similarly, in the establishment of the Field Fabric, three field regions were established with quadrature relationships between them. Furthermore, there exists complete quadrature freedom between the field and space fabric, so that in effect we work in a Six Dimensional Continuum. **It is easy to appreciate the large number of possibilities among the many permutations and combinations of spatial dimensions and fields, but the real problem is to sort out the actuality from the possibility.** This can be done only by continual cross-reference to observation of Reality; i.e., by asking Mother Nature the right questions. We can be reasonably certain, however, of one thing: there will not be any unused Parameters, and the final result of the studies will involve all six. Since we have no senses by which we can become directly aware of the various fields, we will have to depend on the second hand data made available through our instruments. Here we must be extremely careful to distinguish between the phenomenon itself and the effects of the phenomenon on the instruments. Also, we must be particularly careful in posing our questions to nature, so that they ask exactly what we want to find out and are not ambiguous. **In developing the twelve Parameters, the Quadrature Concept was applied between Awareness and the next lower Parameter, but it may also be applied between any aspects of any Parameters, or any derivatives of them.** In doing this, however, it is most necessary to realize just what is being done, and to understand the relationships which are involved. Furthermore, we must never forget that we are dealing with Reality, and even though certain aspects may become zero, the Reality never vanishes. Conversely, any aspect which extends to infinity is still reality. Since it was established that reality does extend in all cases from zero to infinity, it follows that if there is to be particularization as made possible by the eleventh Parameter, there must be \"overlap\" among certain aspects. This simply means that in the field fabric it is possible to have fields that exist independently amongst themselves and independently of any \"background\" which may also exist. In fact, we do not know directly at present how much \"unpercipitated Reality\" there is in the universe, which will of course appear as a uniform background to the precipitated Reality with which we exist.

Whether or not fields stick together and add up to a single field depends entirely on the antecedents of the field. If the fields are of unit particles, they will become coherent for more than half of the reality to be held in common, when the little bits combine to form a big bit. If a field is produced by the simultaneous behavior of lots of particles or other fields, then it will be coherent, so long as more than half its reality exists in common. These are basic principles and form the subject matter of a series of interesting and enlightening experiments. When understood, they provide an elegant interpretation of much data being pondered by students of these matters. **The transition between coherent and incoherent fields results from conditions which bring more or less than half of the reality in common, and the \"stability\" is purely a function of how close to \"half\" the system actually is.** In manipulating fields and applying the Quadrature Concept between them, we must understand that what we are really doing is allowing one field to operate on another. The operation of A on b is not necessarily the same as the operation of B on A, although there can be relationships between these two operations. Successive operations will go right around the circle and back to the starting point provided certain conditions are met. These conditions will become apparent later. **There is basically no difference between particles and radiated energy, except one of structure and configuration. Both contain Reality and are made up of fields in space, and are subject to the higher Parameters. We can say that radiated energy is \"extended\" and that matter is \"re-entrant\", to describe loosely their configurations and structures.** With the foregoing in mind we can now explore what happens when the various fields are operated upon by each other. **When an electric field is operated upon by a tempic field, i.e., changed, a magnetic field results. When a magnetic field is operated upon by a tempic field, i.e., changed, an electric field results. **A tempic field should result when an electric field operates on a magnetic field, but the trick is to make it do so. Also, we would like to know what happens when a tempic field is operated upon by an electric field or a magnetic field. A tempic field is largely amorphous and has direction only in relation to its own gradient in space, while both the electric and magnetic fields have vectorial aspects in addition to their scalar aspects.

A tempic field is largely amorphous and has direction only in relation to its own gradient in space, while both the electric and magnetic fields have vectorial aspects in addition to their scalar aspects. Therefore, we could hardly expect complete symmetry among the operations of these three fields. We can, however, work through an intermediate arrangement whereby we generate the desired field with its interaction already built into it. Whether or not there is a limit to this sort of operation we do not know, but it certainly hasn't been found yet. It is a valid approach so long as we keep the basic rules constantly in mind. As an introductory exercise consider the operation of a tempic field on an electric field by the simple expedient of having the electric field move. A magnetic field will be produced and will have a certain specific orientation. The vectorial direction of the magnetic field will be mutually at right angles to the direction of the electric field and its motion. Now, since the magnetic field is a curl function, its divergence over the entire field must be zero. In order to bring this about the magnetic field must operate on either or both of the other fields to close the system somehow, somewhere. One such method would be for this operation to increase the tempic field on one side and decrease it on the other, so that the motion would close into a loop. This implies the operation of the magnetic field on the electric field to produce a tempic field. If the structure of the three fields is understood, the validity of this operation is at once apparent, which establishes another principle; namely, that when a magnetic field, produced by a moving electric field, is moved longitudinally, a tempic field is produced. More thinking about this exercise discloses the fact that if this system merely closes on itself, the divergence, which is the electric field is eliminated, so that the only way in which the system can be self-sustaining is for it to close toroidally, so that there will be components of all three fields in all directions. That this is in fact the model of the basic particle of the universe in which we exist is amply borne out by experiment, because it displays a tempic field, an electric field, and a magnetic moment. The electric polarity depends on whether the spiral is right- or left-handed.

The electric polarity depends on whether the spiral is right- or left-handed. Inspection of this model discloses the fact that the tempic field will drop off as the inverse distance from the center of the toroid, the electric field will drop off as the inverse square of this distance, and the magnetic field will drop off as the inverse cube. What fields we observe with our instrumentation in the vicinity of such a particle will be the summation of the particle fields, the fields of all other particles, and the unresolved background fields of the fabric itself. Possibly a clearer understanding of the structure of the basic particle may be had by considering the composition, orientation, and interaction of the entire field structure, considered together as a unit. Looking at the composite field structure shows us three fields at right angles to each other. There is the tempic with its gradient in one direction, the electric with its divergence in a direction at right angles to it and including it, and the magnetic at right angles to the other two and including both of them. For self-sustaining conditions, the operation of each upon the other, there must be one-for-one relationships between them. Therefore the real movement under stable self-sustaining conditions will be in the vectorial 1,1,1 direction, or exactly midway among the three directions of the component fields. The skew progression of the fields results in a double closure of the system, which will have both rotation and precession. It is readily apparent that since the tempic field only must have a specified gradient, the other two fields have two possible orientations, which will result in two directions of possible rotation and two directions of possible precession. The electric polarity of the particle will be the resultant of the coherent fields arising from both the rotation and precession, and can have two values of positive and two values of negative. Because of the necessary geometrical conditions imposed by the nature of space itself, the precessional field will be smaller than the rotational field giving particles having two values of positive charge rather close together and two negative equally close together. The significance of these differences in charges will be discussed later in the chapter on gravity, as well as some very interesting circumstances arising out of the skew condition, particularly at close range. **Chapter VIII** **Radiated Energy** The basic tempic particle resulted from the operation of the tempic field on the electric field through movement.

The only change possible under these conditions would have been an increase or decrease in the electric field through the operation of the tempic field. It would have had to inject its own quadrature relationship in order to exist. Therefore, the tempic field must in itself carry the quadrature concept, which simply means that it becomes a sinusoidally varying alternating field in the single space location. Now, if the tempic field varies at any point in space, adjacent to that point there must be tempic field gradients, or \"velocities\". Since the electric field has a definite orientation, and consequently the magnetic field resulting from the tempic field operation will also have a definite orientation, it will in turn produce a further tempic field of definite orientation which will be coherent with the original field, increasing it in one direction and reducing it in the other direction. The whole business can therefore become self-sustaining only if it darts off in this particular direction with the velocity of light, or in the direction of the establishing tempic field gradient. It is readily apparent that we cannot avoid space getting into the picture in some way or other. If we permit things to travel through space, they just go round and round and stay in one place. But if we try to make them stay in one place they dart off with the velocity of light! Furthermore, **the difference between matter and radiated energy is very similar to that between Direct Current and Alternating Current. Otherwise, there is very little difference between the two forms of the expression of Reality.** As coherence is possible among particles if more than half the reality is common, so is coherence possible in radiated energy if more than half the reality is in common. The extent to which the tempic field makes use of the quadrature concept in its operation will reflect in the \"wave length\" of the radiation, which in turn will reflect the quantity of reality involved. The maximum values of the electric and magnetic fields will be those existing in the region where the radiated energy originated, since there is no concept in this universe for Negative Reality, and the operations must be on the total coherent fields present. This same reasoning applies to the size and maximum fields of the basic", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:21:45295b95b691", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9605, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "quadrature concept in its operation will reflect in the \"wave length\" of the radiation, which in turn will reflect the quantity of reality involved. The maximum values of the electric and magnetic fields will be those existing in the region where the radiated energy originated, since there is no concept in this universe for Negative Reality, and the operations must be on the total coherent fields present. This same reasoning applies to the size and maximum fields of the basic particle. It follows that where radiated energy originates in fabrics having appreciably different background fields, its wavelength will be different from that of equivalent radiated energy originating in more familiar fabric. Within the universe which we perceive, we are reasonably satisfied that the maximum value of all the coherent fields involved in our particles and radiated energy have the same value. Planck's Constant is the numerical expression of this value. The velocity of light is the expression of the numerical value of the tempic field intensity. Whether or not other universes can and do exist having other numerical values, and what the relationships ought to be between them, is quite another matter, subject to entirely separate consideration. In the previous consideration, the operation of the tempic field on the electric field was proposed as the starting point. If, however, the initial operation was on the magnetic field, an additional complication gets injected. The electric field so generated can have its required divergence only if the whole system is folded back on itself. This establishes a condition where the magnetic field is entirely closed on itself about a tempic field \"core\", with the electric field interlaced with alternating polarity. Picturesquely, it would look like a string of magnetic doughnuts of alternating magnetic direction, stuck together with electrostatic icing of alternating polarity, and all threaded into a string of increased tempic field and placed inside a tube of decreased tempic field. A most complicated picture, but one which does exist in this universe and has some most remarkable properties. For lack of a better name it is called \"tensor energy\". Tensor energy carries its tempic field with it, so it is therefore not subject to propagation, and both ends of the beam are actually simultaneous (interval zero). The beam does not dissipate and has the same numerical values at the receiving end as it has at the transmitting end. Regardless of the combination of field conditions encountered at the receiving end, the same relationships are maintained as existed at the transmitting end. Reversing the initial polarity of the magnetic field will place decreased tempic field on the inside and increased on the outside, so that several tensor beams can be stuck together as a \"cable\".

The only manifestation external to the beam itself is the tempic field gradient of the outer sheath. **Chapter IX** **Building Blocks of Matter** When the basic particle was developed, it was tacitly stated that only the first six parameters would be considered. However, during the development there were many instances when the higher Parameters were invoked, particularly those of the Fourth Fabric, so that not only could the particle itself be visualized, but some idea might evolve as to how it might be related to other particles. When all the parameters have been applied, there exists a particle, having form, along with many others of its kind, and having certain definite relationships to them, and possible combinations with others to form purposeful aggregates. **Two particles will merge into a single particle if they can be so arranged that more than half the reality is in common. Since the basic particle is shaped like a toroid, stacking them is rather obviously the way to achieve this.** We can put them together alternately with opposite polarities until we reach a point where this basic condition no longer holds. Remembering that the tempic field is an inverse distance field, the electric is an inverse square field, and the magnetic is an inverse cube field, the coherence of the various fields will be different, and there will be reached limits beyond which the system will not be stable with simple stacking. We can then stick the stacks together sideways, and then stick another stack on the ends of the resulting assembly, and so on. **Electrons and positrons as we know them are basic particles. Protons and neutrons are simply stacks of these with either an even or odd number in the stack. Mesons are merely fragmented stacks.** There are quite a variety of other bits and pieces made up of basic particles stuck together through their field coherence, with varying degrees of stability being displayed according to how close to the half-in-half-out rule they are. Since it is rather obvious that **no pattern of stacking can ever make all the fields involved equally interpenetrating, there must be some pattern of leftover fields manifesting outside the composite particle. These are the fields which establish the characteristics of matter as we know it.** Study of the relative configurations of the electric and magnetic fields establishes the electric charge and the configuration of the family of basic particles which the composite", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:23:870f4a19d04c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9607, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "close to the half-in-half-out rule they are.

These are the fields which establish the characteristics of matter as we know it.** Study of the relative configurations of the electric and magnetic fields establishes the electric charge and the configuration of the family of basic particles which the composite particle attracts. The electrons will drift into the electric field and then attach themselves over appropriate poles, to an extent that interpenetration can be established between electron fields and the residual fields of the composite particle. The number of poles and the number of unit charges determine the \"elements\" as we identify these systems. The tempic field, being purely scalar in nature merely contributes to the manner in which changes can occur in the system. If, however, through some characteristic of configuration, the tempic field within a composite particle displays some irregularity, this will manifest as a \"vibration\". And if the magnitude of the vibration is such as to cause the interpenetrating fields to exceed the half-and-half point, the whole system will come apart: radioactivity. When a system does come apart, those fields which were coherent and interpenetrating in the correct proportion will remain so and take off down the tempic field gradient and become radiated energy. The fields which contribute to the internal \"attractions\" of atoms are the electric and magnetic, supplemented by secondary fields resulting from any further operations between the basic field parameters. These fields form a static pattern, which is dynamic only when tempic field irregularities occur. The difference in energy levels is the extent to which the fields are coherent in the proportions to form radiated energy, which can enter or leave the system upon appropriate arrangement of its components. At this point it may be well to call attention to a simple but often overlooked principle. **Since all Reality in this universe must conform to the parameter of Form, it must always display the characteristic of being half-in and half-out. This rule also applies to energy, either quantized or amorphous. Energy always exists in conjunction with its conjugate. In other words, in any reaction involving energy, we see only one half the energy involved; the other half is either inside or outside from our point of concern.** It is most fortunate that this is so, otherwise the universe wouldn't work! In developing our understanding of radiated energy, we made certain initial assumptions, i.e., that we did have a field upon which we could operate, that this field was sufficiently detached, and that the operation was so isolated that it could be considered quite apart from any interaction with other fields or particles.

Rather obviously this does not represent a real condition. In nature we always find a close association between matter and energy somewhere in the scheme of things, usually at both ends of the system. So we should have a closer look at the interaction of matter and energy, always bearing in mind that they are both different aspects of the same Reality. The reason that fields curl around to form material particles is because tempic fields are generated which increase the time available on one side of the system and decrease it on the other. Therefore, whenever any degree of asymmetry is introduced into a coherent field system, it will change direction. And if the conditions are right for the system to be self-sustaining, a particle will be formed. Conversely, if a discontinuity is introduced sufficient to disturb the closure of a system, the differences in the tempic field distribution will disappear and the particle will dart off as radiated energy. When particles merge to such an extent that the interpenetration of the fields exceeds the halfway point, and an asymmetry is introduced. A tempic field gradient is established away from the system in the direction bisecting so that two bits of radiated energy take off in both directions down these gradients. Conversely, when two approximately equal bits of radiated energy merge beyond the halfway point, a deviation in direction of the tempic field takes place which, if it can be maintained, allows the bits of radiated energy to merge into a particle. Within a complex structure of particles there may be coherent field systems, which if disturbed may acquire a linear tempic field gradient, such that a bit of the Reality will take off down this gradient and radiation will be emitted by the structure. With the curling in on itself of radiated energy, if the geometry is correct, the alternating field aspects flow into a uni-directional arrangement. Conversely, when a particle unwraps to form radiation, a quadrature phase is introduced in the field relationships. With an understanding of the basic particle, the structure of radiated energy, and the transition mechanism, we do in fact have the understanding of how this universe is put together and how it operates.

Here and there we can confirm our understanding by reference to experiment, in the full knowledge that we will pose our questions correctly, and that nature will give us explicit answers. **Chapter X** **Forces** In the evolution of the twelve Parameters of the Universe by the Quadrature Concept on the Basic Concept in Nothing-At-All, such questions as the forces involved and the energy which became apparent did not arise. These matters come into being only when the twelve Parameters have been established, and we find that what goes on in this universe requires some understanding of these factors. A field is a region which has a unique characteristic. The unique characteristics of fields were established by the operation of the Quadrature Concept on the Space Fabric, and then in turn on the fields as each was established. In the earlier stages of this development, before the application of the parameters higher than the Sixth, we could not discern the presence of these factors in the amorphous background of the field and space fabrics; only the Reality which had been established. Subsequent applications of the Quadrature Concept provided Control and Percipitation, but **none of the Fabrics added anything beyond what existed in Nothing-At-All as perceived by Awareness. All Reality which existed or can exist was provided by the Creator in that original state. Awareness merely established how it was arranged to establish the universe as we know it.** We generally think of a Force as something which pulls or pushes against some sort of resistance, and as such have a pretty fair, but superficial, idea of what it is. In the establishment of the Space Fabric, **Force is what stretched a Point into a Line and kept it there. It is what pulled a line out sideways to make an area and held it there, and what pushed the area apart into a volume and sustained it. Force provided the means by which the density of Reality in Space was adjusted to form the Tempic Field. It also provided the means by which the Tempic Field was given a Divergence to establish the Electric Field, the means by which the Electric Field was given a Curl to establish the Magnetic Field, and the means by which these fields were sustained.** Force, in turn establishes the parameters of the Control Fabric and the Percipitation Fabric, and makes possible the establishment of Matter and Energy as we know them. In other words, each operation with the Quadrature Concept involves a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:26:009f5eb24555", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9610, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 27, "text": "provided the means by which the Tempic Field was given a Divergence to establish the Electric Field, the means by which the Electric Field was given a Curl to establish the Magnetic Field, and the means by which these fields were sustained.** Force, in turn establishes the parameters of the Control Fabric and the Percipitation Fabric, and makes possible the establishment of Matter and Energy as we know them. In other words, each operation with the Quadrature Concept involves a Force arrangement, and the magnitude and significance of each of the Forces depends on the manipulation carried out and the Fabric in which it is being done. Conversely, forces always develop whenever Reality is modified, and always in the Fabric where the modification takes place. **It takes the combined manipulation of all three Parameters in any one Fabric to extend a force into another Fabric,** which, needless to say, is a rather special arrangement. We say that Energy is the ability to do work, or the ability to establish a force which will operate against a resistance over a certain prescribed distance. But these ideas are not quite basic enough to relate Force with the basic Reality. Looking at a region of unit size in which there is a field, we note that this field came into being because of the Quadrature Concept, a Force, and is being sustained by this Force. The Unique Characteristic which describes this field says that there is a difference between opposite sides of the unit region in the direction of the field, and therefore the field must be stressed against itself in this direction, and therefore the Reality so expressed is the product of the field intensity with itself, so that the total Reality within the total field will be the integrated value of this \"Field Intensity Squared\" over the entire space occupied by the field, bearing in mind the half-in-half-out relationship of Form. Or we can concern ourselves with the Reality or Energy within a limited region only and perform the integration over that region. There is a very interesting factor which enters the picture at this point called the Principle of Inversion. If a region is selected in which there are two fields of the same kind, same magnitude and same direction, such that very nearly half the Reality of each is within the region, then the two fields are just on the edge of becoming coherent. If the fields are not coherent, the total energy in the region is the sum of the energies of the two fields, i.e., twice the square of the field intensity of each integrated over the region. If, however, the fields are coherent, the total energy is the square of twice the field intensity integrated over the region, or twice the energy of the two fields incoherent!

If, however, the fields are coherent, the total energy is the square of twice the field intensity integrated over the region, or twice the energy of the two fields incoherent! This relationship is most significant as it represents the \"packing energy\" of the bits and pieces in atomic nuclei. It also points the way to the precipitation of energy out of the cosmic background. When we take a look at the mechanics of matter we find some interesting relationships. Kinetic energy, or the energy of change, is one half the mass times the velocity squared. But the velocity is the reciprocal of the gradient of reality or the tempic field, from which it appears **the energy is one half the mass times the tempic field intensity squared, integrated over the region involved in the change. If the mass is taken as the density of reality times the volume it occupies, the fact that twice as much energy appears indicates that the fields making up matter are coherent.** This again is an important relationship as it pertains to the chopping up of matter. **Chapter XI** **Gravity** The twelve Parameters of the Universe are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the establishment of our Universe as we know it, and together with the unique position of Awareness forms our entire experience in this physical world. All of which we are or can be aware are expressable in terms of these twelve Parameters. Gravity is a phenomenon with which we have daily experience, but about which we haven't learned very much, working backwards as we do from effect to cause. The fact that objects fall when given an opportunity to do so, experiencing an acceleration which appears to have very nearly the same value on this planet for all falls, leads us to the conclusion that it is somehow an inertial phenomenon. The added fact that ordinary manipulations appear not to affect gravity leads to the conclusion that somehow gravity is inherent in matter itself. By studying the effects of gravity and keeping close track of the numerical quantities involved, we have established some rules respecting forces, energy and interactions, all of which allow us to work with gravity as we find it, but there it stops. Since matter and energy are manifestations of Reality entirely within the Twelve parameters, we must look for explanations of their behavior within the structure of these parameters, and regardless of any ideas to the contrary, this is where we will find it!

The field fabric sets up three, and three only, fields which are capable of exercising forces on the field structures which constitute matter and energy. So gravity must be due to the operation of one or more of these three fields. **The fact that observation indicates that gravity falls off as the inverse square of the distance indicates that it is essentially an electric field, divergence.** The fact that we cannot cancel it out by the application of the electric fields to which we have access is due to the fact that we cannot make the canceling field coherent. The best we can do is to integrate the effects of the fields, not the fields themselves, to produce an opposing force in a limited region. The inertial approach involves the application of a particular tempic field gradient, carefully adjusted so that its effects are consistent with observation, but this implies certain flexibilities in the space fabric inconsistent with its established linear nature. Another inertial concept of gravity is the all-pervading micro-particular gas, the units of which impinge on matter and, through an exchange of momentum, press the matter together. The difficulty of this concept is the necessity for explaining the inflow of energy to matter, which implies either an energy sink within matter or an obscure energy exchange phenomenon between the regions within and without matter. **When the basic particle was being considered, it was established that four kinds of particles were possible: right hand and left hand spin and right hand and left hand precession, which gave particles having positive charges with plus and minus increments, but all having the same magnetic moments and tempic fields. Within these particles, and within systems made up of them as atoms, etc., there is field coherence, so that there are specific values for these fields determined by the particles themselves, and outside of them the fields will also be quite specific.** Looking at the model of the basic particle, it is noted that the electric field is a dynamic condition resulting from the mutual interaction of the three basic fields. But since the tempic field is a gradient, it is in itself not \"motional\". The radial component of the electric field being divergence and having no component along either of the tempic field gradient directions also is not motional. These fields are essentially static so long as the particle itself doesn't move or change. However, the skew component of the electric field, due to the precession, does have a component along a tempic field gradient", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:29:c64daeb3e146", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9613, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "of the three basic fields.

These fields are essentially static so long as the particle itself doesn't move or change. However, the skew component of the electric field, due to the precession, does have a component along a tempic field gradient and is motional. Therefore, field coherence is possible within the static structure due to spin, but not within the dynamic structure due to precession, unless the configuration is such that the skew field can comply with the half-and-half Form condition. It is fairly obvious from the foregoing that **only matter having the same direction of precession will assemble into large aggregates,** first, because of the selective action of the differences in forces resulting from the differences in electric charges, and second, because the interpenetration of particles of opposite precession will introduce an asymmetry in the system resulting in its immediate conversion into radiated energy. There are, however, a few special configurations where fairly large aggregates are involved and where the initial fields already had an asymmetry which could be offset by the asymmetry introduced by the particle with the reversed precession, so that the whole system may be stable. Consequently, in the evolution of our universe, we would expect a separation process to take place which would result in matter of essentially the same precession congregating together, and a fairly quick conversion to radiated energy of particles of opposite precession which happened to wander into such regions. In considering the integration of basic particles to form the larger units of matter, there is a slight advantage for the particles with the larger total electric charge to so integrate, because suitable configurations will permit coherence of the skew fields.** In any aggregate system such as a planet, there is bound to be a continual circulation of particles, both basic and composite, so that after many cycles of such circulation, most of the big ones congregate in the nuclei and the little ones take up outer positions.** This is the condition which we find now, as we inspect the matter to which we have access. When the aforementioned separation has taken place and most of the particles of opposite precession have been eliminated, we find that the system contains nuclei having one specific charge with electron shells having the opposite charge. **The matter on planet Earth has positive charges dominant in the nucleus and negative charges in the shells, and as free particles. Elsewhere in the universe there will be an aggregate of the converse relationship.** An aggregate of matter such as we have on Earth, where the sort-out is reasonably complete, will be electrically neutral so far as the electric fields", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:30:b1e5c1a04697", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9614, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "eliminated, we find that the system contains nuclei having one specific charge with electron shells having the opposite charge. **The matter on planet Earth has positive charges dominant in the nucleus and negative charges in the shells, and as free particles.

It may or may not have a magnetic moment depending on how random the orientation of the various particles is, again determined by the summation of the effects of the fields ̈ and a tempic field which will be the direct scalar summation of the many contributing tempic fields. It will also have the skew electric fields of the same polarity as the nuclei. With the exception of the skew fields, all the other external fields of the aggregate may be considered as static because they have no component of the tempic field at right angles to them. The skew fields, on the other hand, are dynamic because they do have a quadrature tempic field component. Furthermore, the skew fields are largely incoherent simply because the normal, almost random orientation precludes their meeting the half-in requirement of Form to become coherent. **Since the skew fields do have a tempic field component at right angles, they will generate an electric field throughout the entire region of the same polarity as the static electric field to which they are additive.** Such an aggregate may be considered as having two electric fields, one of which is subject to cancellation by surrounding electric particle fields, and the other not so subject. Partial cancellation is possible, and if the aggregate is left to its own devices, it will be attained by a surrounding shell of particles of the opposite polarity, so that externally to the entire system, the effects of the fields will be a minimum and electrically neutral. However, if another aggregate of similar precession enters the vicinity, such cancellation can no longer be approximated, and the skew field induces an electric field within this aggregate which amounts to an electric field distortion or \"polarization\". A convenient way of discussing what happens is to consider the skew fields and the polarization in terms of electric \"charges\", even though this concept is not strictly correct. If the primary aggregate is considered to have a charge which induces the polarization in the secondary aggregate, this polarization will be equivalent to a charge displacement, such that the product of the displaced charges and the distance through which they are displaced will be a statement of the amount of polarization. This will be located in the electric field of the primary aggregate and will have two forces acting which will be numerically equal; one maintaining the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:31:8c55ffb79616", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 9615, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "energy__wilbur_smith_new_science", "chunk_index": 32, "text": "strictly correct.

Therefore, **the net force will be the product of the primary field divergence and the square of the polarization in the secondary aggregate.** There are of course other ways of establishing this relationship, but they all say the same thing in other words, which is that **Gravity is a dynamic field function and is the product of the gravitational field divergence and the square of the polarization induced in the attracted bit of matter, with the gravitational field being merely the skew electric field.** For the mathematician the following is offered: Polarization in the attracted bit is q(q dr) Equating forces q(q dr) = Qq/r2 + Qq/(r + dr)2 Gravity F= Qq/r2 + Qq/(r + dr)2 = (q dr)2 1/r Having established the nature of Gravity and its \"formula\", we may now see what can be done with it. Since it is essentially an electric field phenomenon, albeit not an electrostatic one, its distribution and behavior will be much the same as any other electric field, except for its dynamic characteristic. **Altering the polarization will alter the force exerted by gravity, but because this is a square relationship, no such alteration can make the force negative (operate in the opposite direction). However, altering the divergence will alter both the magnitude and direction of the force, and the trick for controlling gravity is precisely this.** Since the gravitational field is due to the skew electric field, or stated differently, to the induction from the motional electric field, this is the logical region to explore for the mechanism by which fields may be produced to combine with the gravitational field and produce a resultant, having a divergence more to our liking. In taking a quick look at the gravitational relationships of the basic particles alone, there are some interesting aspects. Since in an established region practically all the precessions are the same, the free particles will have a motional field of polarity the same as the particles making up the composite ones. They will therefore be \"repelled\" by gravity. This repulsion, however, will be quite a bit less than the electrostatic attraction, so a compromise position will be established at such a distance that everything will be in equilibrium. In the atomic structure there are therefore the electric field forces holding the electrons onto the nucleus, the magnetic forces fixing them", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:energy__wilbur_smith_new_science.txt:32:44126d4c41ac", "wtk_id": NaN}]
