Immediate Release Unprecedented case highlights censorship of physicians Board s abuse of power and harsh penalties for doctors who deviate from government dictated treatment guidelines Washington D C Meryl Nass M D a member of Children s Health Defense CHD Science Advisory Board filed a complaint yesterday in the U S District Court for the District of Maine against the Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine BOLIM claiming that the Board s retaliatory conduct for Nass s discussions of COVID 19 treatments violates both the U S Constitution and the Maine State Constitution Charging that the Board denied Dr Nass her First Amendment rights by chilling the Plaintiff s free speech and assembly the complaint also demands a jury trial Dr Nass a board certified internist who began practicing medicine in the state of Maine in 1997 has testified before Congress on six occasions and is an acknowledged expert on anthrax bioterrorism the anthrax vaccine and Gulf War syndrome In the face of the COVID 19 pandemic Dr Nass spoke frankly about the government s handling of the pandemic the efficacy of mask mandates the suppression of effective medications to treat COVID 19 and safety risks associated with COVID 19 vaccines In the fall of 2021 BOLIM issued a Position Statement threatening all Maine doctors with disciplinary action if they spread COVID 19 vaccine misinformation Dr Nass is one of several doctors whose medical licenses have been threatened or suspended for not adhering to rigid government protocols for COVID 19 treatment Following an executive session on Jan 11 2022 BOLIM suspended Dr Nass s license without a hearing initially accusing her of unprofessional and disruptive behavior spreading misinformation and prescribing hydroxychloroquine and a deworming medication ivermectin to patients The Board also ordered Dr Nass to undergo a neuropsychological evaluation despite having no evidence of mental illness nor substance abuse as required for a mental examination under BOLIM S guidelines BOLIM withdrew the accusations of misinformation on Sept 26 2022 just prior to the first hearing date Oct 11 2022 BOLIM s case now rests on Nass s alleged non adherence to the medical standard of care as it pertained to ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID 19 despite the Food and Drug Administration s acknowledgment in recent oral argument before the Fifth Circuit

Fraud in Omnibus Autism Proceeding Link copied Return to Press Releases Press Release For Immediate Release Washington D C Children s Health Defense CHD Senior Staff Attorney Rolf Hazlehurst today filed a motion in the U S Court of Federal Claims alleging that the U S Department of Justice DOJ representing the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS committed fraud in its representation of HHS in the Omnibus Autism Proceeding OAP in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program NVICP The OAP was established to consolidate and adjudicate the approximately 5 400 claims filed on behalf of children who regressed into autism following vaccination In 2003 Hazlehurst filed a claim in the program on behalf of his son Yates diagnosed with autism after suffering adverse reactions following routine childhood vaccines Hazlehurst s claim was one of six original test cases in 2007 that would decide the fate of all the other claims in the OAP According to the newly filed motion the DOJ attorneys engaged in a series of acts of fraud upon the courts beginning in the NVICP and ultimately impacting the Supreme Court of the United States In the NVICP DOJ attorneys concealed from the special masters and petitioners that the government s top expert witness a world renowned pediatric neurologist revised his opinion on whether vaccines can cause autism The expert explained to the DOJ attorneys that vaccines can cause autism in a subset of children The witness had been scheduled to testify in the first test case in the OAP However the DOJ abruptly dismissed him as a witness once they learned of his clarification Without the witness s knowledge DOJ attorneys repeatedly misrepresented his prior case specific written opinion in the OAP to argue there is no scientific basis that vaccines cause autism Ultimately all of the 5 400 OAP claims were dismissed leaving vaccine injured children and their families with no recourse The DOJ s first act of fraud upon the court snowballed into a massive scheme of deception with far reaching implications Their fraudulent scheme denied justice to Yates and the thousands of other children in the OAP said Hazlehurst By hiding that their own expert s opinion had changed to favor Yates and other children in the OAP the DOJ effectively closed the NVICP s doors to the injured children with similar claims who have followed Watching my

to the plate tell the truth about what happened to these vaccine injured children and dismantle a rogue system that answers to Pharma instead of to the children it s supposed to protect The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 Vaccine Act took away parents ability to sue vaccine manufacturers for death or injuries to their children following vaccination Instead they must pursue compensation from HHS through the NVICP Opponents of the compensation program say that it is a one sided disaster pitting hard working and law abiding parents and their children against a government adjudicated and well funded system of attorneys where the children are denied their Seventh Amendment rights of a trial by jury and basic rules of evidence and discovery available in state and federal courts Vaccine makers walk away with billions in profits with no liability for dangerous products which is bad enough said CHD General Counsel Kim Mack Rosenberg But today s motion goes even further alleging fraud on the part of government lawyers Instead of seeking the truth and following the path wherever it led the government marginalized and ignored witnesses in order to push the vaccines don

learn about how safe this vaccine is unless we start giving it That s just the way it goes Even the hand picked VRBPAC members acknowledged at their previous meeting that the vaccines don t have correlates of protection that would allow them to assume what the health outcomes from antibody measurements are said Holland Since the FDA has now admitted that antibody titers are not a predictor of immunity it is requiring clinical trial data that shows at least 50 efficacy which is required to issue an Emergency Use Authorization Moderna was able to perform some sleight of hand to claim the vaccine s efficacy for babies six months up to two years old rose from 44 to 51 between March and April Yet CDC says that 75 of children have already had COVID That means that perhaps 3 4 of the children who get this vaccine will receive no benefit but still risk all the side effects The FDA said it plans to convene its outside panel of vaccine experts on June 8 21 and 22 to review Moderna and Pfizer applications for childhood vaccines There will be no delays FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters at a health journalism conference last week We ll review the data hold an advisory

titles outlining the mishandling of the global COVID 19 crisis Both books aim to reveal the true story behind the pandemic response while equipping readers with the knowledge necessary to prevent governments and public health officials from using future disease outbreaks to claim dominion over nearly all aspects of human life Since COVID 19 arrived the Bio Pharmaceutical Complex consisting of multinational drug companies the National Institutes of Health NIH and other federal agencies research and virology labs and private enterprises including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have endeavored to seize power over nearly every aspect of peoples lives and liberties The Courage to Face COVID 19 Preventing Hospitalization and Death While Battling the Bio Pharmaceutical Complex by true crime writer John Leake and eminent cardiologist Peter McCullough recounts how Dr McCullough and his colleagues began their work by fighting a novel infectious disease and ultimately became leaders in fighting the tyrannical regime that endangers our American way of life At the beginning of 2020 Dr McCullough was a highly regarded physician professor journal editor and clinical investigator at a major academic medical center in Dallas TX When COVID 19 arrived that March Dr McCullough followed his instincts and training as a physician and set out to find a treatment for the disease adhering to the well established principle that early treatment is always best Using generic repurposed drugs and supplements Dr McCullough and practitioners around the world developed COVID 19 treatments that have saved millions of people from hospitalization and death Much to their surprise public health officials and mainstream medicine dismissed these undeniably successful treatments maligning anything outside their Pharma driven agenda At the same time academic journals began publishing papers disparaging inexpensive repurposed drugs such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine ignoring their long track records of safety and efficacy The Courage to Face COVID 19 tells the story of how brave physicians who put saving lives over their impressive careers found themselves censored censured in the media criticized by their peers and fired from their jobs The greatest victims however were the hundreds of thousands of COVID 19 patients who died needlessly due to the suppression of early treatment Dr Peter McCullough is a hero for our time and all times When the world collapsed from the COVID 19 pandemic he led the 500 doctors who saved the world and saved

"Children s Health Defense Wins Federal District Court Injunction On District of Columbia s Minor Consent for Vaccinations Act Children s Health Defense Wins Federal District Court Injunction On District of Columbia s Minor Consent for Vaccinations Act Link copied Return to Press Releases Press Release For Immediate Release Washington DC On March 18 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued an order granting a preliminary injunction to prohibit the mayor of the District of Columbia the D C Department of Health and D C public schools from enforcing the D C Minor Consent for Vaccination Act of 2020 until further order of the court This is a major legal victory for children parental rights and informed consent said Rolf Hazlehurst senior staff attorney for Children s Health Defense CHD who argued the case Government overreach such as this has dire implications for children s health and the constitutional rights of citizens The D C Minor Consent for Vaccination Act of 2020 allows children eleven years of age and older to consent to vaccinations without their parents knowledge or consent The law specifically targets children whose parents have religious exemptions for their children The D C Act contains several provisions designed to deceive parents and hide the fact that their children have been vaccinated against their parental judgment authority or religious convictions The court order states that the parents have shown they are likely to succeed on the merits because the District s law requires providers to hide children s vaccination status from parents who invoke their religious exemption rights The D C Minor Consent Act requires health care providers to falsify records by leaving the child s school vaccination records blank The doctors may bill the parents insurance companies for the vaccines administered to the children against the parents written directive However to deceive the parents insurance companies may not send the parents an Explanation of Benefits EOB CHD and Parental Rights Foundation filed a lawsuit in the U S District Court for the District of Columbia seeking a court order to declare the D C Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendment Act of 2020 unconstitutional Plaintiffs Booth et al are four parents of minor children who attend public school in Washington D C Oral arguments were heard on March 3 2022 In the opinion issued on Friday March 18 the court found the parents likely to succeed on the merits in their arguments that the D C Act is unconstitutional for two reasons First the D C Act is preempted by federal law because it directly contradicts the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 The D C Act also violates the right to free exercise of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution Hazlehurst argued that the District has created a pressure cooker environment enticing and psychologically manipulating minor children to

that threatened injury must be certainly impending as established by the U S Supreme Court precedent Clapper v Amnesty Int l in part by the use of a drawing entitled Peer Pressure drawn by one of the plaintiff s children The drawing depicts the dilemma children face at school when they do not want to get the COVID vaccine or have been advised by their parents not to take the shot This preliminary injunction is part of ongoing litigation in an extremely important national precedent setting case said Hazlehurst The rights of parents to decide what is best for their children s health is at stake Government can t be allowed to make such decisions for minor children Two similar but separate lawsuits Booth argued by CHD Parental Rights Foundation and Mazer supported by Informed Consent Action Network were filed against the D C Minor Consent Act In both Booth and Mazer the court ruled the plaintiffs have standing based on preemption because the D C Minor Consent Act conflicts with Congress National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 In CHD s Booth case the court made the additional finding that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits that the D C Minor Consent Act violates the free exercise of religion clause in the First Amendment of the Constitution In his ruling U S District Judge Trevor N McFadden stated Removing the law would revert the District to the standard age of consent of 18 Although the case is not yet final the preliminary injunction reverts D C to the standard age of consent of 18 Children s Health Defense is a 501 c 3 non profit organization Its

Clinic s Vaccine Research Group Suffers From Tinnitus Following COVID Vaccine Director of Mayo Clinic s Vaccine Research Group Suffers From Tinnitus Following COVID Vaccine Link copied Press Release For Immediate Release Washington DC March 17 2022 Dr Greg Poland Director of the Mayo Clinic s vaccine research group told reporters last week that he developed tinnitus ringing in the ears that can be debilitating shortly after receiving his second COVID vaccine According to MedPage Today Poland believes there may be tens of thousands of people affected in the U S and potentially millions worldwide He feels strongly that more research should be done to determine what caused these symptoms and what can be done to help people desperate for relief Many parents of children who regressed following routine childhood vaccinations and were later diagnosed with autism have long suspected that their children are suffering from tinnitus Some researchers believe that neuroinflammation may be behind tinnitus reports in some COVID 19 vaccine recipients Inflammatory biomarkers and neuroinflammation are also suspected in regressive autism patients Tinnitus and hyperacusis an intolerance of everyday environmental sounds are more prevalent in individuals with autism Recent studies indicate that 35 of the ASD population suffers from tinnitus but the true number is likely unknown since individuals with autism and little to no speech can only be assessed from observations by parents and educators The need to try to drown out the tinnitus is obvious after parents watch their non verbal children engage in things like repeated head banging the constant need for background noise even in quiet environments and holding and or slapping their ears said Children s Health Defense CHD executive director Laura Bono mother of an adult son who regressed developmentally following vaccines he received at the age of 16 months Sometimes children make their own constant verbal noise to drown out the noises in their ears The experiences Dr Poland describes would likely match what our kids would say if they could communicate The U S government s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System VAERS has received 22 138 reports of tinnitus following all vaccines combined since the system was established in 1990 Of that number there have been 19 630 reports of tinnitus following the COVID vaccine alone Tinnitus isn t the only disorder in the growing list of adverse events from vaccines In 2014 Dr Poland and a team of researchers at the Mayo Clinic found that Somali Americans develop twice the antibody response to rubella from the Measles Mumps Rubella vaccine compared to Caucasians These findings underscore the importance of resisting a one size fits all approach when it comes to

anyone considering this shot and especially for children who are at virtually no risk of serious complications or death from COVID in the first place Additionally the MedPage Today article states that myocarditis often resolves within a few days of treatment Poland noted But with tinnitus symptoms can persist Studies and other physicians don t support Dr Poland s prognosis for those who develop myocarditis In fact it is the third leading cause of Sudden Death in children and young people Myocarditis is not a benign condition said Dr Susan Vosloo a cardiac surgeon at Christiaan Barnard Memorial Hospital in Cape Town South Africa Long term consequences are unpredictable From mid December 2020 through March 4 2022 VAERS received 4 065 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis with 2 499 cases attributed to Pfizer 1 381 cases to Moderna and 174 cases to J J s COVID vaccines While tinnitus can be a serious adverse effect Pfizer reports that there could be adverse events of special

and Children s Health Defense CHD Films comes the documentary Infertility A Diabolical Agenda The film exposes a World Health Organization WHO population control experiment carried out under the guise of a vaccination program resulting in the sterilization of women in Africa without their knowledge or consent The film will premiere on Friday June 10 at 2 00 pm ET on CHD TV Immediately following the 30 minute film a special edition of CHD TV s Friday Roundtable will feature special guests Dr Andy Wakefield Dr Christiane Northrup Dr Jim Thorp Dr Brian Hooker and Dr Liz Mumper to discuss the dramatic rise in infertility issues across the globe It is with timely irony that the World Health Organization reveals its true colors as it makes a desperate grab for control of global health said director Dr Andy Wakefield This story is a true WHO dunnit Infertility pulls back the curtain to reveal the truth behind WHO s nefarious collaboration with the Kenyan government in which an experimental tetanus vaccination later found to be laced with the pregnancy hormone βhCG was given to millions of unknowing African women of childbearing age Consequently their right to carry children was stolen Wakefield chronicles this tragic story and brings shocking new evidence to light As Dr Stephen Karanja warns in the film When they re through with Africa they re coming for you The truths exposed in this film cast a long shadow from a tetanus trial in Africa to the symptoms of infertility that are happening all over the world including reports after the Gardasil vaccine and the COVID shots said CHD chief science director Dr Brian Hooker This film documents evidence that strongly supports the idea that the WHO was conducting an experiment on women of childbearing age to make them infertile without informed consent said Mary Holland CHD president general counsel and author of The HPV Vaccine On Trial Seeking Justice For A Generation Betrayed The Rome Statute of the

Return to Press Releases Press Release For Immediate Release Washington DC The U S Food and Drug Administration s FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee VRBPAC is convening today and tomorrow and will likely recommend Emergency Use Authorizations EUA for Moderna s COVID shot in children ages 6 through 17 The committee is also considering the recommendation of Pfizer and Moderna s COVID vaccines for infants and children 6 months through 4 years old for Pfizer and 6 months through 5 years old for Moderna CHD implores the FDA committee to follow the science and mounting evidence that proves there is no COVID emergency for this age group Young children have almost zero risk of severe illness or death from COVID 99 995 recovery rate and over 75 of US children already have natural immunity to COVID providing broad and durable protection There is strong evidence showing that newer variants like Omicron pose dramatically reduced risks to young children Any protection the shots may provide is short lived and currently mRNA vaccines are demonstrating negative efficacy In addition the COVID jabs do not prevent transmission infection hospitalization or death and there is no valid evidence showing they prevent severe disease or death in children Since there is no logical need for children to receive these COVID injections the risks of getting these shots far outweigh any potential benefits Multiple studies have suggested that those who receive the jabs after infection are at an increased risk of vaccine induced side effects such as myocarditis Eighteen prominent members of Congress recently wrote a letter demanding answers from the FDA regarding the safety and efficacy of COVID shots for infants and young children CHD board chair and chief litigation counsel Robert F Kennedy Jr also sent a letter to VRBPAC members last week warning that CHD is poised to take legal action should the EUAs be granted Vaccinating young children against a virus that poses no harm to them is unethical and dangerous said CHD president and general counsel Mary Holland However it does bring Pharma closer to its ultimate goal of getting COVID shots added to

often within mere months throughout the COVID 19 pandemic Judge Shubb s memorandum and order states drawing a line between what is true and what is settled by scientific consensus is difficult if not impossible The judge explains because COVID 19 is such a new and evolving area of scientific study it may be hard to determine which scientific conclusions are false at a given point in time The judge s ruling confirms an important right to share and receive truthful information involving important medical decisions said CHD s Chairman and Chief Litigation Counsel Robert F Kennedy Jr Promoting

power must remain inviolate The order s criticism of the new law is most remarkable Because the term scientific consensus is so ill defined physician plaintiffs are unable to determine if their

exemptions in the military was so egregious that in 2022 judges in non military courts hearing lawsuits on behalf of service members granted preliminary injunctions against the Navy the Air and Space Forces and the Marine Corps The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 finally put an end to the mandate but this did nothing for the many service members who had already been penalized for refusing what turned out to be an unsafe and ineffective experimental drug Conscientious objectors lost promotions and positions and or were involuntarily separated from the military all

CHD s Brian Hooker and Jacob Puliyel M D Raises Safety Concerns Over Infant Rotavirus Vaccine in India New Study by CHD s Brian Hooker and Jacob Puliyel M D Raises Safety Concerns Over Infant Rotavirus Vaccine in India Link copied Return to Press Releases Press Release For Immediate Release Washington D C A study published yesterday in the peer reviewed journal The International Journal of Risk and Safety in Medicine found that Rotavac the rotavirus vaccine used in India increases the risk of intussusception in infants Intussusception is a condition where the intestine telescopes into itself and can lead to gangrene of the bowel or death if not treated immediately The paper was co authored by Jacob Puliyel MD of the International Institute of Health Management Research India and Children s Health Defense Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker Ph D A 2020 New England Journal of Medicine analysis found there was no risk of intussusception from Rotavac a live attenuated rotavirus vaccine manufactured by Hyderabad based Bharat Biotech A statistical method called self controlled case series SCCS determined that the risk of intussusception in the high risk window 21 days after any dose of the vaccine was comparable to the background risk Using the same raw surveillance data Puliyel and Hooker used an alternate method called self controlled risk interval SCRI to ascertain if the 2020 conclusion could be substantiated They found that there was a 1 6 fold increase in the risk of intussusception in the vaccinated which was missed in the earlier SCCS analysis Additionally the mean age of developing intussusception was lower in the vaccinated babies putting them at risk of serious harm including death The authors also performed a novel analysis of time to intussusception from the last vaccination The number of babies developing intussusceptions was highest within a month after vaccination with risks tapering off over time They found 93 cases of intussusception in the first 30 days compared to 63 in the next 30 days This was statistically very significant and suggested vaccine risk very much like the SCRI analysis according to the paper The first symptom of intussusception is typically the passage of blood and mucus in the stools said Dr Hooker Parents can easily mistake this for infectious dysentery which is more common Intussusception often requires surgery to prevent death so parents need to be informed and vigilant The SCCS method is useful when the overall age of onset of intussusception is not altered by vaccination The authors found that the rotavirus vaccine lowers the age of intussusception rendering the standard SCCS analysis ineffective in detecting the risk of this serious adverse effect The original SCCS analysis had missed the risk and all previous SCCS studies may need to be re evaluated the authors conclude The paper underscores the need for awareness of this risk from the Rotavac", "chunk_id":

conclude The paper underscores the need for awareness of this risk from the Rotavac vaccine and the symptoms of intussusception among parents and caregivers This is especially crucial when the vaccine is administered in remote rural areas to the infants of poor illiterate parents as part of the national immunization programme said Dr Puliyel Every parent must know the symptoms of intussusception so that the children impacted can receive emergency medical intervention Dr Puliyel emphasized that post marketing surveillance can indicate if there is an increased risk but without data from unvaccinated controls the magnitude of the risk is difficult to estimate He hopes that data from the original randomized control trial RCT in each of the three study centers in India will now be

refusing the COVID vaccine Workers are calling on Mayor Eric Adams to stop discriminating on the basis of vaccination status by applying the same rules for all NYC employees and to rehire those who lost their livelihoods as a result of the COVID vaccination mandates NYC Mayor Eric Adams signed an Executive Order on March 24 allowing all professional athletes and performers the ability to work in the city regardless of vaccination status The order kept in place the vaccine mandates for all other municipal employees who have not been granted an approval for reasonable accommodation such as a medical or religious exemption In an interview this morning with Pete Hegseth on FOX Friends MTA conductor Tramell Thompson who has become a vocal advocate for informed consent said that no one is talking about people who were coerced into getting the vaccine in order to pay their bills to take care of their families to make sure they don t lose their homes their cars to make sure their kids can go to school NYC Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli posted to Twitter on April 14 stating In the last 2 days 375 NYPD more officers were denied medical or religious exemptions to our vaccine mandate and there are 5 400 applications still pending This is over 15 percent of the police department Borelli introduced a resolution on April 14 calling on Mayor Adams to rehire city workers as

the case could have a broad impact on all city workers who have lost their jobs for declining covid vaccination It s fantastic that Kyrie Irving is playing home games in Brooklyn NY once again said Kane However even Irving himself recently came out in full support of rehiring fired and banned employees in NYC City employees who didn t provide proof of at least one dose of a COVID vaccination by the February 11 deadline were terminated City Hall reported that 1 430 municipal workers were fired at that time however that number doesn t include employees who resigned due to the mandate to keep their pensions or benefits While some workers oppose the mandates for infringing their rights many others have expressed concerns about the safety of the COVID vaccines According to the U S government

supported by Children s Health Defense CHD are representing four families in a suit in Massachusetts Superior Court seeking to reinstate the Pittsfield Board of Health s cease and desist order against Verizon The case is the next step in the resident s 24 month ordeal that began when Verizon turned on a cell tower in their neighborhood known as Shacktown As soon as the tower went operational people began getting sick Almost 20 have been definitively identified but more may be negatively affected The Pittsfield Board of Health issued the cease and desist on April 11 2022 after a long and thorough investigation into the health impacts of Verizon s tower It rescinded the order on June 1 2022 after Verizon sued in federal court W Scott McCollough McCollough Law Firm PC and Paul Revere III Law Offices of Paul Revere III are representing the Plaintiffs and argue in their suit that the interference of several city officials was improper unlawful and tainted the entire process The Pittsfield Board of Health studied the relevant scientific and medical information including more than 1 000 peer reviewed studies The Board interviewed scientists and medical professionals It took evidence from those being sickened and met with Verizon Wireless The Board discovered the cell tower was making 17 individuals ill and their homes were so uninhabitable that many had to move away while others moved in with relatives and some slept in their cars The tower had rendered sleep elusive cognition impaired while some children were vomiting in their beds at night Vertigo heart palpitations and severe headaches were part of the constellation of neurological symptoms experienced by the affected neighbors On April 11 2022 the Board issued an Emergency Order having found health and sanitary code violations and declared that the Verizon cell tower is a public nuisance They gave Verizon seven days to request a hearing and if it did not then it had to discontinue operation Verizon then filed a lawsuit contending the Board is powerless and cannot protect Pittsfield residents from the tower s toxic wireless emissions The Board has bravely tried to resolve the problem but Verizon has refused to admit to the harms it is inflicting or to engage in collaborative efforts to resolve these harms Even worse the Board and the residents are not just having to deal with Verizon Others in the city

government employees and attorneys The lawsuit extensively documents their specific actions and details the financial and legal conflicts of interest that are driving them Tyer Pagnotta and Ruffer in cooperation with Verizon thwarted the Board s efforts to secure outside counsel thereby ensuring that the Board could not defend its Emergency Order As a result the Board was coerced into rescinding the Emergency Order on June 1 2022 The residents lawsuit challenges the Board s decision to rescind but its principal focus is on Tyer Pagnotta Ruffer The complaint seeks a court declaration that their interference was improper unlawful and tainted the entire process If the Superior Court grants the requested relief these individuals will have to stop their improper interference and the Board will be allowed the flexibility it needs to remediate the harms it has already found to exist Pittsfield has previously taken on companies that were hurting its citizens said CHD president and general counsel Mary Holland The residents of the Shacktown neighborhood epitomize the reality that prosperity means nothing if your citizens are sick and even dying The only difference here is that it is Verizon not General Electric and the toxin is wireless radiation not PCBs When GE left Pittsfield it created an economic vacuum but moving the tower to address the residents suffering including three homeowners with cancer does not create a hardship for anyone Several commercial landowners in Pittsfield have offered their property for the tower In this picturesque city in the Berkshires with 40 open space Verizon can put their tower where it is not a potentially lethal nuisance The Board is trying to do the right thing but they have been prevented from carrying out their duties because of cronyism and favoritism continued Holland We hope that this suit will stop the interference and free up the Board so it can finally force Verizon to the negotiating table as the Emergency Order

address collusion among behemoth media conglomerates to silence smaller publishing competitors in violation of antitrust and free speech laws Amarillo TX A first of its kind antitrust action was filed Tuesday against the British Broadcasting Corporation BBC The Washington Post Reuters and Associated Press seeking damages totaling millions of dollars based on the collusive censorship of online health and political news publishers who dared to question the narrative relating to vital matters such as the COVID 19 pandemic and vaccine mandates The lawsuit reveals that by March 2020 a partnership was created called the Trusted News Initiative TNI between Big Tech and legacy media to exclude rival publishers from the dominant internet platforms On Dec 10 2020 TNI agreed to focus on combatting the spread of harmful vaccine disinformation This coordinated effort is by definition a classic unlawful group boycott to damage the ability of smaller publishers to compete or even survive Members of the TNI include legacy media outlets the BBC The Washington Post Reuters and Associated Press along with social media and tech giants Twitter Meta Facebook Instagram Microsoft LinkedIn and Google YouTube The TNI members collectively hold 90 of the overall social media market an 85 market share of the online social media news market a 90 share of the social networking market 75 of the video hosting market and over 90 of the search engine market The complaint points to multiple examples of what plaintiffs state violates antitrust laws By their own admission members of the Trusted News Initiative TNI agreed to work together and have in fact worked together to exclude from the world s dominant Internet platforms rival news publishers who engage in reporting that challenges and competes with TNI members reporting on certain issues relating to COVID 19 and U S politics For example TNI members deemed the following to be misinformation that could not be published on the world s dominant Internet platforms A claims that COVID originated in a laboratory in Wuhan China B claims that the COVID vaccines do not prevent infection C claims that vaccinated persons can transmit COVID to others and D claims that compromising emails and videos were found on a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden The TNI did not only prevent Internet users from making these claims it shut down online

disease epidemic in America s children The epidemic of poor health in American children started after 1986 coterminous with the passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act which resulted in an explosion of the vaccine schedule For American kids born in 1986 only 12 8 had chronic diseases That number has grown to 54 among the vaccine generation those born after 1986 in lockstep with the expanding vaccine schedule 1 Children have never been sicker than today 54 of American children have serious chronic health conditions according to a 2011 survey funded by the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS Conditions include neurodevelopmental disorders asthma allergies mental health behavioral disorders and obesity 2 A growing body of peer reviewed animal and human studies link childhood chronic illness epidemics to vaccines including Vaccine Adverse Event Reports and manufacturers product inserts The world s most aggressive vaccine schedule has not given our country the world s healthiest children We now rank 35th in overall health outcomes just behind Costa Rica making the U S by most measures including infant mortality the sickest in the developed world 3 Vaccine manufacturers and healthcare providers cannot be held liable for vaccine injuries In 1986 Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act freeing companies from liability for injuries resulting from childhood vaccines no matter how toxic the ingredients how negligent the manufacturer or how grievous the harm The act created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program NVICP that is governed by HHS Over 4 2 billion has been paid by consumers for vaccine injuries The U S vaccine schedule has more than tripled since the 1986 Act 4 Vaccines CAN and DO cause injuries The message that vaccine injuries are rare is not supported by facts and anecdotal evidence An HHS sponsored study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that vaccine injuries when tracked using electronic medical records occurs in 1 in 39 vaccines given 5 Post licensure vaccine safety surveillance is failing the American people and children around the world The Vaccine Adverse

longer had any incentive to make vaccines safe ordered HHS to study vaccine injuries work to improve vaccine safety and report to Congress on its progress every two years It has not sent one safety

routine vaccines and vaccine induced immunity wanes over time Highly vaccinated populations frequently have outbreaks of pertussis mumps measles and chickenpox Many diseases were on the decline prior to the development of vaccines Civil engineers not vaccines produced the large gains in life expectancy over the 20th century 9 CDC Vaccine Researcher Turned Whistleblower Dr William Thompson Ph D was denied the ability to testify regarding scientific fraud and destruction of evidence by senior CDC officials in critical CDC vaccine safety studies regarding an association between childhood vaccines

Online First 06 August 2020 doi 10 1136 bmjebm 2020 111419 SUMMARY The Merck Sharp Dohme Corp aluminium adjuvant amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate AAHS primarily used in the Gardasil vaccines against human papilloma virus has been criticised for lack of evidence for its safety Documentation from Danish authorities and answers from the European Medicines Agency EMA suggest that AAHS may not have been sufficiently evaluated Documentation from the Danish Medicines Agency shows discrepancies in the trial documents of two prelicensure clinical trials with Gardasil in 2002 and 2003 For both trials the Agency seems to have authorised potassium aluminium sulfate as the adjuvant and not AAHS In addition the participants in the trial launched in 2002 were informed that the comparator was saline even though the comparator was AAHS in an expedient consisting of L histidine polysorbate 80 sodium borate and sodium chloride According to the EMA AAHS was first introduced in Europe in 2004 as the adjuvant in Procomvax a vaccine against the hepatitis B virus and Haemophilus influenza type b The EMA reports that AAHS was introduced without any prelicensure safety evaluation The adjuvant is described by the company to be both physically and functionally distinct from all other previously used aluminium adjuvants There is a need for rigorous evaluation of benefits and harms of the adjuvant AAHS View Abstract TAGS SYNOPSIS The CDC vaccine schedule results in a high degree of chronic aluminum toxicity in the first seven months of life TITLE Acute exposure and chronic

physiological environment of the injection site can help explain their role in adverse events The authors suggest that some degree of toxicity and cell death is probably inevitable following injection of aluminum salts but they note that the type of iatrogenic effect observed may range from benign to fatal depending on the properties of the specific adjuvant and critically the physiological

adjuvanted vaccines administered and the rate of autism spectrum disorders Many of the features of aluminum induced neurotoxicity may arise in part from autoimmune reactions as part of the ASIA

223 230 SUMMARY Immune challenges during early development including those vaccine induced can lead to permanent detrimental alterations of the brain and immune function Experimental evidence also shows that simultaneous administration of as little as two to three immune adjuvants can overcome genetic resistance to autoimmunity In spite of the widespread agreement that vaccines are largely safe and serious adverse complications are extremely rare a close scrutiny of the scientific literature does not support this view For example to date the clinical trials that could adequately address vaccine safety issues have not been conducted i e comparing health outcomes in vaccinated versus non vaccinated children Infants and young children should not be viewed as small adults Their unique physiology makes them much more vulnerable to noxious environmental insults in comparison with the adult population In spite of this children are routinely exposed to much higher levels of Al vaccine adjuvants than adults even though adequate safety data on these compounds are lacking That Al vaccine adjuvants can induce significant autoimmune conditions in humans can hardly be disputed although still debatable is how common such side effects are However the existing data or lack thereof raise questions on whether the current vaccines aimed at pediatric populations can be accepted as having adequate safety profiles Because infants and children represent those who may be most at risk for complications following vaccination a more rigorous evaluation of potential vaccine related adverse

datasets and 15 other datasets including dietary patterns metabolomics cytokine profiles and human brain gene expression profiles We found a functional architecture along the GBA that correlates with heterogeneity of ASD phenotypes and it is characterized by ASD associated amino acid carbohydrate and lipid profiles predominantly encoded by microbial species in the genera Prevotella Bifidobacterium

differences may influence attributions for autism spectrum disorder ASD and subsequent vaccine hesitancy the latter of which refers to a continuum of concerns about vaccine safety that may lead to vaccine delays and or refusals Two hundred and twenty five parents of children with ASD who were enrolled in the SPARK cohort Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge completed the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines survey and the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire 28 9 of respondents n 65 were vaccine hesitant PACV score 50 Significant differences were observed between proportions of vaccine hesitant parents VHP in the White sample and combined samples of color Asian Black Latinx Multiracial and Other 22 8 of the White sample n 39 versus 48 1 of the samples of color n 26 White non hesitant parents more often agreed with the child s brain structure as a cause of their child s ASD while White VHP more often agreed with the deterioration of the child s immunity as a cause All VHP regardless of race agreed more often with diet their own decisions and vaccines as causes VHP of color more often agreed with accident or injury environmental pollution

accounts for only 14 of the total school population in Montreal but has the highest rates of POD diagnosis in the five total districts and in some cases POD rates were three times higher within this district The claim that the thimerosal exposure in the Canadian vaccine schedule starting in 1996 was nil is false Thimerosal free HepB formulations were not introduced until 2001 and the thimerosal containing Penta vaccine was administered leading to a cumulative maximum dosage of 137 5 micrograms mercury This renders any time trend comparison between autism ASD PDD prevalence and thimerosal exposure useless Schechter et al 2008 Schechter was a part of the Immunization Branch of the California Department of Public Health which is charged with maximizing vaccination uptake in that state Epidemiology Arch Gen Psychiatry Time trends in autism diagnoses in the State of California continued to increase with the introduction of the thimerosal containing maternal influenza vaccine in 2004

arthritis like conditions Though the presence of virus in joints and associated inflammation has been implicated as one of the reasons for the acute and chronic polyarthritis post alphaviral infections the basis for rheumatic like outcomes is not clear through an in silico analysis we have investigated the possibility of an autoimmune process mediated through molecular mimicry in alphaviral infection induced pathogenicity interestingly sequence alignment of the structural polyproteins belonging to arthritogenic alphaviruses revealed conserved regions which share homology with human proteins implicated in rheumatoid arthritis RA these conserved regions were predicted to exhibit binding to HLA class ii alleles showcasing their potential to incite t cell help Molecular docking of the viral peptide and the corresponding homologous region in the human protein onto HLA DRB1 revealed strong similarities in their binding patterns Linear and conformational B cell epitope prediction analyses showed that these potential mimics have high propensity to elicit an efficient B cell response We thus propose that the origin of polyarthritis post arthritogenic alphaviral

significant correlation exists between the number of pediatric aluminum adjuvanted vaccines administered and the rate of autism spectrum disorders Many of the features of aluminum induced neurotoxicity may arise in part from autoimmune reactions as part of the ASIA syndrome Aluminum is added to vaccines to help the vaccine work more effectively but unlike dietary aluminum which will usually clear rapidly from the body aluminum used in vaccines and injected is designed to provide a long lasting cellular exposure Thus the problem with vaccine derived aluminum is really twofold It drives the immune response even in the absence of a viral or bacterial threat and it can make its way into the central nervous system It is not really a matter of much debate that aluminum in various

function Experimental evidence also shows that simultaneous administration of as little as two to three immune adjuvants can overcome genetic resistance to autoimmunity In spite of the widespread agreement that vaccines are largely safe and serious adverse complications are extremely rare a close scrutiny of the scientific literature does not support this view For example to date the clinical trials that could adequately address vaccine safety issues have not been conducted i e comparing health outcomes in vaccinated versus non vaccinated children Infants and young children should not be viewed as small adults Their unique physiology makes them much more vulnerable to noxious environmental insults in comparison with the adult population In spite of this children are routinely exposed to much higher levels of Al vaccine adjuvants than adults even though adequate safety data on these compounds are lacking That Al vaccine adjuvants can induce significant autoimmune conditions in humans can hardly be disputed although still debatable is how common such side effects are However the existing data or lack thereof raise questions on whether the current vaccines aimed at pediatric populations can be accepted as having adequate safety profiles Because infants and children represent those who may be most at risk for complications following vaccination a more rigorous evaluation

previously isolated from convalescent donors infected with the Wuhan Hu 1 strain against the SARS CoV 2 variants of concern VOC Alpha Beta Gamma Delta and Omicron By testing an array of mutated spike receptor binding domain RBD proteins cell expressed spike proteins from VOCs and neutralization of SARS CoV 2 VOCs as pseudoviruses or as the authentic viruses in culture we show that mAbs directed against the ACE2 binding site ACE2bs are more sensitive to viral evolution compared to anti RBD non ACE2bs mAbs two of which retain their potency against all VOCs tested At the second part of our study we reveal the neutralization mechanisms at high molecular resolution of two anti SARS CoV 2 neutralizing mAbs by structural characterization We solve the structures of the Delta neutralizing ACE2bs mAb TAU 2303 with the SARS CoV 2 spike trimer and RBD at 4 5 Å and 2 42 Å resolutions respectively revealing a similar mode of binding to that between the RBD and ACE2 Furthermore we provide five additional structures at resolutions of 4 7 Å 7 3 Å 6 4 Å 3 3 Å and 6 1 Å of a second antibody TAU 2212 complexed with the SARS CoV 2 spike trimer TAU 2212 binds an exclusively quaternary epitope

Negative residents also had higher mortality which we suspect is secondary to preanalytical error and low sensitivity of the swab test in poorly compliant subjects Male gender older age and low scores on ADL scales probably due to immobility are risk factors for COVID 19 related mortality Finally mortality was inversely associated with vitamin D supplementation Design In this observational study we

Patients and Methods French Confirmed COVID 19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting Depending on their clinical presentation azithromycin was added to the treatment Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls The presence and absence of virus at Day6 post inclusion was considered the endpoint Results Six patients were asymptomatic 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6 post inclusion compared to controls and a much lower average carrying duration than reported in the literature for untreated patients Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination Conclusion Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction disappearance in COVID 19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin View Abstract TAGS SYNOPSIS This natural trial showed that the COVID 19 regimen containing both HCQ and azithromycin can be helpful to promote the recovery

autism spectrum disorder ASD Both of these medications share a common trait of inhibiting cell proliferation Thus these researchers set out to determine if thimerosal can inhibit cell proliferation using doses of thimerosal which reflect the concentrations that infants are exposed to via vaccinations The design of this experiment was chosen to be able to distinguish between shared or different in utero environments among families with an ASD member To accomplish this goal B cells were collected from ASD individuals their unaffected fraternal twins representing a shared in utero environment and their unaffected nontwin siblings In the same manner B cells were collected from control families with no history of ASD which were matched for age sex ethnicity and compared to ASD families It was determined that there is a hypersensitivity to thimerosal among a subpopulation of ASD families The target of thimerosal toxicity is the mitochondria and cell proliferation was inhibited at a dose that was lower than that required to cause cell death Among the hypersensitive population the dose of thimerosal that could inhibit cell proliferation was found to be only 40 of that needed to inhibit proliferation in the control group Whether a twin or sibling was hypersensitive was dependent on having another family member with hypersensitivity This finding implies there is a genetic component to thimerosal hypersensitivity Among the ASD families with hypersensitivity oxidative stress was determined to be the contributing factor Poor antioxidant status high lactate levels and elevated markers

was claimed that her vaccines induced a mitochondrial encephalopathy that resulted in autism Since the mitochondria is the most significant target of thimerosal toxicity it is particularly poignant to know that a lowering of antioxidant status by any other additional conditions such as infections or co exposure to other toxins would further sensitize mitochondria to the damaging effects of thimerosal These researchers state that their work supports a multi insult model of ASD causation where many individuals have the genetic background that makes them vulnerable to a particular type of insult at a particular time in their brain development Just like valproate and thalidomide which are the only 2 accepted causative agents for ASD this research has demonstrated that thimerosal is also

2020 https doi org 10 1038 s41598 019 55730 6 SUMMARY Alphaviral infections are foremost in causing debilitating clinical outcomes in humans characterized by rheumatic arthritis like conditions Though the presence of virus in joints and associated inflammation has been implicated as one of the reasons for the acute and chronic polyarthritis post alphaviral infections the basis for rheumatic like outcomes is not clear through an in silico analysis we have investigated the possibility of an autoimmune process mediated through molecular mimicry in alphaviral infection induced pathogenicity interestingly sequence alignment of the structural polyproteins belonging to arthritogenic alphaviruses revealed conserved regions which share homology with human proteins implicated in rheumatoid arthritis RA these conserved regions were predicted to exhibit binding to HLA class ii alleles showcasing their potential to incite t cell help Molecular docking of the viral peptide and the corresponding homologous region in the human protein onto HLA DRB1 revealed strong similarities in their binding patterns Linear and conformational B cell epitope prediction analyses showed that these

Bordetella pertussis is considered the main causative agent of whooping cough in humans Bordetella parapertussis infections are not uncommon The widely used acellular whooping cough vaccines aP are comprised solely of B pertussis antigens that hold little or no efficacy against B parapertussis Here we ask how aP vaccination affects competitive interactions between Bordetella species within co infected rodent hosts and thus the aP driven strength and direction of in host selection We show that aP vaccination helped clear B pertussis but resulted in an approximately 40 fold increase in B parapertussis lung colony forming units CFUs Such vaccine mediated facilitation of B parapertussis did not arise as a result of competitive release B parapertussis CFUs were higher in aP relative to sham vaccinated hosts regardless of whether infections were single or mixed Further we show that aP vaccination impedes host immunity against B parapertussis measured as reduced lung inflammatory and

limited on environmental or residential exposure to these chemicals Methods We analyze asthma prevalence in an agricultural town with high use of pesticides mainly glyphosate with an ecological study conducted in Monte Maíz Argentina composed of a chemical and environmental analysis to determine the burden of exposure to glyphosate and pesticides in general and a cross sectional asthma study that uses the methodological criteria of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood ISAAC the prevalence s found in Monte Maíz are compared with the results of ISAAC in Argentine cities with low exposure to pesticides Results In Monte Maíz high and preponderant levels of glyphosate were found in the soil and in corn husk and soybean powder The environmental exposure burden to pesticides was 121 kilos for glyphosate 81 kilos per person per year while this burden in the entire country is 7 9 and 6 kilos respectively The found asthma prevalences were several times higher than those of reference in all ages the risk of asthma in children of 13 and 14 years old with respect to those of three large Argentine cities is OR of 4 64 CI 3 26 6 60 Conclusion These results highlight

papilloma virus has been criticised for lack of evidence for its safety Documentation from Danish authorities and answers from the European Medicines Agency EMA suggest that AAHS may not have been sufficiently evaluated Documentation from the Danish Medicines Agency shows discrepancies in the trial documents of two prelicensure clinical trials with Gardasil in 2002 and 2003 For both trials the Agency seems to have authorised potassium aluminium sulfate as the adjuvant and not AAHS In addition the participants in the trial launched in 2002 were informed that the comparator was saline even though the comparator was AAHS in an expedient consisting of L histidine polysorbate 80 sodium borate and sodium chloride According to the EMA AAHS was first introduced in Europe in 2004 as the adjuvant in Procomvax a vaccine against the hepatitis B virus and Haemophilus influenza type b The EMA reports that AAHS was introduced without any prelicensure safety evaluation The adjuvant is described by the company to be both physically and functionally distinct from all other previously used aluminium adjuvants There is a need for rigorous evaluation of benefits and harms of the

0000000000001377 SUMMARY Areas of Uncertainty The majority of trialed agents have failed to provide reproducible definitive proof of efficacy in reducing the mortality of COVID 19 with the exception of corticosteroids in moderate to severe disease Recently evidence has emerged that the oral antiparasitic agent ivermectin exhibits numerous antiviral and anti inflammatory mechanisms with trial results reporting significant outcome benefits Given some have not passed peer review several expert groups including Unitaid World Health Organization have undertaken a systematic global effort to contact all active trial investigators to rapidly gather the data needed to grade and perform meta analyses Data Sources Data were sourced from published peer reviewed studies manuscripts posted to preprint servers expert meta analyses and numerous epidemiological analyses of regions with ivermectin distribution campaigns Therapeutic Advances A large majority of randomized and observational controlled trials of ivermectin are reporting repeated large magnitude improvements in clinical outcomes Numerous prophylaxis trials demonstrate that regular ivermectin use leads to large reductions in transmission Multiple large natural experiments occurred in regions that initiated ivermectin distribution campaigns followed by tight reproducible temporally associated decreases in case counts and case fatality rates compared with nearby regions without such campaigns Conclusions Meta analyses based on 18 randomized controlled treatment trials of ivermectin in COVID 19 have found large statistically significant reductions in mortality time to clinical recovery and time to viral clearance Furthermore results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID 19 with the regular use of ivermectin Finally the many examples of ivermectin distribution campaigns leading to rapid population wide decreases in morbidity and mortality indicate that an oral agent effective in all phases of COVID 19 has been identified View Abstract TAGS", "chunk_id":

Despite their pervasiveness whether they are active on any targets has not been systematically explored We computed the likelihood that approved excipients would bind to molecular targets Testing in vitro revealed 25 excipient activities ranging from low nanomolar to high micromolar concentration Another 109 activities were identified by testing against clinical safety targets In cellular models five excipients had fingerprints predictive of system level toxicity Exposures of seven excipients were investigated and in certain populations two of these may reach levels of in vitro target potency including brain and gut exposure of thimerosal and its major metabolite which had dopamine D3 receptor dissociation constant K d values of 320 and 210 nM respectively Although most excipients deserve their status as inert many approved excipients may directly modulate physiologically relevant targets View Abstract TAGS SYNOPSIS In susceptible individuals chronic low Hg exposure may trigger local

Chirumbolo J Aaseth and N Martins 2020 Mercury induced autoimmunity Drifting from micro to macro concerns on autoimmune disorders Clin Immunol 108352 SUMMARY Mercury Hg is widely recognized as a neurotoxic metal besides it can also act as a proinflammatory agent and immunostimulant depending on individual exposure and susceptibility Mercury exposure may arise from internal body pathways such as via dental amalgams preservatives in drugs and vaccines and seafood consumption or even from external pathways i e occupation environmental pollution and handling of metallic items and cosmetics containing Hg In susceptible individuals chronic low Hg exposure may trigger local and systemic inflammation even exacerbating the already existing autoimmune response in patients with autoimmunity Mercury exposure can trigger dysfunction of the autoimmune responses and aggravate immunotoxic effects associated with elevated serum autoantibodies titers The purpose of the present report is to provide a critical overview of the many issues associated with Hg exposure and autoimmunity In addition the paper also focuses on individual susceptibility and other health effects of Hg View Abstract

Methylmercury MeHg has conventionally been investigated for effects on nervous system development As such epigenetic modifications have become an attractive mechanistic target and research on MeHg and epigenetics has rapidly expanded in the past decade Although these inquiries are a recent advance in the field much has been learned in regards to MeHg induced epigenetic modifications particularly in the brain In vitro and in vivo controlled exposure studies illustrate that MeHg effects microRNA miRNA expression histone modifications and DNA methylation both globally and at individual genes Moreover some effects are transgenerationally inherited as organisms not directly exposed to MeHg exhibited biological and behavioral alterations miRNA expression generally appears to be down regulated consequent to exposure Further global histone acetylation also seems to be reduced persist at distinct gene promoters and is contemporaneous with enhanced histone methylation Moreover global DNA methylation appears to decrease in brain derived tissues but not in the liver however selected individual genes in the brain are hypermethylated Human epidemiological studies have also identified hypo or hypermethylated individual genes which correlated with MeHg exposure in distinct populations Intriguingly several observed epigenetic modifications can be correlated with known mechanisms of MeHg toxicity Despite this knowledge however the functional consequences of these modifications are not entirely evident Additional research will be necessary to fully comprehend MeHg induced

Shardlow E Mold M Exley C Unraveling the enigma elucidating the relationship between the physicochemical properties of aluminium based adjuvants and their immunological mechanisms of action Allergy

some degree of toxicity and cell death is probably inevitable following injection of aluminum salts but they note that the type of iatrogenic effect observed may range from benign to fatal depending on the properties of the specific adjuvant and critically the physiological response of the recipient Pointing out that aluminum based adjuvants have never received approval for intramuscular or

autoimmune disorders During early development the child s brain is more susceptible to toxins and the kidneys are less able to eliminate them Thus children have a greater risk than adults of adverse reactions to aluminum in vaccines Millions of children every year are injected with vaccines containing mercury and aluminum despite well established experimental evidence of the potential for additive or synergistic toxicity when an organism is exposed to two or more toxic metals View Abstract TAGS SYNOPSIS Thimerosal reduces people s ability to make all important vitamin B12 compounds

computer model was created to study the effect of the measles elimination program in the United States on the number of susceptibles in the population The simulation reveals that in the prevaccine era approximately 10 6 of the population was susceptible to measles most of whom were children less than 10 years of age With the institution of the measles immunization program the proportion of susceptibles in the population fell to 3 1 from 1978 through 1981 but then began to rise by approximately 0 1 per year to reach about 10 9 in the year 2050 The susceptibles at this time were distributed evenly throughout all age groups The model did not consider the potential effect of waning immunity The results of this study suggest that measles elimination in the United States has been achieved by an effective immunization program aimed at young susceptibles combined with a highly naturally immunized adult population However despite short term success in eliminating the disease long range projections demonstrate that the proportion of susceptibles in the year 2050 may be greater than in the prevaccine era Present vaccine technology and public health policy must be altered to deal

spectrum disorder ASD Both of these medications share a common trait of inhibiting cell proliferation Thus these researchers set out to determine if thimerosal can inhibit cell proliferation using doses of thimerosal which reflect the concentrations that infants are exposed to via vaccinations The design of this experiment was chosen to be able to distinguish between shared or different in

or different in utero environments among families with an ASD member To accomplish this goal B cells were collected from ASD individuals their unaffected fraternal twins representing a shared in utero environment and their unaffected nontwin siblings In the same manner B cells were collected from control families with no history of ASD which were matched for age sex ethnicity and compared to ASD families It was determined that there is a hypersensitivity to thimerosal among a subpopulation of ASD families The target of thimerosal toxicity is the mitochondria and cell proliferation was inhibited at a dose that was lower than that required to cause cell death Among the hypersensitive population the dose of thimerosal that could inhibit cell proliferation was found to be only 40 of that needed to inhibit proliferation in the control group Whether a twin or sibling was hypersensitive was dependent on having another family member with hypersensitivity This finding implies there is a genetic component to thimerosal hypersensitivity Among the ASD families with hypersensitivity oxidative stress was determined to be the contributing factor Poor antioxidant status high lactate levels and elevated markers of oxidative stress are a common finding among individuals with ASD In 2008 the case of Hannah Poling was awarded compensation under the United States National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program It was claimed that her vaccines induced a mitochondrial encephalopathy that resulted in autism Since the mitochondria is the most significant target of thimerosal toxicity it is particularly poignant to know that a lowering of antioxidant status by any other additional conditions such as infections or co exposure to other toxins would further sensitize mitochondria to the damaging effects of thimerosal These researchers state that their work supports a multi insult model of ASD causation where many individuals have the genetic background that makes them vulnerable to a particular type of insult at a particular time in their brain development Just like valproate and thalidomide which are the only 2 accepted causative agents for ASD this research has demonstrated that thimerosal is also capable of inhibiting cell proliferation TAGS SYNOPSIS There is a connection between infant and prenatal thimerosal exposure and neurological disorders TITLE Low dose mercury

thimerosal because they are not efficient excretors of these toxic materials Research confirms that a lead toxic person would be more susceptible to mercury toxicity than a healthy non toxic person

been definitively shown to be causative with regards to autism spectrum disorder ASD Both of these medications share a common trait of inhibiting cell proliferation Thus these researchers set out to determine if thimerosal can inhibit cell proliferation using doses of thimerosal which reflect the concentrations that infants are exposed to via vaccinations The design of this experiment was chosen to be able to distinguish between shared or different in utero environments among families with an ASD member To accomplish this goal B cells were collected from ASD individuals their unaffected fraternal twins representing a shared in utero environment and their unaffected nontwin siblings In the same manner B cells were collected from control families with no history of ASD which were matched for age sex ethnicity and compared to ASD families It was determined that there is a hypersensitivity to thimerosal among a subpopulation of ASD families The target of thimerosal toxicity is the mitochondria and cell proliferation was inhibited at a dose that was lower than that required to cause cell death Among the hypersensitive population the dose of thimerosal that could inhibit cell proliferation was found to be only 40 of that needed to inhibit proliferation in the control group Whether a twin or sibling was hypersensitive was dependent on having another family member with hypersensitivity This finding implies there is a genetic component to thimerosal hypersensitivity Among the ASD families with hypersensitivity oxidative stress was determined to be the contributing factor Poor antioxidant status high lactate levels and elevated markers of oxidative stress are a common finding among individuals with ASD In 2008 the case of Hannah Poling was awarded compensation

into the gluteus maximus on postnatal day 1 A fifth group served as a control and received a saline injection Tests were performed 44 48 days post injection to determine spatial learning and memory function On day 49 the animals were euthanized and prepared for immunohistochemical staining to determine the expression of the dopamine D4 receptor DRD4 serotonin 2A receptor 5 HT2AR and apoptosis programmed cell death in the prefrontal cortex The DRD4 receptor is associated with memory function while the 5 HT2AR receptor correlates with episodic memory Previous rat studies have demonstrated that early life exposure to thimerosal alters the dopamine and serotonin systems Similarly this study found a significant decrease in the expression of DRD4 5 HT2AR and learning at the highest dose of

thimerosal as newborns naïve group received a single dose as an adult It was determined that the kidneys accumulated the largest amount of mercury followed by the liver then the brain Individuals with autism have been known to engage in self injurious behaviors SIB and to demonstrate a decrease sensitivity to pain hypoalgesia Studies of individuals with autism have reported a reduction in SIB when treated with naloxone Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist which would allow a person to more profoundly feel their pain upon participation in SIBs A secondary consideration of this study was to determine if thimerosal exposure modulates sensitivity to painful stimuli Using a hot plate test it was demonstrated that thimerosal induces hypoalgesia The long term impairment in pain sensitivity seen among the neonates exceeded that of the naïve adults that received a single acute dose indicating young rats are more sensitive than adults If rats were given a dose of naloxone prior to the hot plate test it significantly mitigated the thimerosal induced hypoalgesia thereby indicating a role of the opioid system The authors conclude our study shows that administration of THIM to suckling or adult rats causes persistent impairment of pain sensitivity which appears to involve increased activity of endogenous opioids View Abstract TAGS SYNOPSIS A CDC sponsored database showed much higher

Liberato Kimberly S Grant Elsa Cernichiari and Thomas Clarkson Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 113 Number 8 August 2005 SUMMARY The mercury used in vaccines and still in the flu vaccine given to pregnant women is far more toxic than the mercury found in fish because it stays in the brain at much higher levels Data from the present study support the prediction that although little accumulation of Hg in the blood occurs over time with repeated vaccinations accumulation of Hg in the brain of infants will occur Thus conclusion regarding the safety of thimerosal drawn from blood Hg clearance data in human infants receiving vaccines may not be valid given the significantly slower half life of Hg in the brain as observed in the infant macaques There was a much higher proportion of

In this review we compiled research reports from the last 40 years which were found based on the PubMed search for the epidemiological and immunological studies on the non specific effects NSEs of the most common human vaccines Analysis of information showed that live vaccines induce positive NSEs whereas non live vaccines induce several negative NSEs including increased female mortality associated with enhanced susceptibility to other infectious diseases especially in developing countries These negative NSEs are determined by the vaccination sequence the antigen concentration in vaccines the type of vaccine used live vs non live and also by repeated vaccination We do not recommend stopping using non live vaccines as they have demonstrated to protect against their target disease so the suggestion is that their detrimental NSEs can be minimized simply by changing the current vaccination sequence High IgG4 antibody levels generated in response to repeated inoculation with mRNA COVID 19 vaccines could be associated with a higher mortality rate from unrelated diseases and infections by suppressing the immune system Since most COVID 19 vaccinated countries are reporting high percentages of excess mortality not directly attributable to deaths from such disease the NSEs of mRNA vaccines on overall mortality should be studied in depth View Abstract View Abstract TAGS

whooping cough in humans Bordetella parapertussis infections are not uncommon The widely used acellular whooping cough vaccines aP are comprised solely of B pertussis antigens that hold little or no

direction of in host selection We show that aP vaccination helped clear B pertussis but resulted in an approximately 40 fold increase in B parapertussis lung colony forming units CFUs Such vaccine mediated facilitation of B parapertussis did not arise as a result of competitive release B parapertussis CFUs were higher in aP relative to sham vaccinated hosts regardless of whether infections were

indicate that due diligence in considering alternative spacing and use of non aluminum containing vaccines when possible will reduce whole body toxicity and may reduce risk of morbidity associated with exposure to aluminum The study concludes that careful consideration of expected aluminum exposures during regular and Catch Up vaccination is found to be especially important for infants and

vaccines against human papilloma virus has been criticised for lack of evidence for its safety Documentation from Danish authorities and answers from the European Medicines Agency EMA suggest that AAHS may not have been sufficiently evaluated Documentation from the Danish Medicines Agency shows discrepancies in the trial documents of two prelicensure clinical trials with Gardasil in 2002 and 2003 For both trials the Agency seems to have authorised potassium aluminium sulfate as the adjuvant and not AAHS In addition the participants in the trial launched in 2002 were informed that the comparator was saline even though the comparator was AAHS in an expedient consisting of L histidine polysorbate 80 sodium borate and sodium chloride According to the EMA AAHS was first introduced in Europe in 2004 as the adjuvant in Procomvax a vaccine against the hepatitis B virus and Haemophilus influenza type b The EMA reports that AAHS was introduced without any prelicensure safety evaluation

schedule results in a high degree of chronic aluminum toxicity in the first seven months of life a time period critically important to neurodevelopment and immune system development The authors reached this conclusion after assessing time spent in toxicity defined as the percentage of days of each week an infant spends with a body burden that exceeds the minimum safe level for the CDC schedule and two other lower aluminum schedules Important safety considerations include aluminum adjuvant dose per vaccine spacing of aluminum containing vaccines the child s weight at the time of vaccination and genetic variants that may limit ability to clear aluminum Changes to the vaccine schedule including use of vaccines that do not contain aluminum can significantly reduce time spent in toxicity View Abstract TAGS SYNOPSIS More than one in ten vaccine related adverse events in Zimbabwe are serious 11 and measles containing vaccines are one of the vaccines most frequently responsible

Do vaccines increase or decrease susceptibility to diseases other than those they protect against A Rubio Casillas C Manuel Rodriguez Quintero E M Redwan M Nath Gupta V N Uversky M Raszek Contrary to the long held belief that the effects of vaccines are specific for the disease they were created compelling evidence has demonstrated that vaccines can exert positive or deleterious non specific effects NSEs In this review we compiled research reports from the last 40 years which were found based on the PubMed search for the epidemiological and immunological studies on the non specific effects NSEs of the most common human vaccines Analysis of information showed that live vaccines induce positive NSEs whereas non live vaccines induce several negative NSEs including increased female mortality associated with enhanced susceptibility to other infectious diseases especially in developing countries These negative NSEs are determined by the vaccination sequence the antigen concentration in vaccines the type of vaccine used live vs non live and also by repeated vaccination We do not recommend stopping using non live vaccines as they have demonstrated to protect against their target disease so the suggestion is that their detrimental NSEs can be minimized simply by changing the current vaccination sequence High IgG4 antibody levels generated in response to repeated inoculation with mRNA COVID 19 vaccines could be associated with a higher mortality rate from unrelated diseases and infections by suppressing the immune system Since most COVID 19 vaccinated countries are reporting high percentages of excess mortality not directly attributable to deaths from such disease the NSEs of mRNA vaccines on overall mortality should be studied in depth View

comparable to that observed in the general population The FDA briefing on the Pfizer BioNTech trial stated observed frequency of reported Bell s palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population although this statement was removed from the subsequent FDA briefing on the Moderna trial However this reporting is based on a misconception driven by a subtle distinction between rates and proportions that has persisted in the lay media The estimated incidence rate of Bell s palsy in the general population ranges from 15 to 30 cases per 100 000 person years Since the 40 000 vaccine arm participants were followed for a median of 2 months the combined safety population receiving vaccine across the two trials represents roughly 6700 person years of observation time for an expected incidence of Bell s palsy of one to two cases in line with the single observed case in the combined placebo arms Therefore the observed incidence of Bell s

Documentation from Danish authorities and answers from the European Medicines Agency EMA suggest that AAHS may not have been sufficiently evaluated Documentation from the Danish Medicines Agency shows discrepancies in the trial documents of two prelicensure clinical trials with Gardasil in 2002 and 2003 For both trials the Agency seems to have authorised potassium aluminium sulfate as the adjuvant and not AAHS In addition the participants in the trial launched in 2002 were informed that the comparator was saline even though the comparator was AAHS in an expedient consisting of L histidine polysorbate 80 sodium borate and sodium chloride According to the EMA AAHS was first introduced in Europe in 2004 as the adjuvant in Procomvax a vaccine against the hepatitis B virus and Haemophilus

SUMMARY Measles virus is a paradigmatic RNA virus as the antigenic composition of the vaccination has not needed to be updated since its discovery The vaccine confers protection by inducing neutralizing antibodies that interfere with the function of the hemagglutinin protein Viral strains are indistinguishable serologically although characteristic nucleotide sequences differentiate 24 genotypes In this work we describe a distant evolutionary branch within genotype D4 Designated subgenotype D4 2 this virus is distinguishable by neutralization with vaccine induced monoclonal antibodies that target the neutralizing epitope NE The subgenotype D4 2 viruses have a higher predominance in countries with intermediary levels of vaccine coverage Our studies demonstrate that subgenotype D4 2 lacks epitopes associated with half of the known antigenic sites which significantly impacts our understanding of measles virus evolution View Abstract TAGS SYNOPSIS This preliminary

therapy SMDT is a widely and currently available solution to stem the tide of hospitalizations and death A multipronged therapeutic approach includes 1 adjuvant nutraceuticals 2 combination intracellular anti infective therapy 3 inhaled oral corticosteroids 4 antiplatelet agents anticoagulants 5 supportive care including supplemental oxygen monitoring and telemedicine Randomized trials of individual novel oral therapies have not delivered tools for physicians to combat the pandemic in practice No single therapeutic option thus far has been entirely effective and therefore a combination is required at this time An urgent immediate pivot from single drug to SMDT regimens should be employed as a critical strategy to deal with the large numbers of acute COVID 19 patients

parents for decades that following the CDC s childhood vaccine schedule is the best way to keep their kids healthy If vaccines are safe and effective why is there such growing controversy surrounding them Why are some parents opting to skip vaccines altogether or allowing them on a limited schedule that doesn t align with the CDC s recommendations While correlation doesn t necessarily indicate causation it s clear that something is amiss and the health of our children is going in the wrong direction The only way to stop these troubling health trends is by investigating all possible causes even if it means re examining what has ironically been considered settled science in mainstream medicine With all the advances in medicine in recent history why are our nation s children getting sicker In 1986 12 8 of children in the U S had a chronic health condition compared to 54 in 2007 curiously the last year this data was made publicly available The parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore While not conclusive on its own the existing science provides an undeniable alarming signal indicating further investigation into the safety profile of vaccines and their possible mechanisms of damage is paramount Vaccines that are injected into our children should undergo rigorous testing to prove safety and efficacy before going on the market Unfortunately industry funded vaccine studies are inherently flawed and poorly designed Almost none use inert placebo controls and even some of the so called placebos contain problematic adjuvants like aluminum and there are no long term double blind studies The entire schedule has never been properly tested despite what we hear from vaccine makers and our federal health agencies who claim it would be unethical to withhold life saving vaccines from children How can they know vaccines are life saving or that benefits exceed risks while they re still in the testing stage How would you go about testing the cumulative safety of all of the vaccines in the childhood schedule If vaccines were treated like most other pharmaceutical products you d do a double blind placebo controlled study divide the research subjects into two groups each selected at random and give one group all of the interventions and give the other group none Then the impact of the entire vaccine schedule would be clear But in the case of vaccines this type of experiment is deemed unethical and is prohibited by institutional review boards Instead vaccine studies are typically limited to testing a single vaccine at a time And even those tests rarely use inert placebos for the control group instead substituting another vaccine or using the adjuvants without the inactivated virus For example the

used an inert placebo Ten of the 16 compared the HPV vaccine against a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant and four trials used an already approved aluminum containing vaccine as the comparison These tactics muddy the waters around outcomes between the treatment and control groups What s In a Vaccine No one wants to expose their children to questionable substances especially those already widely known to be toxic However vaccines contain numerous concerning ingredients including aluminum mercury aborted fetal cell lines antibiotics monkey kidney cells formaldehyde and more This toxic list is especially troubling when we consider that expectant mothers are cautioned repeatedly to limit their exposure to anything that might harm the growing fetus Vaccine ingredients don t become any less toxic once the baby is born yet parents are expected to comply completely with the vaccine schedule no questions asked Even on the day of birth newborns are exposed to 250 micrograms of aluminum via the Hepatitis B vaccine well above the recommended limit even for adults The 1986 Act A Boon for Big Pharma When children are harmed by unsafe products such as faulty car seats contaminated baby food or over the counter drugs the manufacturers are liable to compensate for their injuries Why would the standard be any different for vaccines In 1986 Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act in response to mounting pressure from vaccine makers who claimed they could not afford to continue compensating for the excessive amount of injuries and deaths caused by their products The law granted pharmaceutical companies complete immunity from liability for any vaccine recommended on the CDC s childhood schedule Pharma ramped up development once there was no longer a threat of being sued for adverse outcomes and a vaccine gold rush ensued with revenues skyrocketing from 750 million in 1986 to 89 billion in 2021", "chunk_id":

like Boeing got to decide if Boeing s airplanes were safe enough to fly How did that work out Remember Boeing s 737 Max 8 jet crashes and how it took a Presidential decree to ground these planes Where

injection site like pain swelling and bruising they broke out all three groups However when they reported the more severe side effects like a systemic autoimmune disorders such as arthritis celiac disease inflammatory bowel disease hypothyroidism and psoriasis they added the children who got saline to those who got aluminum AAHS Not surprisingly 2 3 of both groups reported systemic autoimmune

to have side effects Some vaccines have not been improved in 50 years No Legal Requirement to Improve Vaccines Vaccine manufacturers are under no legal requirement and have no financial incentive to improve their vaccines This is primarily a legal decision by the government Here s some of the history In 1986 Congress enacted the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act NCVIA against the backdrop of a wave of tort litigation that threatened to drive manufacturers out of the business of providing vaccines Children were getting severely injured from vaccines Vaccine makers were getting sued The vaccine makers went to Congress and basically said if you don t protect us from this liability we will stop making vaccines Vaccine Makers Protected From Liability The NCVIA was passed and contained a number of provisions It created the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP and liability protection for vaccine makers so they could not be sued for certain actions The question before the U S Supreme Court in the case of Bruesewitz v Wyeth LLC 562 U S 223 2011 was whether the NCVIA stops vaccine makers from being sued when their vaccine injures or kills someone For you legal eagles the question before the Supreme Court was whether the NCVIA preempts all design defect claims against vaccine manufacturers brought by plaintiffs seeking compensation for injury or death caused by a vaccine s side effects A design defect occurs when there is an inherent flaw in a product s design that renders it unreasonably dangerous With drugs and almost all other products it is possible to sue for design defect This basically means that you can sue if the manufacturer sells you a product that is not safely designed Whether this was no longer possible was being decided in this case in respect to vaccines Bruesewitz Decision In this case Hannah Bruesewitz got the DTP vaccine when she was 6 months old April 1992 Within 24 hours she started to experience seizures Hannah suffered over 100 seizures during the next month and her doctors eventually diagnosed her with residual seizure disorder and developmental delay Hannah a teenager at the time the case was brought forward was still diagnosed with both conditions The court s opinion was written by Justice Scalia In it he said a number of things including that a vaccine s design is not open to question and that the safest design is not always the best one Part of the analysis rested on the question of what was unavoidable The statute said that a manufacturer is not liable for hurting a child if the side effect could not be

vaccine related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after the effective date of this subtitle if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings DTP Vaccine Approved in 1948 The vaccine at issue was a DTP vaccine manufactured by Lederle Laboratories It first received federal approval in 1948 and received supplemental approvals in 1953 and 1970 Remember Hannah was vaccinated in April 1992 so this vaccine had remained virtually unchanged for 44 years During that 44 year span newer and arguably safer DTP vaccines had or could have been invented In front of the U S Supreme Court Hannah s lawyers argued that when there is a safer vaccine available a manufacturer must act reasonably in pursuing that safer design This was an important point because there was no law that required a vaccine maker to make a vaccine in the most efficacious way with the least serious harm to children This was not a legal requirement In addition neither the CDC nor the FDA were or are legally required to do a comparative analysis for safety that is provided under State law design defect claims The defendant the drug maker with support from the U S Government Solicitor General Department of Justice for the United States disagreed Supreme Court Decision The opinion written by Justice Scalia also stated A side effect of a vaccine could always have been avoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element We have no idea how much more expensive an alternative design can be before it compromis es a vaccine s cost or how much efficacy an alternative design can sacrifice to improve safety Supreme Court Dissent The dissent was written by Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg and stated in part T he majority s decision leaves a regulatory vacuum in which no one neither the FDA nor any other federal agency nor state and federal juries ensures that vaccine manufacturers adequately take account of scientific and technological advancements This concern is especially acute with respect to vaccines that have

unavoidable that their products will have side effects and if the vaccine was made any safer it may not work as well Plus they don t have to pay if their vaccine injures a child This is the only group of products in the U S that get this special treatment The court decided that people may not sue a vaccine maker for failing to update the vaccine with a newer safer version By protecting vaccine makers in this way the government has taken away a vaccine maker s incentive to develop improved designs It s an immense giveaway to the vaccine industry and it means that older vaccines will probably

Millions of people myself included initially believed the COVID 19 vaccine disaster to be a one off the result of a novel rapidly evolving virus combined with a rushed therapeutic packaged in an

humbled and enraged Our government the media and the powerful and rapacious pharmaceutical industrial complex have deceived endangered and gaslit the public for far too long I hope this explosive and

Today s parents and a growing number of my colleagues are now coming to recognize this grand irony in our modern pediatric health care system The Science is finally here in one place If you want to follow the science related to vaccines and health problems this is a must read With over one hundred references the actual harm being caused by vaccines is exposed Parents don t listen to an authority figure without doing your own research This book is required reading for every informed parent With easy to understand graphics and explanations of statistics you can analyze data from clinicians and researchers from around the world You may find yourself doubting the simplistic safe and effective doctrine repeated by health authorities You will find yourself more empowered to make vaccine decisions for your child While the CDC continues to refuse to do the type of vaccinated versus unvaccinated study that parents have long been demanding independent researchers have forged ahead and the results are now quite clear unvaccinated children are healthier In Vax Unvax Let the Science Speak Robert F Kennedy Jr and Dr Brian Hooker review those data as well as many additional studies comparing health outcomes between those who did or did not receive individual vaccines This is an essential resource for the serious researcher and a valuable guide for anyone wishing to exercise truly informed consent The graphs helpfully included with the discussion of each study covered speak for themselves It is past time for the public health establishment to stop deceiving the public with their proclamations of official dogma about the ostensible safety of these pharmaceutical products Bobby Kennedy and Brian Hooker are tireless heroes on the front line of a great battle to protect our health freedom Biomedical studies are being falsified and the masses are being deceived by health authorities the vaccine industry and a complicit media Read this book and let the true science speak When I met Dr Hooker on August 29 2014 he was more than a decade into his relentless efforts through the Freedom of Information Act FOIA to reveal not only the studies the CDC refused to

confession regarding the censorship and fraud in the MMR vaccine trial by the CDC to cover up the fraud in the in clinical literature surrounding all vaccines Stunned by the blatant corruption in Dr Hooker s presentation that day Kent Heckenlively and I in collaboration with Robert F Kennedy Jr began to write Plague of Corruption Throughout 2019 Dr Hooker and Kennedy collaborated to reveal much of the CDC FDA and NIH corruption in the thirty four page foreword to Plague of Corruption that revealed manipulation of hundreds of basic research studies showing dangers of xenotransplantation microbial contamination and environmental toxins including mercury aluminum PEG and the corruption of the agencies tasked to protect public health Vax Unvax is the result of their heroic effort to reveal the censored science and truth behind the role of a failure by these agencies tasked to conduct safety studies in three decades of liability free vaccines and the resultant explosion of chronic disease and disability facing our world today Given the massive push to vaccinate a new generation this book is a must read supporting a moratorium on inoculations in favor of oral and mucosal immunization strategies In Vax Unvax Let the Science Speak authors Robert F Kennedy Jr and Brian Hooker have provided a deep dive into vaccine safety by looking at published data from independent researchers The resulting review of vaccinated and unvaccinated children s health outcomes clearly shows the damage much of it neurological that blind adherence to the CDC s current vaccine schedule can induce The studies highlighted are those that both the FDA and CDC have routinely refused and continue to refuse to do themselves The official reason for not providing such studies is based on the erroneous notion that conducting vaccinated unvaccinated evaluations would somehow be unethical Kennedy and Hooker demolish this argument and then proceed to review the safety of different vaccines many that contain adjuvant aluminum or Thimerosal the latter an ethyl mercury compound Overall for those trying to understand the often confusing claims and counterclaims particularly lay people the book provides some badly needed clarity The book also considers the current COVID 19 mRNA vaccines in the context of the older childhood vaccine platforms This is a particularly timely contribution in that the COVID 19 pandemic and resulting vaccine mandates have paradoxically served to make more people question the official safe and effective mantra that tends to surround all vaccines If the

confusing and frightening to consider the pros and cons of vaccines against childhood diseases what if they make the wrong decision in either direction and their child is harmed While many in the medical profession may not like the book because it exposes the outright deception of the pharmaceutical industry the CDC and the FDA I strongly believe that many parents or parents to be will be grateful for the information it contains Simply put at the end of the day the ability to consider all aspects of vaccine safety in order to make an informed choice for one s children or oneself is an absolutely critical aspect of real health freedom In turn health freedom is intimately tied to the concept of security of the person perhaps the most fundamental of natural rights Kennedy and Hooker should be commended for tackling this crucial issue in order to bring clarity to the mass of dis and mis information peddled by the health establishment and the mainstream media If indeed the truth can set you free then this book is a huge step in the right direction If there is only one book you read in your entire life let it be this one If you want the science to speak then have the courage to look at the actual science data and truth found in the pages of Vax Unvax Arm yourself with the information that puts the power back into the hands of parents where it belongs not in the hands of corrupt Pharma captured government officials and incentivized doctors spouting catchphrases with little to no evidence to back it up RFK Jr and Dr Brian Hooker are the bold voices of truth presenting

more about the Larry King political sub culture of drugs and child abuse and the horrors of child abuse committed and covered up by certain members of the Catholic clergy but the circulation of The Franklin Cover Up throughout the United States has brought many new cases to my doorstep And one after another I have become involved as attorney on one side or the other in these startling cases from Columbine to the Oklahoma Bombing from MY first of its kind lawsuit against any Catholic Diocese for covering up child abuse by priests to today when it seems every day brings a new revelation about the abuse and use of children by clergy What I was condemned for saying 15 years ago when the first edition of The Franklin Cover Up first came out is now shouted from the rafters of the churches and POLITICAL HALLS across the United States AND THE ABUSES ARE BEING CORRECTED When this book first came out it was the first to open the ugly side of many of these issues and I was certainly condemned by many for doing so In fact I was so threatened because of that first book that I had to move my entire family to a small town of 300 people Clatonia Nebraska where I felt I had more security and neighbors to help watch out for and protect my children That move has worked out fine for me And my children are the greatest ever I wish I COULD DROP THIS ISSUE ENTIRELY but I have too many daily weekly calls from folk all over America asking for help or guidance or information or direction on their particular problems Hence I thought the best way to answer them was to make this book available to them with current updates That is part of what I have tried to do in this 200412005 edition of The Franklin Cover Up I have never spent one penny advertising or promoting this book However whatever caused it it has sold well over 110 000 One Hundred Ten Thousand copies Hopefully it will do", "chunk_id": "ai_corpus_slimmer_clean_filtered:franklin-cover-up.txt:0:103ad5d7a730", "wtk_id": NaN},

nurses came to check on him early next morning Boner was sitting in a chair bleeding from the mouth and quite dead Former FBI Los Angeles Bureau Chief Ted Gunderson tried to get autopsy and other information and details that were promised him on Boner s death but Gunderson and appar ently every other entity were totally shut out of all information No news stories on Boner s death were

against the Church DeCamp s suit first showed Americans the very serious problem with abuse and cover up of the abuse throughout the United States by members of the Catholic clergy Boys Town and the Archdiocese of Omaha have now also been named in multiple lawsuits for the identical activities that DeCamp alleged in his 1991 lawsuit which as stated was the first of its kind in America to open and expose this abuse cesspool FINAL COMMENT UPDATE I have become involved in a number of super high profile cases since First Edition of Franklin Cover Up came out but perhaps the most frightening to me has been the COLUMBINE case where I represented various victims of the massacre and or their families I believe as a result of those cases I am the only lawyer to have taken the depositions of the Harris boy s mother father and I am one of the only victims lawyers to have seen certain Columbine materials and tapes I have reached certain conclusions on Columbine which I feel obligated to put into print here in hopes it will some day make a difference More court action has been done to keep everything secret and destroy the depositions than anything 1 have seen in my 40 years of court activity SO for my own personal and LEGAL safety and protection let me say simply that everything absolutely everything l say here is simply MY OPINION AND BELIEF and not done to violate any court orders or sealed records But say these OPINIONS and BELIEFS I MUST 1 I believe the first crime committed at Columbine was the slaugh ter of the children Harris and Klebold s classmates by Harris and Klebold 2 Just as surely I do believe the second crime of Columbine has been the continuing and strong suppression of the informa tion and evidence by the Legal System which keeps parents and the public from really ever knowing the truth or at least having a real opportunity to make judgments as to what the truth is by having available all the information from which to make judgments 3 I believe as sure as I believe anything on this earth the claim I made IN A LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL COURT in which I alleged on behalf of the Columbine children that the Harris boy s actions including

of this lawsuit and the lawsuit was dismissed by the Federal Judge IT BECAME PUBLIC INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE THAT CERTAIN OF THESE ANTIDEPRESSANTS DO IN FACT CAUSE SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS AND NOW THIS FACT MUST BE PUT ON THE DRUGS WHEN THEY ARE SOLD OR PRESCRIBED TO CHILDREN But of course when I had this lawsuit going none of this information was public knowledge

and now head of Salomon Brothers Warren Buffett and Ronald Roskens the current administrator of the Agency for Interna tional Development all have in common I asked my close friend and adviser William Colby one day in 1991 I give up fanner head of the Central Intelligence Agency CIA Colby said What could that group have in common Three things I replied all of them a burden at times for those who have to carry them The three things are me John DeCamp a case called Franklin and a man named Larry King Are you serious Colby asked Dead serious I responded And I hope that word dead does not tum out to be a prophetic pronouncement as it has for at least fifteen other Franklin related personalities My statement to Bill Colby was not made lightly Colby and his wife Sally Shelton Colby a United States ambassador under President Jimmy Carter were at that very moment warn ing me to get away from the Franklin child abuse investigation Larry King and anybody else linked with Franklin as quickly as possible for the sake of my own life and safety Sally and Bill had never talked to me like this before They sat me down made it clear that this was not one of our routine discussions about life and health and happiness and empha sized to me the serious nature of what and whom I was deal ing with What you have to understand John is that sometimes there ix THE FRANKLIN COVER UP are forces and events too big too powerful with so much at stake for other people or institutions that you cannot do any thing about them no matter how evil or wrong they are and no matter how dedicated or sincere you are or how much evidence you have That is simply one of the hard facts of life you have to face You have done your part You have tried to expose the evil and wrongdoing It has hurt you terribly

those times Bill warned with Sally nodding her head in affirmation When a caution of this nature comes from someone of the stature and experience of Bill or Sally Colby you have to take it seriously even if you do not want to I had already had warnings enough that unless I backed off from the Franklin situation I might be looking at life from a pine box six feet un derground Bill Colby had ample reason to know the seriousness of the Franklin case In secret Colby had been hired a few months earlier by the Nebraska Legislature s investigative committee to look into the single engine plane crash in which the Senate s private investigator Gary Caradori and his son were killed But Bill I argued somebody has to do something The problem here is that our institutions of government have been corrupted If there is a cover up and I now absolutely believe there is even though originally I thought this whole Franklin story had to be a fantasy then that cover up can only take place with the cooperation and even the active assistance of some of our key institutions of government from the courts to the cops from the highest politicians to the media representa tives to the wealthiest business leaders of our community and country I can t believe what you are telling me Bill Are you saying I should just lay it down and walk away from this when I know kids are being abused and killed when I know our most respected citizens and business leaders are up to their eyebrows in drug dealing and official corruption when every bone in FOREWORD my body tells me that evil is triumphing and everybody who is anybody is scared beanless to do something about it for fear of one thing or another How can any honest or intelligent person do this If I or someone like me do not keep pursuing this

before the now infamous August 19 1991 coup attempt to throw out Gorba chov and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union as it had existed since 1917 Why was I in Russia Bill explained For meetings in Moscow to try to work with other world leaders and Russian leaders privately and quietly so that when and if a transition of power and a change of government and economic policy occur in Russia they occur in such a way that it avoids a war was staying at a hotel located right near Red Square which as you know is the most guarded sacred spot in the Soviet Union It was about 1 00 in the morning I could not sleep The next morning I was to return to the United States Not being able to sleep I thought I would see if it was possible to walk around and get some exercise I walked out of my room expecting to be stopped by the guards or secret police But nobody paid attention to me in the hallway I walked on down into the hotel lobby Nobody seemed to care So I walked out the door of the hotel directly onto Red Square Nobody paid attention I stopped by Lenin s tomb I stood a few feet away from the entrance to the Kremlin Then it struck me like a ton of bricks It was over Here was the head of the CIA once hated and feared by the Soviet Union wandering unwatched and unguarded around Red Square after spending the previous week meeting with their THE FRANKLIN COVER UP leaders trying to help them save themselves from economic collapse and political revolution which might turn into a new totalitarian dictatorship And nobody cared The guards did not care who I was or what I was doing The system had collapsed It was over Communism was dead That was the happy part Bill went on quietly But I also realized that this walk in Red Square was going to be the only victory parade I would have to celebrate my forty year battle for this There were not going to be any parades down Madison Avenue with ticker tape This walk in Red Square was the only victory parade I was going to have So what s the message I asked What are you trying to tell", "chunk_id": "ai_corpus_slimmer_clean_filtered:franklin-cover-up.txt:6:a33e458fcdaa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 21355, "dataset":

are you trying to tell me Sometimes Bill said There are forces too powerful for us to whip them individually in the time frame that we would like We have to keep working at our goal But we have to be sensible enough not to risk everything and get ourselves destroyed or killed in the process That victory we seek may take much longer than we wanted and come in ways we never anticipated Maybe just maybe you have to have your own private victory parade You maybe have to face the fact that you cannot right all the unrightable wrongs That there really are people too powerful interests too big that the rich and the powerful even when doing evil can and will succeed and you can do nothing about it at that moment But Bill continued you do the possible recognize the impossible and if you are right and you are and we both know it there will be a time when victory will come and the good will triumph over the evil Only the when and where and how are usually unknown to us The best we might be able to do sometimes is point out the truth and then step aside That is where I think you are now For your own safety and survival step aside Maybe I should start carrying a gun I suggested Bill gave a cynical laugh and said No that will only likely get you killed If they are going to get you a gun you are carrying is not going to stop anything The best thing you can xii FOREWORD do for your personal safety is to tell your story and make sure you have the national press interested in this and looking into it with some really good investigative reporters Huh I muttered Maybe the simplest thing for me to do is to try to tell the story Maybe it is Bill said Besides I myself want to fully understand what you said at the beginning about what all those prominent individuals from President Bush to Bob Kerrey from myself to billionaire Warren Buffett have in common Maybe I ll have to write a book and tell you won t I Bill Well here it is xiii PART I INTRODUCTION On June 21 1991 21 year

was pro nounced guilty by a jury in Douglas County Nebraska on eight counts of felony perjury On August 8 1991 she was sentenced to serve nine to twenty seven years in prison Owen was indicted for telling a grand jury before which she testified in 1990 that she was sexually abused as a juvenile by a Nebraska district court judge by the chief of police of the city of Omaha by the manager of the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union and others Alisha Owen also witnessed she said the abuse of other children by figures in Nebraska s political and financial establishment whom she named among them the publisher of the state s largest newspaper the Omaha World Herald She testified that she was in a group of Nebraska children who functioned for years as illegal drug couriers traveling nationwide for some of Nebraska s wealthiest most powerful and prominent businessmen Two grand juries one local and one federal had a mandate to consider these and other charges of child abuse connected with the Franklin Credit Union They indicted the victim wit nesses for perjury instead This is unprecedented probably in the history of the United States commented Dr Judianne Densen Gerber a lawyer psychiatrist and nationally prominent specialist on child abuse during her visit to Nebraska in December 1990 If the children are not telling the truth particularly if they have been abused they need help medical attention You don t throw them in jail Both grand juries admitted that Alisha Owen and Paul Bo nacci whose testimony extensively corroborated Owen s had rHE FRANKLIN COVER UP been badly abused But this was done they concluded by persons other than those the young people named Bonacci too was indicted for perjury Two other victim witnesses whose stories buttressed those of Owen and Bonacci recanted under immense pressure Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci refused to recant America is suffering an epidemic of child abuse S O S America a 1990 report from the Washington D C based Children s Defense Fund CDF said that a survey by the American Association for Protecting Children indicates that 2 2 million children were reported abused neglected or both in 1987 a 225

1990 If we saw these same numbers of children suddenly developing some kind of illness we d think we had a major epidemic on our hands Shocking as the numbers are the nature of the crimes is more so Ever more frequently abuse involves what law enforcement officials refer to as sadistic ritualistic features or to speak plainly satanism What the victims of this type of abuse de scribe is so horrific that parents teachers and even child welfare workers have great difficulty to grasp what they are being told The mind recoils from such evil inflicted on the most innocent of all people children In recent months news media around the country have been full of propaganda to the effect that children who report abuse are just telling what they fantasized or stories fed to them by adults As for satanic or ritualistic abuse many newspapers declare that it does not even exist as the New York Village Voice did in a June 1990 article which attacked the great ritualistic abuse hoax xviii INTRODUCTION A banner headline story in the Chicago Tribune of May 17 1991 A chilling tale of child abuse no one can prove gave typical coverage of the debate over whether or not children are being abused by satanists All nine children tell the same story a grisly tale of being taken out of school and abused in a blue house They name the sameculprit a school administratorwho performs satanic rituals as part of his twisted routine In the 14 months since the first child came forward police said they have conducted 150 interviews and cannot substantiate the claims of the children who range in age from 5 to 9 Prosecutor Stanley Levco is more blunt He doesn t believe them and he plans to publicly clear the accused But the children s enraged parents believe them And a once skeptical psychologist also thinks they are telling the truth All agree the children have been traumatized The prob lem is no one can prove how In all these cases I don t know of a single shred of credible

children are encouraged to step forward and expose adults who hurt them police are encountering more cases of child abuse accompanied by allegations of occult rituals The Tribune cited Kenneth Lanning the Federal Bureau of Investigation s expert on occult crime on the virtual non existence of ritualistic abuse Lanning who has publicized his opinion that more people have been killed in the name of Jesus and Mohammed than in the name of Satan said on this occasion that there had been only one criminal conviction stemming from charges of satanic ritual abuse in the U S On April 28 1991 the Omaha World Herald carried a story along these lines titled Satanism Lots of Talk Little Proof It said that the problem was not an epidemic of satanic abuse but rather authorities say America is witnessing an epidemic of concern over Satan and his minions especially among adherents of fundamentalist Christianity So called rit xix THE FRANKLIN COVER UP ual abuse is only part of it But are these stories of incest and human sacrifice true Many mental health experts think not And at least two law enforcement officers with the FBI and the San Francisco police say they have looked into some of the claims and found nothing Emphasis added An embattled minority of law enforcement officials disagrees with Lanning of the FBI Ted Gunderson a 28 year FBI veteran former special agent in charge of the Bureau s Los Angeles Field Division speaks from his personal knowledge of one of the most infamous recent cases involving ritual abuse the McMartin pre school case in California After a 33 month trial and despite voluminous evidence against them school operators Peggy McMartin Buckey and her son Raymond Buckey were exonerated in January 1990 on 52 counts of molesting the children in their care while the jury failed to reach a verdict on thirteen other counts against Raymond Buckey In a May 25 1990 interview with Executive Intelligence Review Gunderson said In the McMartin case for example before any criminal charges were filed against anyone 460 complaints were filed with the Manhattan Beach police Are we to believe that 460 families fed their children the same story of ritualistic sexual abuse animal sacrifices etc He stressed that the crimes were reported in an affluent suburban area where residents are typically skeptical about organized child abuse or satanic conspiracies Gunderson

active in the United States in the twentieth century Aleister Crowley Anton LaVey and Michael Aquino Ken Lanning is probably the most effec tive and foremost speaker for the satanic movement in this country today or any time in the past Evidence from Gunderson s investigations has convinced him that tens of thousands of children or young people disappear from their homes each year and that many are ritually sacri ficed A decade ago one estimate printed in Reader s Digest in July 1982 was that approximately 100 000 children are unaccounted for each year That number sounds too high but xx INTRODUCTION nobody knows what the true figure is because the FBI does not keep count Gunderson observes The FBI has an accurate count of the number of automobiles stolen every year It knows the number of homicides rapes and robberies but the FBI has no idea of the number of children who disappear every year They simply do not ask for the statistics Every month every major police department in the United States files its uniform crime statistics with the FBI It would be simple for the bureau to add one more column to the statistics and get a breakdown of every reported case of missing

prominent Republican Party activists A Lurid THE FRANKLIN COVER UP Mysterious Scandal Begins Taking Shape in Omaha head lined the New York Times Three years later people living outside eastern Nebraska are unlikely to be aware of the Franklin scandal and those in the region have been told that the case is closed Larry King is serving his jail term for misappropriation of funds after a guilty plea Law enforcement at the local state and federal levels said there was no evidence of drug peddling organized child abuse or satanic activity by King The allegations of child abuse were a carefully crafted hoax according to one of the two grand juries that examined the affair A chiefwitness Owen stands convicted of perjury The day after Alisha Owen s conviction 3 000 Nebraskans responded to a local radio station s poll 94 of them said they believed that she had been railroaded and that there was a cover up What the public suspects the careful investigator of the Franklin case confronts face to face This case is far from closed This book will explore the substance of the Franklin case much of which has never been revealed to the public until now That means evidence concerning key players which apparently was never brought before or was ignored by the grand juries It means evidence gathered for the Nebraska Legislature s special committee on the Franklin case which found and verified the tracks of criminal activity where law enforcement purported to see none The legislative investigation which began in November 1988 ended on January 9 1991 when a new Legis lature was sworn into office and the investigative committee authorized by the previous Legislature was automatically termi nated as required by the state constitution The Legislature had the option to renew the investigation but did not many members knew or suspected what the stakes were and were terrified I write about the unfolding of the Franklin case its exposure and its cover up as not only

to Ronald Reagan and in 1988 to George Bush I was there as the story of the Franklin Credit Union and the child abuse broke in Nebraska I wrote the DeCamp memo in 1990 which marked a new phase of the case I will describe events in which I personally was involved Most of these have never been made public and it has pained me tremendously at times when I knew that the Omaha World Herald was saying something false or distorting a fact that I had no forum or no legal right to respond because I had to protect a client or honor a legal privilege As an attorney furthermore I have some specialization in cases of allegations by youngsters against adults in the area of child abuse It has been my policy and belief as it is now that there is nothing worse than child abuse with the possible exception of falsely accusing people of child abuse Just in the past year I have overturned two felony charges against individuals in rural Nebraska who were charged with abusing their daughters based on allegations from the daughters I was convinced the girls were not telling the truth I successfully proved this in both cases and the girls broke down and told the whole story as to why they had lied In addition I am the lawyer for the National Child Abuse Defense and Resource Center of Nebraska which fights against false accusations of child abuse and is made up of adults who have been falsely accused of child abuse By contrast with these cases of fantasy I can say without reservation that in one Franklin related instance after another there was sufficient evidence and corroboration available for anyone seeking it to back up the victims tales My own recollections and considered judgments are just a fraction of the huge record of the Franklin case The files of the Legislature s

this book never before made public makes it possible to contrast the assurances of local and state officials that there was little or no Franklin related abuse with what those agencies had in their own files The chapters of this book dealing with Franklin are based apart from my direct experience strictly on documents avail able and documented facts I do not claim to know the accuracy or veracity of every statement made by every witness or other person recorded in these documents I do claim however that the statements and the evidence were officially presented exactly as described Readers can draw their own conclusions as to what is or is not believable I have been very careful to present only material and docu ments which I can legally and properly in my opinion make available I also must state that I received none of the Franklin commit tee documentation from the committee s chairman Senator Loran Schmit other than what I was entitled to as attorney for Paul Bonacci Some people inevitably will claim as they did when I issued the DeCamp memo in January 1990 that Senator Schmit whose private attorney I am leaked everything to me I said then and I say now that nothing could be further from the truth Neither is anything whatsoever from grand jury docu ments some of which I had access to presented here be cause I am not allowed to disclose this information I wish I could I wish everything about Franklin could be made public Then the public could judge even more thoroughly about what is true and what is false I believe that sunshine and exposure of all facts from all agencies that have information about Franklin would establish the truth of the stories of drug abuse child abuse pedophilia abuse of positions of public trust cover up by institutions of government and most tragic involvement in this conduct and later cover up by some of our most respected and wealthiest citizens I believe that the record must get out into the open to the extent possible and that the public has to share the information xxiv INTRODUCTION Otherwise truth becomes whatever those who control the insti tutions of government and the press say it is Benjamin Frank

first time it appears The Franklin case which has dominated political life in Nebraska for three years has chilling implications for the whole United States The unfinished business of the Franklin

drug trafficking money laundering pornography child prostitution and the kidnaping and sale of children in different parts of the United States and abroad The shocking treatment of Alisha Owen and

was tapped a finding con firmed to him by sources inside the phone company The investigator continued to work with a growing sense of the importance of his task On May 29 1990 Caradori wrote to Franklin committee chairman Loran Schmit To be frank he told the senator it is my opinion that we are the only ones who are seriously working to get this case out in the open so to speak I honestly feel that should we terminate this investi gation that no further work will be done on it On June 23 1990 Caradori took a few hours off to attend a barbecue at the Omaha home of Mary Lyons Barrett Most of those present were members of the Concerned Parents a THE FRANKLIN COVER UP group of citizens who were outraged about the lack of a serious investigation of child abuse by state or federal authorities and the campaign in Nebraska s major newspaper the Omaha World Herald to discredit young victim witnesses Arriving in a 1980 white Corvette Caradori told Concerned Parents president Trish Lanphier he had taken the car out of storage for the day s drive because his other vehicles had been tam pered with and he was sure that no one had ever seen that car He was planning to sell his boat for the same reason but what he most feared he told Lanphier was that someone would tamper with the private plane he often flew It would be so easy to tamper with a plane In early July 1990 Caradori phoned Senator Schmit We ve got them he exclaimed about some new evidence he had just developed There s no way they can get out of it now He and his son Andrew would be flying to Chicago for the All

happened at 2 30 a m on July 11 when Gary and AJ were flying back to Lincoln Nebraska from Chicago A farmer in Lee County Illinois reported that he saw a flash of light heard an explosion and saw a

was on the early edition of television news in Nebraska but got pulled from subsequent reports which said that the plane exploded on impact At the Nebraska statehouse that morning Senator Schmit talked to reporters who soon filled his office There were a lot of people in this state who wanted to see Gary dead he charged They got their wish The question to be answered is whether it was a coincidence Gary s brother Dick Caradori was interviewed by the Lincoln Journal about the many threats Gary had received I know that it weighed a lot on his mind Dick said He always hoped that they just didn t cover it up He said there was a lot to it and a lot of big names involved and hoped their money wouldn t sweep it under the rug Gary s mother Mary told the paper that Gary cared dearly

motel there was also no record of what phone calls he might have made from Chicago After months of investigation the National Transportation Safety Board had not come up with the cause of the crash My friend Bill Colby former director of the CIA commented after he looked into the matter that the cause would probably never be known Mary Caradori rendered her own verdict on the deaths of Gary and AJ My son and grandson were murdered Many Nebraskans echoed her opinion They have growing grounds for suspicion From late 1988 when the Franklin case first broke into public view until mid 1991 at least 15 people associated with the case as investigators alleged perpetrators or potential witnesses died sudden deaths many of them violent In December 1990 as Dr Densen Gerber prepared to travel to

on June 10 1985 when the Washington County Nebraska Sheriffs Department contacted a Nebraska Department of Social Services DSS social worker handling the case of Sean Sally and Steve McArthur The children were living in foster care with Jarrett and Barbara Webb of Fort Calhoun The social worker wrote up the call The Sheriffs department phoned today and stated they have the McArthur children in their custody and they had picked them up from the Webb home due to child abuse complaint Sean had welts and scratches over parts of his back which he said the Webbs had beat him with a railroad iron and belt They also had picked up the Webbs son Joey age 16 Joey also complained of being beaten by his parents Sean said the Webbs have been beating them for quite some time and this is not the first time this has happened to them They were afraid to say anything the other times Jarrett Webb worked for the Omaha Public Power District and was a board member of the Franklin Community Federal Credit

their grandmother s and Nelly separately and together Both girls stated numer ous times that they refuse to go back to the Webbs Both girls have stated they have received whippings and beatings from both Barbara and Jarrett at different times These started in 1978 approximately eight months after they moved into the Webb home The girls said they were hit with objects an extension cord a belt a black thing rubber hose and a railroad prop a narrow piece of heavy black rubber approximately two feet long with several holes in each end Before they were struck they were made to remove their clothing They were mainly struck on the back or on the behind but occasionally on the head or face Social workers removed Nelly whose full name was Corne lia M Patterson Webb from the Webb home and

Tooley found out that the abuse was not limited to beatings Tooley wrote in her report dated January 30 1986 She stated that she had been sexually abused Nelly stated that when she was approximately

by Jarrett supported by a poly graph test given to Nelly 1 30 86 4 The intense concern by the children out of the Webb home for the physical and emotional well being of the chil dren remaining in the

Tripp called Nelly Webb a liar lie detector tests notwithstanding Tripp s attitude was recorded by Julie Walters a youth care worker called on to interview Nelly and Kimberly Patterson Webb in March

fur nishings He went on to state that he had bought a couch from one of the furniture dealers in Omaha that would not fit in the elevator as it was being transported to KING S apartment And as a result of this a crane was rented for the amount of 1 200 00 to have the couch lifted to the apartment from the outside He also stated that the apart ment was very elegantly furnished and the 50 000

included nude photography Those participating were given something to drink which she stated tasted like apple juice but which she thought contained some kind of a drug 19 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP SMITH indicated that NELLY and KIMBERLY WEBB had also reported these activities to Police in the past but that nothing had been done She stated that the WEBB girls had told the superintendent of Fort Calhoun Schools whom she identified as a Mr FINCH and stated that it had been reported to him first but the girls felt that since nothing was done that he must have been involved also In a report

1988 Omaha police officers in the Robbery and Sex Unit received an unexpected visit from their boss Chief of Police Robert Wadman According to the officers own account related by Nebraska Foster Care Review Board official Dennis Carlson in testimony to the Legislature s Executive Board they took precautions to keep Wadman out of their work on Larry King Excerpts of Carlson s remarks from the Executive Board minutes of December 19 1988 show that the officers feared a police cover up of King s activities from within the de partment Officer Carmean told me some things which I found to be somewhat startling I asked if he was interested in informa tion regarding Larry King and he said yes we are we re conducting what he called a supersensitive investigation of Larry King and he said this investigation was so supersensi tive that they were not even using the steno pool in the Omaha Police Department They were handwriting their police reports and he also told me that Chief Wadman had come to their unit and directly asked if they were investigating Larry King Investigator Carmean told me we lied to the Chief and we said no we are not investigating Larry King OK so that conversation took place on July 20th of 1988 After we were presented with that information we had some concerns as to what was going on in the Omaha Police Department We were concerned about if we gave this infor 25 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP mation to the Omaha Police Department what would they do with it The investigation of Loretta Smith s charges did not go far in Wadman s department Neither did

Officer CARMEAN Reporting Officer told DR SHILLING that sometime during the week of 04 July 1988 this Reporting Officer will assign Officer CARMEAN to revisit Loretta at the hospital in order to build up some rapport and possibly obtain more spe cific information Carmean never came back to interview Loretta Smith again As Loretta volunteered more horrific detailed allegations during the summer Richard Young Hospital and FCRB person nel were concerned about the lack of police interest Dennis Carlson recalled in his Executive Board testimony Loretta was making more allegations against Larry King and others and these were allegations of the most serious nature She was reporting that she had witnessed homicides Investigator Carmean was contacted by myself on one possi bly two or three

Loretta s psychiatrist contacted the police in Omaha and asked them to come Loretta s personal care worker Ken Stoner contacted the police Richard Young employee Kirstin Hallberg contacted the police as well as Adrienne Hart who is Kirstin s supervisor All those people had made contact and nothing was being done Not long after after his interview with Loretta Officer Carmean was transferred out of investigations altogether into a section called Research and Planning At the same Executive Board meeting Senator Ernie Chambers recounted a phone conversation with Carmean When I called the sexual assault unit they said he s no longer here and that s when they told me that he was with Research and Planning I finally got him and I men tioned his enthusiasm at the outset and that from what I had developed in terms of creditable information being given to me I felt he d been transferred because he was getting too close to something and his superiors did not want him to continue So there was a silence then he kind of chuckled 27 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP he said well no uh I wanted this transfer I ve known of Carmean for years and he s not the type of officer who d want to be put into an office

Robbery and Sex Unit under the command of Lt Guy Goodrich While in that assignment Officer Carmean was involved as an investigator and did participate in looking into matters involving allegations that Larry King was involved in some sexual improprieties with young people The investigation never did come close to supporting the allegations suffi ciently for a charge to be considered against Larry King One other Omaha policeman who was reported to have kept a file on Larry King Officer Bill Skoleski died of a heart attack In August 1989 Chief Wadman dismissed out of hand the criminal satanic horrors that Loretta Smith and other children had described to authorities On Omaha radio station KKAR the city s chief law enforcement officer chalked up concern 28 COVER UP PHASE I THE POLICE about these allegations to the fact that some Omahans have a prurient interest of child abuse of child sexual abuse those kinds of things I think that the media attention to that element of things is inappropriate Regarding Loretta Smith Wadman said The primary wit ness was making statements that were very bizarre and were not founded in reality Wadman concluded his KKAR interview by stating that the OPD and other agencies had conducted a thorough investiga tion but the allegations led to a dead end Robert Wadman has sworn under oath that he barely knew Larry King that he had very few social contacts with Larry King That s not what King says In April 22 1989 interviews with King and Wadman Frank Brown of TV 7 Omaha ques tioned them about an incident in which Wadman intervened

question about Mr King and the relationship to child pornography or pornogra phy of any kind WADMAN We had a situation where we were advised that there was a possibility of child pornography involving no it came in as child pornography case What happened is that there was a photographer who was taking photographs of young women and in the course of that set of circumstances a mother with her daughter called and filed a complaint with the police department and the complaint involved a situation where her daughter was approached by the photographer to be photographed and the photographer extended an invita tion to this young woman s mother to come with her They went to the studio photographs were taken and in the course of that the mother became concerned over the photographs and some of the photographs that she observed at the photo studio and then filed a complaint of concern that this was a possible pornographic situation We investigated it found the photographer to be you know legitimately involved in the photography business legitimately involved in conducting the photographs and getting signed releases and having a photography studio and so on The only involvement is that this individual had subleased his studio or apartment from Larry King and that was the extent of our investigation into pornography related activi ties involving Mr King in any direct way This was the photographer Rusty Nelson described to Margo Georgiu by people who knew him as a pervert and proven by her to have lied about his professional experience and resume The pictures in his studio were frontal nudity 31 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP shots of adolescent girls Nelson described King not as his landlord but as his boss The investigating officers had com piled and filed accounts from several people about the lavish spending by King on Nelson s and other apartments about his comings and goings in Mercedes Benz cars and other evidence of an unexplained leap in King s income and about the

enforcement agency and is not equipped to investigate crimes let alone prosecute them in 1988 found itself by default the main recipient of reports of abuse from children and from case workers which attested to the existence of an organized child exploitation ring in Nebraska and stretching far beyond Expressing frustration and alarm that the Omaha Police had failed to investigate reports of child murders and other serious crimes even after many urgent phone calls from personnel at Richard Young Hospital FCRB Executive Director Carol Stitt on July 13 1988 met with Nebraska s Republican governor Kay Orr to seek help Governor Orr told her to do whatever is necessary to secure an investigation On July 20 Stitt wrote to Attorney General Robert Spire to request that his office the state s top prosecuting agency enter the case For the first time somebody openly pulled together the testimony of Nelly Patterson Webb Loretta Smith and other children whose reports of abuse all cited Larry King Pursuant to the Nebraska Child Abuse Statutes the State Foster Care Review Board is making a report of allegations of a child exploitation ring and respectfully requests an investi gation wrote Stitt She noted that in December 1987 FCRB had reviewed the allegations about a child prostitution ring centered on the Webb family s foster home Then On 5 17 88 the Foster Care Review Board received a phone call from Kirsten Hallberg who is a previous employee THE FRANKLIN COVER UP of Uta Halee Girls Village and currently works for Richard Young Psychiatric Hospital in Omaha She was aware of Nelly and her youngest sister Kendra s reports to the Re view Board Ms Hallberg told me about three Uta Halee girls a 20 year old young man at Richard Young and three youths at Boys Town who all reported inappropriate activi ties with Larry King of Omaha She also reports that at a recent child exploitation conference in Kansas City a detec tive from Kansas City asked her when the Nebraska

turned over its entire file on these cases to the attorney general Spire assured the FCRB that he would do everything in his power to help and assigned the case to one of his top assistants Bill Howland As months dragged by with little apparent action by the attorney general Stitt and Dennis Carlson demanded a meeting with Howland which was held in his office on November 22 1988 Stitt described the meeting to the Legislature s Executive Board on December 19 1988 When Dennis and I were in this meeting it became clear to me that if Mr Howland had ever read the materials we delivered to him in July it was a long time ago He didn t know major players names in the case Dennis did some rather tough questioning and it became clear to both of us that nothing had occurred The file was just a mess I grabbed the file from him Reordered it Dennis and I both left that meeting I mean I can speak for myself and I felt full of despair and I felt like all the optimism that we had had that something was going to happen to not only help the kids who d been abused but to stop this from occurring to other kids and many of the kids that I m aware of were State wards was not happening Nothing was happening Now we see that we were just 34 JUST HOW BIG IS THIS COVER UP being put off Yeah we ll get out there and Yeah we ll do this and Yeah we re on top of it but really none of the officials had organized their investigation Her fellow Executive Board member Burrell Williams added I think we became really baffled and puzzled on what was going on when you get all this information

took place on June 28 1988 On November 30 1988 Stitt again attempted to contact the governor to set up a still more urgent meeting because of the failure of the attorney general s investigation to get off the ground The governor s staff scheduled a meeting for the fol lowing week but canceled the appointment the next day The governor according to her office was not willing to meet as Carlson recorded in his daily notes of December 1 In the November 22 1988 meeting Howland once again claimed he would do everything he could a claim undercut by the attitude of the governor The Attorney General s Office put one investigator Thomas Vlahoulis on the case part time but as the Legislature s Franklin committee was to learn on lime 22 1989 he did next to nothing In this transcript of his legislative testimony Vlahoulis is questioned by committee counsel COUNSEL As I understand what you told Senator Chambers the information in your notes which was important was placed in the reports that you generated is that correct 35 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP VLAHOULIS Yes it was COUNSEL Now the conclusion I draw after reviewing that information is that you really didn t do anything between July and late November except to collect some extraneous pieces of information about Mr King s business interests and perhaps about his wife s citizenship status That s my conclusion from reading the reports On December 20 1988 Attorney General Robert Spire was quoted in the Lincoln Journal saying that his office had acted promptly and professionally on all the sensitive information received on child abuse six months earlier Yet the Nebraska State Patrol the agency that would be called upon by the attorney general in such an investigation conducted its very first investigative meeting on the case on December 19 1988 the day Spire was boasting to the Lincoln Journal about his alacrity In the face of official inaction Carol Stitt and the medical personnel responsible for treating Loretta

the order however it said that Loretta was making bizarre statements that she had been on the streets for two weeks and that she was suicidal Not only were these allegations untrue but they could help

upon making S L a campaign issue it s one that could work against Kerrey The White House apparently has some files on Commonwealth Savings and State Security Savings but no details were given The mentioned institutions were two of Nebraska s largest industrial banks They collapsed in 1983 and 1984 shortly after Kerrey s election as governor Kerrey knows about his vulnerability Soon after the

Anticipating the request Amen brought with him our highly confidential secret sensi tive list of problem institutions as he later told my legislative committee when we were looking into the State Security and American Savings failures High on the list were Commonwealth Savings controlled by Lincoln businessman S E Copple and his son Marvin and State Security whose president and leading stockholder was none other than Bill Wright In 1986 testifying before my committee Amen was asked if he hadn t felt a little strange showing the governor this list in the presence of Wright whose own bank was on it Amen replied No Senator Harris I didn t even think in terms of that I thought in terms of the fact that Bill Wright was the Governor s principal adviser and the Governor had wanted him present at the particular meeting Wright was a prominent lawyer in Lincoln a member of a wealthy established family and one of the rising stars in Ne braska politics during the 1970s State Security which he and associates acquired in 1978 in a highly leveraged buyout had made many loans to businessman Bob Kerrey Wright became the guiding force behind Kerrey s gubernatorial campaign THE FRANKLIN

counsel Bill Wright s law firm that bankruptcy should not be allowed but that the state should seize the bank By statute Commonwealth also should have had ten days to find new capital before being seized The bank had at least two offers the one Amen was working on and one from a local group of investors S E Copple was willing to sell his control ling stock in the bank to this local group for 1 in return for an infusion of 8 10 million in capital in order to save the bank The bank as Commissioner Amen later testified to the Legislature would have been saved Some 50 million of depositors funds would have been preserved as well But Kerrey s press release the resulting run and the governor s refusal to allow Commonwealth to be purchased after its sei zure preempted that possibility 42 DESTRUCTION OF COMMONWEALTH SAVINGS The failure of Commonwealth the biggest collapse of a financial institution in the history of Nebraska was a human tragedy of major proportions Many of its depositors were elderly people who had their life savings in Commonwealth When it collapsed some of them were left without even money to buy food By 1991 eight years after the collapse one third of the depositors have died Many of them died from heart attacks or strokes within the first 90 days after their bank s doors were shut Seven families with retarded children had put their life savings in the bank to care for the children after the parents die that money was all gone Kerrey claimed to have great compassion for Common wealth s depositors but his actions spoke otherwise Throughout 1983 the State Banking Department pressured Commonwealth president S E Copple to put up over 8 million of his personal assets and those of his son Marvin to secure unsecured loans that Commonwealth had taken from other banks In one instance a multi million dollar property got pledged to secure an approximately 750 thousand loan These were debts to among others Bill Wright s State Security Sav ings

year old man to dispose of whatever personal assets he had left including his residence to pay back depositors The bulk of Copple s substantial assets however were no longer available to the depositors They had already been taken by Kerrey s friends The Copple family was descended from some of the first pioneers in Nebraska It had a tradition of fierce independence from the state s financial establishment whence Kerrey re ceived campaign funding The Copples bank had been a source of liquidity for farmers and small and medium sized entrepre neurs When Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker doubled interest rates to nearly 20 in the fall of 1979 many Nebraska banks including Commonwealth landed in trouble But there 43 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP was a decision to attack the Copples while sparing institutions tied to Kerrey The brouhaha over Commonwealth s collapse diverted atten tion from State Security Savings which Amen testified had been in worse shape than Commonwealth State Security escaped the kind of pressure applied to the Copples Rather Kerrey s permission for State Security to remain open until July 9 1984 made possible its milking and draining by Bill Wright and other bank officers in the words of our 1986 Senate investiga tion That investigative report was unanimously adopted by all members of the legislative committee by which it was prepared Republicans and Democrats alike including some of Governor Kerrey s previously staunchest supporters Then State Security was allowed to file bankruptcy contrary to the standard set for Commonwealth by Wright s law firm via the State Banking Department Wright s double standard was glaring It was Wright who took State Security intofederal bankruptcy which shielded it from possible attempts by local officials to investigate its affairs or to protect depositors Yet Bill Wright s law firm acting as official adviser to the Banking Department had prohibited that same course from being fol lowed by Commonwealth by issuing its opinion that such a declaration of bankruptcy by Commonwealth would be illegal At the age of 88 S E Copple was stripped of everything he owned sent to

threatened to foreclose on all those loans unless Joyce and Rentfro sold Shoppers Fair for a million dollars below its assessed value When Joyce and Rentfro pre pared to sue State Security looked for another arrangement Ultimately Shoppers Fair was delivered to the Kerrey group in return for State Security writing off 3 million of Joyce Rentfro debts State Security financed the purchase by AIG with a loan at 4 under the prime rate The 3 million write off of Joyce Rentfro loans and the new below prime loan to enable AIG to acquire Shoppers Fair relieved State Security s depositors of substantial funds Those depositors lost millions in other financial swindles which reveal the brutality of the Kerrey group s actions master minded by Bill Wright Wright and others gained control of State Security in 1978 by purchasing its stock through a holding company they owned with a very preferential loan from First National Bank of Lincoln FirsTier Bank after its 1984 merger with Omaha National Corporation the loan required no per sonal guarantee and carried no personal obligation meaning that if it went bad and the company folded Wright and his partners had no obligation to repay Ultimately they did not repay it Having gained control of State Security they sold its most valuable asset a downtown Lincoln office building to them selves using a disguised corporate name for one fourth of its actual value Since the depositors really owned the equitable value of the building this transaction alone robbed them of a small fortune Adding insult to injury Kerrey s friends then

had had enough The senators subpoenaed Spire and other Kerrey appointed officials who stated that it was their prerogative to prosecute or not and they chose not to We called Kerrey himself as a

committee was essentially saying It is OK if your banker tells us everything they know about you Kerrey eventually did consent to appear before the committee Highlights included his denial of im proper influence by William F Wright Key decisions of the administration were based upon advice from the Department of Banking whose counsel was Wright s law firm and other official channels Kerrey testified Kerrey s AIG deal was already a scandal when it transpired in 1983 Talking about his business affairs to my legislative committee in 1986 the governor claimed that he had taken every politician s routine precautions I prepared and executed a business trust that naturally moved all the assets physically that I owned all the business assets away from even indirect control But

investigation during the uproar over the collapse of Commonwealth On November 5 1983 news media reported what was an apparent leak from administration sources that Republican Attorney General Paul Douglas who normally would have handled the Commonwealth investiga tion was involved in improper Commonwealth loans Douglas was a long standing friend of the Copples With impeachment proceedings under way Douglas resigned Kerrey replaced Douglas as attorney general with his own man Robert Spire Today Spire serves as U S Senator Ker rey s chief of staff To oversee the Commonwealth investiga tion he named a new special assistant attorney general David Domina formerly a law clerk in Bill Wright s law firm On November 15 1983 Kerrey fired Banking Director Paul Amen and replaced him with John Miller whom he had ap pointed to the State Liquor Control Commission in June Miller admitted he had no knowledge of the banking business telling the press according to the Metro Update I can t even balance my checkbook The Legislature s Banking Commerce and Insurance com mittee then chaired by this writer Senator John DeCamp was prepared to investigate the Commonwealth collapse which came under its purview But Kerrey handpicked a special new committee for the job In a November 21 1983 letter to the governor I protested Kerrey s actions Governor it would be most unfair and unreasonable to expect

Worster s group charged that post seizure actions planned by Kerrey were even more egregious In their three volume report these Commonwealth depositors argued that Kerrey had tried to establish

Busi ness Development Authority Although this alleged scheme attributed to Kerrey bogged down in legislative resistance Commonwealth assets did get inexplicably devalued by 54 and did wind up in the hands of Stuart and other Kerrey connected creditors Worster s group has charged Commonwealth depositors got paid only 8 5 million by the state against their 50 million in losses There was no reason for them to have lost a nickel The bank had assets mainly in real estate then valued at 50 60 million The Commonwealth property at 40th Old Cheney in Lincoln for instance would have been worth 35 million if properly developed according to an estimate given in 1985 by state appointed receiver John Queen in front of depositors representative Dr Breiner and attorney John Robinson At the fire sale

was by qualifying as a low income credit union that Franklin could sell certificates of deposit to non members the means by which it swindled millions Larry King became its manager in 1970 Chambers was in receipt of numerous complaints against King People talked about his high spending ways and about the teenaged boys who got in and out of limousines with King During 1988 Chambers received some of the Foster Care Review Board reports that abused children had named Larry King Senator Schmit as a Republican knew of suspicious behav ior by King out of town In early years Larry King was a Democratic Party activist and headed Black Democrats for McGovern in 1972 but after he shifted registration in 1981 King made his name in the GOP As Schmit s friend and personal attorney I shared with him my own recollections about how I had noticed the two faces of Larry King which I later summarized in writing I had personally been a delegate to the Republican National Conven tion in 1984 and 1988 and been a witness at the massive spending and luxury at the Larry King parties in both Dallas and New Orleans and as chairman of the legislative Banking Committee had observed with a jaundiced eye the Franklin operation which no information could be obtained on because it was a Federal Institution At these two conventions I attended the two biggest parties ever sponsored by Larry King It was the first of these that brought King to my attention The year was 1984 I was attending the Republican National Convention in Dallas Texas having been elected as a delegate pledged to support

was from 54 THE FRANKLIN COMMITTEE Nebraska and was the fastest rising black star in the Republi can Party Who the blazes is he 1 asked And how come 1 haven t heard anything about him Larry King

gotten in government You ve got to be there So we went I drove Rex out to the party which was being held at Southfork Ranch famous as the setting for the TV show Dallas It was the most impressive party I have ever witnessed The attendance by top politicians was remarkable names and faces you only hear or see on television were there in number At the center of the excitement was Larry King Draped over him like a blanket throughout the evening was a heavyset woman who 1 learned was Maureen Reagan the president s daughter From what I saw this party had to have cost far more than the one or two hundred thousand dollars I have heard as an estimate At a public meeting in 1990 I recalled my thinking at the time I got to wondering Here s this little credit union and here s Larry King obviously in the highest reaches of the Republican Party And I just wondered how does he do this supposedly on a salary of 16 thousand a year Such conspicuous consumption as I had witnessed earned Larry King the tag flamboyant in just about any mention of his name The NeVA s civil suit against King filed November 14 1988 in the wake of the raid put some price tags on his lifestyIe It itemized 4

flow on how King s 2 million dollar credit union had tens of millions of dollars in deposits unaccounted for and on the secret second set of books I suggested to Senator Schmit that he talk to some other legisla tors about investigating whether some state laws were violated Why was I concerned Because from my experience as chairman of the Banking Commerce and Insurance Committee of the Legislature I knew that with all the regulatory controls existing for a federally insured institution it was impossible for such a theft to occur without cooperation by higher up officials Larry King could only have accomplished this massive theft with the help or cooperation of regulatory officials or politicians at the highest levels That meant that institutions of government must have been compromised Senator Schmit had his own reasons for thinking that a legislative probe of the Franklin collapse was in order He had heard from friends of his in the black community that Larry King spent money like a drunken sailor but was not making any loans in the community When I discussed a possible investigation with Schmit I had no idea that anything other than theft and the possible protection of illegal financial transactions would be involved As the investigation was launched no one except possibly Senator Ernie Chambers knew where it might lead On November 18 1988 the Legislature passed Schmit s resolution in favor of an investigation In front of special hear ings of the Legislature s Executive Board the strands of evi dence against Larry King were finally pulled together for the first time before officials who would pay attention After the first session on December 12 1988 Senator S6 THE FRANKLIN COMMITTEE Chambers made a dramatic announcement about the probe The

CARLSON The nature of these allegations are something that is going to shock the Committee They deal with cult activities they deal with sacrifices of small children they deal with sexual abuse and there s a correlation between these two different reports We have the Boys Town report prepared by a worker from Boys Town named Julie Walters which contains the allegations of the children that were in the Webb foster home Nelly primarily Years later well two years later we have Loretta Smith in Richard Young Hospital who s making allegations against Larry King and as far as we know there is no relationship between Nelly and Loretta Smith Both reports talk about the Omaha Girls Club both reports mention a specific individual who is the superintendent of schools SENATOR REMMERS T he question that came into mind it s been in my mind since you ve been testifying and I think you ve answered part of it just now is you re talking about about these abuses from children from Boys Town and Girls

kind of leads to that CAROL STITT Well the common thread is Larry King SENATOR REMMERS Yes that s what I mean It all goes back to him OK CAROL STITT Yes he seems to be more the organizer or the high class pimp I mean if that helps fit this together 57 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP Stitt also clarified what she had written in her June 1988 letter to Attorney General Spire about a Kansas City connection of Larry King She testified that she had cross checked with the Kansas City detective who reportedly inquired of Kirstin Hallberg about when Nebraska was going to crack down on King The officer said

The Executive Board also received from the FCRB the hand written report by Julie Walters on her interview with the teen aged victims during 1986 In the December 21 1988 Omaha World Herald reporter James Allen Flanery recounted a tele phone interview with Walters at her home in another state in which she told him how their testimony had seemed at first too bizarre to be true But the more experience she gained with troubled children Walters added working in probation I m more sure than ever that there is more truth than not in their accounts The conclusion I reached was the kids I spoke with were not lying What the senators heard at the closed December 19 1988 meeting shook them to the bone The information brought tears to my eyes Schmit said according to the Lincoln Journal I do not cry easily and I was not the only person that was moved Chambers echoed the witnesses outrage about delays With this type of information it is inexcusable that action had not been taken of an investigative nature People were not contacted that should have been Leads were not followed up that should have been followed up My feeling is that the whole thing is being sat upon and nothing was done The question of a cover up of Franklin linked crimes came up at the outset in this way Omaha Police Chief Wadman and state Attorney General Spire offered a lame protest Every step that should have been taken was taken Wadman told the Journal Spire said We did receive some sensitive information in July My office acted promptly and professionally and noth ing was sat on I am confident that

case was politically hot Larry King had become wealthy and influential thanks to quite a number of big people he commented Moreover Lowe reported there were indications that King was involved in guns and money transfers into Nicaragua of involvement by the CIA and possi bly a White House connection There appeared to be some type of connection between the money missing from Franklin the crisis in

years When we were both senators we frequently worked together on major issues At other times such as when we disagreed on the issue of telephone deregulation we led opposite sides and fought each other tooth and nail During the early months of the legislative investigation of Franklin I personally had serious doubts as to the validity of THE FRANKLIN COVER UP what was being alleged I provided a minimum of legal advice to Senator Schmit during this period but he did insist that I be available to provide him such advice Schmit had the experience of a previous investigation in volving drug related matters and the State Patrol which ended up with him and other senators including myself being sued by some of the individuals investigated He wanted to make sure that he made no error that would cause any legal liability for him Even though we had won that earlier suit against us Senator Schmit wanted to exercise all caution to protect himself from lawsuits Therefore like many other state and national politicians he quite properly had private legal counsel me In the spring of 1989 after the Franklin committee had been conducting investigations for some time Senator Schmit sought my legal advice He wanted to know the legal liability involved if he supported a planned report of the committee which was to suggest that there was child abuse committed by prominent individuals not to be named which had not been properly investigated by agencies of government I asked for no names and he provided no names of the individuals he was talking about In point of fact there were enough rumors floating in the legislative corridors and on the streets of Omaha that at least a dozen prominent persons could have been the subject of these accusations I gave him the same advice then that I would give now Accusations of child abuse are the worst accusations you can make against an individual That is because no matter what the truth of the matter once the accusation is made it will never be able to be rubbed completely off even if the individual accused is as innocent and pure as can be Therefore before you sign your name to anything that suggests that there is serious child abuse or

worse than falsely accusing 62 THE FRANKLIN COMMITTEE I had my own personal experience of a false accusation of child abuse which still bums in my soul It was also a hideous example of the use of political office to intimidate silence or destroy political enemies The year was 1984 early January I had announced my intention to run for the United States Senate As chairman of the Legislature s Banking Committee I was actively seeking to investigate the collapse of Commonwealth Savings which had just occurred In an Associated Press listing of the ten most powerful people in Nebraska as ranked by media editors and publishers I was number 5 behind the governor U S Senator J J Exon Omaha World Herald publisher Harold An dersen and University of Nebraska President Ronald Roskens Polls showed me as the leading candidate for the Republican senatorial nomination Then I received a message from Republican Party leaders It was simple GOP strategists at the highest levels believe this is the year the Republicans can beat J J Exon Opinion poll analysis shows that such a victory can only come if the candidate is a woman and has no political baggage Remem ber 1984 was the year of Democrat Geraldine Ferraro s candi dacy for U S Vice President the Year of the Woman in politics Republican leaders are fearful that you John DeCamp will be able to win the primary but because of baggage and controversiality you will not beat Exon in November Therefore Republican leaders ask you to withdraw from the primary If you do not drop out voluntarily you will have to be stopped some other way And stopped you will be because this race means so much to Republican leadership at the highest levels in Washington I did not listen I continued to campaign for the Senate seat Shortly

UP Two investigations conducted immediately one by the DSS and one by the Lincoln Police found there was no child abuse and so reported But a County Attorney Mike Heavican took matters into his own hands Heavican was on the Republican search commit tee for a senatorial candidate which ultimately picked a woman with no baggage and she lost to Exon He also was someone whose name had come up as my Senate Banking Committee attempted to start probing the Commonwealth and State Secu rity matters as someone who may have granted illegal tax favors to involved parties Heavican filed a petition alleging that I and my wife had abused our daughter in the way we were educating and raising her It was a civil not a criminal filing but I am sure it was designed to gain statewide publicity Heavican s action also exemplified how a public position can be abused It comes as a shock to most Americans that the lowliest county attorney has absolute immunity when he files complaints or charges against somebody even if he does so knowing them to be false His automatic immunity is sup posed to protect the prosecutor as an institution of government from being deterred from effective action by the specter of future lawsuits The abuse of this institutional privilege can be terribly destructive Months of investigation resulted in a legal opinion from Judge W W Nuernberger that there was no child abuse Nuern berger concluded that if Mr and Mrs John DeCamp were guilty of child abuse then so were a lot of families and so was the late President Kennedy and perhaps every family in Nebraska would have to destroy its photo albums if I were considered guilty of anything While the investigation was under way media coverage continued to smear my name with the charges I maintained that the phantom

DeCamp was pure as the driven snow Luedtke said but he added whoever may have had it in their mind to get rid of DeCamp accomplished their purpose My 1984 ordeal came to mind in the spring of 1989 as I insisted to Senator Schmit that he exercise caution in the Franklin case Senator Schmit offered an amendment to the committee report written by himself which stated in essence that at this point in the investigation the legislative committee did not have the smoking gun that would establish the truth of any of the child abuse allegations or the failure of institutions of government In July 1989 a controversy broke out on the Franklin com mittee over Schmit s amendment and the course of the investi gation Some members maintained that Senator Schmit was not doing enough to follow up the child abuse Schmit rejoined that the information gathered thus far by Lowe while useful was mostly second hand and that the committee should follow the advice he had been given by a friend in law enforcement Follow the money trail There is almost no important crime that can be committed said Schmit echoing his friend s advice without spending money and spending money leaves a paper trail It should be possible to move from hearsay to court admissable evidence such as checks credit card receipts and flight manifests Senator Chambers and Senator McFarland departed from the committee

People were also becoming discouraged by the lack of progress made thus far on the investigation and they translated this to mean cover up Initially the reports which Mr Lowe had generated were reviewed in detail It was evident that while there were a large amount of reports generated that very little of sub stance had been gained by him regarding firsthand informa tion It was then decided that while secondhand information had been valuable in that it presented an idea of the possible scope of abuse going on that it was more important to locate individuals who had actually been abused and participated in the various activities that comprise this case 66 CHAPTER 8 SOMEBODY HAS TO TELL THE STORY Caradori did find victims who would talk Four of them allowed him to videotape their stories in nearly 30 hours of sessions during late 1989 and early 1990 These interviews contained detailed allegations of sexual abuse drug usage pornography and other crimes by prominent Omaha citizens Implicated among others were individuals already named by Nelly and Kimberly Webb Brenda Parker and Loretta Smith as abusers or pornographers Rusty Nelson Deward Finch Larry King What these victim witnesses related became the central mat ter of the Franklin case but nobody except for a few law enforcement personnel state senators and grand jury members has viewed the Caradori tapes Snippets were aired on television in Omaha With their contents largely unpublicized the tapes became a target of speculation and denunciation rumor and doubt The interviews are reported here for the first time in consider able detail The excerpts that follow are from Caradori s written precis of the interviews which include his notes on discrepan cies in the testimony corroborative details and

that Mr Wadman is a pedophile Contrary to impressions that the Omaha World Herald tried to convey Alisha Owen not only did not seek out Caradori but she told him only a fraction of the story at that first meeting As she later described to the legislative Franklin committee she was extremely reluctant to get involved at all After Cara dori left she contacted the prison psychiatrist who directed

involved in flights to other states and she knew of other minors who were on these flights also 68 SOMEBODY HAS TO TELL THE STORY On November 7 Caradori and Ormiston proceeded to York prison and took

the closing of the Franklin Credit Union before it fell Other issues discussed regarding Bob Kerry consisted of Alisha s statements that she had a friend who works for Dixon and Dixon law firm who is

of 1983 I attended a meeting at the state with Florence Davis the McArthur children s worker and Lloyd Linquist the permanency planner Basically the purpose of this meeting was to tell me that the state would not change their minds and that they felt they were in a better position to judge what the McArthur children needed and that they were going to proceed with adoptive plans of placing the children with the Webb family in Fort Calhoun 75 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP A few days later I went with Florence Davis to the Webb home as Florence thought I would feel better about the placement if I had the opportunity to meet the Webbs Quite to the contrary after meeting with Mr and Mrs Webb I was more concerned than ever as I did not feel that this was a proper home for these three children Something that I think is extremely suspicious is that about the time that the King mess was surfacing Florence Davis suddenly left the state almost overnight and suppos edly is living in California A short time later Lloyd Linquist went on sick leave and was gone for many months And then about the time he was to return he also resigned While he was on leave I understand that he took a trip to Tahiti I think personally that Lloyd Linquist and Florence Davis know a lot about the situation regarding the abuse of these children and they should be found and questioned One time when Florence was working for the state I be lieve before she became a supervisor I noticed that she de clared bankruptcy while she was living in her new condo and had her new car However after that whenever I would see Florence it seemed like she was dressed extremely well and did not appear to have any monetary worries although I am not a friend of Florence s and I did nothing with her socially Lloyd Linquist

reiterated that Rusty Nelson and Larry King would direct these photographic sessions She said that she would cry and try to get out of participating 76 SOMEBODY HAS TO TELL THE STORY in these sessions

Alan met him at the door in a yellow Ralph Lauren bathrobe Alan Baer asked him to get undressed Troy stated that he thought he was going to get 50 00 He started undressing in the hall way and Alan Baer asked him to go into the bedroom Alan Baer then got undressed and a sexual encounter ensued including mutual masturbation and oral sex After this sexual encounter they took a shower together and he received 400 00 in fifty dollar bills Alan Baer told him to call him that next Tuesday Troy met with Alan Baer again five days later after Troy had called him from his residence in Council Bluffs

by at various times usually in the afternoon for sex with him They would perform oral sex on each other and Larry King performed anal sex on Troy Larry King also wanted Troy to urinate on him in the bathtub which he did In May of 1985 he Troy talked with Danny King about how Danny could make some money Danny initially ob jected and said he did not want to get involved but he later changed his mind Troy had also told Alan Baer about Danny King Troy then took Danny to Alan s apartment at the Twin Towers during which time Alan Baer asked Danny some questions about himself Alan Baer then told him Troy to leave He waited for approximately three hours before Danny came out of the apartment and Danny showed him 300 that he said Alan Baer had given him Danny said no sexual activity went on but

new witnesses we have even though they were discovered by our investigative efforts 83 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP after a fairly short time and with a very small budget It is the opinion of all committee members that the activities described and the personalities involved scream out for action whether statute of limitations problems are involved or not As a result of the new evidence and new investigations we have all become very very concerned Schmit expressed his personal inclination to release the tapes in toto for the sake of the safety of our witnesses and a speedy investigation He abided by the committee consensus however to hold them back By December 1989 local state and federal law enforcement had received copies of the videotapes of Alisha Owen Troy Boner and Danny King Some officials notably Douglas County Sheriff Dick Roth said they believed the victim wit nesses After watching five hours of the tapes the Associated Press reported in February 1990 Roth said he found the wit nesses statements to be credible But there was no apparent move toward prosecutions 84 CHAPTER 9 THE DECAMP MEMO On January 18 1990 I released a document that soon became infamous as the DeCamp memo For the first time the names of prominent alleged perpetrators were public A lot has been written about that memo much of it full of untruths and distortions What follows is the true story of the DeCamp memo and the events leading up to it In the spring of 1989 after the first child abuse stories surfaced I recommended to Senator Loran Schmit that he go directly to the FBI in Omaha to discuss the very serious allegations being made against Police Chief Robert Wadman by various individuals This was before anybody even knew that Alisha Owen or other victim witnesses existed and of course before Alisha Owen s allegations against Robert Wad man were made This legal advice of mine to Senator Schmit was in response to his question as to how to handle things when law enforce ment officials themselves were being accused of impropriety Go to the highest authority you can above the authority who is being accused I told him Senator Schmit insisted", "chunk_id":

Senator Schmit insisted I go with him to this meeting as his personal attorney I agreed to go but on condition that he first meet one on one with the regional head of the FBI Nick O Hara without me present He did meet with O Hara for about one hour Then I was called into the room Itwas only at that urne through discussion that I learned that the individual in question was former Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman In brutal language and with the most somber demeanor possible Mr O Hara made it clear that probably his closest 85 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP friend in the world was Police Chief Robert Wadman and that anyone who would dare to accuse Robert Wadman of impropriety had better realize that in accusing Wadman they were effectively taking on Nick O Hara and the FBI I realized instantly that my advice to Senator Schmit may have been faulty How could I have known in advance that the head of the FBI and the former chief were so intimate in their business and personal relationships There was tension in the air I made a point of saying that I also was sure that all these accusations whatever they were had to be nonsense I pointed out that my experience as a public official a senator for sixteen years made me appreci ate the fact that it is easy to accuse a public official and darned difficult for one to defend himself since the accusations are immediately put on the front page of the paper and broadcast as the lead story on the evening TV news But as if to make a point that both I and Senator Schmit had better understand how serious it was for anyone to come to the FBI and raise questions about Robert Wadman O Hara had us sit down and provide him information about ourselves as ifwe were the ones being accused and investigated proceeding exactly as one might expect the FBI to do with someone the FBI was investigating What s your date of birth Where were you born What is your exact name Do you have any aliases O Hara quizzed us When we left the FBI offices I said

or anybody associated with him I had no idea how prophetic those words were It was only after Caradori s first tapes had been turned over to law enforcement agencies that leaks of what was on them began to reach the public and became the subject of widespread 86 THE DECAMP MEMO discussion Articles began to appear in the Omaha World Herald aimed to discredit the witnesses and intimidate any other potential child victim witnesses from testifying or coming forward with information As the stories proliferated Gary Caradori expressed to Sena tor Schmit his concern for the safety of the victim witnesses who had allowed themselves to be taped Schmit sought my legal advice again These kids need protection or they are going to end up dead or become afraid to continue to tell the truth the senator said The committee has to do something to guarantee their protection Gary Caradori was even more vehement on the need for protection Unless they get into a protected environment where Alan Baer and Larry King and Robert Wadman are not able to get to them and scare them I can tell you the kids will fold They will do whatever those guys order them to do They will fold or they will end up dead Caradori hammered at Senator Schmit You have to do something to protect them My legal advice to Senator Schmit and my direct warning to Gary Caradori at that time in December 1989 and January 1990 was the most painful information I have ever had to provide someone You cannot and should not do anything to use committee funds or committee personnel to provide protection for these kids I told Schmit Otherwise you and the committee may be accused of impropriety and tampering with witnesses and who knows what else Painful as it is for me to tell you this you have to find some other legal channel to provide protection for the kids Whether that channel is the courts or a judge or whoever it is something that either the lawyer for the kids should be doing or some institution of

legislature who were hearing the rumors and who had their own resources for finding out information Key among them was Senator Jerry Chizek of Omaha chairman of the Legisla ture s Judiciary Committee He was very tight with Douglas County Sheriff Dick Roth In early January 1990 as stories of what was involved in the Franklin case spread through the streets of Omaha Senator Chizek took it upon himself to set up a very secret private meeting among Senator Schmit Sheriff Roth a representative of the Douglas County District Court Judge Corrigan and himself I was asked by Senator Chizek and Senator Schmit to attend the meeting I was glad to come for the purpose of providing legal guidance to Senator Schmit so that he did not engage in trying to solve the problem of protection for the witnesses in an illegal if well intentioned manner The meeting took place in an auto body repair shop some where in west Omaha on what I am sure was the coldest day of the year For most of the afternoon discussion centered around the essence of the rumors that were circulating about the contents of the Caradori tapes Attention was focused on the necessity of protecting the victim witnesses who had provided testimony Sheriff Roth had viewed the tapes I presume others in the room also had including Senator Schmit I personally had not viewed the tapes and believe it or not have not viewed them to this day From the conversation on that cold January day there was no doubt at all that Sheriff Roth and others in the room believed in the validity and accuracy of the allegations made on the tapes As the talks progessed Sheriff Roth used a phrase that had special meaning to me I will tell you one thing he said Nick O Hara of the FBI and Robert Wadman are closer than nineteen is to twenty Everybody in law enforcement knows that I know it especially well Closer than nineteen is to twenty That makes it almost impossible to get anything done or to arrange any witness protection through

They carry enough weight in this community to do what they want and get away with it Sheriff Roth did stand up for the victims of Franklin related child abuse on several occasions 1know that he subsequently came under intense pressure including from the World Herald to repudiate his belief that the allegations of the child victim witnesses were true The net result of the secret meeting with Sheriff Roth and Judge Corrigan of the Douglas County District Court was noth ing The plan was for Judge Corrigan to explain the situation including the fact that fellow district court judges were the subject of some of the accusations to the other dozen district court judges Then a plan might be worked out for witness protection under the auspices of the court Unfortunately that did not transpire What Judge Corrigan did or did not do only he knows About the time of the secret meeting with Judge Corrigan and Sheriff Roth my office received a long distance phone call from a girl who identified herself as Loretta Smith 1 returned her call I m one of the Franklin victim witnesses she explained I m the one they wrote a lot about in the Omaha World Herald A friend of mine told me that maybe you would help me Having read the stories about Loretta who was not identified by name in the World Herald 1knew basically the story she was telling as to her abuse and the individuals who had supposedly abused her I know who you are Loretta and if 1can help you 1 will 1 said And yes 1 have read about you and your story and surprising as it might sound to you 1 do believe you We discussed ways 1 might help her A couple of weeks after that phone call reporter Kathy Rutledge of the Lincoln Journal telephoned me at night at 89 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP home She said she understood I had been in touch with Loretta Smith and she wanted to know all about the matter It was clear from the beginning of the conversation by the tone of her voice and her accusatory questions that Kathy was intent on doing a

things she was saying or implying that I did such conduct would be a violation of legal codes of ethics and would subject me to penalties including even revocation of my license to practice law I urged that she not even write a story about this for the protection of the young lady involved If she insisted on writing a story I said she should at least tell the truth and not distort facts A few days later a lawyer working in my office John Goc walked into the office carrying the Lincoln Journal and talking loudly Whatare you trying to do DeCamp get yourselfdisbar red What are you going

story That is ap proximately what John Goc said to me on January 18 1990 I ran down to get a copy of the newspaper knowing already what Kathy Rutledge must have done Determined to get herself a headline story and lots of attention she had to distort the truth Just as I feared every negative and distorted impression was conveyed by her story Six days later I would be notified by the Bar Association that I was under investigation as a result of the Rutledge story Even before that happened I was confronted by Omaha World Herald reporter Bob Dorr on the telephone demanding that I answer

also prepared a documented reply to the Nebraska Bar Association inquiry to prove that the conduct related by Kathy Rutledge in her article had not occurred I was able to submit affidavits from two employees in my office who swore that it was Loretta Smith who contacted me and not vice versa I also obtained an affidavit from a friend of Loretta who knew me and my wife from when we had helped her on request from her minister several years earlier and who was the person who advised Loretta to call me Within hours after presentation to the Bar Association of this documentation the bar investiga tion was terminated I was cleared of any impropriety or wrong doing The Lincoln Journal ran a second story on the matter after the DeCamp memo was issued in which Rutledge attempted to correct the falsehoods and deceptions in the first story In any case I filed a slander and defamation lawsuit against the Journal for that first story which lawsuit is still in the courts I charged in the memo that in the Franklin case institutions of government have failed and thus credibility of government itself is at stake in this matter and in a very real sense first the legislativeJ committee and then

not to know the names of the personalities involved and the scope of the allegations Stop on any street corner in Omaha go into any coffee shop have a drink in any bar in Omaha or if you are lazy walk around the Capitol Rotunda in Lincoln and simply listen to the discussions Here is what you will learn 1 The allegations are that the most powerful and rich public personalities of the state are central figures in the in vestigation 2 That these include former Omaha World Herald Editor Harold Andersen Larry King of the dead Franklin Credit Union Former Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman Media Personality Peter Citron Ak Sar Ben Financier and bluest of the bluebloods Alan Baer for starters 3 That the allegations are that these individuals were some of the centerpieces in a co ordinated program of Child Abuse Drug Abuse and abuse of their various public posi tions of trust and honor 4 That prosecutors who should be prosecuting are afraid to prosecute for one reason or another and that the public itself is rapidly losing faith in its fundamental institutions of government as a result of this perceived coverup whether real or imagined What do I personally believe I damned well believe the allegations Now having said these things and reported these allega tions am I afraid of being sued by these powerful personali ties Absolutely not Remember that rule you newspaper folk 92

Former legislator s angry memo turns sober Nebraska on its ear Two months ago DeCamp sat behind his word processing machine and pounded out the infamous DeCamp Memo The piece of invective became the subject of discussion from Omaha s silk stocking salons to the cowboy bars in the Sand Hills He named five prominent Omaha men as central figures in a legislative committee s yearlong review of allegations of sexual abuse linked to the 1988 collapse of the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union DeCamp s memo found its way to dozens of copy ma chines and quickly littered the state spawning a swirl of gossip In an attempt to put the rumors to rest and find the truth the U S attorney called a federal grand jury last month And next week a Douglas County grand jury in Omaha will begin hearing the allegations including one that King flew teenagers to Kansas City in 1985 to perform sex with men in a rented room at the Westin Crown Center Hotel Hardly modest DeCamp takes credit for the convening of the grand juries If it had not been for that memo 93 THE FRANKLIN COYER UP there would not even be a grand jury investigation today DeCamp contends DeCamp had the audacity to name among others Harold Andersen former publisher of the Omaha World Herald DeCamp left the implication that Andersen an icon of jour nalism who lunches with President Bush had a fetish for children Said one politician It was like insulting God Rumors started reaching me that I was going to be sued by various people Finally a close friend of mine who is a prominent reporter in Nebraska and whom I agreed not to name in this book came to me privately to say that an agreement had been reached among the various individuals I had named in the memo and others for Peter Citron to be the one to sue me The purpose would be to destroy me in full view of the public and to repudiate the DeCamp memo Truth put a crimp in that plan Not long after the message was delivered to me Peter Citron was charged with sex crimes involving male minors in the Omaha area It seems that some parents who knew their children were hanging around Peter Citron were shocked to see him named in the DeCamp memo They responded

neglect to comment on the World Herald s overall role in the Franklin scandal Nebraska has only one state wide news source It is the 94 THE DECAMP MEMO Omaha World Herald Our small population vast expanses and the cost of maintaining a daily newspaper in this day and age all guarantee that the World Herald is the news source for this state With that awesome power one would think would come a corresponding measure of responsibility to make sure Nebraskans get all sides of an issue That they really get the news But the World Herald s long standing pattern of behavior is just the opposite If it has an editorial attitude on a story its news coverage and every other aspect of the newspaper are mustered to accentuate the preferred side of the issue and suppress opposing views In the case of Franklin the paper went to new lengths The integrity and credibility of the newspaper went on the chopping block for the sake of suppressing the truth about Franklin and to a high degree the Commonwealth and State Security banking stories Nebraska s three biggest scandals of the last fifty years Why all this effort Because tragically the people who control the World Herald appear to have a strong vested interest in suppressing the truth Whether it is Peter Citron past pub lisher Harold Andersen or underlings who have their positions only because of Andersen their linkage to Franklin dictates that they use the best tool available the World Herald to tell the public what they want them to believe Because of its virtual monopoly as a news source something repeated often enough by

exemplify the program of deception carried on by the World Herald throughout the Franklin scandal continuing to the present In coverage of the DeCamp memo and in other Franklin coverage the impression given by the World Herald was that the legislative committee to investigate Franklin headed by 95 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP Senator Schmit was functioning in an irresponsible manner allowing leaks to the press and to others In editorials and on the news pages the World Herald repeatedly condemned Senator Schmit for supposedly leaking information Then they attacked me for supposedly obtaining information from Sena tor Schmit and leaking it The truth was the opposite I was providing information to the committee as committee records will bear out Probably the best example of this would be the detailed breakdowns of Franklin Credit Union financial transactions which the committee received from me months in advance of their own investigation How did I get such data Believe it or not I got them from the chief counsel of the National Credit Union Administration NCUA Robert Fenner In an unsolicited phone call from him Fenner gave me details about Franklin s secret accounts In retrospect I believe he wanted through me to throw cold water on the questions that were heating up in Omaha about the role of Franklin monies in the Iran Contra money laundering schemes At the time I asked Fenner if he wanted me to share his information with Senator Schmit which he did I immediately drafted a detailed memo of my conversation with Fenner I provided the information to Senator Schmit for the legislative committee I gave Fenner s phone number to Schmit Thus from the outset I was sending information to the Senate Franklin committee and not the other way around 96 THE DECAMP MEMO

bag the boy was in We went over a very thick brush area with a clearing in it Over the clearing they dropped the boy One said the men with the hoods would take care of the body for them I didn t see Nicholas until that night at the hotel He and I hugged and held each other for a long while About two hours later the men or Larry King came in and told us to go take a shower since we had only been hosed off at some guys house We took a shower together and then were told to put on the tarzan things After we were cleaned up and dressed in these things we were told to put on shorts socks and a shirt and shoes and driven to a house where the men were at with some others They had the film and they played it As the men watched they passed Nicholas and I around as if we were toys and sexually abused us They made Nicholas and I screw each other and one of the men put the dead boy s penis in mine and Nicholas mouth I didn t want to write this because the man forced me to bite the boys penis

the Douglas County grand jury formed in the wake of the DeCamp memo issued its long awaited report A banner headline in the World Herald trumpeted Grand Jury Says Abuse Stories Were a Carefully Crafted Hoax The conclusions presented in the 42 page Grand Jury Re port not to mention the pretentious language in which it discounted whole areas of the Franklin case betray the delibera tions of the jury rather as a carefully crafted cover up The grand jury gave opinions on a variety of matters The Douglas County grand jury cleared Larry King of child abuse We found no credible evidence of child sexual abuse inter state transportation of minors drug trafficking or participa tion in a pornography ring by King or other Franklin officials or employees To the extent that homosexual relations occur red involving such employees or officials the evidence we were able to uncover showed these exchanges to be voluntary acts between persons above the age of consent Yes Larry King had diverted credit union funds for his personal gain but it is our opinion that federal authorities are better able to pursue matters regarding this misappropriation of credit union funds and we strongly recommend that they COVER UP PHASE II THE GRAND JURY continue to do so And although we also found probable cause to believe that King on numerous occasions used money or items of value to entice

occasions used money or items of value to entice inveigle persuade encourage or procure men in their late teens or early twenties to engage in acts of prostitution with him and therefore he committed the crime of pandering the statute of limitations had run out on many of these acts and our ultimate decision was that to charge and try King with a class IV felony under state law when he is facing 40 felony counts in federal court on financial charges only would not be the best use of the resources of the Douglas County District Court and again we have deferred to the federal prosecution So careful was this grand jury not to fritter public resources that it did not even subpoena Larry King The grand jury explained away its failure to call King as a witness Because King is presently in an institution out of the state pursuant to an order from the federal court and because we believedhe wouldrely on his right against self incrimination we decided it would not be fruitful to attempt to require King to appear before us Whenever it did admit that abuse had taken place the grand jury stipulated that none of it had anything to do with the Franklin Credit Union The grand jury indicted three people First came Alan Baer the department store heir one of the five persons named in the DeCamp memo We did have testimony from certain witnesses about sexual involvement with Baer Evidence also showed that these witnesses received substantial amounts of money or other valuables in exchange for sex Therefore we believe Baer committed the offense of pandering and we have handed down an indictment against him for that offense However that may be the grand jury added We have found no direct connection between Alan Baer and King or the Franklin Credit Union other than limited social and busi ness dealings THE FRANKLIN COVER UP Peter Citron another of the five I named appeared before the grand jury and was found to have had inappropriate sexual contact with male minors but again no connection has been found to link Citron with the Franklin Credit Union Citron had already been indicted and convicted for these contacts in a separate court process The other two people indicted were the victim witnesses Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci These young people had suf fered admitted the grand jury but that had nothing to do with Franklin We think that Owen might have been sexually

that Owen might have been sexually abused during her early years but not by the people and in the way she has alleged As for Bonacci according to his testimony he was a child victim of repeated sexual abuse by persons not associated with the Franklin investigation Accusing them of lying to the grand jury during May and June of 1990 the jury handed down indictments against Owen on eight counts of perjury and against Bonacci on three counts Troy Boner and Danny King the other two main witnesses taped by Caradori recanted in the spring of 1990 The Douglas County grand jury made no mention of the fact that by retractin their testimony to Caradori the two were saying that they lie to the Legislature whose representative Caradori was The grand jury noted that in a May 1990 interim report it had recommended that the Washington County Attorney charge Jarrett Webb with third degree sexual assault of a minor namely Nelly Patterson Webb Where Nelly had reported organized abuse and prostitution however she was not to be believed In early 1986 Nelly began to expand her allegations by charging that she had been taken by King on flights to other cities such as Chicago and Washington D C where she was put on display at parties where sex and illegal drug activities took place We interviewed a number of witnesses who traveled extensively with King and a few made what must have been embarrassing admissions about engaging in sexual contact with King on some of these trips However no witness before the Grand Jury could confirm in any way that Nelly Webb or any other children were ever transported COVER UP PHASE II THE GRAND JURY for any illegal purposes and we found no evidence to support these claims Addressing other dimensions ofthe Webbs house of horrors the grand jury offered its opinion that it was unfortunate that so much time elapsed between the first allegations of abuse and the time that the last children were removed from the home It then faulted Carol Stitt of the Foster Care Review Board for writing to the state attorney general so promptly about Loretta Smith s reports instead of first making more inquiries on her own But Attorney General Spire had

In any event the Grand Jury found no evidence to substantiate any connection between King or any Franklin personnel and the alleged illegal activities described by the girl The grand jury report contained gratuitous pronouncements such as that children do have the right to expect that if they exhibit reasonable behavior they will not be abused Empha sis added It casually mentioned that according to the OPD there were over 500 known pedophiles in the Omaha area Since the U S Department of Justice estimates that a typical pedophile molests 77 children before he is caught and most are never caught a contingent of 500 pedophiles would be abusing thou sands of children every year One pedophile even caused us grand jury members to be greatly concerned This individual Robert W Andresen

authorities Having painted that bloodcurdling portrait the grand jury dismissed the matter with a wave Unfortunately because the victims refused to testify against him we could not indict In reality Andresen figured in the taped testimony of Troy Boner and Danny King to Gary Caradori which the grand jury ne glected to say The grand jury charged that the hoax was spread by certain rumormongers

Theodore Carlson Harold Andersen former Game and Parks Commissioner Eugene Mahoney Omaha Mayor P J Morgan and Omaha lawyer Thomas McKenney As for alleged abuser Chief Robert Wadman the jury observed We now look upon Owen as the perpetrator and Wadman as the victim According to the grand jury one of the perpetrators did not even exist Owen repeatedly referred to a bodyguard and enforcer of King s nicknamed Larry the Kid We believe this muscular black male in his late teens or early twenties to be a fictitious character The report did not explain how a fabricated personality could have appeared in reports from at least four different children over a period of three years Loretta Smith told about a person named King Horse who was at 110 COVER UP PHASE II THE GRAND JURY parties and rituals she

reported that a black man he called Larry Little King would carry out threats on Larry King s behalf Finally the report insisted that there was no cover up There are citizens who believe that prominent individuals allegedly associated with this case are automatically guilty because of their public stature They also believe that the public stature of these individuals allows automatic protec tion and the power to cover up situations While we agreed that this was a possibility our investigation found nothing to substantiate any of these allegations There is no evidence of a cover up

rather III THE FRANKLIN COVER UP than verifying the same Caradori worked from a sensational base If there appeared to be something that would be scan dalous he was interested in following it through If it was just a routine matter he was not willing to invest the neces sary time or effort In October 1990 Karen Ormiston the employee of Cara dori s investigative firm who was with him at the videotapings passed a polygraph test administered by Chris Gugas a profes sional polygraph specialist from San Diego who was President of the National Polygraph Association The questions to which she answered no were 1 During Gary Caradori s inter views with the Franklin case victims did he ever threaten anyone in obtaining information from them 2 To the best of your knowledge did Gary coach any of the alleged Franklin case victims on what they should say in their interviews 3 Did Gary and you advise any of the four victims at anytime to fabricate their stories To the question Were all the state ments given to you and Gary by the four Franklin case victims completely voluntary she answered yes Gugas concluded I t is the opinion of this examiner that Ms Ormiston answered all of the above

Hughes a pilot named by Alisha as one of Larry King s favorite pilots Caradori did not trace through many of these leads because he died But the grand jury waved them aside The jury s report says that

dissatisfaction with the grand jury report More than 3 000 responses were tallied The jury claimed without having called me to testify that I had issued my memorandum for personal political gain and possible revenge for past actions against me I filed a civil suit charging that the jury s statements were malicious intentional negligent and done in violation of my clearly established constitutional and statutory rights Senator Chambers submitted a Motion to Expunge to the Douglas County District Court accompanied by an 83 page supporting brief which documented the jury s gross irregular ities The legislative Franklin committee s official response to the jury s report raised a question which the jury had carefully left unanswered We assume from their choice of words carefully crafted hoax the Franklin committee said that the Grand Jury was persuaded that the testimony of the witnesses corroborated each other and included facts and circumstances which were readily verifiable and attested to by other witnesses Otherwise it could not be logically deemed carefully crafted If it was carefully crafted who crafted it and when In addition the committee observed Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci are charged with perjury and Troy Boner and Danny King are not As we see it the victims who stand by their story are charged with perjury while those that have admitted to false statements before the Committee in the videotaped testi mony are not That makes little sense to us Either all of them should have been indicted or none of them The message is mixed and appears to

never got to the point in three days It was always go around the circle and it was always accusatory more than trying to get the facts out and let the chips fall where they may They never gave her an opportunity to go into them you see 119 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP Although the grand jury was to indict Owen for saying she was sexually abused by Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman in 1983 and 1984 she said they asked her virtually nothing about those years about the abuse or about her detailed descrip tion of Wadman s physiognomy OWEN I you know as I said before they never talked to me about 1983 and 1984 They don t even know what happened They they send me into this grand jury they are calling me a perjurer and they have never even asked me what happened And when it s kind of hard for me because I want people to know I m telling the truth and sometimes some of the things that you have to tell them about what happened or about the perpetrators is difficult And it would be I think a gross injustice if that evidence was suppressed The fact that I know about the bunion or the knot on his little toe and he has hair on his toes you know I can tell you exactly how the hair patches on his feet are it would be a gross injustice if that was suppressed in the grand jury I think that would that would be absolutely a crime Because in the United States today when it comes to those kinds

the grand jury in a taped interview with Senator Ernie Chambers reported on in the Nebraska Observer of August 31 1990 She was left with the overwhelming impression that the Grand Jury had wanted only that part of her testimony that might be useful to discredit Alisha Owen Later she was to receive phone calls from a male saying she talked too much 120 COVER UP PHASE II THE GRAND JURY Since she had moved several times since her partying days and except for phone calls right after being investigated by the FBI had not had any such phone calls she believed that someone connected with the Grand Jury was giving out information Jane Doe charged that the grand jury was simply a set up Then the fact is also about half way through my testimony in front of the Grand Jury it was it got to a point where I didn t even trust them Because of the fact that they did not want to know about Alisha or any of that type of stuff According to Jane Doe Van Pelt told her how to testify and why revealing information about the Grand Jury pro ceedings that others had been charged to keep secret Van Pelt was said to make some references to Jane Doe s past including some illegal activities that were blocked out of the transcript that could have been interpreted by her as a threat to her She said in the interview there were some things that I had done in my past that I was afraid he was going to

Concerned Parents group Cosentino told Chambers she was repeatedly harrassed by Van Pelt s assistant Terry Dougherty outside the jury room The jury s sole interest it seemed to her was to tie her to Michael Casey a journalist whom the grand jury was to build up as an orchestrator of the carefully crafted hoax Cosentino wrote in her open letter to Chambers printed in the Omaha Metro Update 121 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP Numerous questions asked by Mr Van Pelt and Mr Dou gherty seemed to be accusatory and began with phrases like Did you tell Carol Stitt Foster Care Review Board and Did you tell Jerry Lowe former Franklin investigator I found myself on trial for reporting leads to the proper authorities I was questioned relentlessly about Michael Casey who seemed to be the focus ofMr Van Pelt s prosecution I had only met Mr Casey on two occasions neither of which were interviews Mr VanPelt and Mr Dougherty seemed to try over and over again to form some relationship between myself and Mr Casey which simply did not exist Senator Schmit recalled his own appearance before the grand jury during a Franklin committee hearing on June 21 1990 And it s also sort of interesting of course I appeared before the grand jury I had about 25 minutes for a statement the first time and they had about that many questions Mr Van Pelt said they didn t have any further need for my appearance up there And I thought that was sort of strange in view of the fact that we spent a year and a half at this we have spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours and the Franklin committee could answer all their questions And I might without revealing anything that was asked might add that most of the questions that were asked of me I think Franklin committee counsel Mr Berry is here had

Dougherty had even participated in writing the grand jury s final report a practice forbidden by Nebraska law Jury foreman Michael Flanagan admitted their involvement as the World Herald re ported on August 21 1990 Flanagan emphasized that the grand jurors participated equally and actively in the writing of the report dividing 122 COVER UP PHASE II THE GRAND JURY the writing into small groups and then meeting again and again as a whole to polish and polish the text He said the special prosecutor Samuel Van Pelt and his assistant Terry Dougherty did not have a disproportionate amount of influence on the writing Van Pelt was with us and he was part of it Flanagan said d say he was one eighteenth of the writing Everybody had equal chance and equal opportunity It was a completely joint effort The grand jury explained that its failure to subpoena Larry King was due to the probability that King would have invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself In other cases it was fine with Van Pelt to call witnesses who would take the fifth as he indicated to Jane Doe in the exchange reported by the Nebraska Observer On the return trip home Mr Van Pelt told Jane Doe about the easy day coming up the next day When she asked why he disclosed to her that the witness would plead the Fifth She said He told me that he was a homosexual and that he had sex with little boys And that they would indict him on that so the fact is that he had to plead the Fifth so he would not get indicted Van Pelt said it would be an easy day because he wouldn t have to do anything except just sit there and listen to those guys plead the Fifth through out the questions That exchange in addition to consisting of inappropriate disclosure by Mr Van Pelt is in sharp contrast to the Jury s refusal to subpoena Larry King because he would rely on his right against self incrimination and therefore would not be fruitful to attempt to require King to appear before the Grand Jury",

five years in prison for passing 700 in bad checks He had handled the child molesta tion trial of World Herald society columnist Peter Citron After Citron s conviction Sigler maintained that the Citron case had never been linked with the Franklin investigation in the begin ning middle or end That s not what this case is about He told the World Herald It had nothing to do with Franklin the evidence uncovered didn t show any link That s a big misconception Neither was Sigler disqualified from responsibility to probe Van Pelt s performance by the fact that two witnesses to the Legislature

grand jury Since Bonacci refused to recant what he had testified to Caradori Van Pelt s jury was compelled to indict him for perjury in order to maintain that the story of Franklin connected abuse was a carefully crafted hoax It was difficult to see how Bonacci could have participated with Owen in the fabrication of such a hoax Caradori did not even meet him until May 10 1990 and took his videotaped statement for the Franklin committee on May 14 five days after Owen finished testifying before the grand jury Bonacci s recollections corroborated Alisha s on many points although he told Caradori that he thought the last time he had spoken with her was in 1986 Since his testimony supported Owen s the grand jury had to call Bonacci a liar Bonacci was perhaps the most pathetic witness

Densen Gerber New York area psychiatrist lawyer child abuse expert and member of the International Society of Multiple Personality and Dissociative States has described the ailment Bonacci suffers from Multiple Personal ity Disorder MPD It is not a psychosis she said but a neurosis that results from a defense mechanism in the mind of a child seeking to protect himselffrom unimaginable atrocity Virtually all MPD victims were severely abused starting before they were six years old with tortures such as being hung upside down and having hot objects stuck inside them or being forced to participate in the murder mutilation and cannibalism of other children A child subjected to such terrible emotional and physical pain has no possibity of escape from this emotional Auschwitz so his mind in self defense invents another iden tity at the moment of abuse and suffering Through this mecha nism the child victim can imagine he is someone else looking at the pain and betrayal from the outside as if it were not actually happening to him As the victim grows older these different personalities survive in the victim s mind each having its own age name memories and characteristics Multiple Personality Disorder is familiar to many people from Flora Rheta Schreiber s book Sybil about the first MPD victim who ever reintegrated her personality through psychoanalysis Sybil tortured

through that mine field with you because that is what it will very likely prove to be Senator Chambers who represented the black district of north Omaha where Franklin was headquartered agreed What Larry King is doing is the tip of an iceberg and he s not in it by himself One thing I told the Attorney General is that I don t want Larry King to commit suicide and I don t want any accidents that

scandal broke King was more expansive about his friends They were the key to my success I had really great great people who were counselors and teachers who were over some of the major companies in the city And I would go to them and ask them what they thought I should do and sometimes they would come and sit down or send someone out to talk with us Harold Andersen of the World Herald was one of the great people who came out Bill Fitzgerald at Commercial Federal Savings and Loan I called him once years ago when we were in a crisis and he said I Il be there at 7 30 tomorrow morning And so he was So I have to say the Omaha power structure has some of the best people to work with They ll help you if they re convinced you want to help Omaha They don t tum their backs they have never done it to me And I appreciate it because I like being a part of what makes this city grow and this country Had the Omaha power structure merely extended a liberal hand to a young black man trying to get ahead For some of the city s elite perhaps that s all there was to it Days and even weeks after the raid some of Franklin s backers were still defending King The World Herald of No vember 9 1988 quoted its own publisher Harold Andersen Ken Power of US West Communications and Lyn Wallin Ziegenbein of the Kiewit Foundation in praise of King Until the day it closed Franklin was performing a useful purpose Harold Andersen said on November 30 1988 Yet someone making even a casual inquiry such as a busi nessman might be expected to do before he contributed or deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars in a credit union would quickly hear the kind of warning Boys Town social worker Julie Walters did when she asked around about King They would have heard he was a dangerous man and they

McGuire aka Sheila Cal der former manager of the French Cafe who had moved to the West Coast This night spot partly owned by Larry King was named by victim witnesses as a center of sexual abuse Alisha Owen told Caradori that Sheila Calder would arrange parties at the French Cafe during the afternoon when the cafe was closed Here is what the hostess had to say We had parties in my apartment above the French Cafe Larry King would wine and dine potential investors down stairs at the Cafe When the French Cafe closed about 1 AM King and his man called Parking Lot Bob who worked for him and was our coke connection would bring people upstairs to my place If Larry King investors wanted drugs booze children or hookers male or female we d get them While these guests of Kings took their pleasures with the kids or whoever King would sit and watch while he drank did coke and played with his young boys One time when this guy Irv from NYC wanted Sandra who was about 12 or 13 years old and getting her 1st period Larry intervened when Sandra refused King pulled out a roll of 100 00 bills and gave Sandra 5 of them King then pulled out a small gram of coke and gave that to Sandra Sandra finally agreed and went off to bed with Irv King took good care of the local and out of town high rollers If you had the money to invest at Franklin King would cater to your most deranged perversion And let me tell you another thing The boys in the board rooms around Omaha are s ing in their Brogans If this case gets cracked open the list of involved will read like Who s Who King and his crew have ruined

Andersen and the rest of them The word has gone out layoff the Franklin investigation Most of the Senators are terrified These guys make and break political careers They give a lot of campaign money and many of the Senators get what are generously called consulting fees or sometimes positions no show jobs really with the big firms up there That s the way it s done It s not uncommon for a big company to have more than one Senator on a 50 000 retainer Who were these guys the Ak Sar Ben crowd Visit the Omaha Public Library to look up the boards of directors of big Omaha companies and you will find names that are listed on board after board Take a few of those say Walter Scott Jr chairman and CEO of the construction giant Peter Kiewit and Sons Corporation Charles Mike Harper chairman and CEO of the 20 billion per year food conglomer ate ConAgra Michael H Walsh CEO of Union Pacific Rail road a major force in Nebraska for over a hundred years and ask the librarian to help find information on these men The reply will likely be something like what one library staffer told a friend of mine in 1991 These are businessmen all right but they are intensely secretive We have very little on them For over a century the Omaha business community has been organized around the Knights of Ak Sar Ben a quasi freemasonic social organization centered on a racetrack and fairgrounds in Omaha Spell Nebraska backwards and you get its name Founded in 1895 Ak Sar Ben functions as a sort of central committee of the corporate elite and a self perceived oligarchy for the city Every year Ak Sar Ben celebrates a ritual coronation of the King of Ak Sar Ben generally an older corporate executive and his Queen generally the younger wife or daughter of another man in the club The king for 1990 was Mike Harper of ConAgra Here and at debutante balls and other affairs organized for the younger generation the lords and ladies of Ak Sar Ben establish their social pecking order The rituals

over where a new stadium would be constructed Morgan blustered Frankly I m just sick and tired of a small handful of people who think that they can control this city and county without regard to feelings sentiments and desires of the honest hard working people who are the real foundation of this city Sensitive to this widespread perception ConAgra s Harper speaking as chairman of Ak Sar Ben s Board of Governors replied in a special World Herald column on December 9 1990 Ak Knights Don t Control City Just because the indi viduals and corporations on Ak Sar Ben s board had given over 50 million to various causes over the past 20 years wrote Harper ticking off a list of most of the public facilities in Omaha that did not mean they had clout I am at a loss to see how contributions to reputable charities can be associated with political power Harper s own company flaunted its political power over the city and the state just a few years ago According to Omaha Held Hostage a May 1989 article in Progressive magazine ConAgra threatened in 1987 to pull out of Omaha unless the city granted it a choice piece of free land sewage paving and a host of other benefits which will ultimately total as much as 60 million for a new corporate headquarters The city acquiesced Later the same year when the Nebraska Legislature was on the verge of removing personal property tax exemptions on

as individuals poured in money while Union Pacific officer Arnold Nesbitt sat on the board Ak Sar Ben interfaced with the Franklin credit union proper but also with individuals in the orbit of Larry King One of its biggest financial contributors in recent years was the department store heir and child abuser Alan Baer Catering for Ak Sar Ben was Gary West bartender from the Max gay bar As the Legislature geared up to investigate the credit union its lofty advisors began to jump ship At the Legislature s Executive Board meeting of December 12 1988 Senator Chambers captured the picture This situation will be like the Nazi regime after it failed nobody saw Hitler nobody knew who Hitler was but one kid once saw an old man who one time knew a guy who talked to a guy who saw a car drive by with curtains on it and somebody said Hitler was in that car That s the way this is going to be nobody knows anything nobody has seen anything nobody knows why investigations in the past by the federal government were terminated Sure enough over the next months one board member after another would appear on the pages of the World Herald to deny he had really had anything to do with Franklin Virtually nobody from the powerful firms that channeled funds to Frank lin and advisers to its board was ever questioned by the Franklin committee about his relations with the credit union Once again

that throughout his friendship with Larry everything was always straight and that he had never seen anything out of the ordinary To the trained investigator something didn t sit quite right Caradori observed This investigator noted that Mr Barker seemed extremely uneasy while this writer was present Further investigation will be conducted reference this matter In other cases Franklin Advisory Board members were one step removed from personal contact with King One person from a company would sit on the board while somebody else was more directly in touch The law firm Byrne Randall credit union board member Carolyn Rothery fit this pattern Joseph Byrne handled much of King s legal business early in his career and King used Byrne as a personal reference on credit applications according

indicate that he typifies what our community is In the community there is outrage that the appearance seems to be to try to keep this man looking like a decent upstanding citizen One of the pictures you ll see is where he was catering something for one of the Christ Child centers in Omaha to make it look like he s a great guy You ll see an article that talks about how generously he gave for AIDs

another secret powerful factor Senator Gene Mahoney had become arch enemies with the senator I was running against Bill Wylie I chanced to fit perfectly into Mahoney s plans against Wylie Back in

history Gary Caradori s dossier on Mahoney filled up with incident reports of another nature One of his confidential informants in an interview on February 22 1990 recalled how he once returned Mahoney s car to him at a camp where lacking wife or family Mahoney spent time THE FRANKLIN COVER UP Immediately west of the Louisville State Park is a little camp near there with a half a dozen cabins in it And Mr Mahoney s is the far west cabin in that group right up against the river We took that car down there and went up with the keys to leave the to identify the car so here s the keys And the door swung open and as I recall there was no screen or anything on it And there stood a large heavyset fleshy young black man absolutely in the buff with nothing but a big smile on his face In retrospect the informant thought it was likely that the heavyset young man had been Larry King That would agree with a report by Jerry Lowe from June 18 1989 of an interview with a former Franklin employee Source indicated that Godfather s Pizza founder Willie Thiesen s name had been linked with Larry King s as being homosexually involved and that King had also had simi lar relationships with Harold Andersen Eugene Mahoney and Bob Wadman Investigator Robert Hansel of Caracorp Caradori s firm filled out the picture on October 1 1990 Information was obtained that Mr Mahoney has a cabin at the west end of Louisville Park The source also stated that some sexual activities may have occurred there He stated Harold Andersen was real close with Gene Mahoney and his name had come up on several occasions The name Nate Foley was mentioned He stated he knew for a fact that Gene Mahoney had propositioned him in the past and showed him some photos He informed this writer that Mr Foley

Game and Parks Commission who used to fly him around 142 THE OMAHA BUSINESS COMMUNITY During his time with the Commission he stated that Eugene Mahoney always travelled with young individuals i e late teens or early 20s Whenever Mahoney would travel especially with his aides they always had to stay in the same room or cabin with Mahoney He stated that on numerous occasions Harold Andersen had also travelled with Maho ney which may have been to promote the State Games sic and Parks Commission and also for fundraisers Said the February 22 1990 confidential informant about Mahoney s ongoing

He s the highest priced park superintendent in the state even though when he came in there he had absolutely no creden tials He d never worked in a state park and didn t know anything about managing people or the wildlife or anything On March 16 1990 Caradori reported the observations of another source He went on to state that Mr Mahoney did like to cater to teenage boys and had participated in many outings with various groups of teenage kids such as the Boy Scouts With the help of Harold Andersen and Lincoln Journal Star publisher Joseph Seacrest over a two year period Mahoney raised more

there would have been a conflict of interest for any UP employee sitting on the grand jury In the case of Flanagan there was more to it than that In the summer of 1990 while the Douglas County grand

much vested in a good salary position and pension But I do not feel I can sit idly by He defended Union Pacific as a company that was good to its employees and he thought good for the country But it

the young male individual was paid a substantial sum of money by Union Pacific to keep quiet go about his business and find other employment I began to investigate and found the facts accurate Here is how they were summarized in a lawsuit filed by me on behalf of Paul Bonacci The Grand Jury Foreman Michael Flanagan should not have been allowed to be Grand Jury Foreman because he himself Michael

Alisha Owen Paul Bonacci and Nelly and Kimberly Webb all reported that King took boys from Boys Town for his pedophile activities Omaha author Steve Bowman who is preparing a book on the Franklin Credit Union for release in 1992 discovered as he interviewed Boys Town grads that King s activities there were scarcely anomalous You would keep hearing the same thing over and over again Bowman said of the graduates many of whom were homosexually involved with Larry King They would invariably say I first discovered my homosexual ity during counseling at Boys Town The homosexual ambiance at the orphanage was featured in a novel reported on in the August 27 1989 World Herald An Omaha native said his new novel describing a youth s painful upbringing in a boys home including many homo sexual encounters is based on his eight years at Boys Town Jimmy Cheshire 44 of Yellow Springs Ohio said in an interview that Home Boy accurately depicts life as he saw it at Boys Town from 1955 to 1963 when he graduated as class valedictorian Cheshire said homosexuality was rampant at Boys Town while he was there Everybody I knew was involved in it After graduation no one talks about it he said In my opinion one third of the Boys Town counselors were pedophiles The only reason they were there was because kids were there A lot of kids were seduced Cheshire said he did not find any adults at Boys Town who were reliable There were some brutal people some sick people he said The children turned to each other for support 154 THE OMAHA BUSINESS COMMUNITY Father Val Peter said of Cheshire s book

one point Franklin was paid 15 000 to do a study on the relocation of people who lost their houses because of an expansion of Boys Town Boys Town boys could get jobs at Franklin King hired Brandt Thomas a 1984 graduate to work at the credit union according to a July 5 1983 report from Doyle and Carol Gilles pie Boys Town family teachers They also noted that Brandt has moved in with his employer Mr King Thomas was still under care of the school and his change of residence was sanctioned by the highest official at Boys Town then Executive Director Father Hupp His March 26 1983 letter to Brandt s mother Lila Thomas was summarized by legislative Franklin committee researcher Jose J Soto This letter from Father Hupp advises Brandt s mother of steps to take before Brandt moves in with Larry King Hupp even attended the party King threw for Thomas after the boy moved in Two and a half years later Nelly Webb was to tell Julie Walters that King frequently took Thomas around with him to serve as a homosexual prostitute By the time Franklin Credit Union met its fate Boys Town had deposited or planned to deposit one million dollars in the credit union THE FRANKLIN COVER UP Ifhis liaison to Boys Town were insufficient for his purposes Larry King had the Omaha Girls Club as a hunting ground Victim witnesses consistently said both institutions were tapped by King to find

heard that a couple of girls had slept with men who were somehow connected with the Girls Club A week later he learned from Kathleen Sorenson that Nelly and Kimberly talked about being at many parties at King s house on River Road and at another location They were often taken to these parties at a moments notice They said the parties were for very important people Caradori s investigation showed that King s control of the Girls Club was a matter of public record for anybody who bothered to look Checking the incorporation papers at the Secretary of State s office Caradori discovered that the Girls Club was incorporated in December 1973 with Larry King as its president to promote the health social cultural vocational and character development of girls One of the three incorporators was

been done by law enforcement at the time of the children s complaints more could have been learned about the very important people the girls saw party ing with King The stakes in keeping their identity under wraps were obviously very high The Omaha corporations that bankrolled Larry King and Franklin are also the major sponsors of youth organizations in Nebraska such as Boys Club Girls Club Boy Scouts Boys Town Uta Halee Home for Girls and others These corpora tions donate millions of dollars per year to these organizations as the annual reports of the recipients show Many executives of

unknown person by telephone that I was advised not to pursue the investigation because it would lead I was told to the highest levels of the Republican Party And I responded that the investigation would go where it went Hard as the Omaha business community worked to distance itself from Larry King there were even more strenuous efforts to insulate from the scandal anybody of national stature

accepted a position in the Reagan Bush re election campaign He was appointed by National Black Republican Council Chairperson LeGree Daniels who was named Chairperson of the Black Voters for the Campaign in the Reagan Bush 84 re election bid She has appointed King as coordinator of all the activities to bring out the Black vote In brief this means that Mr King will be responsible for meeting with the Party officials and the Black Republican leadership within each of the 17 targeted states He will coordinate the efforts of these groups in support of the Reagan Bush campaign Mr King will also be traveling to the 17 targeted states when President Reagan does to draw state party officials and Black Republican leadership together Mr King has also accepted the Chairmanship of the National

psychiatric facility in Springfield Missouri for tests Senator Chambers reacted to King s abrupt disappearance as reported in the March 17 1990 World Herald State Senator Ernie Chambers said Friday that he believes that Franklin Com munity Federal Credit Union head Lawrence E King was whisked out of Omaha in a hasty almost clandestine way last month so he could not attend an event at which President Bush spoke Chambers said that a trial of King could prove embarrassing to powerful people at the national level The notes of Franklin investigator Gary Caradori confirm the senator s suspicions On February 19 1990 twelve days after King was whisked off Caradori wrote I was informed that LK was sent to Missouri for observation because the Secret Service had discovered that he had pur chased a ticket to Governor Orr s breakfast with President Bush LK was approached at a local floral shop and was rushed to court by the Secret Service or at their demand This was so sudden that LK s attorneys were unaware of what was going on The word in Omaha was that King indicted in federal court May 19 1989 on forty counts of financial wrongdoing was planning to ask Bush for help When Larry King traveled the political circuit he evidently had two agendas To the public he was the rising GOP star with the resonant baritone voice Something else went on be hind closed doors At the Dallas convention in 1984 King threw his splashy party at Southfork Ranch remembered by me and many other delegates as an unparalleled extravaganza According to several victim witnesses he also arranged some

at the party you would not know from the outer glitter what sordid activity was going on behind the scenes I am sure that was the character of many of Larry King s parties particularly the political events Outwardly they had the appearance oflegitimacy with prominent people in attendance from mayors to presidents from businessmen to congressmen So when people say to me Well I was at one of Larry King s parties and I did not see any of this sex or drug or pedophilia stuff I understand that they may be speaking with honesty and accuracy As to what really went on I believe they are wrong Larry

NCVA be wanting to talk to me I wondered out loud when my secretary said that Fenner was on the line The man on the other end of the phone said he knew I was a close friend of former CIA head Bill Colby and that I also was Senator Loran Schmit s personal attorney He quickly came to his point I know there are a lot of rumors that Franklin was being used as a front for laundering money for the Contras and that a lot of the money that is missing from Franklin actually went to finance the Contras I acknowledged that I had heard such talk and told him I myself am one of those who wonder if that is not a real possibility in light of the way things have been shaking out on the Contra scandal Fenner then gave me a flood of details on the secret Franklin accounts and where the missing money supposedly went No destinations linked with Iran Contra were mentioned I know you recommended that Bill Colby be hired to inves tigate this matter Fenner continued and that the committee rejected

Looks to me as if he had to have one heck of a lot of powerful political protection at the highest levels Homosexuals Fenner said Franklin financed the biggest group of homosexuals any state has ever seen A lot of awfully powerful and prominent personalities involved But probably not anything you can do anything about As far as politicians go it does not seem to go to the very top as some of the rumors suggested Are you telling me that the Franklin theft and scandal was just one big queer party with a bunch of rich folk who do not want their involvement known I asked Yes replied Fenner and I am not sure we know who all THE FRANKLIN COVER UP was involved Larry King did very clearly have contacts at the highest levels that made it possible for him to prevent proper audits Otherwise this could never have happened But the money was not used for Iran Contra purposes Reviewing that conversation from the vantage point of nearly three years later I think that on both counts where the money went and the involvement of high level political figures I was hearing something short of the real story from Fenner to put it charitably Independent investigations confirm that there are ample grounds to question the conclusion of the NCUA hired firm FAG that the nearly 40 million gone from the credit union was all squandered by Larry King on limousines flowers gold watches for his lovers

King was involved with CIA money laundering that jibes with a report from a member of Concerned Parents I heard from two different black people in North Omaha that King used to send limousines down to Offutt Air Base home of the Strategic Air Command to pick up CIA personnel for parties The sometimes expansive Larry King used to talk fondly about his friends In a Sept 7 1988 interview with the

about the lack of OPD follow up on the child abuse when it was first reported In exasperation Wadman replied The tough thing with this Mr Berry is that we have the FBI who conducts an investigation and basically says the same things that we have said If the FBI are they now linked to this cover up in some way Should the Justice Department be investigated as somehow or another assisting in this cover up Wadman said it but in this case it s true The Justice Depart ment acting through the FBI and the U S Attorney s Office in Omaha emerges from the record of the Franklin investiga tions not so much as a party to the cover up but as its coordina tor Rigging grand juries harrassment of witnesses incitement to perjury and tampering with evidence federal personnel were seen to apply all of

government would say anything that they would automati cally lose their jobs That evidence was never made available to the Franklin committee nor its existence publicly acknowledged by the FBI All warrants concerning the raid were sealed by U S Magistrate Richard Kopf The Douglas County grand jury proclaimed on July 23 1990 that the allegations and evidence of Franklin linked child abuse were a carefully crafted hoax Its report implied that the perpetrators were Alisha Owen journalist Michael Casey and the late Gary Caradori According to testimony of Alisha Owen and her parents before the Franklin committee the FBI had this line already in March of 1990 before the grand jury even started sitting Alisha testified to the Franklin committee on June 11 1990 before promulgation of the grand jury report that her former lawyer Pam Vuchetich had come to see her in the spring giving a proposal from the FBI that if recanted my story then nothing would happen to me I could possibly get out of prison and no charges would ever be brought against me Such as if I recanted my story they wouldn t charge me with perjury they wouldn t charge me with lying they would just drop the COVER UP PHASE III THE FBI whole thing they would write letters to the judge asking for my sentence reduction so I could get out of prison And if and in this deal I would have to say that Gary Caradori and Mike Casey came to me they set this whole thing up they told me what to say we got scripts we were promised monetary values And I would be taken care of On June 21 1990 Donna and Alvin Owen told the Franklin committee about that incident DONNA OWEN My concern is that Pam came to us and said that the FBI wanted Alisha to say this to drop it SENATOR LYNCH You testified that your husband was there

have been Tuesday April 25 1990 It would have all that was brought up then but it was also brought up earlier in March Because at that time I called Senator Labedz and I said do you realize that this is what is happening and I want to tell you this because I think when all is said and done it s not going to just be this man Mike Casey they are going to say that Gary Cara dori was in on it and that

phone calls from Troy Boner She wrote up her notes on the calls I need to preface this writing by explaining that in the course of the Franklin Credit Union investigation many calls were received at our home from Troy Boner I was familiar with the individual s voice and can be 100 assured that I did in fact receive the telephone calls from him In the early evening of Wednesday July 11 1990

asked Troy to tell what he had just told me to our son Sean sc Troy I want you to talk to Sean Gary s lti year old son Please tell him alright TB Yeah sure SEAN Yeah man what do you want I along with the ten to 15 other people in our kitchen family room heard Sean s portion of the conversation as follows SEAN Okay buddy you need to do it for my Dad man Okay Okay I got back on the telephone and told him I would try to contact Senator Schmit or Karen Ormiston He said he d be at phone number but only for a short time He said he was going to be on the move or something to that effect He further stated I Il go to anyone who ll listen I ll go without my lawyer I m gonna come clean He then asked if I would talk with his mother She wanted to talk I said Of course Troy s mother s voice was

would promise me that he would come through for me for Gary and for A J He said I promise 187 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP tomorrow To anyone who will listen the FBI the news anyone The next day I did not

They laughed at me They said they spent too much time and money on this case now for me to change my story I also went to Frank Brown Channel 7 TV but he said he didn t want to take a statement because of my Grand Jury testimony The next day Sandie Caradori arrived at the offices of her husband s firm for the first time since his death to find two FBI agents already there with a subpoena for all of Caracorp s records Mrs Caradori recalled I was extremely upset because the timing certainly left much to be desired I opened the closed door and noted two FBI agents Karen Ormiston and our security director Joe Hebe nstreit They were all seated in the office I said I don t think I need to introduce myself What are you doing here I can t believe this The smaller individual stammered a bit and looked at Karen and said Who who is this She s Gary s widow He then halfway stood up and extended his hand as if to shake mine and expressed his their sympathy The whole ordeal was extremely unprofessional He then looked over his shoulder at the other agent gave him a smirk and shook his head He identified himself as Mickey Mott I then asked them directly whether Troy Boner had tried to

1990 188 COVER UP PHASE III THE FBI State Senators Loran Schmit of Bellwood and Bernice Labedz of Omaha said Troy Boner told blatant lies when he said he did not come to Schmit s office last week and when he said he didn t recant what he told a Douglas County grand jury Schmit said at least eight people were in his office last week when Boner in essence recanted his recantation and said that what he had originally told Caradori was the truth Six of the eight appeared at a press conference Thursday including four Schmit Sen Labedz Caradori associate R I Nebe and Jody Gittins an attorney who works in Schmit s office who said they heard Boner s comments directly The six at the press conference Thursday said Boner was in Schmit s office both July 16 and July 17 the day of Caradori s funeral Under pressure Boner reasserted that what he told Gary Caradori was not true His new lawyer Marc Delman insisted that his client had lied to Caradori A specialist in child abuse cases when he worked in the Douglas County Attorney s Office Delman was now better known for defending pornographers Since Boner was penniless many people in Omaha wondered if Alan Baer or another patron had given him the money to hire Delman On Sept 25 1990 a federal grand jury returned findings almost identical to those of the Douglas County jury There is no credible evidence for us to believe that funds or individuals connected with the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union were involved in the sexual exploitation of minors the interstate transportation of minors the interstate transportation of

said had threatened Boner into recanting his videotaped statement which enabled the Douglas jury to return its carefully crafted hoax verdict and set the pattern for the federal grand jury Federal officials in charge of the latter in particular Assistant U S Attorney Thomas Thalken attempted to terrorize Alisha Owen into recanting as well In testimony to the Franklin committee on June 21 1990 Owen told about her experience with the federal grand jury in an exchange with committee counsel BERRY Now I do not want to know what questions were asked and what answers you gave But you told me earlier that your life hasn t been easy and the worst three days of your life were in front of the county grand jury Was the federal grand jury a more pleasant experience Of OWEN Well now I have to clarify that statement No longer the worst three days of my life were not in front of the county grand jury but they were in front of the federal grand jury Imagine if you were woken up at 5 00 in the morning told to take a shower and get dressed You were not told where you were going I mean if sombody came to your home at 5 00 did not tell you where you were going they had the authority to drag you out of bed After you got dressed you were then taken outside your home and wrapped in chains and driven two hours to another city all you were still not told where you are going and what is actually happening Officially you are not told Then once you get to this other city you re put into an actual cage I mean I have seen kennels look nicer than where I was held And five minutes before 9

disrespectful tone saying things repeatedly over and over if she gets up there and she doesn t tell the truth I m going to charge her with perjury Over and over and over and over again I have not heard the word perjury so many times in my entire life than that day He was saying this to my attorney saying I m going to put her on the stand and if she doesn t you know if she doesn t tell the truth I m going to charge her with perjury Alisha s attorney Henry Rosenthal confirmed her account Well I don t know Tom Thalken He came at me like a little grizzly bear And he had a finger about two inches from my nose and kept yelling about perjury And I didn t even know what he was talking about Over and over about this and that and this and that I said let me tell you if you think you have got any evidence of perjury when she s done please charge her just please do that And that s every time there was a recess yelling about perjury This was before the evidence even started Long before Thalken s behavior in dealing with Owen his name had surfaced in Gary Caradori s investigation as an alleged pedophile who frequented adult book stores in Council Bluffs Iowa Moreover a confidential informant told Caradori that Thalken was key to the cover up in progress In a February 22 1990 report Caradori transcribed an interview with this confidential informant GC Are the federal people still

conveyed to Alisha the FBI s offer of a deal from Vuchetich s friend Mickey Mott In her Franklin committee testimony of June 11 1990 Owen reported another incident involving Vuchetich and the FBI which appeared to be an attempt to craft some evidence of the carefully crafted hoax They had Troy call me in the beginning of March He called me in the afternoon and I got on the phone Pam had told me that Troy had recanted his statement about Danny She never told me he recanted his statement about me And you know maybe I was naive maybe I was just dumb but I never once thought he could do that because I mean I had all this evidence you know and I mean I m the one that you know that told them about Troy and others It never dawned on me that he would ever do that recant about Danny So we I got on the phone and I one of the first things I asked him was why are you doing this to Danny he s one of your best friends how could you do this what are you doing And he said something Alisha I m scared And his voice the FBI has this tape His voice is just really scared And I know Troy sleeps until 4 00 or 5 00 at night so I started to think oh my God he s in Omaha for a week it s 3 00 2 30 in the afternoon somebody must be at his house making him do this And I thought this must be a taped phone conversation I was I was literally scared I thought either they sat down a lot of money in front of him or else somebody has got a gun to his head making him say this 192 COVER UP PHASE III THE FBI I mean I never thought it never dawned on me the FBI would be so you know devious as to try and do

I said I don t give a damn about any money you know just tell the truth That s what I said quote unquote Excuse my French But I just just tell the truth He said what should I do And I said just tell the truth And he kept trying to make these leading statements Alisha what should I do And that s when I realized at that point in time that whoever was listening was probably law enforcement trying to do entrapping statements And after I got off the phone I tried to get ahold of Pam Well Pam is sitting down in the FBI s office with them making that call Tried to get hold of Pam Pam is not around So I was upset enough and I was worried enough that possibly somebody was sitting there with a gun that I called Gary And I thought okay if anybody is going to be able to do anything or know anything Gary will know or he ll be able to find out I called Gary And Gary said Alisha Troy is sitting down at the FBI s office right now So okay I knew that the FBI was the one that prompted him to that call So Gary told me that it was the FBI And Gary said to me at that time Alisha maybe you should start wondering why your attorney is spending so much time with the FBI Against Alisha Owen s specific instructions she reported Vuchetich turned over to the FBI a file that Alisha maintained on acquaintances from her past Vuchetich had suggested she assemble this information In it were the names of

she told me and that she wished me well For my own protection I tape recorded the telephone conversation which lasted approximately 30 minutes According to an associate of Caradori Franklin committee counsel John Stevens Berry alerted Caradori that he should get a lawyer since he would likely be indicted Alisha was not the only witness the FBI was reported to have harrassed or told to lie At a Franklin committee session on June 22 1990 Senator Labedz related her discussion with former Franklin employee Noel Seltzer 194 COVER UP PHASE III THE FBI One of the most important things that I thought he told me was the fact that when they first went into the investigation of Larry King he was talked to by the FBI and he told them mostly everything that he told me about the sexual abuse and so forth And then he said he was told by the FBI we re going to advise you it s best for you that you keep your mouth shut And I said say that again and he repeated it so I could write it down Gary

added Following this meeting this writer placed a telephone call to Sue Tompkins who is the sister of Terry Muller She advised me that Terry had retained an attorney to protect him from the FBI I told her that I wished him well and hoped that everything worked out for him Caradori s investigative notes for February 19 1990 record his talk with Joanie Gregory a Department of Social Services social worker who screened families applying for foster care licenses Approximately 2 5 years ago she was inspecting the home of Jarrett and Barbara Webb for a renewal of their license She felt the environment was not right and wrote a letter to DSS in Lincoln She received no response After a couple of months she wrote a letter to the Omaha Police Department regarding this same situation with the Webbs She was then contacted by the FBI In the meantime she had tried to do some research on her own but evidently files were missing 195 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP To this writer s knowledge a letter

be in gold but you produce a work product and then one of the aspects of your investigation is the State Patrol and right away it goes to them goes to the FBI and and then they just tear you apart And yeah it s been really frustrating SEN LYNCH So the impression that we talked about being left with the grand jury wasn t an impression that this com mittee or witnesses that we had or any staff in addition to you our counsel misled us with information but the fact that information we developed that we shared with the FBI and the police department was in fact used by them to 196 COVER UP PHASE

that it was a pity charter companies did not keep flight manifests so no trips could be verified In a September 25 1990 letter to Senator Schmit Ormiston summed up the FBI s activities THE FRANKLIN COVER UP There must be some kind of provision which allows the State of Nebraska to retain its information so that there is not a probable cover up when this stuff is turned over to the federal level It is my sincere hope that the federal agencies cannot just walk all over the state agencies espe cially since we have given them everything we have yet we have been allowed to see nothing that they have This in itself has not only prolonged the investigation but it has also been a major factor in that the FBI does seem to get to our leads since they do have a lot of manpower I do feel that the leads turned over to the FBI have effectively been stonewalled as it pertains to this investigation The FBI s eagerness to discredit the victim witnesses may be based on more than just an

of that motion The Sexual Deviance Complaint and Investigation reads in part In response to his telephonic complaint a signed sworn statement was taken from Rochon on July 3 1984 In his COVER UP PHASE III THE FBI statement Rochon described a series of acts or events which he alleged were evidence of sexual deviance by SA Special Agent Dillon and other SAs assigned to the Omaha office Specifically Rochon alleged that he had personally ob served Dillon French kissing SA Agent Terry 1 Bohle a male at a going away party for SA Bohle and that he likewise had personally witnessed Dillon exposing him self in the Omaha office during a regular work day to numer ous Omaha employees both male and female In addition Rochon said that he had heard reports that Dillon had allowed Bohle to urinate into his mouth and to urinate into a beer bottle from which he subsequently drank and that Dillon had been observed picking out the deodorant block in the men s urinal and placing this block in his mouth Rochon further alleged that Dillon appeared preoccupied with homo sexual sex kept homosexual pornography at his desk and had frequently spoken in the office of homosexual acts Another agent backed up Rochon s account of Dillon s allowing Bohle to urinate into his mouth In an official re sponse Dillon protested that SA Bohle only accidentally did urinate on him on one occasion He added that he Dillon had not exposed his penis in the office as Rochon charged but merely his buttocks The Bureau defended Dillon s possession of pornographic homosexual literature as necessary for his

Dillon U S Attorney Ron Lahners commented privately at the time This thing is so big and involves so many prominent people around this state The investigation was expected to bring high level indictments but never did One Nebraska insider said recently There is no doubt that the pedophile networks investigated in 1983 over lapped those of Larry King in fact King himself was probably looked at at that time Special agent Dillon who was investigating homosexual prostitution in those years was real close to some priests at 199 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP Boys Town according to a law enforcement source who knew Dillon then Years later Caradori received allegations that some priests associated with Boys Town in particular Father Pat Henry and Father Fiala were pedophiles Father Henry was sent to Bolivia when child abuse scandals surfaced at Boys Town in the mid 1980s Donald Rochon was a successful agent part of whose respon sibility while in Omaha was to find missing children He once was commended for finding a kidnapped girl within one day of beginning work on the case Inevitably as a black agent he would have developed ties in the black community in north Omaha where Larry King s pedophilia was notorious Many of the boys King used as prostitutes were black and were recruited from Boys Town where the alleged pervert SA Dillon seemed to have friends Would it have been just a matter of time until Rochon found himself investigating SA Dillon and others in Dillon s clique One thing was established for certain by Rochon s court documents Dillon was the ringleader of the harassment operation which drove Rochon from Omaha and most of the rest of the Omaha FBI office covered up for Dillon 200 CHAPTER IS KATHLEEN SORENSON S STORY At the time of his death Gary Caradori

area and some observers think the number should really be about 50 But it is difficult to determine the cause of death of a yearling after five or six days in open country However Pierce County rancher Eugene Scott last week 202 KATHLEEN SORENSON S STORY found a calf which had been dead only five hours according to the examining veterinarian Its sex organs had been re moved and the body drained of blood State Patrol investiga tor E M Hastreiter said no blood or tracks were found on the scene Mutilation stories began in May and at first authorities attributed the acts to varmints mostly coyotes But then a veterinarian called to examine the dismembering and drain ing of a cow near Madison in June said he was concerned that a human element was involved In most cases blood has been drained and reproductive organs removed A helicopter frequently has been seen hov ering over the area about the time of the mutilation A copter with a spotlight was seen over the Lancaster County

on several occasions Bonacci spoke to Dr Judianne Densen Gerber about his activities as a member of four different satanic cults in Nebraska some of which had 50 to 100 members A groundbreaking account of satanic activities in Nebraska came from Kathleen Sorenson the foster mother who took in Nelly and Kimberly Patterson after they fled from the Webbs Mrs Sorenson decided to speak out about what she had learned from children in her care Together with her eldest foster daugher a survivor of ritualistic abuse she spoke at public forums around the state gave radio and television inter views and appeared on Geraldo Rivera s nationally televised special on satanism This is the report Kathleen Sorenson gave on a Christian TV interview program aired in Nebraska in 1989 based on her experience with over 30 children who spent months or years in her home We got involved and learned about this subject because we were foster parents and worked with a number of children And several years back several of the children began after a period of time and building up trust began to talk about some very bizarre events that had happened in their past and they were frightening and very

when we talk about devil worship There 204 KATHLEEN SORENSON S STORY are things that come up in every single story such as candles They all talk about sex Sex is without a doubt a part of every area of this all sorts of perverted sex That is what you will first hear about the sex about the incest and it is so hard to believe But once we get that we have learned that we can go on and ask and find out and it will involve pornography that is always part of it Part of the reason is that they can use that to threaten the children We have pictures we will show the police if you talk It makes the children feel that they are in great danger and they are all very frightened of the law They talk about the garish make up that the people in the group wear they talk about singing that they didn t understand Obviously that is chanting and that has come up in every one of these stories and none of them call it chanting There will be dancing Most often that will involve sexual acts There will always be a leader and they will be very frightened of the leader These children from a very young age and I am talking about children who came out of birth homes the family they were born to worshipped the devil That s all I can share and I don t pretend to be an expert All I can tell you is what the children have told me My husband and I say we know things we shouldn t know That s true and I thought very carefully before I agreed to do the program because we have heard so much and it is so ugly and so frightening that you hesitate to tell it to people It s very heavy to know I don t

laugh at or ignore The children I have talked to have all had to murder before the age of two That is something beyond anything I could comprehend But in some way whether with the help of an adult s hand over theirs by having them practise by getting them excited to be part of the adult scene they do murder And the evil thing that happens is that they really believe that they want to They want to do what the 20S THE FRANKLIN COVER UP older people are doing and they are praised for that And that becomes their goal to be like the adults There is a little part in them that natural good God given part which knows that it is wrong But in a group and in the excitement of everything they want to do that They enjoy the sex Children are capable of enjoying the sex I didn t know that Well why would they fight against it A child will eat a bag of candy if you give it to them They will take part in these things willingly When they get out and begin to talk it is very difficult for them to realize we didn t realize it at first that they actually wanted to do it They are told they will never get out no one will ever believe them that there is no freedom that the law will get you they are hopeless before they get someone willing to listen They are threatened with death Every time a child is killed in their group they are told If you tell this will happen to you They have every reason to believe that So even when they are into the foster care system and with another family and begin to feel somewhat safe they still expect these people to show up on the doorstep They believe that

talked and they told about sexual abuse at one point and were very grieved We talked about good and bad touching and we thought we really had gotten to the bottom of it and then that afternoon the little one began to cry and when we couldn t get the answer from him the older brother said He is probably crying because he was in the room when they killed his friend That was the first one we know about And as they described that they talked about that particular victim being brought into a room hands and arms tied mouth taped and how there had been x s marked on his body on his vital organs That was bad enough Within a very few weeks we learned that it was not the adults who had killed that child It was this oldest boy who was talking The next person that we talked to was a little boy who was very borderline mentally He had language problems it was very hard for him to explain himself And when he began to come out of it everyone was startled the way he talked We were real sure we knew he had not been around these other children and heard anything but we began to 207 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP question ourselves Are we asking strange questions Is there something odd about us which makes children come and dump these things on us The part which made me believe this child s story he talked about different babies being killed but this particular one being stabbed he curled up in a fetal position he was 9 years old when he was telling the story He curled up in a fetal position and his eyes got real glazed and he said They cooked that baby on the grill And I thought he has really

and the types of killings this little girl is II today she was 9 when she first talked It was a very painful thing when she first started to share the sex things The sex things are so harmful to the children and they are so embarrassed and it is so personal to the children and they know that they enjoyed that They know that We had been through all that She began to draw pic tures of cats and the cats all had tails that were on the other side of the page or their leg was someplace else As we began to work with her and talk she said that she had had to kill a pregnant cat She first said that they had killed a pregnant cat We said how did you know it was pregnant Well she could not explain that but as we got into it she confessed that she had had to kill the cat And I asked her 208

knife I put it in her bottom and twisted it Now you tell me does a kid know that If I ask a kid how do you kill a cat do you think they will say that Those are the kinds of details these children tell us Later and they eventually cut the cat open and that was how they knew the cat was pregnant And they eat parts of the cat and the feces and the blood And again this was just the beginning It progressed and the next time she had to kill a baby the same way put the knife in the bottom and twist The baby was alive and he was screaming And that child hears that to this day and has nightmares and flashbacks And they cut the baby open and they ate the baby They do this so there are no bodies left and they bum what is left and grind up the bones And she talked about that pouring gasoline on the bodies and burning them in the back yard And I used to think that was nuts but I have heard it enough times now that I know it must be so We know there are mortuaries involved to cremate the bodies and that makes sense The most horrible story about fire that I have to tell and this is extremely extremely disturbing it was a little girl she was a teenager when she was telling me And she was describing a bam where they used to go to have their meet ings and they used to gather outside the bam and there would be chanting And then as they went inside the bam they would be split into different groups And she was never with any of her family they all went to different places And I asked her where she had to go and she said I was always in the burning room And as she went on to describe the burning room I thought how she came out of this with any sanity at all I don t know She was a very small child They would take in children probably pre schoolers and they would hang them from the rafters in this bam and there would be as many as five or ten hung in a row They would be fully clothed which is unusual because frequently they are naked The children like this girl were all given candles And you can picture the ceremony as she described it And the candles were lit Then the adults would go forward and would pour liquid from a cup on each of the children s clothing which

and set the children on fire When they were done they would cut them down The first child that this girl had to kill was a cousin a little cousin What does that do to you But you couldn t object because the children that objected were killed Frequently she said people would come in families not knowing that their child would be sacrificed and she described the screams when they realized that their child had been killed This child about two years ago just fell to the ground at Christmas time everyone thinks that Christmas is such a wonderful time And she confessed that she hated Christmas she couldn t wait until everything was put away because all she could hear was babies crying Christmas is the time when the most babies die And she covered her ears and cried for hours and screamed Stop it stop it stop it Talk to God and make him stop it All she could hear is the screams and the babies crying Christmas for the children I have talked to has been one of the worst times I have had three children tell me about a very similar ceremony and I will kind of merge that and tell you how it went They were taken to a church and all the children it is a very festive occasion and they are taken to the front of the church and a small child is now brought in two of them talked about babies and they put them on a platform The adults are all celebrating and dancing and singing and the children are getting into the spirit of it and what they are doing is forming a circle around the child and of course the child represents the child Jesus and they begin mocking and spitting and calling names and then they encourage the children to begin doing it and you can imagine how it gets out of control And at some point they hand all of the children knives and then they are all hacking and slashing until the baby is dead and then they all celebrate because the child Jesus is dead Kathleen Sorenson was aware that it was dangerous to tell the public what she did She appealed to

contract suicide The other driver didn t die but well could have in satanic lore a person who loses his life in such a contract murder suicide will be reincarnated with more power granted by Satan Kathleen was driving on a long narrow stretch of road between Fremont Nebraska and her home in Blair At least several people knew the road she would be on and at what time A car was traveling in front of her which was possibly the spotter car used in such a situation Another car coming from the opposite direction crossed the center line and rammed into Kathleen s car killing her Both the young woman driver and her husband had prior arrest records for cruelty to animals a common marker for satanism Not long after Sorenson s death a teenager in a youth care facility told a worker You better watch out or we will get you like we got that lady from Blair The youth went on to describe a ceremony of drawing lots for the privilege One of the most potent weapons of the satanists is the inability of the average person to comprehend such hideous events as described by Kathleen Sorenson A few years ago if anyone had recounted something like her testimony to me I would have recommended that they be hauled off to the loony farm Today I have no doubt that much maybe all of it is true I have been confronted with documentation of a world I did not know about or believe existed I understand why normal people reading Kathleen Soren son s words will have what psychiatrists call a denial syn drome Dr Densen Gerber addressed this phenomenon when she testified before the Senate

the automatic denial that goes along with this kind of material The first human defense mechanism against untenable horrific facts is to say that they don t exist Dr Densen Gerber testified that a particular satanic ritual in which a two year old child was placed in the cavity created by a Caesarean section delivery of a baby was so horrible that she herself refused to understand what some of her patients were telling her I ve been in this field for an awfully long time I should have realized that s what these three patients were telling me It was so horrific for me to contemplate Taking a two year old child and placing it in an open uterus in a dying woman To have this child covered with blood I used denial myself after all these years This has occurred accord ing to Sorenson in Nebraska and now she s dead And the same thing that is described this ceremony was described by Bonacci as occurring in Nebraska She reviewed her prison interview with Paul Bonacci con ducted the previous day 1 He has an extraordinary memory for detail making him an invaluable witness 2 He does not lie 3 He has precisely described satanic rituals used by interna tional cults which it were impossible for him to have known unless he participated in them Oh he calls one personality a computer chip in his head He keeps it together by this meticulous obsessive attention to detail So that he can give you times and dates that I have never seen in any other child abuse case I have never seen a child who could do this kind of thing So that he is an unusual witness He doesn t fabricate he ll say I don t know if he doesn t know And then you have what I think that you may have here You have an internationally connected cult In which persons move from one place to another and have very set

two year old had sex with his mother The mother was a believer he states that she was not tied down though she was drugged and a lot of them had drugs The baby was removed and the blood drained the chalice passed the high priest urinated in the chalice in the blood Because part of the way of the reverse Christian belief is to take the blood and defile it But only the high priest may do it And he knew it The baby was dismembered The next thing that he said is that the child would not stop crying and so they eliminated that child as well And ate the flesh And the mother died and she was also eaten by the cult And I said well what happened to the bones and teeth And he said that they were ground in a machine Which is one of the ways that they do do it He described it extremely well Occasionally you have to ask a question in a matter of fact way So instead of saying was there anything done with any body part that was unusual I said Who ate the eyes Because part of this ritual is the eating of the eyes And because the concept is that when you eat the eyes of the fetus or the new born you gain sight that s a Celtic Druid ritual which has been taken by these individuals And without a change in voice or anything else he said Malachi ate the eyes And I said but you were supposed to eat the eyes as the third ranking member in the cult And he said I was out of favor and was not permitted to eat the eyes But I have to tell you the detail that he knew about how the rituals are conducted have convinced me he has been at ritual events There is no other way that this child could know 213 CHAPTER 16 FOUR FIGHTERS WHO DIDN T QUIT Freeing America from the influence of those who protect and engage in official corruption from drug dealing to pedophilia from abuse of public

one body I would have thought they had been reading too much science fiction or living with Alice in Wonderland Then the Douglas County Grand Jury indictment of Paul Bo nacci brought me deeper into the Franklin case and the suffer ing of its victims Paul Bonacci called me shortly after he was indicted and I agreed to visit him in the jail where he was incarcerated for touching another boy on the outside of his pants Meeting with Paul I have spoken to several of his personali ties Three psychiatrists who have examined him concurred in the diagnosis of Multiple Personality Disorder brought on by 214 FOUR FIGHTERS WHO DIDN T QUIT horrible traumatic abuse when he was a child My first act with respect to representing Paul Bonacci was to have him write down everything he could remember about individuals who had abused him from his earliest boyhood An excerpt from what he wrote appears in Chapter 10 In that document and in Paul s letters his handwriting will vary depending on which personality is in control Bonacci was sentenced to five years in prison in 1989 for molesting a young boy for whom he was baby sitting Appar ently one of Paul s homosexual personalities was in control of him during the incident in which he briefly put his hand on the outside of the young boy s pants an activity stopped when a remorse stricken Paul reasserted control Despite testimony from family friends and church members that this was out of character and despite its being a first offense the Omaha court threw the book at Paul This was before Gary Caradori first interviewed Paul but the

meeting with the Ministerial Alliance in Omaha he said he felt personally responsible for the death of the man he hired to investigate the Franklin Credit Union case Schmit has a longstanding

pedophile ring After Caradori was killed and the Franklin committee no longer had a profes sional investigator Schmit remarked Gary had this remark able knack of just putting on his casual clothes and going out to places where people had information and just sitting down with them and gaining their trust That s how he brought in all these facts in the investigation I know I can t do it like Gary did but when I hear that someone has information for us I just put on myoid clothes and go wherever I need to go and sit down with them and try to get that information myself Gary would have done it much better but I try This senator who often starts speeches by saying Well I m just a farmer but here s what I think is a plain spoken man The image before him of setting the pace for the people of his state and of keeping the faith with his martyred investiga tor has proven Loran Schmit to be a man of courage He has withstood threats and harassment At the height of the Franklin committee

down and the lawsuit dismissed Mary Caradori has commented that there were no such slanders of her son while he was alive She calls him a gentle smiling man a great man and the greatest investigator Nebraska has ever had The man the World Herald now smears as a Keystone Kop she notes was the youngest person ever to qualify as an investigator for the State Patrol He was univer sally liked and

wanted to ring down the curtain on the Franklin case once and for all They and federal authori ties moved to tidy up matters that were left hanging Larry King is in prison but not for child abuse Under a plea bargain arrangement finalized with federal prosecutors on June 17 1991 King is serving a IS year sentence for embezzle ment conspiracy and making false financial record entries Since the Douglas County grand jury deferred to the federal authorities and since there was no trial of King on the federal embezzlement or any other charges the evidence ofchildprosti tution and abuse perpetrated by King was never presented in any court Jarrett Webb did not stand trial In a calculated display of concern the Douglas County grand jury recommended in May 1990 that Webb be indicted by Washington County prosecutors for third degree sexual assault of a minor Nelly Patterson On December 26 1990 however Washington County Judge David Quist dismissed the charges against Webb ruling that the statute of limitations had run out on acts committed in 1985 In Nebraska cases of abuse of children under sixteen years of age are supposed to receive an automatic extension of the statute But although Nelly had reported abuse that began when she was nine years old the judge ruled that the assaults in question were not prosecutable because they occurred two days after the girl s sixteenth birthday 224 SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT Alisha Owen was convicted of lying when she said she was sexually used by Robert Wadman I will allow the articles and statements of others to deal with this since I have at Alisha s request now agreed to represent her free of charge I do not want to say anything here that would jeopardize Alisha or my ability to help her But I can say that Alisha

after Owen s conviction Prosecutor Gerald Moran dropped the Douglas County perjury charges against Paul Bo nacci He also obtained a court order that barred me from gaining access to other files that would have been used in Paul s trial Speaking as Paul s attorney I charged They dropped the charges so that the truth would never come out For months motion after motion to deposition those Bonacci accused was denied by Judge Patrick Mullen Now Moran stipulated that any such depositions and discovery were perma nently ruled out I had seen it coming As we moved closer to the commence ment of Paul Bonacci s perjury trial I said many times to all who would listen I guarantee you that Paul Bonacci will never go to trial They will either kill him or dismiss the charges We are ready for trial When we have the trial the entire picture of crime drug dealing pedophilia and child abuse and even this satanic cult activity will come out with all the personalities associated with it They dare not bring this boy to trial Or if they are going to bring him to trial they will have to get rid of me first and get someone in there handling the trial whom they control For over a year after the initial flurry of coverage in 1989 the national news media avoided the Franklin case On June 225 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP 19 1991 two days before the jury convicted Alisha Owen CBS TV featured Nebraska on its prime time show 48 Hours The program ostensibly on the impact of child abuse in various communities stated its conclusion on the Franklin case at the outset Some communities have over reacted and ac

the judge expressly ordered the jurors not to watch the program a good number of them did and several reported that it was the main topic of discussion in the jury room the next morning In articles on

Franklin case remains alive not only in Omaha but in its nationwide and international scope Karen Ormiston Caradori s coworker reviewed the case in September 1990 In her notes on a September 22 1990 conversation with Alisha Owen s lawyer Henry Rosenthal Ormiston recorded I did indicate to Henry that these kids were only a small part of this case and that the bulk and real intent of this case was to determine why OPD FBI and the NSP had insisted that they had thoroughly investigated these allega tions and concluded that there was no merit to these allega tions I also indicated that the end result of this case should be to determine where the monies earned from kiddie porn child prostitution and drug activity were going to Failure of the various law enforcement agencies to follow up on 227 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP these allegations which they had received from several years back was also discussed Again I stated that the statements of the kids was sic very important but these kids were but a small part of the frightening reality and extent of the bigger picture of this case Three days later Ormiston wrote to Senator Schmit in the same vein Gary and I have always maintained that these kids were not the case they were only a small part of it For instance where does all the money go that is earned by child prostitu tion and kiddie porn and what is it used for Why is the FBI and or others trying so desperately to cover all this up We both know that if thesepeople werejust ordinarycitizens that they would certainly be in prison right now based on the incredible amount of

Bonacci at length as did private investigator Roy Stephens in preparation for the perjury trial that was not to be Through his many personalities each with its own distinct partial recollections Bonacci provided new evidence on child kidnaping pornography and murder taking place in the United States and abroad The Franklin case was just one part of what 228 SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT

David Thorstadt Two of Bonacci s personalities Sean and Christopher have Thors tadt as their last name Bonacci reports that he was brought into contact with Thorstadt through two Omaha men that he traveled with Thorstadt to New York and that he witnessed NAMBLA organized auctions of children Alexandrew another Bonacci personality wrote to Dr Densen Gerber who had examined him in prison in April 1991 I can even recall when and where I remember you from Tell me if I m wrong in which I know you wouldn t remem ber me It was in New York on December I believe the 28th or 29th 1982 it was a Tuesday or Wednesday not important It was a news conference at I believe the Holiday Inn I had to wait for David Thorstadt with a friend When he got done he told me that wicked old witch Gerber was someone he had to fix somehow Densen Gerber dubbed public enemy 1 by NAMBLA for her efforts to expose the organization commented He s absolutely right The details are perfect Bonacci may remember events in

UP delivery route as usual Only that Sunday he never came home For nine years his parents have searched the country for him Most evenings and weekends when they were not on the road to check out leads they sold candy bars in local shopping centers to finance the search In late 1990 the Gosches got the first major break in years because of what Paul Bonacci had to tell I had noted that one of the events Paul described reminded me of the case of Johnny Gosch which I had read about years earlier I went to the library and confirmed the similarity of the details of the case with what Paul said I then contacted the Gosch family They advised me that they had had their fill of false leads from people who claimed to know something about their missing boy and people who claimed to have infor mation for sale but did not seem genuinely interested But a couple of weeks later Mr Gosch did come to Omaha The Des Moines Register of July 24 1991 reported on what developed A Nebraska inmate has provided details about the abduction of Johnny Gosch that only someone with firsthand knowl edge could have had his lawyer said Tuesday Inmate Paul Bonacci s account did not match up 90 percent not 95 percent not 98 percent but 100 percent John DeCamp said I am convinced this kid is telling absolutely the truth He never varied on the time He gave a description of Johnny s pants names on his shirt scars on the body DeCamp said he became suspicious of a Gosch connec tion when he read a transcript of a psychiatrist s interview with Bonacci in which an incident involving a newspaper carrier was mentioned DeCamp said Bonacci didn t identify Gosch by his full name I went to the library and checked on Johnny Gosch I wrote to the Gosches and told them I don t know if there is any validity but

walked into the prison in Lincoln Nebraska to meet Paul Bonacci for the first time unannounced Sitting down across from him Gosch asked Bonacci Do you know who I am Bonacci replied You look like it can t be the eyes you look like Johnny Gosch Noreen Gosch told the World Herald that paper reported on July 22 1991 that Bonacci knew some incredible things about the case For instance There were photographs taken of Johnny prior to the kidnaping We know this because a woman reported it to police We re convinced Bonacci saw those pictures He accurately described the location which is not far from our home He described many things about the pictures which we have never publicly talked about Bonacci also described a mark on Johnny Gosch s body which the Gosches had never publicized As a result of the Gosch meeting Roy Stephens came to visit with me Shortly after we discussed Paul Bonacci and the Gosch case I hired him to check out Bonacci s story on Gosch and on other things Roy Stephens is an Omaha based investigator and a founder of the Missing Children s Foundation A former safecracker who went straight Stephens was named Outstanding Man of the Year for 1991 by the Nebraska Jaycees for his work in recover ing children Roy is remembered in Nebraska as the man who did what the police and other investigators were unable to do locate and cause the conviction of the kidnaper of Jill Cutshall the Norfolk Nebraska girl who disappeared in 1987 and almost certainly was murdered though her body was never found Stephens was cited as the leading child finder in the nation in an article in the 1991 summer supplement to Forbes maga zine The best in the business in that field according to a survey of his peers is Roy Stephens who has recovered some 50 missing children over the last five and a half years said G Gordon Liddy of Watergate fame now a private security consultant in Florida Stephens spent hundreds of hours debriefing Bonacci in prison and many

I had said something and Emilio hit me a couple of times RS What did you say PB Called him a dirty bastard because of the way he treated Mike At night when we was in the hotel and stuff he d brought some other guy and made Mike have sex with that guy I didn t think that was right RS O K so you re in the trunk and Mike is on the floor or on the back seat covered with a blanket and what happened PB

there was more than one kid It sounded like there was a couple of them there And then we went around the block and he let me out of the trunk and told Mike to he says if you don t do what I say I m gonna shoot you He has a gun he pulled out and pointed at me and says you do what I say or I ll shoot you We drove around 232 SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT RS So you re out of the trunk now PB

the next thing I know there was somebody you know he grabbed the boy and he d thrown him in and my job you know we were supposed to do is just hold him down and gag his mouth so he couldn t yell or nothing And then after we had just like two seconds just spun off tore off got out of there Two other people were involved in the kidnaping one of whom was a local contact Bonacci named them all According to a July 18 article in the Des Moines Register Stephens has told the family sources say that Bonacci identified the Des Moines contact from a photograph The suspected contact said Noreen Gosch has been under suspicion by the family for some time Furthermore Gosch said Stephens told her the same ring may be involved in other kidnapings in the region including the suspected abuction of Des Moines Register carrier Eugene Martin 13 in south Des Moines in 1984 and more recently that of Jacob Wetterling in St Joseph Minn Bonacci described a network of safehouses where the pedo phile ring stored kidnaped children before selling them He said he met Johnny Gosch again several years later and provided a detailed description of the farm on which Gosch was being kept in Colorado and of Gosch s new parents a homosexual man and a lesbian in their thirties After Gosch once attempted to run away Bonacci reported they branded him on the buttocks with the same brand used on horses and

were sold I saw a few girls once in a while He said virgins could bring as much as 50 000 They called the boys toys used toys brought in money but not as much Most boys were sold out of America cause

acts The case involves the largest adult juvenile sex ring in Minnesota history authorities said reported the Minne apolis Star Tribune on November 18 1983 At least 30 children told police they had been molested Morris brought indictments against 24 adults People magazine of October 22 1984 summarized The village harbored rings of adult sex abusers who incestuously victimized their own children and other children during ritualistic sex parties involv ing sadism and bestiality Some of the children described a bizarre sexual variation of hide and seek in which children who were found were taken to a bedroom and abused The children told of witnessing three ritualistic murders Child care workers and psychologists found the children highly credible Psychologist Michael Shea who treated some of them told People Children are not able to fantasize in such graphic detail about sexual acts which are outside their experience And they certainly can t be coerced or bribed or brainwashed into making statements about their parents Minnesota psychologist Susan Phipps Yonas who also inter viewed some of the children told the Star Tribune that she fully believed their reports It s not just the details that make them convincing but the emotional effect behind the stories They re extraordinarily upset when they recount these things They d have to be world class actors to be so convincing if it wasn t true Phipps Yonas speculated that since the children talked about large sums of money changing hands organized crime was likely involved Morris indicted the ring s chief figure 26 year old James Rud on 108 counts of child abuse His parents Alvin and Rosemary Rud and his 17 year old brother were also indicted as were several other people from the Valley Green Trailer Park 35 miles outside of Minneapolis St Paul Most of the abused children also lived in the trailer park Like the Franklin investigators in Nebraska Morris came under savage attack from media and the political establishment 235 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP in her state Under pressure she ultimately turned the investiga tion over to state Attorney General Hubert Skip Humphrey Jr To the horror of many Humphrey soon

their 6 year old boy Tony who told the court that his father had sodomized him and his brothers Although the boy was confused over the meaning of the sexual terms when a defense attorney asked if he feared that his father would abuse him again the boy looked across the courtroom at Bentz and replied You won t do that no more right During the grueling cross examination defense attorneys succeeded in shaking some of the young witnesses stories by hammering away at dates places and word meanings However a 12 year old girl steadfastly refused to waver from her testimony When a defense attorney accused her of lying she snapped You re just helping Bob and Lois Bentz to get out of this stuff this child abusing stuff I m not lying you guys are It s the truth they hurt us Later she rushed tearfully into the arms of a social worker Though the Bentzes got off in the Scott County case James Rud plea bargained Before the case was scratched he pleaded guilty to lesser charges In 1978 and 1980 Rud had been convicted of sexually abusing children in Virginia and Minne sota respectively On other occasions Bonacci described ritualistic abuse and the sacrifice of a boy at a place near

available could make it easier for Larry King to entice prominent people after they got drunk and then high on the drug into sex with a teenaged girl or boy According to the accounts of Paul Bonacci

Chambers observed to the Executive Board of the Legislature on December 19 1988 just as the Franklin investigation was getting underway My community is ravaged by drugs We see the Omaha police picking up kids from 14 to l8 years old with a half an ounce or less of these narcotic substances and that is supposed to be fighting the drugs These are nickel and dime pushers not suppliers not mid level suppliers A few days ago the Douglas County Sheriff got together with some of the county sheriffs one was from Sarpy and they made a raid and they got a pound and a half of heavy drugs some money and

ritual abuse of children was happening in Nebraska and that it was being protected from within the political and law enforcement estab lishment a resistance movement on behalf of the children took shape In her famous interview on Geraldo Rivera s TV special on satanism Kathleen Sorenson identified her group as Believe the Children Later friends of Kathleen were active in the Concerned Parents group which urged that the testimony of Loretta Smith and others be investigated on its merits instead of dismissed out of hand Against the shroud of cover up imposed by the World Herald in its

say that the FBI did not wish to become involved in a futile public debate with them EIR or anyone who may choose to support their efforts It was my view that the Franklin cover up was so massive in Nebraska that it could not be broken just inside the state In 1991 the case did receive attention in the Italian weekly Avvenimenti and in Pronto published in Spain Both articles came from Italian journalists Giovanni Caporaso and Massimi liano Cocozza Lubisco a team that has produced many stories for Italian television After their own May 1991 investigative trip to Nebraska they wrote about

1991 the Nebraska State Parole Board voted 5 0 to parole Paul Bonacci who has been serving a five year sentence since 1989 On Hallowe en soon after a scathing World Herald editorial against the decision the board reversed itself As Bonacci s attorney I responded with the following press release From beginning to present Franklin has been a cauldron of cover up skillfully executed by powerful and wealthy thieves and pedophiles Punishment destruction and even elimina tion of those who would expose or try to correct the evil wrought by these individuals is the reward of child victim witnesses and any who would aid those children The perpetrators have corrupted institutions of govern ment Abetted and at times absolutely led by the Omaha 244 SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT World Herald they have systematically turned lies into truth and truth into lies A free Paul Bonacci would continue to provide information which helps expose individuals and offenses involved in this cover up So one way or another they intend to eliminate Paul Bonacci no matter what it takes That is my very real fear Therefore the World Herald intimidated an already frightened and beleaguered parole board into effectively re versing their original proper decision to allow this youth out of prison If there is a God above the Franklin cover up will fail and the evil and individuals involved will be exposed Meanwhile the visible payoff to the Parole Board will be a glowing editorial in the Omaha World Herald Right on schedule the World Herald came out on November 3 1991 with an editorial Vote on Bonacci Was Sensible Flaunting its clout more blatantly than ever the paper took credit for the reversal attributing it to lobbying by the press and others I have often said that I wish I had never

asked Are you sure you are not falling into a trap overreacting to rumors I don t know answered Mary Kay Evans a former cam paign chairman of mine As you know I am close to one of the University of Nebraska Board of Regents members Dr Robert Prokop He called me and said he did not particularly like you or really ever get to know you but that he felt he had an obligation morally to warn you I knew of Dr Prokop Everybody in Nebraska did Prokop had been chairman of the Board of Regents for many years He had been a Democratic candidate for Governor of Nebraska just recently And he was somewhat famous as a police pathologist not only in Nebraska but for many cities in the United States What did Prokop say I asked that has you so con cerned He simply told me he was with the police riding around talking to individuals on the street which he does once a month he said and he learned that you were supposed to be the target of an assassination because of your Franklin involvement and trying to force the investigation there And he said that if I cared about you that I should call you so that at least his conscience would be clear The next day I called Dr Robert Prokop I told

John DeCamp were supposed to be the first hit instead of Gary Caradori In other words Mr DeCamp you were supposed to 246 SO THE TRUTH WOULD NEVER COME OUT be eliminated first and then Gary Caradori if that was necessary Now that Caradori has been killed I was concerned that maybe they will go ahead with the next hit which means you Are you serious I asked Do you really think there is even a remote possibility that could happen I have no doubt it could happen Prokop said I have been doing police work and autopsies for almost as long as you have been around And I think I know the difference between conversation and serious talk That s why I felt I had to warn you even if it is not my area of responsibility After warning me by phone Prokop took it upon himself to make three separate trips to Lincoln from Omaha to meet with the legislative Franklin committee and try to warn them of the seriousness of this threat So am I crazy to be concerned Is Prokop crazy Maybe so But there have been too many surprises for people closely involved in Franklin who ended up dead I was prepared to take Bill Colby s warning seriously when he sat me down and warned me that Franklin would never be dealt with without exposure in the national and international press What is Franklin really all about Was it theft by a black politician of forty million dollars Is it child abuse Is it just a big

businessmen and politicians What I am going to offer now are my conclusions my beliefs based on the massive information I have seen and heard since Franklin broke in November 1988 First I have absolutely no doubt that prominent individuals whom everybody in Omaha is familiar with and many of whom have been named during the investigation have engaged in long term activity involving drug peddling and drug abuse child abuse and pedophilia with particular attention to the abuse of young boys That in the case of Larry King and the cadre of people he dealt with closely boys and girls like

based on what I have seen much of which I am legally forbidden to reveal I have no doubt that child abuse pedophilia illegal drug trafficking murder satanic cult activity theft and a host of other crimes were involved in what we have come to know as the Franklin scandal Just as surely do I believe that there was and is a cover up Just as surely do I fear that nothing will be done about it So

251 APPENDIX B BOBBY AND ME It is impossible to understand the Franklin scandal and its cover up without knowing the environment created in Nebraska when Robert Kerrey was governor 1983 to 1987 It was an atmosphere of permissiveness for the rich and powerful to do mostly as they pleased Some of what follows I probably should have said some time ago Now the prospect of Bobby Kerrey holding the highest office in the land means that I who am knowledgeable about Kerrey in a way that probably no one but the closest of his cronies is have no choice but to speak out I could say much more but I think the following episodes in addition to what I have said in Chapter 6 are enough to shed important light on Bobby s character I have always called him Bobby or Roberto Bobby has always called me

the United States Bobby had been aNavy lieutenant on special duty in Vietnam with the SEALS I had been an Army infantry captain in the 252 APPENDIX B BOBBY AND ME south in the Mekong Delta on special assignment to John Paul Vann and a program called CORDS which was run by then Deputy Ambassador to Vietnam William E Colby Colby would later become head of the Central Intelligence Agency under Presidents Nixon and Ford I functioned as an infiltrator and analyst for CORDS which in fact was more CIA than anything Officially CORDS was the pacification program But that s another story In the early 1970s I was aware of Bobby because of his war protest activities and his Medal of Honor He was aware of me because of my high profile and controversial activities as a state senator One of the first things I did in Nebraska following my return from Vietnam was to sponsor a legislative resolution which some viewed as a war protest but which in reality was an attempt to open dialogue on the Vietnam War issue and to educate the politicians in the United States as to what was really occurring in Vietnam The essence of my plea in the legislative resolution was this Let us win or get us out of this war Do not keep us in the position of not being allowed to win and not being allowed to lose swinging in the wind For the first time in its lOO yearhistory the Nebraska Legis lature voted not to allow any discussion on a resolution It also forbade any hearing on the resolution to be held within the walls of the Nebraska State Capitol This was how volatile this issue was back in 1971 and how adamant the elected officials in Nebraska were against anybody daring to question the propri ety or value of the Vietnam War I was hurt and discouraged by this action and what I viewed as the stupidity of the Legislature in refusing to want to learn about the issue As I sat at my Senate desk licking my wounds after the vote to ban any hearing on the topic Lincoln Star reporter Don Walton

the Vietnam War they might even learn to understand why there are war protests Don Walton bent over my desk and whispered in my ear so no one standing around would hear The way I read that resolution the Legislature just passed Don said was that they were not allowing any discussion on your resolution to occur inside the walls of the State Capitol I did not see anything in that resolution that said you could not hold a hearing outside the Capitol on the front steps Don smiled I perked up In a flash I knew what he meant Defy the Legislature Hold a hearing of our own right on the steps of the Capitol Invite one and all to come and partici pate Have any senators attend who wanted to Let the others chicken out if they wanted but make sure everyone got counted And that is exactly what I did I announced the hearing would take place on the north steps of the Nebraska State Capitol The press did the rest On the day of the hearing the Capitol steps were barren of people except for more law officers undercover police FBI agents and CIA operatives than had ever been assembled in Nebraska at one time The only senators who dared to come sit on the steps of the Capitol to participate in the hearing and listen to testimony were Senator Terry Carpenter the firebrand from Scottsbluff who had gained national attention by nominat ing a non existent Joe Smith for President at the Republican National Convention years ago to mock the nomination process at conventions Senator Ernie Chambers who has gained state national and international attention for his unwavering defense of the rights of African Americans Senator Pol Morgan now Mayor Morgan of Omaha Senator Wally Barnett who later became Nebraska State Fire Marshall and myself Senator John DeCamp As we five sat there at our make shift

enough to show up for the hearing And I was going to be the biggest fool of all Then we heard a distant rumble Slowly it grew louder As we looked north from the Capitol steps we could see the street filled by a mass of human beings moving straight toward us It was the most moving sight of my life There they were several thousand people marching on the Capitol covering the street for blocks behind the leaders Men in wheel chairs who had lost limbs or worse in Vietnam combat veterans who came back shattered in spirit or mind who had been cynical about everything but afraid to express it students from the University of Nebraska by the thousands and businessmen and housewives by the hundreds In the front leading the parade was a young war hero named Bob Kerrey The event turned out to be the largest hearing ever held by the Legislature up to that time As ideas were shared those who supported the war and those who opposed it including many on both sides of the issue who had fought in it came together for the first time and communicated It was awesome Part way through the hearing a group of Vietnam War veterans moved up to the podium and began depositing medals they had earned for acts of heroism This was their way of repudiating the war and for them it was a catharsis Years later there were rumors that Bob Kerrey was one of those who deposited a medal in the coffin some of the vets brought to the hearing to put the medals in Kerrey has always denied this In 1982 when Bobby was running for governor his partici pation in the event became an issue with potentially damaging political consequences At that time I discussed the matter with Bobby as he sought to minimize the damage his opponent Governor Charles Thone was doing to him for having attended and thrown away his medal 2SS THE FRANKLIN COVER UP I remember Bobby s pleading discussion with me in my office at the Capitol as the issue heated up I had publicly admired and praised him for his participation because

his brother at the time of the hearing so he could not have been there I was dumbfounded But as Bobby grew more insistent that he had not been there I started to become confused about the matter myself I complied with his request taking his word and publicly said that I must have been mistaken to say that Bobby attended the hearing Recently I decided to see what records there were of that special hearing twenty years ago where Bobby now said he was not present In the files of the Lincoln Journal I found a May 6 1971 article which identified Congressional Medal of Honor winner Bob Kerrey as one of the main speakers at the rally The article said A Nebraska native and Vietnam Congressional Medal of Honor winner Robert Kerrey in a prepared statement said that the Viet Cong or North Vietnam ese troops are angelic compared with the ruthless Americans I checked the files of the World Herald They also report Bobby as a speaker at the hearing Two days after the event Bobby wrote a letter to the Journal in which he said that what he meant was that the evidence of atrocities in Vietnam is sufficient to support an argument against all wars Over the next several years we had little contact Bobby entered the restaurant business and with a little help from a law I helped amend that let an individual obtain more liquor licenses than were allowed until then began to do quite well He became a significant personality in Lincoln the state capital Meanwhile I was having more legislative success than I had dreamed possible It is quite something to look back at the

gubernatorial race I was there when the state s leading powerbrokers anointed Bobby as the next governor in fact it was I who suggested they anoint him That is a fascinating story but let me first give a little necessary back ground Starting in the mid 1970s a debate over the structure of Nebraska s banking industry emerged as the issue which would dominate state politics for a decade Officially dubbed Multi Bank the issue was a turf battle of monumental proportions over who was going to own the banks in Nebraska and what competition was going to be allowed in the purchase of exist ing banks On one side were the Independents who advocated owner ship of banks by individuals The Independents were very strong in Nebraska as in many rural states On a per capita basis as I recall we probably had more banks than almost any other state in the United States On the opposing side were the Big Banks particularly those based in Omaha the state s largest city Nebraska law forbade holding companies which could own many banks If holding companies were allowed the big banks would naturally start buying up a lot of small banks Multi Bank That was the issue In 1976 I won the chairmanship of the Senate Banking Committee which controlled banking finance and insurance in Nebraska That is I thought I won it I know today that I 257 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP was merely the bright young legislator selected by powerful men in business and politics to aid their efforts to change the banking structure in Nebraska I believed at the time that the banking structure changes I was proposing which would allow the big banks to get bigger were good for Nebraska I thought they were necessary as well as probably inevitable It was this battle over bank structure that next brought Bobby and me together In 1978 the banking forces I supported determined that we had likely assembled enough senators in the recent election to pass the Multi Bank structural changes But we had to be sure that if we passed the legislation we could get it signed by the governor A veto would be fatal It was possible to get", "chunk_id": "ai_corpus_slimmer_clean_filtered:franklin-cover-up.txt:236:20fa3d6fd5e3",

that if we passed the legislation we could get it signed by the governor A veto would be fatal It was possible to get a majority of votes to pass the legislation but electing enough senators to override a governor s veto might take two or three elections or forever It would be much faster and cheaper the big boys concluded to control the governor Accordingly at a very private meeting between a Nebraska congressman named Charles Thone the state s then premiere lobbyist Jim Ryan Omaha National Bank President and CEO John Woods Omaha National Vice President Don Adams and myself certain agreements were reached The meeting was held at John Woods personal residence in Fair Acres Omaha in a quiet servants quarters outside the main house The understanding was clear that we would work to make Charles Thone governor And Charles Thone who said he strongly believed in our Multi Bank bill gave his iron clad pledge that he would sign it just as soon as we could put it on my desk But the best laid plans of mice and men go oft awry and that is what happened with the new governor Charles Thone Charlie liked being governor Charlie was cautious Charlie did not want to do anything that made anybody unhappy The last thing Charlie needed after being in office for a couple of years was to have a controversial issue on which he had to play King Solomon which would make one or another powerful group hate him no matter what he did 258 APPENDIX B BOBBY AND ME Multi Bank was exactly that The two contending groups of banks financed almost all major political races in Nebraska on both sides for almost a decade Politicians would pledge their support to either the Independents or to the Big Banks led by Omaha National later to merge with First National of Lincoln to become FirsTier as the first step toward running for public office particularly for the Legislature Some politicians came to believe that they would never really have to cast a vote on the issue because there would never be enough votes to get the bill passed Therefore they could promise to support Multi Bank without having to worry about a final vote or signature on the bill Charles Thone was apparently one of those As long as the bill never reached his desk he could promise till the cows came home that he would sign the bill but he would never be held accountable But on a", "chunk_id":

happened in the Legislature that nobody dreamed possible It had never hap pened in the first one hundred years of Nebraska history There was a tie vote 24 to 24 Nebraska s unicameral Legislature has 49 Senators but on this day Senator Ernie Chambers decided to sit on his hands rather than vote for what he regarded as one bunch of evil doers against another Then in an act of dubious legality Lieutenant Governor Roland Luedtke cast the deciding ballot in favor of the Big Banks Never before had a lieutenant governor voted on anything Governor Charles Thone was in a dilemma If he signed the bill he incurred the wrath of the powerful independent bankers If he did not he betrayed the promise he had made to John Woods and the Omaha business community who were intent on this piece of legislation Charlie did the smart thing He left town and criticized Luedtke for having improperly voted for the bill Luedtke re sponded by putting on the hat of Acting Governor and signed the bill into law The story did not end there On instructions from Attorney General Paul Douglas who favored the independent bankers the newly passed law was not entered into the statutes It was as if it had never passed 259 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP Inthe next year s legislative session the Big Bank forces came back with guns blazing Led by me on the floor ofthe Legislature and in the Banking Committee we marched the legislation slowly but surely through three legislative votes and to a final showdown with Governor Thone We had a bare majority but nowhere near enough votes to override a governor s veto On a spring day as Charlie was dreaming of an easy reelec tion as the newspapers were saying that he was unbeatable being a Republican governor in a Republican state who had done nothing really right or really wrong we laid the newly passed legislation on Charlie s desk John Woods sent clear messages to Charlie Thone that he was expected to live up to his promise to sign the legislation But the

where 3 As Charlie we and everybody else knew it would almost certainly be defeated because the voting public was inclined to support the Independents Charlie would be done for Charlie got the message He vetoed the bill With that veto Charlie s political doom was sealed and the door was opened for Bob Kerrey to be the next Governor of Nebraska Until then Bobby was still frying hamburgers at his restaurant and was no closer to the governorship to Debra Winger or to Hollywood than the local movie theater John Woods was adamant So was super lobbyist Jim Ryan Charlie Thone must be eliminated It was time to come up with other candidates To my suggestion that they seriously consider supporting me for Governor the answer was unanimous I was too contro versial I had too much political baggage I would not like being governor I was too effective as a legislator and besides as everybody knows except for signing bills the Governor of Nebraska is not as powerful as independent legislators 260 APPENDIX B BOBBY AND ME What they said was probably true They wanted me as their power broker in the Legislature I suggested we get behind a young man named Bob Kerrey For a couple of years there had been talk about Bobby I had even dreamed as I told Bobby many times of running for Governor with Bobby as Lieutenant Governor I knew others were encouraging Bobby too From that meeting on it was a done deal Jimmy Ryan and Omaha National Bank Vice President Don Adams were assigned the task of meeting with Bobby privately to sort out whether he would support Multi Bank legislation Bob Kerrey filed as a candidate A lot of people found it remarkable that Democrat Bob Kerrey had the heavy support of the normally totally Republican Big Bank establishment In November 1982 Kerrey became

with you in the years ahead will be one of the most rewarding experi ences of my life Best wishes signed Robert Kerrey Following her rule that a man s word is his bond Bernice rolled out the political machine of the pro life movement in favor of Bobby and away from Charlie Thone But in 1991 when Senator Bob Kerrey decided to run for 262 APPENDIX B BOBBY AND ME President of the United States the political winds had changed Polls showed that only a candidate who would have the support of the pro choice movement stood a chance to beat George Bush Bobby s first substantive act in his presidential campaign was to repeat a pattern I had seen during the years I worked with him He repudiated everything he had previously said on the subject of abortion acknowledged that he had been essentially fibbing in his pro life statements and admitted that he had given the previous false commitments purely for the purpose of getting elected Campaigning in New Hampshire Kerrey was quoted in the October 17 1991 World Herald regarding his letter to Senator Labedz It was a political act yeah and an act about which I feel very little pride The whole issue of not just abortion but many of the other emotional issues in 1982 were extremely difficult I didn t know what public policy was for certain should be for certain and as a result I was all over the map The Multi Bank legislation was not Governor Robert Ker rey s only foray into state banking law In 1983 84 the state s banks were experiencing severe problems In the summer of 1984 Kerrey called a special legislative session to deal with these problems but specified that it would not deal with the most notorious of them Commonwealth whose collapse he himself had precipitated with his infamous press statement of October 31 1983 As the Legislature convened however Kerrey expanded the session to handle a completely new proposal of his own crafting which did bear on Commonwealth and State Security Kerrey s crony Bill Wright was

Kerrey s associates were secretly working would quietly take over Commonwealth and State Security in return for the interstate banking monopoly I had been sponsoring legislation to allow legitimate inter state banking but this was not legitimate It was clear to me that the reason for the Kerrey administration s approach to Commonwealth was to cover up a multitude of sins related to State Security owned by Kerrey s intimate Bill Wright I met with Bobby We talked intensely I made clear that I would support a competitive and reciprocal interstate banking proposal which I thought would help all Nebraskans not one that would be used to bail out individuals involved in what I felt was corruption I mentioned for the first time to him face to face the role of his friend and adviser Bill Wright When we ended our discussion I thought Bobby would abandon his idea and accept an interstate banking proposal along my lines A legitimate interstate bank bill however could not be used by Bobby and his friends for their personal purposes related to Commonwealth and State Security From that standpoint Kerrey directed by Bill Wright had to push through his peculiar form of interstate banking Led by his chief of staff W Don Nelson Kerrey lined up enough votes to bypass my Banking Committee and railroad his bill through the Legislature and onto his desk where he could sign it Or so he thought They had their votes lined up It required 25 of the 49 to pass the legislation Most senators knew less about the legisla tion than a sow knows about Sunday But by using the most traditional political methods carrot and stick the Kerrey ad minstration had gotten commitments from twenty six senators They were ready to roll Roll they did using the most powerful lobbyists and the heaviest

on that he thinks he has this incredible power I thought for a minute Bobby was riding as high as any governor ever had in Nebraska Movie star Debra Winger was now living in the mansion with him part time All Nebraska was in love with Bobby and Debby Camelot was here and Nebraskans were lapping it up There were pictures of Bobby fluffing up a pillow smiling and saying Just fluff up your pillow and dream about it his response when asked what it was like to date Debra Winger I knew the press was in love with Bobby and that anything I said had to be simple and not susceptible of distortion Bobby has to learn that there is more to being a governor than macho and movie stars I told the press Later when I returned to Lincoln from Dallas I learned from a close friend of mine and of Bobby a prominent lobbyist that immediately after the legislative vote in which I stopped his banking proposal Bobby stormed out of the Governor s office and down to the doors just outside the Legislature where he yelled out a threat I know you lobbyists worked for John DeCamp to stop me on this Well I promise you one thing DeCamp is dead meat Do you hear me DeCamp is dead meat I mean it When I was an infantry captain in Vietnam the phrase dead meat was well known It was what a soldier usually an enlisted man threatened an officer with just before fragging him Fragging was a live grenade tossed

be recommended for a Medal of Honor Recently disclosed records show that as the Pentagon attempted to popularize the war the word came down to create more heroes to recommend more wounded for medals Since there were more places to fill on the list Bobby s name suddenly popped onto the bottom of it This may be a crude way of putting things but since the Medal of Honor is being cited by the press as the apparent best evidence of Bobby s qualifications to be President it is legitimate to discuss it And I do not think Bobby would deny this In 1984 Bobby knew that this lobbyist would deliver the message that I was dead meat which he did It occurred to me that I might be dealing with an emotionally disturbed individual I had no doubts as to how important the legislation was to help bailout and cover up the State Security scandal in which Bobby and his friend Bill Wright were involved And I knew how detrimental such legislation would be to the rest of Nebraska s million and a half citizens A governor or legislator does not go completely nuts over a proposal the way Bobby did unless he has something personal at stake And I was well aware of what Bobby and his friends had hanging on their interstate banking plan The more I learned about State Security the extent of the thievery that had occurred there and the fact that the publicity about Commonwealth was being used as a smokescreen to protect State Security from a deeper probe the more at odds Bobby and I became As I kept the heat on with continual demands for an investiga tion of State Security Bill Wright left town When the press confronted Kerrey as to why Wright was gone an angry Kerrey snapped that Bill Wright was driven out of town by John DeCamp Finally the Legislature agreed to allow my Banking Com mittee to investigate

for reelection I was defeated for reelection to the Legislature Bobby and I sat down for a heart to heart talk I had not yet issued the committee report I had determined to wait until after the election so that it would not appear that I was using it as a campaign tool Bobby wanted to know what I was going to say about him in the report As far as I am concerned I told Bobby I have no reason to go after you You have already been hurt enough by having to drop out of the Governor s race I have no reason to pick on you because it was really Bill Wright who masterminded the State Security swindle though you obviously played a role in it I am not out to hurt you We both have been hurt enough and blamed enough As far as I was concerned Bill Wright was the key villain and that is what I said in the State Security report Perhaps I felt a bit sorry for myoid friend who left half his leg in Vietnam Two years later Bobby and I had occasion to get together again for some very serious

Party in Nebraska to trash Kerrey during his U S Senate race by making public everything Iknew abouthim Governor KayOrrherself appealed to me to speak out I refused not just once but again and again With hindsight I believe I should not have stayed silent Ultimately someone hired a writer named Jack Hart to go through the records of my legislative investigation and write a series of articles to

days in public life which were accentuated in the Commonwealth State Security affairs are being repeated now in the Franklin matter and have the possibility of being amplified onto the national level if Robert Kerrey became Pres ident What are those patterns 1 Abuse of public positions for one s own financial benefit This is an invariant of Kerrey s career from his first appearance in student politics at the University of Nebraska in 1964 65 where he was censured by the Student Council for pocketing profits from a Student Council program he was in charge of We saw the same thing again in Commonwealth State Security and the NIFA loan scam 2 Shifting political position 180 degrees with the prevailing winds When it was fashionable to be against the Vietnam War Kerrey led the parade When it became a political liability he chucked his opposition overboard and lied about it When he needed votes and he could get them by denouncing abortion he did so When he thought the best way to get votes was to be pro abortion he embraced that position In the lead up to the Gulf war Bobby was strongly against it When it was clear that the war was popular Bobby decided he had been uninformed before and switched his stance I saw this happen so many times I used to call him Flip flop Bobby to his face 3 Acting as a puppet of forces behind the scenes Bobby got his start in political life because John Woods and the Omaha business community anointed him to pass their Big Banks bill 269 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP While governor he danced to the tune called by them and by Bill Wright Today he is controlled by a small circle which includes John Gottschalk publisher Omaha World Herald and Kerrey business partner William Wright the individual who milked State Security s depositors of millions

reduction groups in the country 4 Operating with the protection of a corrupt press The press can tum truth into falsehood and lies into truth such is its power in Nebraska and also nationally The media should be the ultimate check and balance of our other institutions of government in this country Three times in my short life the McCarthy era Watergate and Iran Contra it was the press that finally exposed the truth and kept our Constitutional system of government in place rather than the institutions of govern ment themselves that are assigned that purpose In the case of Commonwealth and State Security Robert Kerrey had a relationship with the two major news sources in Nebraska the Omaha World Herald and the Lincoln Journal that guaranteed presentation of a distorted and false picture of Commonwealth and State Security His personal and business relationships with the owners and publishers of the Lincoln Journal guaranteed that truth would be sacrificed to conve nience And his business and personal relationship today with the World Herald publisher guarantees even more certainly that same result from the World Herald Lest anyone doubt the latter consider the open mike inci 270 APPENDIX B BOBBY AND ME dent of November 1991 Kerrey found himself on a podium in New Hampshire sitting next to fellow candidate Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas Not realizing a microphone was on he told Clinton a dirty joke that was offensive to lesbians and homosexuals whom he has otherwise supported Some of the nation s press attacked him for his crudity But here is how the World Herald run by his business partner Jack Gottschalk covered it in an editorial entitled Kerrey Too Deserves Apology Bob Kerrey is right when he says he shouldn t have repeated the crude story he told Bill Clinton in a private conversation in New Hampshire Nonetheless it would be unjust if this stupid minor blown out of proportion incident were to hurt Kerrey s campaign for the Democratic

that Bob Kerrey is the victim because the evil people dared to catch him committing his dirty joke routine The World Herald editorially attacks the accusers and labels Kerrey as the target of a carefully crafted sabotage operation And demands that his victims apologize to him In Franklin the child victim accusers were labeled as the bad people and the people they accused were the target of a

as CIA Station Chief and recruited a young combat infantry captain named John DeCamp to be one of his chief assistants in Operation Phoenix right through to his role in trying to blow open the Franklin cover up I published The Franklin Cover Up as much as an insurance policy for myself and my family as for any other purpose Colby had pointed to the extreme danger for a person to have secret

is why the CIA and the KGB sometimes find their agents dead Your 277 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP best interest he argued may well be in publishing what you know and are able to prove rather than keeping those facts secret Whether you ever sell a single book or not does not really matter Putting your information on the public record is what is important That way there is no logical reason to harm you or your family to suppress some truth you have already documented That is probably your real life insurance policy in something like this Franklin situation Colby had advised me Now four years later without a single dollar spent in adver tising or promotion over 50 000 copies of this book have been sold nationwide I am convinced that this is why I am alive today although I did receive a warning

CONTINUE When the first printing of what you have just read appeared in May 1992 I was threatened with countless law suits by individuals named in the book I was told by their attorneys from some of the most prominent law firms in the state and in the country that We will destroy you in court As it turned out although there have been numerous attempts to disbar me only one law suit for libel and slander was ever launched as a direct result of the book and that was a suit I launched and won as I will relate My victory in that case was but one of a series of what I call the mini miracles perhaps a hundred or more unforeseen events since the book first hit the streets which prove the truth of The Franklin Cover Up I have chosen a small sampling of these mini miracles to recount here After this book appeared attorneys for Franklin related indi viduals repeatedly appeared in the printed media particularly in the Omaha World Herald and on TV to make statements such as This book is the most libelous and slanderous book I have ever read The individuals who have been slandered in this book will definitely be filing legal actions to stop distribution 280 INVESTIGATION AND COVER UP CONTINUE of this book and against Mr John DeCamp personally That is certain This book will be stopped and Mr DeCamp will be proved to be a liar and made to pay damages When reporters who interviewed the lawyers or principals named in the book contacted me for my response to their threats I had one standard answer I agree with certain things these people and their attorneys attacking me are saying I agree that the things described in this book are horrible If anyone had said these things about me I agree that I would sue them I believe if there is anything false in this book or if they believe I have not told the truth in this book that they should sue me In fact I welcome their law suits because that will help develop the truth I personally believe I have been most careful and cautious in the way I have handled matters and only written about those things I can absolutely document So what happened with those threats Who sued whom Who proved what The only major lawsuit for libel and slander arising from this book was my suit against Atlantic Telecast owner of a television station in Wilmington North Carolina WECT Channel 6 I charged that statements made on a WECT news broadcast

statements made on a WECT news broadcast on November 12 1992 attacking me and the book were false I demanded a retraction and public apology The first response I received was from WECT s station manager who informed me that WECT had consulted its attor neys that the station had thoroughly investigated the matters described in my book and that WECT was not only not going to apologize but planned to repeat the attacks WECT s attorney further advised me that the station had investigated in part by talking to U S Senator Bob Kerrey from Nebraska who was running for president of the United States at the time and who had visited Wilmington and met with representatives of the TV station Further investigation he claimed was conducted by talking to the new Wilmington police chief a man named Robert Wadman the former police chief of Omaha Nebraska who had come to Wilmington in the early 1990s 28 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP After hearing this I gave a simple demand to WECT Rest assured I am ready to prove everything I wrote in my book I hope you are ready and able to prove your claims made on TV I give you three weeks for further investigation and then I will move forward aggressively on my lawsuit against you At that time I will seek not only an apology but substantial monetary damages Just under three weeks from the date of my ultimatum attorneys from Atlantic Telecast contacted me and stated that they had done further investigation and acknowledged that now they not I were in trouble Shortly thereafter a settlement agreement was reached which stipulated l WECT TV would broadcast a retraction and public apology to me on its news broadcasts and would issue a press release to the same effect 2 WECT would pay me money damages and other financial benefits 3 All other de tails of the settlement other than those stated above would be kept confidential for the benefit of the TV station I accepted the settlement offer and dismissed my lawsuit WECT lived up

and across North Caro lina and Wadman s adversaries led primarily by Officer Clatty went as high as the State Legislature From 1992 until roughly mid 1994 it divided the city of Wilmington and even the state of North Carolina The outcome of the war between Chief Wadman and his 282 INVESTIGATION AND COVER UP CONTINUE own force was that in early July 1994 a secret meeting was held with city officials and Wadman s attorney On July II 1994 Wadman resigned as police chief Although city officials refused to comment on what had transpired in the meeting Wadman himself admitted in a television

been the head of Boys Town from the late 1970s through the decade of the 1980s the critical time in question for the Franklin case contacted me and asked to have a meeting at which he specified that witnesses must be present I anticipated that his purpose was to attack me and to deny what I had written about Boys Town I was completely wrong With two witnesses present Monsi gnor Hupp opened our discussion with the simple statement John DeCamp your book stated the game I hope I can help with some of the names Monsignor Hupp and I then entered into an in depth discus sion on the entire

public officials and the Church would do nothing apparently terrified at the 283 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP damage it would do to the Church and to the entire city of Omaha Monsignor Hupp said What are you talking about I asked him Is there some particular story or incident you are talking about in the book that you have more information about Please explain what you mean I asked the Monsignor He then described an incident in 1985 in which a young boy named Shattuck who lived in Elkhorn Nebraska had been sexually abused and then killed The Monsignor told me that he was certain who had killed the boy a man he identified as a member of the Catholic clergy in the Omaha Archdiocese Monsignor Hupp provided precise detail which he said proved beyond any doubt that the particular individual he named was in fact the child s murderer The Church is plagued by these sexual abuse problems across the country and by the devastating publicity the clergy abuse incidents have caused Monsignor Hupp explained The Church s reaction to these sexual abuse problems is in most cases to immediately get the clergy member involved out of the state and if possible out of the country and hopefully into treatment I know that may not be right but it is a difficult situation to deal with and simply moving the priest or the brother out of the state or country has been the traditional approach by the Church in America to addressing the problems In this case where an innocent child was murdered and where 1 know that a member of our clergy has done this I felt I had a moral obligation overriding all

Monsignor advised me that he was receiving all kinds of pressure and criticism and was he feared being forced to leave Boys Town Shortly after that discussion in a controversy that received national press attention on how resources should be used at Boys Town Monsignor Hupp was removed from his post He now lives quietly in a home in West Omaha Nebraska Monsignor Hupp has shown incredible courage

On the contrary he is one of America s most famous and nationally honored clergy men the author of two best sellers a former Presidential Ap pointee as Special Ambassador to the United Nations and the former head of America s most famous child care institution Boys Town Monsignor Hupp showed his courage yet again when he repeated his charges a year later to a British TV team making a documentary on the Franklin cover up entitled Conspiracy of Silence In mid 1993 after The Franklin Cover Up had been circulat ing for almost a year the British based TV station Yorkshire Television sent a top notch team to Nebraska to launch its own investigation of the Franklin case Yorkshire had a contract with the Discovery Channel to produce a documentary on the case for American television They spent many

and abilities that I personally had Over the year that I worked with them I was amazed at the team s ability to gather new documents and witnesses which kept opening up new and frightening facts about Franklin They were a crack team In the final weeks that they were in Nebraska they expressed their certainty that they would win awards for this documented horror story of government sanctioned drug running involving children government sanctioned abuse of children and government protection of some of this country s most powerful businessmen and politicians who had been the chief actors in the Franklin story Finally the big day came Their documentary was to air nationwide on the Discovery Channel on May 3 1994 It was advertised in the TV Guide and in newspapers for that day But no one ever saw that program At the last minute and without explanation it was pulled from the air It was not shown then and has never been broadcast anywhere since I have a copy of that program which arrived anonymously in my mail in late 1995 When I watched this pirated copy I could see clearly why the program had been suppressed Conspiracy ofSilence proved beyond doubt that the essential points I had stressed in the book and more were all true For instance the team had interviewed Troy Boner Some time after that grand jury was over Troy guilt stricken because of his lying over Gary Caradori s death contacted me and told the truth about what had happened This is recorded in a remarkable affidavit see Chapter 20 The Yorkshire TV team spent a small fortune to confirm Troy s charges They flew Troy to Chicago and paid for a lengthy polygraph lie detector test at the Keeler Polygraph Institute With the results of that test the Yorkshire team was so convinced that Troy was telling the truth

in this book and developed them much more extensively than I ever had the resources or abilities to accomplish 2 These areas which the documentary focused on were a the use and involvement of Boys Town children and person alities in the Franklin Scandal particularly Peter Citron and Larry King s relationships to Boys Town b the linkage of Franklin to some of this country s top politicians in Washing ton and in the U S Congress with particular attention on those who attended parties held by Larry King at his Washington mansion on Embassy Row c the impropriety of these politi cians and businessmen and compromising of these people by Larry King through drugs and using children for pedophilia 3 When the broadcast tape was sent to the United States Customs officials seized the documentary and held it up as being pornographic material Attorneys for Discovery Channel and Yorkshire TV were able to get the documentary released Then the lawyers went through the film for months making this or that change or deletion so that the documentary ultimately advertised to be shown on the Discovery Channel on May 3 1994 would survive any claims of libel or slander that any of the individuals identified in the documentary might attempt to bring The lawyers had cleared the documentary for broadcast 4 During the several months that the documentary was being prepared and advertised for showing major legislation impacting the entire future of the Cable TV industry was being debated on Capitol Hill Legislation which the industry op posed was under debate for placing

day without the complicity of Nebraska s largest bank FirsTier Every dollar that went into Franklin Credit Union the missing 40 million was no exception went into its account 153 7 353 at FirsTier In October 1994 evidence released through the Freedom of Information Act FOIA proved exactly how right I was These FOIA documents showed that some of the same attorneys who had threatened so loudly to sue me together with the FirsTier Bank with which they were associated had reached a finan cial settlement with the National Credit Union Association NCUA in which they agreed to pay the NCUA 10 million in damages for their role in improprieties involving Franklin The attorneys had to come up with over 6 million and First Tier itself over 3 million Despite the fact that the FirsTier case was the biggest mal practice settlement in the history of Nebraska and despite the fact that the settlement involved very prominent individuals including former Republican Governor Charlie Thone and at torney Jay Derr the story received almost no coverage in the press that is before the FOIA material became public Then the World Herald jumped in with a huge editorial in October 288 INV ESTIGATION

6 I described another big money scheme that intersected the Franklin case the looting of the Common wealth Savings Bank in which I filed a claim on behalf of the Commonwealth victims To my surprise and joy I succeeded beyond all my expectations in this case until a strained inter pretation of our state Constitution was put forward by Nebras ka s Supreme Court First I presented to the Claims Board the Commonwealth story exactly as described in this book but with even more extensive documentation The Claims Board agreed and reached a Settlement for some 16 000 000 00 to be paid to the Commonwealth victims But the Legislature had to approve this as did the Governor So we took the matter of the settlement with me as attorney for the Claimants and victims to the State Legislature Sur prise in a close but bitter battle enough Senators stood up to acknowledge the horrible acts that had occurred and the 289 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP intense suffering of the Commonwealth victims that resulted The settlement was approved Next we went to the Governor who signed the legislation for the settlement Then the matter was taken to court by certain unnamed individuals concerned citizens who claimed that they did not want their tax money used to pay these Commonwealth victims Nebraska has a unique section in its State Constitution which forbids the state from using any tax dollars for purposes of extending the credit of the state or granting a gift The result that which the Claims Board and the Legislature and the Governor all agreed the Commonwealth Savings Bank victims were entitled to because of the failures of the Govern ment in Commonwealth was taken away by the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska The Court claimed that Nebraska s Constitution forbids paying the money to the victims because they were only victims of moral wrongdoing rather than le gal wrongdoing And John DeCamp who would have become a multi mil lionaire out of the case because I had done it

became interested in the Franklin story was the TV program America s Most Wanted AMW In several episodes AMW opened up a whole new dimension on just how high up politically the story went and how wide it reached across the country For a while I had great hopes For example AMW inter viewed Paul Bonacci in prison and broadcast his account of a host of specific details about individuals places activities kidnappings etc in which he said he had participated 290 INVESTIGATION AND COVER UP CONTINUE To the shock of AMW and sometimes of myself the inci dents Paul Bonacci described when investigated by AMW turned out to be exactly as Paul had recounted For instance a young boy named Jimmy who had been branded by pedophile perpetrators like you would brand a steer with a hot iron cautiously came forward to a nationally broadcast request by and verified many of the events Paul had described including a secret hiding place for concealing children located in Colorado precisely as Paul had said Investigation by AMW in preparing subsequent episodes of the program began turning over more and more rocks provid ing still more proof of the story told by Alisha Owen and by the other victim witnesses AMW even featured a one hour special on one of the most important kidnappings on which Bonacci had given details that of Johnny Gosch the Des Moines Iowa newspaper boy who had disappeared a dozen years ago Gosch s parents John and Noreen had repeatedly met with Bonacci and become convinced of the truth of Paul s description of the kidnapping and of Paul s own participation in it At a press conference reported in the World Herald April 7 1992 John and Noreen Gosch had declared Paul Bonacci told my wife and I things that we ve never told anybody The investigation was

all our programming because we can t afford to Our success THE FRANKLIN COVER UP requires their cooperation and we are a tremendous benefit to them which they could get nowhere else But we are running

to do with the FBI Paul Sparrow told me much more but I promised confiden tiality on those matters and will live up to that promise As I told Paul several weeks later You have done a tremen dous service for this country in the work you did on the Franklin case on its nationwide links and on its drug dealing and political implications and particularly by proving so many of the things in question including even arranging to have Paul Bonacci polygraphed by some of the nation s best experts to prove his truthfulness I full well understand your sensitive situation and your relationship

involving Boys Town As I had re ported it was only a matter of time until Rochon discovered if he had not done so already that his FBI tormentors were deeply involved in the Franklin affair itself The FBI agreed to settle Rochon s suit by paying him 1 million and to reim burse his legal expenses of 500 000 Later in 1994 when the press was hounding Sessions as to what if anything he had done during his term as FBI Director Judge Sessions defended himself by recalling his successful handling of the law suit of the former FBI agent Donald Rochon which he said he had been able to settle without it damaging the FBI Sessions said that the horrible allegations Rochon had made in his lawsuit were in fact true and that a public trial would have damaged the Bureau He Sessions had prevented this

grilled Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman as to why the Omaha Police Department was dismissing the reports by child victim witnesses of horrific abuse and of other crimes Wadman replied The FBI conducts an investigation and basically says 293 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP the same things that we have said If the FBI are they now linked to this cover up in some way Should the Justice Depart ment be investigated as somehow or another assisting in this cover up I noted apropos of this exchange that Wadman said it but in this case it s true The Justice Department acting through the FBI and the U S Attorney s Office in Omaha emerges from the record of the Franklin investigations not so much as a party to the cover up but as its coordinator Now four years later I am even more certain of these charges Not only has information continued to pour in on the Franklin case which strengthens me in that conviction and not only has the Justice Department turned its back on a high level request to re examine the whole Franklin case see Chapter 25 but in case after notorious case entirely unrelated to Franklin Justice Department personnel appear as liars perverts frame up artists and even assassins An increasing number of citizens view the United States government with suspicion even hatred Though there are no doubt other branches of the government where corruption flourishes there is no question in my mind that the stench of evil which emanates from Washington originates in the so called Department of Justice particularly in its permanent bu reaucracy I have documented that case with respect to the Franklin cover up and the average citizen may have become aware of it in the massacre at Ruby Ridge Idaho in August 1992 where it is now generally acknowledged that the Justice Department through its FBI marksmen murdered the 14 year old son and wife of Randy Weaver The same thing happened in Waco Texas in 1993 when the Justice Department directed the slaughter of 86 people

slanders him most people in the country know something about the economist and several time Demo cratic Party presidential candidate Lyndon H LaRouche Jr After all he did get a very respectable 600 000 votes in the Democratic presidential primaries in 1996 averaging 10 or more of the vote in each state in which he ran And while people may have heard that he is a convicted felon they probably have no idea of what actually happened On December 16 1988 Lyndon H LaRouche Jr and six co defendants were convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud eleven counts of mail fraud in the alleged amount of 294 000 in unrepaid loans LaRouche was con victed on one additional charge of attempting to defraud the Internal Revenue Service LaRouche was then 66 years old it was obvious that the very harsh sentence of 15 years he was given meant that the Justice Department intended for him to die in jail In 1991 I first had a chance to examine a small portion of the six volumes of evidence his attorneys filed with the court proving his innocence I must say notwithstanding all that I had already been through on the Franklin case I was shocked no stunned is a better word by what I read I remember saying to colleagues at the time Oh my God if they can do this to LaRouche who is a well known if controversial political figure in this blatant way there is no one in the country that they won t simply frame up The U S Justice Department had not a shadow of evidence to convict LaRouche nor any of his associates one of whom Michael Billington was sent to jail in Virginia for 77 years In fact the evidence showed in the government s own docu ments released under the Freedom of Information Act as LaRouche s attorneys contended that The U S government knew at all relevant times from 1979 to the present day that Lyndon LaRouche and his co defendants were innocent of the false charges for which they were convicted The only crimes committed in the LaRouche case were the

in the LaRouche case were the massive illegalities 295 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP of the U S Department of Justice in their zeal to remove LaRouche from the political life of this country It later turned out as LaRouche s associates found out from FOIA appeals that LaRouche s latest troubles started when his longtime political enemy Henry Kissinger wrote a letter in 1982 to then FBI director William Webster asking Webster to go after LaRouche But already back in 1973 as other FOIA documents from the FBI s own files showed the FBI had authorized the Communist Party of the United States which it basically ran through its informants to eliminate LaRouche that is to kill him outright I was not the only one to get a whiff of a big time frame up Former U S Attorney General Ramsey Clark with whom I had had some contact during the Franklin case and who was LaRouche s appeals lawyer wrote a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno in which he said I believe it the LaRouche case involves a broader range of deliberate and systematic misconduct and abuse of power over a longer period of time in an effort to destroy a political movement and leader than any other federal prosecution in my time or to my knowledge And as of August 1996 721 U S state legislators and thousands more federal parliamentarians and other dignitaries around the world had signed an open letter calling for the exoneration of LaRouche which denounced in no uncertain terms his frame up LaRouche is out of jail and going strong but he has still not been exonerated from the stain of a phony conviction nor compensated for the five years stolen from his life nor for the untold damage done to his political movement THE DEMJANJUK CASE A case which almost rivals that of LaRouche in terms of the length to which the Justice Department will go to crush one individual is that of former Cleveland autoworker John Demjanjuk In 1979 the Justice Department accused Demjanjuk of being the notorious Ivan the Terrible the Nazi mass murderer who 296 INVESTIGATION AND COVER UP CONTINUE killed countless Jews at the Treblinka concentration camp in Poland Demjanjuk s lawyers later proved again from the Justice Department s own

the Terrible had already been proven to be someone other than Demjanjuk Still other documents showed that the Justice Department knowingly accepted a forged J D card from the Soviet intelli gence agency the KGB to frame Demjanjuk Finally with the full knowledge that he was innocent the Department of Justice had Demjanjuk extradited to Israel to be executed It was only due to the extraordinary courage and tenacity of his Israeli lawyer Yoram Sheftel that the Cleveland autoworker was finally acquitted Then on November 17 1993 the U S Sixth Court of Appeals in Cincinnati Ohio issued a stinging rebuke to the Department of Justice in an 83 page decision overturning Demjanjuk s denaturalization The Court charged that the Department had committed prosecutorial mis conduct and fraud upon the court in obtaining the con viction Nothwithstanding all that the Justice Department is trying to have Demjanjuk extradited from the United States THE FRUEHMENSCHEN CAS E On January 27 1988 then Congressman Mervyn Dymally placed before the House of Representatives a shocking document It was an affidavit sworn by an FBI agent Hirsch Friedman concerning an FBI policy named Operation Fruehmenschen German for primitive man According to Friedman s testimony The purpose of this policy was the routine investigation without probable cause of prominent elected and appointed officials in major metropolitan areas throughout the United States It was explained to me that the basis for this Fruehmenschen policy was the assumption by the FBI that black officials were intellectually and socially incapable of governing major governmental organizations and institutions 297 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP Other evidence backed up Friedman s charges including a 1987 book by Dr Mary Sawyer Harassment ofBlack Elected Officials Ten Years Later a follow up to a 1977 report she had issued on the same subject The figures backed up Dymally and Sawyer s charges Be tween 1983 and 1988 14 of all political corruption cases targetted black officials though they comprised only 3 of U S officeholders From 1981 1983 roughly half of the 26 members of the Congressional Black Caucus were targets of

together to examine Department of Justice corruption regarding the above cases and others The NBCSL said in its Resolution 20 A Call For Congressional Hearings To Investigate Misconduct by the U S Department of Justice WHEREAS the hearings focussed on cases where there was evidence of political targeting of groups and individuals by corrupt officials inside federal governmental law enforcement agencies working in tandem with a concert of private organizations WHEREAS the evidence was presented not by the good word of the witnesses alone but documented by the govern ment s own documents

case My good friend William Colby the chief behind the scenes architect of the Franklin investigation is dead Franklin Credit Union boss Larry King has served five years in prison and is about to be released Alisha Owen was convicted of perjury on June 21 1991 In February she went to prison to begin a IS year sentence This is notwithstanding the fact that the Nebraska Supreme Court expunged the report of the Douglas County Grand Jury from all official records because the report violated all laws relating to such proceedings This Grand Jury had indicted Alisha in the first place claiming that

County Grand Jury report complaining that the Supreme Court had condemned it At my own expense I have continued to provide legal assis tance to her in the appeals process during the last four years But I did not represent Alisha at her original hasty 30 day trial and the problem in defending her subsequently is that if things were done wrong at the trial level either by the defen dant or by the defendant s lawyer it is difficult if not impossi ble to correct that problem at the appeals level The only way to do that is to prove to the court that the defendant did not receive adequate assistance by counsel during the trial 300 YEARS LATER WHERE ARE THEY NOW otherwise the appeals attorney is limited to the record created during the original trial Troy Boner came under such onerous pressure from the FBI that he recanted all that he had told the State Senate s Franklin investigator Gary Caradori This recantation was the key factor in the Douglas Grand Jury s findings that all the children had lied In 1993 Troy engaged me as his lawyer Before he did so however I asked him to write an affidavit telling the story as he actually knew it to have actually happened In this affidavit printed in the next chapter he reasserted his original story which he had also told the Yorkshire TV crew He has now dropped from sight no doubt terrified about the threats that the FBI and others delivered to him were he to tell the truth Paul Bonacci has matured fallen in love and is a devoutly religious young man He is now a youth counselor working to protect young children from the experiences he suffered The civil rights lawsuit I filed on behalf of Paul still contin ues It has been an incredibly costly and painful effort for both of us I will try to outline a few of the facts which are on the public record with respect to that lawsuit First as part of our discovery process in the suit we were able to locate a vast store of pornographic materials which were in the

able to review only I of the material before the court ordered it destroyed The material consisted of thousands of hours of tapes maga zine articles and related pornographic materials The court ruled that Paul was not to be allowed to see any of the materials This restriction was extremely damaging to us because Paul was and is the one person who can and will identify the children and the others in the films a fact the court itself acknowledged The more we began to pour over Citron s materials the more we discovered that huge amounts of them as identified in the official court inventory provided to us were missing So we immediately went to court which took additional time to THE FRANKLIN COVER UP hold hearings and to subpoena officials to try to locate the missing materials and find out how these materials could disap pear despite strenuous security measures The official in control of the materials simply declaimed We admit there are huge amounts of pornographic materials missing but we are not the ones who hid or destroyed or took them and we do not know who did Additionally I could only view the materials in the presence of guards and of the Clerk of the Federal Court at his conve nience and behind security doors and with notice given to all other attorneys in the case to be present if they so desired All this security was as I was told for the protection of the pornographers involved which seems strange even in this bizarre case Under the terms and within the time frame the court allowed it was impossible to ever look at more than a fraction of the materials Now incredibly the court has ordered the materials de stroyed Arrayed against me in this civil rights lawsuit on behalf of Paul Bonacci are lawyers from across the United States from a dozen or so of

the gambling syndicates power to allow any type of casinos or gambling enterprises into the state that they would choose and power to regulate the new casino operations As two former state senators Loran Schmit and myself took out full page ads in the World Herald denouncing the plan and attacked Baer by name On Friday October 25 1996 the gambling syndicates had made arrangements to appear before Federal Judge Kopf who 303 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP had sentenced Larry King to obtain a federal court order to place the gambling referendum on the ballot November 5 1996 Only a week before I had put out a press release in which I publicly expressed my fear that the gambling syndicates would be successful in getting their proposal on the ballot since many of the personalities involved in the syndicate had also been involved and protected in the Franklin case The release may be one reason why when on Oct 25 the syndicate went to get its expected order from Judge Kopf he was nowhere to be found It turns out he had checked himself into Bryan Memorial Hospital with what was claimed to be a possible heart attack When all deadlines for signing the order had passed Judge Kopf remarkably recovered and was released from the hospital to resume his duties on the bench U S Federal Magistrate Richard G KopJ as predicted in the first edition leapfrogged ahead of others to win appointment as

affidavit freely and voluntarily and for the protection of myself and my family now and in the future second because it is right to do and finally because I want 305 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP to undo some of the damage and injury I have caused and to help force legitimate and honest investigations of such matters as my brother s death Gary Caradori s death and all circum stances surrounding my allegations herein particularly the allegations that I lied to the grand jury and at the Alisha Owen trial but that such lies were caused by others including particularly the F B I and my mother and family are ex hausted from living in fear of death or injury as a result of my personal involvement in the Franklin matters which ended up in my testifying at the Grand Jury hearings as well as at the Alisha Owen Trial I lied at the Grand Jury hearings and I lied at the Alisha Owen trial I lied when I recanted my original testimony to Gary Caradori I lied because I truly believed and still do

CARADORI What I told Gary Caradori in the original taped interviews Gary had with me was the truth It is still the truth From about age 14 to 17 I was seriously involved in sexual and drug and related activities with a wide range of individuals but primarily and specifically Alan Baer Larry King Robert Wadman Peter Citron Eugene Mahoney and others of prominence and wealth whom I will identify for any legitimate investigative officials who seriously wish to correct the problems and stop the conduct these individuals are and were engaged in rather than cover up that conduct It has been repeatedly publicly stated that my story and the stories told by Alisha Owen Paul Bonacci and a large number ofother young people not previously identified who were simply intimidatedfrom talking or who were ridiculed were a Care fully Crafted Hoax The stories were not a hoax The only 308 TROY BONER STEPS FORWARD carefully crafted thing that occurred was in fact the cover up of the facts and the subsequent conviction of Alisha Owen and the original Grand Jury Investigation In short there was a carefully crafted cover up by the very people who were sup posed to be exposing the conduct of these people rather than covering it up And yes I was a very very critical element in that cover up but that participation by me was done because of threat and promise made to me primarily from the F B I and Mr Mark Delman the attorney arrangedfor me by others I repeat The original story I told on taped interview to Gary Caradori was in fact substantially the truth and substantially accurate I say substantially because I am sure on some points I exaggerated and on some points I did not remember exactly the date or place or time of this or that event or particular person or persons involved But specifically the material and substantive facts about the 1 Parties that took place at Twin Towers 2 the use of myself and other children as drug couri for Alan Baer and Larry King 3 the involvement

Grand Jury at the insistence and instruction of Marc Delman and the F B I I told the Grand Jury what the F B I and Delman wanted me to tell the Grand Jury which is that the story to Gary Caradori was a hoax But as stated the exact opposite is true Some time after my testimony to the Grand Jury Gary Caradori was killed I have no proof but I do believe he was deliberately killed But someone else will have to determine this because I acknowledge I have no information to prove or disprove this Immediately after Gary Caradori was killed and because I did believe he had been killed as part of a cover up and as a result of my lies to the grand jury I immediately called his home from the Red Lion Hotel at which time I spoke to his wife Sandie and told her I had in fact lied to the Grand Jury and that I was going to help straighten it out now She suggested I go to Senator Schmit and provide him that information This I immediately did and told Senator Schmit personally in his office that I

immediately following the funeral I told my mother who was with me that we were not going to the meeting with the Senators and I was going to stick with my lies to the Grand Jury because of what I feared the F B I or others associated with them or whom they were protecting would do to me or the members of my family Later Senator Labedz called me and asked why I did not show up at the meeting At first I pretended like I did not know what she was talking about because by this time I was really scared especially because of Caradori s death Then she said she knew I was scared So I was honest and I remember I flat told her I was scared and could not do anything now She said she felt sorry for me and that she understood Then Marc Delman and Mickey Mott saw Senator Schmit say on T V that I had been in his Schmit s office and that my recantation had been false They both called me Even though Marc Delman knew I had been at Schmit s office and that what Schmit was saying was the truth he Delman asked me whether the conversation had been taped or whether there was any other record of my having been in Schmit s office to talk to Schmit I told Delman there was no tape or any other record

F B I people one time when I was feeling a bit cocky about their threats to me that Alan Baer and others could n01 afford to do anything to hurt me now because too much publicity was focused on me and that they could not afford the risk of doing anything to me Mott right away told me that they probably would not do anything directly to me that instead they will do something to a family member And of course that is what happened shortly thereafter after I had met with Schmit and talked to Sandie Caradori and when the F B I and Delman and Baer and others thought I might break away from them the F B I and Delman and tell the truth and confirm that I had lied when I testified to the Grand Jury I am completely certain in my own mind which I believe a decent and honest investigation will show that my brother Shawn was killed as a message to me to stick with my lies and not to back down because they were afraid I might back down and tell the truth at the Alisha Owen trial After Shawn got killed I had no doubt at all that they really were as dangerous as I had originally feared that they would do anything and kill anybody to keep the truth contained and to keep me lying for them and I complied with every request they wanted me to do or say with respect to the whole so called Franklin thing Before the Alisha Owen trial I was carefully rehearsed by the F B I as to what I would say and what questions would be asked and then after rehearsing everything with the F B I I was taken over to Mr Moran the prosecutor to go thru the Rehearsal again I do not know whether Mr Moran knew I

sexual acts as well as checks from Alan Baer to me So they had to absolutely know I had a relationship with him and that they were forcing me to lie when I denied such relationships Addi tionally the F B I had seized photos and tapes involving among others myself and a Mr Andreasen and Larry King These were video tapes of a party And I know from having seen tapes at Peter Citron s house that the F B I had access to tapes which clearly documented much of the conduct and the personalities I and other kids had identified as having occurred but which later I lied about before the Grand Jury and again at the Alisha Owen trial when I claimed again to satisfy the F B I that the events never occurred I do not know what the F B I ever did with these pictures of me and Baer for example but I know they had them because I saw them So they the F B I had to know the real truth all along and had to know what they were doing when they forced me to lie I am also sure that there are other pictures which would prove the things we kids told Caradori Why do I say this Because the one thing I remember above all else is that these people like Baer Mahoney Citron Andreasen King always loved to have pictures of themselves and others particularly the kids in weird sexual poses MY CREDIBILITY AND THE CREDIBILITY OF THE OTHER KIDS I know the first thing that the F B I and Marc Delman and others involved in these Franklin and related matters will say when I submit my affidavit is something like You can t believe these kids and you can t believe Troy Boner now If TROY BONER STEPS FORWARD he lied once he will lie again He s a drug addict He s a sex pervert Who are you going to believe these kids with their wild stories or respectable people like Alan Baer or the F B I or Attorney Marc

what they will say I have heard it before But let me give the other side of that story Yes we kids from early age sold our bodies We became drug addicts We got lots and lots of money from these people But today we are ruined because of that And we were turned into sex perverts and drug addicts by these people In my particular case just like a lot of other young boys I was directly turned into a true drug addict by Alan Baer He was the one who first taught me to mainline and who first directly injected heroin directly into my veins same as he did to a lot of other boys He was the one who made me a prisoner of drug addiction to where he could completely control me and use me to deliver drugs or deliver sex or anything else Sure he paid me well but he also destroyed me in the process It was Alan Baer who first injected me with a speed ball for example A speed ball is a heroin cocaine mix that zips you up immediately but brings you down mellow And it was Marc Delman my attorney arranged for me by others who claimed lowed him more than 500 000 00 for work he did protecting me when what he really was doing was having me lie to protect others But to those who really want the truth it really is all there for you to find out if you will only check on the things that are available And the truth is the truth whether it is told by us street kids whom you may not want to believe or the richest and most powerful people in Omaha who you think you have to believe Same with a lie So here are some things that any honest investigator can check out to see who is lying and who is telling the truth I Marc Delman wrote my script for the TV program 48 Hours wherein I claimed that the entire story of myself and the other kids was a hoax He promised me ten or fifteen THE FRANKLIN COVER UP

Hours program was played on television just before the Alisha Owen jury began their deliberations Marc Delman also claimed that I had not met with Senator Schmit to tell the truth and I followed his instructions in denying it also This sure can be checked out There were people who saw me with Schmit Same with my contact with Senator Labedz II I saw the picture the F B I had of me and Alan Baer Some official sure ought to be able to get this picture to prove who is lying me or the F B I III Lots of kids other than myself and Alisha and the ones who tried to come forward and tell the truth know about Alan Baer Larry King and the major drug dealing activity they and other prominent people were involved in But as long as they are scared for their lives because of what happened to Alisha and me they are not going to say anything If an honest prosecu tor would step in and offer immunity and protection to these kids many of them young men and women now I am sure the entire network of drug dealing use of kids for sex and related things could be proven and corroborated to every body s satisfaction IV But maybe the most important thing that any honest investigator should do is to ask me Troy Boner or any of the other kids such as Alisha or Paul Bonacci to take polygraph lie detector tests side by side on the same questions with the people we are accusing of these things Example ask Alan Baer if he shot mainline drugs into me and if he is a major drug dealer and if he had sex with me Ask Eugene Mahoney if he met me at the book store in Council Bluffs and used to regularly pay me to have sex with him as a boy Ask to take a polygraph test on whether he is a big time drug dealer Ask the F B I guys to take a polygraph test on whether they threatened me with jail if I did not

hours of tapes with them They have checked on many of the matters I told them about not dealt with in this affidavit and have satisfied themselves that I am telling the truth about my lying to the Grand Jury and to convict Alisha Owen and the reasons why I had to lie just as I have explained in this affidavit The reason I mention this is simply to establish that eliminating me or any member of
