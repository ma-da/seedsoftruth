I can't say the intensity of the responses surprised me, but it shocked me into noticing a feeling that I'd been derelict in my duty to follow up on an issue I wrote about extensively in 2020 and 2021. Like many of you, I'd kinda like to move on. Forgive me. Also I was wary of getting addicted to identifying with my partisan role in the issue, with its attendant indignation and righteousness.

I will call the illness pandemania-a social, psychological, and political derangement that caused much more harm than the disease itself, and continues to do so. Like Covid itself, which kills people indirectly by provoking a cytokine storm, the pandemic provoked a socio-political tempest far out of proportion to its epidemiological danger.1** And, like an opportunistic germ that reveals and exploits an underlying imbalance, Covid landed on a social tissue already severely diseased. Some advocates of [bioterrain theory](https://www.wanttoknow.info/h/coronavirus-questions-fundamental) theorize that germs are not just opportunistic, but sometimes can exercise a healing role. For example, by aiding the clearing of accumulated wastes through mucous discharge, they can restore balance to unhealthy tissues.

Otherwise, the disease will continue to deepen, morphing into new and diverse forms that may not fall into the category of epidemic, but will highlight the same social maladies that made us so susceptible to Covid pandemania. * * * What is the disease and what are the lessons? I will trace it through some of the responses I've received. One of the main themes in the comments was betrayal and a shattering of trust. Many people are asking, **Do we just forgive and forget and go back to normal?** One commenter put it like this: How do we move on with these people, some of them cherished friends and community members, in a way that honors and respects the pain, anger, anxiety, etc that went with being excluded or shut down or simply disengaged with as a result of our (courageous) positions taken over the last two years? I imagine that people on the other side of the issue might express a similar sentiment. They might say, \"How do we move on with these people who flouted the advice of the best experts, ignored the consensus science, tried to enroll us in their dangerous conspiracy theories, and thus put us all at risk?\" There is, however, a profound asymmetry between the two sides.** One side experienced ostracism, censorship, cancellation, loss of jobs, loss of licenses, and exclusion from public spaces, while the other did not.** The following comment, from a Vermont woman named Susan who'd been banned from her ukulele group, speaks to our experience. I would like those on the Covidian side to read it without the overlay of \"you deserved it,\" and try to connect with what it was like for us. It's not just about this ukulele group. It's about all the others-the yoga class filled with friends and a real sense of community, now open only to vaccinated people. The annual summer reunion of high school friends that has met every year for the past 45 years, from which I was expressly (and sanctimoniously) excluded last year. Two \"open and affirming\" churches I used to frequent that have closed their doors unvaccinated people, and no one sees the irony.

A Celtic music trio I was part of, a Course In Miracles Study group, two favorite museums we're long time members of, a favorite bookstore, the local repertory theater, and on and on. Most of us who chose to remain unvaccinated have stories like this. We carry some unresolved feelings that make us resistant to going back to normal and forgetting it all happened. It isn't that we are vindictive.** It is tempting just to let everyone forget the whole thing. To let people forget that they excluded, denounced, canceled, censored, and ostracized us. I am willing to let bygones be bygones, except for one thing: How are we to know it won't happen again?** Partly it's a matter of PTSD: I don't feel very safe among these people. But more important than my own comfort or safety is what kind of world my descendants will live in. As George Santayana famously wrote, those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. I fear the possibility that pandemania will become permanent, woven into our social and political institutions, our habits, taboos, and norms.

He goes on a bender and subjects you to all kinds of abuse: yells at you, shames you, locks you out of the house. The next day he wakes up sober and wants to pretend it never happened. The invitation to return to normalcy is strong. But with no change to the conditions behind the alcoholism, without even an apology that recognizes harm was done, you will probably not fully trust the durability of the return to normal. Susan has been invited to rejoin the ukulele group, conditionally, as long as they meet outdoors. Should she say yes? Another commenter articulated her dilemma as follows: **How do we respond if/when we're invited back by people who, last year, chided/berated/excluded/feared/shamed us? How do we respond to the sanctimony, the lack of understanding, the impatience, the shaming, the \"can't-we-just-move-past-that?\"** For sake of completeness, and to communicate some degree of the unresolved fury that is out there, I want to mention that the \"abuse\" in the alcoholic analogy isn't just emotional. It's not that we were merely yelled at, shamed, and locked out of the house. It was physical too. Some of us were beaten bloody. **Last weekend I spent some time with a friend who lost his brother and uncle to the Covid vaccine.

The decline of the previously healthy brother started immediately after the shot. It was obvious to the family but not to the doctors, who said it must be coincidence because the shots were proven to be safe. Can you imagine asking someone like that to forgive and forget, without any acknowledgment of harm?** That said, I don't want to discard the forgive-and-forget impulse too quickly. There is a truth in it as well. The truth lies in what Jesus was reported to have said on the cross: \"Forgive them father, for they know not what they do.\" Real forgiveness is not some kind of indulgence, where we hold ourselves superior to those who have wronged us. It comes from the recognition that we might have done the same, had we been in the shoes of perpetrator rather than victim. It recognizes that those who played their part in what Mattias Desmet calls mass formation are subject to powerful psycho-social forces to which none of us are immune but for fortune's grace. **Instinctively, powerful institutions and ruthless individuals hijack these forces to advance authoritarian goals.** The individuals who contribute to mass formation are their puppets. Even the elites are not the true puppet-masters, since they too act largely unconsciously according to the primal psychology of the mob. Those who rule the mob are never free of it; they must continue to goad it on to new victims lest it turn on themselves. So, the desire to forgive and forget comes not only from wishful thinking that it won't happen again, but also from an important truth: the origin of the wrongness lies beyond those who have wronged us. Accordingly, **the most useful response is not to turn aside from the anger we feel at our treatment by the mob, but to follow it to its source. **The anger is an important signal of a boundary violation. It gives us the energy and daring to do something about it. As anyone in an abusive relationship can confirm, the perpetrator's apology is no guarantee that the abuse won't happen again. Even if the apology is sincerely contrite, still it is no guarantee. It can be gratifying to receive an apology, but too often apology represents merely the reversal of a dominance-submission relationship, not its transcendence. And usually it is a temporary reversal. At best, it is a gateway to a deeper exploration of the background situation (the trauma, the environment) that drives the abuse. But apology is not necessary for forgiveness or for healing. **It is not of highest importance that those who", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__pandemania-eisenstein.txt:3:3ff414c4e760", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10822, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__pandemania-eisenstein.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__pandemania-eisenstein", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "apology is sincerely contrite, still it is no guarantee.

But apology is not necessary for forgiveness or for healing. **It is not of highest importance that those who have ostracized and shamed us apologize. What is most important is to create conditions where it does not happen again.** In the case of a ukulele group, that might mean not rejoining the group. Or it might not. I can't offer a clear formula. I do find, though, that when I let go of my identity as an aggrieved party, I am better able to recognize sincere acts of contrition, even unspoken. Here are some clear signs that abuse is likely to happen again: (1) Humiliating conditions are put on the abused. (2) The power to inflict abuse remains in place. (3) The perpetrator refuses to admit harm was inflicted. (4) The perpetrator maintains the justifications and pretexts for harm. Obviously, on a collective level we have a long way to go. In fact, the harm has only subsided, not ceased. The authorities have not changed at all-all four signs are starkly visible. Many in the Covid dissident community expect a renewed attempt to impose medical totalitarianism come the fall. I am not so sure. The abuse may take a new form. **Covid was a test-drive for technologies of control and habits of submission that can be applied outside the pandemic context. All that is required is to direct the attention of the mob onto a new threat and a new enemy-in-our-midst.** I am aware that I seem to be ending this piece on a somber note. In the [next segment of this series](https://charleseisenstein.substack.com/p/pandemania-part-2) I think I will address the despair and cynicism that many people expressed in the comments. A lot of people seem to have given up on humanity. The above notwithstanding, I have not given up. In fact I think we are at a crossroads (the one I invoked in my first Covid essay, [The Coronation](https://www.wanttoknow.info/h/coronation)), where a new path is open before us. **Let us not internalize the abuser's message of our helplessness. We can choose a better way, if only we know what we are choosing. That is why it is so important to digest the lessons of the pandemic and recognize the deep causes of pandemania.

If generic and natural treatments had been allowed, deaths would be far lower. Moreover, in terms of life-years lost, Covid was much milder than earlier pandemics because half of all deaths were of people over age 80. It wasn't nothing, but the response was far out of proportion to the severity. Finally, on the scale of current world afflictions,** it pales in comparison with hunger, which [kills more annually](https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/people-and-poverty/hunger-and-obesity/how-many-people-die-from-hunger-each-year) than Covid has in its entire tenure.** Yet, we haven't changed our ways one little bit to address it.

The study finds that the pharmaceutical industry employs numerous ghost management strategies to corrupt research, circumvent and undermine regulations, manipulate consumers, and protect its interests. The authors write: \"The scientific literature using internal documents confirmed widespread corporate influence in the pharmaceutical sector. While the academic literature used internal documents related to only a handful of products, our research results, based on ghost‐management categories, demonstrate the extent of corporate influence in every interstice of pharmaceutical markets, particularly in clinical research and clinical practice.\" Analysis of the articles revealed several common ghost management strategies the pharmaceutical industry utilizes. **Ghost management is a system of behind-the-scenes processes by which the industry corrupts researchers, clinicians, and regulatory agencies with gifts and bribes and determines what research will be funded, what scientific journals can publish, and how physicians, etc., will present their product**. The present research reveals eight broad categories of ghost management: scientific capture, professional capture, regulatory capture, media capture, market capture, technological capture, civil society capture, and others. Scientific capture was the most commonly analyzed ghost management strategy. **Note:** For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing [news articles on Big Pharma corruption](https://www.wanttoknow.info/pharmaceuticalcorruptionnewsarticles) from reliable major media sources. **There's far more scientific fraud than anyone wants to admit** **August 9, 2023, *The Guardian* (One of the UK's Leading Newspapers)** [read on theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/scientific-misconduct-retraction-watch) Scientific misconduct does not happen only at Stanford and Harvard.

Of the nearly 5,500 retractions we catalogue in 2022, and the thousands of cases we have reported on since launching our watchdog website [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/) in 2010, the vast majority involve researchers at institutions without anywhere near Stanford and Harvard's pedigrees. **The number of retractions each year reflects about a tenth of a percent of the papers published in a given year - in other words, one in 1,000. Yet the figure has grown significantly from about 40 retractions in 2000, far outpacing growth in the annual volume of papers published**. Retractions have risen sharply in recent years for two main reasons: first, sleuthing, largely by volunteers [who comb](https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/17/meet-the-scientific-sleuths-ten-whove-had-an-impact-on-the-scientific-literature/) academic literature for anomalies, and, second, major publishers' (belated) recognition that their business models have made them susceptible to [paper mills](https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/) - scientific chop shops that sell everything from authorships to entire manuscripts to researchers who need to publish lest they perish. These are not merely academic matters. Particularly when it comes to medical research, faker hurts real people. The truth, however, is that the number of retractions in 2022 - 5,500 - is almost definitely a vast undercount of how much misconduct and fraud exists. We estimate that at least 100,000 retractions should occur every year. Journals and publishers ... fail to do their part, finding ways to ignore criticism of what they have published, leaving fatally flawed work flagged. **Note:** Back in 2015, the editor-in-chef of *The Lancet*, one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world, [wrote that](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-what-medicines-5-sigma-lancet-chief-editor-richard-horton) much of scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue.

In October 2020, John Carlisle reported a startling estimate. Carlisle, an anaesthetist who works for England's National Health Service, is renowned for his [ability to spot dodgy data](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02241-z) in medical trials. He is also an editor at the journal Anaesthesia, and in 2017, he decided to scour all the manuscripts he handled that reported a randomized controlled trial (RCT) - the gold standard of medical research. Over three years, he scrutinized more than 500 studies. For more than 150 trials, Carlisle got access to anonymized individual participant data (IPD). By studying the IPD spreadsheets, he judged that 44% of these trials contained at least some flawed data: impossible statistics, incorrect calculations or duplicated numbers or figures, for instance. **And 26% of the papers had problems that were so widespread that the trial was impossible to trust, he judged - either because the authors were incompetent, or because they had faked the data.

The issue is, in part, a subset of the notorious [paper-mill problem](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5): over the past decade, journals in many fields have published tens of thousands of suspected fake papers, some of which are thought to have been produced by third-party firms, termed paper mills. \"It ... has the potential to amplify a wrong result, suggesting that treatments work when they don't,\" he says. **Monsanto and the Merchants of Poison** **December 23, 2022, *CounterPunch*** [read on counterpunch.org](https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/12/23/monsanto-and-the-merchants-of-poison/) Last week, the report [*Merchants of Poison: How Monsanto Sold the World on a Toxic Pesticide*](https://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Merchants_of_Poison_Report_final_113022.pdf) was published by authors Stacy Malkan, Kendra Klein and Anna Lappé. [In 2012], pesticide and processed food companies spent $45 million to defeat a ballot initiative to label GMOs (genetically modified foods) in California. This campaign was led by Monsanto, one of the planet's largest producers of GMOs. Monsanto created a PR storm through the mouths of so-called third-party \"experts\" from across the fields of academia and science. It was later revealed that these allegedly neutral voices were closely tied to Monsanto. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015 concluded that glyphosate-the chemical contained within herbicides that most GMO crops have been engineered to resist-is likely a human carcinogen. **Thousands sued Monsanto claiming that their exposure of Monsanto's glyphosate-based product, Roundup, caused their cancers. Monsanto employees ghostwrote scientific papers on the safety of glyphosate and strategized how to discredit journalists and scientists raising concerns about the pesticide**. Major universities, including University of California Davis and University of Florida, played a significant role in legitimizing and amplifying pesticide industry product-defense efforts. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Cornell University, and the American Academy for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) ... also provided essential aid and cover for pesticide industry propaganda. **Note:** For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing [news articles on GMOs](https://www.wanttoknow.info/geneticallymodifiedorganismsnewsarticles) and [science corruption](https://www.wanttoknow.info/corruptioninsciencenewsarticles) from reliable major media sources. **The pharmaceutical industry finances about 75 percent of the [FDA]'s drug division** **September 15, 2022, *New York Times*** [read on nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/health/fda-drug-industry-fees.html) Every five years, top officials of the Food and Drug Administration go behind closed doors to negotiate the terms of its core budget - about $3 billion this year.

But the F.D.A. is not at the table with members of Congress or with White House officials. Instead, it's in dozens of meetings with representatives of the giant pharmaceutical companies whose products the agency regulates. The negotiations are a piece of the \"user fee\" program in which drug, device and biotech companies make payments to the agency partly to seek product approvals. The fees ... make up nearly half of the F.D.A.'s budget, financing 6,500 jobs at the agency. **The pharmaceutical industry funding alone has become so dominant that last year it accounted for three-quarters - or $1.1 billion - of the agency's drug division budget**. Advocates for patients and doctors say the agreements have enabled the industry to weaken the approval process meant to ensure that drugs are safe and effective. \"It's kind of like a devil's bargain,\" said Dr. Joseph Ross, a professor at the Yale School of Medicine who has studied F.D.A. policies, \"that I think is not in the best interest of the agency, because it turns this every-five-year cycle into the F.D.A. essentially asking industry, 'What can we do to secure this money?'\" Senator Bernie Sanders ... suggested that the pharmaceutical companies' tendency to charge \"outrageous\" prices was related to their significant role in funding and advancing policy goals of the F.D.A.'s drug division. **Note:** [This profoundly eye-opening interview](https://www.bitchute.com/video/RgnHBPQV5DNZ/) of a top cardiologist reveals without doubt how big Pharma has corrupted science and greatly damaged public health.

Current events have already made the book's subtitle out of date; in an interview with California Weekly in late February, Tyson estimated that the number of Covid-positive patients they've seen at his clinics now approaches 10,000. ***10,000 Covid patients with only seven deaths. That is their clinical track record.*** And of the seven who died under their care, all were very ill when they arrived at the clinics, and all of them only began to be treated in the second week after they contracted the virus. **\"When we start treatment before Day Seven, not a single patient of ours has died. Not a single one,\" says Tyson. \"Of those we lost, they all presented after Day Seven. It just shows how important it is to treat people early.\"** One of their Covid success stories was 106 years old. Another was a woman two months pregnant. Over the past two years a river of humanity-nursing home residents and their caregivers, migrant farmworkers, meat packing plant workers, prison guards, Border Patrol agents, teachers, doctors, nurses, sheriffs, hundreds of members of a local Baptist church-has poured into the clinic and outside in the parking lot where they set up tents to handle the overflow. All needed help, and all got it. This is why some have dubbed Tyson's and Fareed's work \"the miracle of Imperial Valley,\" although both men would concede it's not a miracle at all. It's a practical affirmation of an almost banal medical truism: catching a disease or illness early is the best way to fight it.** In the beginning of Covid they administered an early treatment protocol of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and antibiotics, the so-called \"HCQ cocktail.\" Since then they have added Ivermectin to the mix** and fine-tuned other elements based on what they have learned", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments.txt:1:f69ec8c1ae16", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10834, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Fareed's work \"the miracle of Imperial Valley,\" although both men would concede it's not a miracle at all.

Then they were told to go home and wait without being offered treatment. Then when they can't breathe anymore and they're in crisis, they'd come back to the hospital in a panic. To me it's absolutely criminal.\" He adds, not mincing his words: **\"This has been the biggest public health failure in the history of medicine. The decisions are not being made in the best interests of health, but in the best interests of power and money.\"** **The overall [mortality rate](https://medicalfreedom.substack.com/p/censorship-of-dr-brian-tyson?utm_source=url&s=r) for Imperial County is 3.4 percent, he says. At his urgent care clinics where early treatment is the rule, the rate is .07 percent [1/50th that of the county]. ** Some claim that the stark difference in the success rate is owing to the fact that they see healthier patients-a criticism Tyson dismisses. \"The argument that we're not taking care of the sickest patients like the hospital does, it's just not true. Same population, same demographics. We have no exclusion criteria whatsoever.\" From the height of the pandemic when they were seeing 300 patients a day, the clinics have seen a recent drop-off in Covid cases. \"Omicron burnt through the valley like a wildfire out here,\" he reports. Although the crisis may be backing off somewhat, for the moment, Tyson himself is not. Last month he announced his [candidacy](https://drbriantyson.com/) for the 25th District of the U.S. Congress to represent the Imperial Valley region in Washington. Tyson and his wife Fabiola, a nurse-practitioner, have seven children-two from his previous marriage, two from hers, and three they adopted together. One night while the two of them were watching TV, she gave him a piece of advice that he took to heart. \"Stop yelling at the TV because they can't hear you,\" she told him. \"Do something about it or shut up.\" Tyson is doing something about it.

This was (and is) a stunning collection, widely read and reproduced on many websites. When you read it, you are astounded to learn that **all the U.S. (and many international) public health agencies took many different actions that led to increased deaths and destruction from COVID and prolonged the pandemic.** \"Avoiding the Trump drug\" served as a great cover story. Taking hydroxychloroquine for COVID was equated to drinking bleach. **But here's the kicker: The authorities knew all about chloroquine and other treatments for COVID-19 before there was a COVID-19 - because they had figured it out for the 2003 [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_1) epidemic and the 2012 [MERS](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html) epidemic, both caused by related coronaviruses. But they hushed it up.** Five Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) U.S. scientists (employed by the U.S. government), along with three Canadian government scientists, in 2005 published a [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16115318/) showing chloroquine was an effective drug against SARS coronaviruses. European scientists [showed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15351731/) the same thing in 2004. The CDC paper concluded: \"... chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-COV infection ... suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.\" Chloroquine looked very promising for both prevention and treatment of the first SARS. After all, it has been used for many decades to prevent and treat malaria. (I took it for prevention, and later for treatment, 50 years ago). Nine years later, in 2014, scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) - the agency run by [Dr. Anthony Fauci](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Anthony-Fauci-Democracy-Childrens/dp/1510766804) - published a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4136000/) showing the same thing. Moreover, the NIAID study revealed that not only did chloroquine work in vitro against the MERS coronavirus, but dozens of existing drugs, which could have been tested in patients as soon as the pandemic started, were also effective against SARS and MERS coronaviruses. This is what the NIAID authors wrote: \"Here we found that 66 of the screened drugs were effective at inhibiting either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection in vitro and that 27 of these compounds were effective against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These data demonstrate the efficiency of screening approved or clinically developed drugs for identification of potential therapeutic options for emerging viral diseases, and also provide an expedited approach for supporting off-label use of approved therapeutics.\" Just", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments.txt:3:5660598125b7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10836, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "SARS and MERS coronaviruses.

These data demonstrate the efficiency of screening approved or clinically developed drugs for identification of potential therapeutic options for emerging viral diseases, and also provide an expedited approach for supporting off-label use of approved therapeutics.\" Just in case you think these papers were flukes, two unrelated groups of European scientists found essentially the same thing. This [2014 European paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24841269/) was published back-to-back with the NIAID paper. I have cited the 2004 European [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15351731/) elsewhere, and these citations can also be found in Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s book, \"[The Real Tony Fauci](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Anthony-Fauci-Democracy-Childrens/dp/1510766804),\" which according to Amazon, has now sold more than 800,000 copies. Please read it. On the other hand, if you are seeking misinformation on COVID, I'd recommend Fauci's own book, \"[Expect the Unexpected](https://www.amazon.com/Expect-Unexpected-Lessons-Service-Forward/dp/1426222459/ref=sr_1_8?crid=3DRL01KIJ8QGG&keywords=tony+Fauci&qid=1644189857&s=books&sprefix=tony+fauci%2Cstripbooks%2C128&sr=1-8).\" I have to repeat myself because the information is so shocking and I don't want you to miss it: **Our governments already knew of options for treating COVID before it appeared - but instead of immediately trying these already identified, safe, cheap and available drugs, and offering early treatments, they did everything they could to stop people from obtaining the chloroquine drugs.** **Please read my [long article](https://merylnassmd.com/how-false-hydroxychloroquine-narrative/) on this suppression and the two articles I wrote [here](https://merylnassmd.com/who-trial-using-potentially-fatal/) and [here](https://merylnassmd.com/even-worse-than-recovery-potentially/) about how patients were administered borderline lethal doses of hydroxychloroquine to give the drug a black eye.** Check the links. Verify that what I have just written is correct. Human beings planned and carried out these medical crimes against humanity. Who are those humans? What are they doing now? This has to be investigated and justice obtained, to prevent such crimes from happening to patients ever again. The \"Why?\" and \"How could this be?!!\" requires people to take a huge leap, in order to understand the world we live in. Many people don't have the fortitude to dissect their worldview and rebuild it in accord with the facts that have spilled out over the last two years. But I am about to present some more facts that I hope you can assimilate into your understanding of the world. It might require a stiff drink, or perhaps some chocolate. Whatever it takes, read on. It might save your life or someone else's. **Ivermectin sales explode** [Ivermectin](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/preventive-ivermectin-reduced-covid-mortality/) was not identified in the studies I mentioned above as a potentially useful coronavirus drug.

There was a brief run on the veterinary drug at this time in the U.S., according to a [warning](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/fda-letter-stakeholders-do-not-use-ivermectin-intended-animals-treatment-covid-19-humans) issued April 10, 2020, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), indicating some people knew it might be an effective COVID treatment and were acquiring veterinary versions. But there was not a lot of buzz and sales did not take off at that time. Here is what the FDA said on April 10, 2020: \"FDA is concerned about the health of consumers who may self-medicate by taking ivermectin products intended for animals, thinking they can be a substitute for ivermectin intended for humans ... Please help us protect public health by alerting FDA of anyone claiming to have a product to prevent or cure COVID-19 and to help safeguard human and animal health by reporting any of these products.\" In December 2020, a full eight months later, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) held a Senate hearing that was focused on ivermectin's benefits for COVID. Intensive care specialist Dr. Pierre Kory, originally a New Yorker, gave a particularly [compelling speech](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Kory-2020-12-08.pdf). **People began paying attention to the drug. YouTube then removed Kory's speech - censoring a Senate hearing!** I think the authorities were initially scared to repeat the same tricks with ivermectin they had used to beat down the chloroquine drugs. And because ivermectin has efficacy late in the disease as well as at the start, and is not toxic at several times the normal dose, some of the tricks used against chloroquine (giving it too late in the disease course or overdosing patients) simply would not work with ivermectin. The U.S. authorities kept quiet. South Africa was the trial balloon. On Christmas Eve 2020, South African authorities banned the importation of ivermectin. However, several local organizations mounted legal actions, and they won. Within several months ivermectin was back on the shelves. Thanks in great measure to the [Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance](https://covid19criticalcare.com/), ivermectin's popularity gradually began to explode. Then the CDC published a [report](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00449.asp) in late August 2021, showing ivermectin prescriptions had quadrupled in a month, and the drug was now selling at 25 times the pre-COVID rate.

It had to be big. It had to be effective. Public health officials couldn't simply take the drug off the market - that would require a long process and would leave a paper trail. **What to do? There was probably only one option: Scare the pants off doctors. Loss of license is the very worst thing you can do to a doctor. Threaten their licenses and they will immediately fall into line. You can't get a prescription if there is no doctor to write it.** The Philippines Department of Health [tested](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1411421/doh-doctors-prescribing-ivermectin-as-covid-19-cure-risk-losing-license) the strategy. The powers that be could also scare the pharmacies. This required stealth - no paper trail. It required intimidation, backed by a one-two punch: actually suspending doctors' (and maybe pharmacists') licenses. You couple that with a huge media offensive, and threats from an industry of medical \"nonprofits.\" You invent \"misinformation\" as a medical misdemeanor, studiously failing to define it. **You make people think the legal prescribing of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine is a crime, even though off-label prescribing is entirely legal under the [Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/laws-enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-fdc-act).** Did Fauci give the order? Was it CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky? Maybe it was acting FDA Commissioner [Dr. Janet Woodcock](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/fda-pfizer-covid-kids-pharma/)? It was probably some combination, plus the public relations professionals managing the messaging and the media. **Here's what happened ... ** **1.** Sen. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), along with several other senators, [introduced the \"Health Misinformation Act](https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/lujan-klobuchar-introduce-legislation-to-hold-digital-platforms-accountable-for-vaccine-and-other-health-related-misinformation/)\" in July 2021, because \"misinformation was putting lives at risk,\" Lujan said.

No reason was given except \"supply and demand.\" But it seemed the supply was cut off everywhere. Ivermectin was dribbled out by the wholesalers, a few pills a week per pharmacy, not enough to supply even one prescription weekly.** Some powerful entity presumably ordered the wholesalers to make the drug (practically) unavailable - with no shortages announced. **I called the main manufacturer in the U.S., Edenbridge, and was told they were producing plenty of ivermectin.** Hydroxychloroquine had been restricted in a variety of ways, determined", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments.txt:6:62451ca83a35", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10839, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "\"supply and demand.\" But it seemed the supply was cut off everywhere.

It had also been restricted by certain manufacturers and pharmacy chains in 2020. Suddenly, in September 2021, it became considerably harder than it already was to obtain. **3.** **In late August 2021, the CDC sent out a [major warning](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00449.asp) about ivermectin but provided only two examples of anyone having a problem with the drug: One person overdosed on an animal version, and one overdosed on ivermectin bought on the internet.** This should not have been news. However, pharmacists and doctors read between the lines and knew this was code for \"verboten.\" Almost all of them stopped dispensing ivermectin at that time. It should be of interest to everyone that our health agencies now speak in coded messages to doctors and pharmacies, presumably to avoid putting their threats on paper and being accountable for them. **4.** Also in August 2021, various \"nonprofit\" medical organizations started issuing warnings, in concert, regarding doctors prescribing ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine, and spreading misinformation - especially about COVID vaccines. These organizations included the [Federation of State Medical Boards](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/vaccine-misinformation-medical-license-u-s-boards-warn-physicians/) (FSMB), the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Pharmacists Association and several specialty boards. Here is an example of the [AMA's language](https://www.ama-assn.org/about/leadership/flow-damaging-covid-19-disinformation-must-end-now): \"A handful of doctors spreading disinformation have fostered belief in scientifically unvalidated and potentially dangerous 'cures' for COVID-19 while increasing vaccine hesitancy ...\" These organizations told doctors they could lose their licenses or board certifications for such behaviors. Mind you, none of these so-called nonprofit organizations has any regulatory authority. Nor do I believe they have any authority to claw back a board certification. They were blowing smoke. And they were probably paid to do so. Who paid them? **5. Over the course of three days at the end of August 2021, national media reported on four doctors in three states whose boards were investigating them for the use of ivermectin.** Hawaii's Medical Board [went after](https://www.mauinews.com/news/local-news/2021/08/board-files-complaints-against-maui-health-officer-physician/) Maui's chief medical officer: \"The Hawaii Medical Board has filed complaints against Maui's top health official and a Valley Isle physician following reports that they backed COVID-19 treatments that state and federal health agencies advise against.\" **They really wanted to make an example by going after a chief medical officer, who had the guts to treat COVID patients.

([Media](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/964643) have reported that eight, 12 or 15 boards of its 71-member boards did so, according to the FSMB.) **7.** On Feb. 7, 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued its own [dire warning](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/02/07/dhs-issues-national-terrorism-advisory-system-ntas-bulletin) about the spread of misinformation, disinformation and a neologism, \"malinformation:\" \"The United States remains in a heightened threat environment fueled by several factors, including an online environment filled with false or misleading narratives and conspiracy theories, and other forms of [mis-, dis- and malinformation](https://www.cisa.gov/mdm) (MDM) introduced and/or amplified by foreign and domestic threat actors. \"These threat actors seek to exacerbate societal friction to sow discord and undermine public trust in government institutions to encourage unrest, which could potentially inspire acts of violence. Mass casualty attacks and other acts of targeted violence conducted by lone offenders and small groups acting in furtherance of ideological beliefs and/or personal grievances pose an ongoing threat to the nation.\" Thus it appears that misinformation and disinformation have been selected to play an important role in a newly developing narrative, as the pandemic restrictions and accompanying narratives become long in the tooth. **8.** I presume the majority of the 71 medical boards' attorneys knew something about the U.S. Constitution, knew that every American has an inalienable right to freedom of speech, and simply ignored the FSMB's exhortation to go after misinformation spreaders. The Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine, however, went along. **Three doctors in Maine, including me, recently had their licenses suspended or threatened for writing waivers for COVID vaccines, \"spreading misinformation\" and/or prescribing ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (all of which are legal activities for doctors).** Boards have broad powers to intervene in the practice of medicine, and their members are shielded from liability as agents of the state. And so they went after a chronic Lyme doctor several years ago, who found, as expected, it would be too onerous to fight back, so he gave up his license. **9.** Here is what the Maine Board", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments.txt:8:ee30c5871be9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10841, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "writing waivers for COVID vaccines, \"spreading misinformation\" and/or prescribing ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (all of which are legal activities for doctors).** Boards have broad powers to intervene in the practice of medicine, and their members are shielded from liability as agents of the state.

My fee was $60 per patient for all the COVID care they needed.** **I am sure the Maine Board had calculated that given all the above, I would not challenge the board's suspension and would simply surrender my license as it would probably cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fight the board's actions in court.** However, I was surprised to find that on the day my license was suspended, there was massive national publicity about my case. The story was on [The Associated Press wire](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-maine-misinformation-35903ae03fc023cf9b52ac089cd19aa3) and covered from the San Francisco Chronicle to the [Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article257335847.html). [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/589379-board-temporarily-suspends-license-of-doctor-accused-of-spreading-false), [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/doctors-medical-license-suspended-over-accusations-spreading-covid-misinformation-1668679), the Daily Beast and many other publications all ran hit pieces about me. **I gathered that my situation was bigger than just a renegade Maine medical board: I had been selected to serve as an example to physicians nationwide who might be prescribing early treatment for COVID.** **Once I realized I was being used as a poster child in a national fear campaign designed to purge doctors who think independently, I decided to fight back.** Fortunately, [Children's Health Defense](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/) is helping with my legal expenses, which is what allows me to mount a strong attack against the bulldozing of free speech, patient autonomy and choice, and the doctor-patient relationship. There is a lot riding on the outcome. *Note: The above article was originally published on [this webpage](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/how-governments-suppressed-effective-covid-treatments/). * **How NIH Got Forbes to Cancel Me After I Wrote About Fauci [Adam Andrzejewski](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/adam-andrzejewski/) March 10, 2022** ***In January 2021, Adam Andrzejewski, founder of [OpenTheBooks.com](https://www.openthebooks.com/), wrote a factual article about Dr. Anthony Fauci in which he pointed out that Fauci is the highest-paid U.S. government employee.

So, it's incumbent upon all of us to give him oversight. In 2011, I founded a [national transparency organization](https://www.openthebooks.com/about-us/) called OpenTheBooks.com. Last year, we filed 47,000 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, the most in American history. We successfully captured and displayed online $12 trillion of federal, state and local spending. **Over the past 14 months - since January 2021 - we investigated [Fauci's](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Anthony-Fauci-Democracy-Childrens/dp/1510766804) financials by filing FOIA requests. When I published our original reporting at Forbes, here is what happened.** **The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Fauci's employer, loaded an artillery shell in their big gun and fired it at the C-suite at Forbes. Quickly, Forbes folded and my column was terminated.** **Background** At OpenTheBooks.com, we believe transparency revolutionizes U.S. public policy and politics. **As a regular contributor to Forbes since May 2014, I [published](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/?sh=6434cf005f81) 206 investigations while writing an estimated quarter-million words on the platform. In May 2018, Forbes upgraded my title to senior policy contributor.** Over this nearly eight-year period, my articles were a-political and used hard data to fact check Republicans, Democrats and unelected bureaucrats. Since 2019, I published 112 articles for 13,031,558 views - an average of 116,353 views per investigation. **Here are three examples of our original reporting:** **The Biden Administration [left behind](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/08/23/staggering-costs--us-military-equipment-left-behind-in-afghanistan/?sh=22f91e9a41db) up to 600,000 weapons, 75,000 military vehicles and 16,000-night vision devices in their hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan.** **No, President Donald Trump [didn't drain the swamp](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/09/27/the-federal-administrative-state-grew--even-under-president-donald-trump/?sh=a6a16a7688d9) - the swamp grew by 50,000 executive agency positions during his four years.** In 2004, [Dr. Fauci](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Anthony-Fauci-Democracy-Childrens/dp/1510766804) [received a permanent pay adjustment](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/10/20/dr-anthony-faucis-little-known-biodefense-work--its-how-he-became-the-highest-paid-federal-employee/?sh=76e528f86081) for his biodefense work. In other words, Fauci was the top-paid federal employee precisely because he was paid to stop a pandemic. **In 2020, I published 36 investigations at Forbes and the editors chose 26 for special showcase on the platform, a designation called \"Editors' Pick.\"** **The first [piece](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/01/25/dr-anthony-fauci-the-highest-paid-employee-in-the-entire-us-federal-government/?sh=3d610378386f) I published in 2021 broke national news that Fauci was the [most highly compensated](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/anthony-fauci-highest-paid-federal-employee/) federal employee and even out-earned the president, four-star generals and 4.3 million colleagues. That piece alone has 900,000+ views.** However, none of the 56 articles I published during 2021-2022 received an \"Editors' Pick\" designation. **Something changed at Forbes after I wrote about [Fauci](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Anthony-Fauci-Democracy-Childrens/dp/1510766804).** **Peak moment** The controversy surrounding Fauci's finances reached a fever pitch in January of this year, and my column at Forbes was right in the middle of it. In the Senate hearing on Jan. 11, U.S.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments.txt:10:bb2744ca34a0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10843, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__coronavirus__suppressed-covid-treatments", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "compensated](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/anthony-fauci-highest-paid-federal-employee/) federal employee and even out-earned the president, four-star generals and 4.3 million colleagues.

In the Senate hearing on Jan. 11, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), cited my Forbes article in his [questioning of Fauci's salary and his financial disclosures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf84NrE81G0). First, Fauci claimed his financials were \"public knowledge,\" then, the hot mic caught the doctor calling the senator a \"moron.\" It was Fauci's code red moment and one of the top national news stories of the day. As reported by The Washington Post, when Fauci went back to NIH, he [admitted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/01/27/fauci-pandemic-threats/), \"Maybe the senator has a point. Maybe my financial investments, though disclosed and available, should be much easier to see.\" In fact, Fauci's financials were not available and I had firsthand knowledge. Immediately, I published the evidence behind the lack of transparency at Forbes on Jan. 12: [No Fauci's Records Aren't Available. Why Won't NIH Immediately Release Them?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2022/01/12/no-faucis-records-arent-available-online-why-wont-nih-immediately-release-them/?sh=561f098646bd) **During an entire year, NIH had refused to produce Fauci's job contract, job description, non-disclosure agreement, conflict of interest, financial disclosures, ethics agreements and royalties** subject to our OpenTheBooks FOIA request. In October 2021, we [sued NIH with Judicial Watch](https://www.openthebooks.com/judicial-watch-sues-on-behalf-of-openthebookscom-for-fauci-financial-disclosure-records-and-royalties-paid-to-nih-employees/) and we still hadn't received the 1,200 pages promised by the agency. PolitiFact fact-checked Sen. Marshall and Fauci on their statements during the hearing, [Fauci said all you have to do is ask](https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/jan/13/fauci-said-all-you-have-do-ask-his-financial-discl/) for his financial disclosure. Yes, but it could take a while. PolitiFact cited my Forbes column as \"Primary Source Material\" for their Truth-O-Meter analysis. In one of the top national news stories of the week, the fact-checkers used my original reporting to hold both sides accountable in the heated U.S. Senate hearing. **Beginning of the end of my column at Forbes** **Rather than putting the full weight of Forbes behind obtaining the 1,200 pages of unreleased Fauci financials, Forbes went after my column.** On Jan. 12, Sen. Marshall [wrote a demand letter](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-marshall-sends-letter-to-dr-fauci-demanding-copies-of-financial-disclosure/) to NIH for Fauci's unredacted ethics/financial disclosures. In the letter, Marshall included footnotes that referenced my Fauci-Forbes columns. On Friday, Jan. 14 at 5:00 p.m. EST, NIH [produced Fauci's unredacted ethics/financial disclosures](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Anthony-Fauci-Financial-Disclosures-for-2020-and-2019.pdf) from 2019 and 2020 subject to Sen. Marshall's [demand letter](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-marshall-sends-letter-to-dr-fauci-demanding-copies-of-financial-disclosure/). The 2020 disclosures had never been released and only heavily redacted 2019 disclosures were previously released. Working through the night, I dug through the 178 pages of disclosure and published the breaking investigation at Forbes on Saturday, Jan. 15 at 3:03 p.m. EST: [Disclosures Show Dr. Fauci's Household Made $1.7 Million In 2020, Including Income, Royalties, Travel Perks And Investment Gains](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2022/01/15/disclosures-released-dr-fauci-household-profits-exceeded-17-million-in-2020--included-income-royalties-travel-perks-and-investment-gains/?sh=6fdc6e057d5f).

Our findings included: **Net worth:** The Fauci household net worth exceeded $10.4 million. **Earnings and gains:** Salaries, benefits, royalties, investment gains in the Fauci household exceeded $1.7 million in 2020. **Fauci's wife:** Christine Grady, the chief bioethicist at NIH [made $234,284 in 2020](https://www.openthebooks.com/executive-agencies-of-the-united-states/?F_Name_S=grady%20christine&Year_S=0). **Royalties:** Fauci made between $100,000 and $1 million as an editor and board member of McGraw-Hill. **Awards:** In 2021, Fauci was awarded a $1 million prize for \"speaking truth to power\" from the Dan David Foundation in Israel. These were newsy findings. However, Justice Louis Brandeis said it best, \"There is no great writing, only great rewriting.\" A regular editor at Forbes suggested some language and style edits and identified a typo - a number that was right in the title and wrong in the text. Quickly, the edits were incorporated while the article had less than 350 views. (Today, the column has 120,000+ views and is the definitive analysis of Fauci's fiscal year (FY) 2020 financial disclosures, the latest available.) Then at 4:22 p.m. EST, I received an email from Caroline Howard, the executive editor at Forbes - a person who I had never spoken to or met during my nearly eight years as a contributor: Let's break down the executive editor's email above. \"I see this is your third article on Fauci in 3 weeks. Huh.\" Each article on Fauci from Dec. 28 through Jan. 15 published original journalism and broke national news. Each article added substantial context to the national discussion. The first article estimated Fauci's $350,000 [golden-parachute retirement pension](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/12/28/dr-anthony-faucis-retirement-pay-will-exceed-350000-per-year--the-largest-in-us-federal-government-history/?sh=342eb360609c) as the highest in U.S. federal history (Dec. 28, 2021). Articles two and three (Jan. 12 and 15, 2022) resulted from the surprisingly heated Senate hearing on Fauci's finances (discussed above). Only six of my 56 published pieces at Forbes during 2021-2022 were on Fauci. But, again, each column was original reporting with important national implications. **\"... the tone of your posts straying into advocacy ...\"** **I am a transparency advocate and it is one reason why Forbes chose me to contribute.** **Currently, there is a war on transparency at NIH with 633 FOIA [requests past due](https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2021/12/24/national_institutes_of_health_slow_walks_633_foia_requests_-_during_a_pandemic_808490.html) triggering 33 lawsuits from various parties in federal court. Good journalism holds the agency accountable.** In fact, since my appointment in May 2014 at Forbes, I only wrote about government transparency and accountability.

All 206 investigations followed the money and properly cited the original research of our auditors at OpenTheBooks.com. \"Everyone who publishes on the Forbes platform must steer clear ...\" The rest of the emailed insinuations are hyperbole and borne out by the fact that Forbes [kept my author archive live](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/?sh=156f72635f81) even after my column was terminated. **National Institutes of Health pressured Forbes** On Sunday, Jan. 16 at 12:43 p.m. EST, six top communications, government relations and public affairs officers at NIH wrote a \"corrections\" email to Randall Lane, the chief content officer and editor of Forbes and me. The email did not contain any substantial corrections. NIH found nothing wrong with the major facts and analysis in my article: the Fauci household's entire cash compensation, benefit, royalty and investment portfolio. In other words, all substantive findings remained intact and validated. **Cancellation** Of course, the real purpose of the NIH's email wasn't to correct my work. Two directors, two bureau chiefs and two top PR officers didn't send an email to the Forbes' chief on a Sunday morning because they wanted to correct the record about Fauci's travel reimbursements. They sent that email to subliminally send a message: We don't like Andrzejewski's oversight work, and we want you to do something about it. **Unfortunately, Forbes folded quickly.** **Within 24 hours of the NIH email to Randall Lane, my regular Forbes editor called and announced new rules. Forbes barred me from writing about Fauci and mandated pre-approval for all future topics.** **Then, Forbes went silent and terminated my column roughly 10 days later on Jan. 28.** On the day Forbes canceled me, the editors bent the knee. A new piece on Fauci published: \"[Fauci's Portrait Will Soon Hang In The Smithsonian](https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2022/01/28/fauci-portrait-smithsonian/?sh=4873bf1c1770).\" Of course, the article was designated an Editors' Pick. Note: Forbes and NIH didn't respond to requests for comment. A Forbes spokesperson [previously told](https://nypost.com/2022/02/15/forbes-columnist-i-was-canceled-over-fauci-coverage/) the New York Post, \"Forbes regularly removes contributors who don't meet our high editorial standards.\" *Additional note: The above article was originally published on [Adam Andrzejewski's OpenTheBooks Substack page](https://openthebooks.substack.com/p/factfindingfaucicanceledforbes?s=r).* [http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/coronavirus/suppressed-covid-treatments&title=](http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/coronavirus/suppressed-covid-treatments&title=) **Finding Balance: WantToKnow.info Inspiration Center** WantToKnow.info believes it is important to balance disturbing cover-up information with inspirational writings which call us to be all that we can be and to work together for positive change.

In the name of \"national security,\" we have been told ever more frequently that we should [not know what is happening](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secrecygraham) behind closed doors in government. Yet we are encouraged to keep vigilant watch over our neighbors, over those who question the government, and over those who look or act different from us, as they could secretly be terrorists in sheep's clothing. Rampant suspicion and secrecy cause us to lose touch with the common humanity we share with all around us. Polarization leads to \"us vs. them\" ways of thinking. Divide and conquer is a tactic that has been used successfully by the power elite of the world for centuries. As long as people focus on blaming and attacking \"the enemy,\" they are not likely to look for the deeper causes of their problems. **Controlling factions of the power elite work to keep public and [media attention](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediacorruption) focused on issues which divide us into two polarized camps, so that their greatest concerns of [power and control](https://www.WantToKnow.info/divinewisdomunderstanding) go unnoticed.** The power brokers then control both sides of the divided public by assuring that corporate ownership of the media and key candidates from all political parties support their deeper power and polarization agendas, which often involve [war profiteering](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup). A final subtle, yet powerful method of gaining control is to distract people from their purpose in life. Consider that television, radio, and movies have been filled with ever more greed, violence, and empty sex. Our educational system has increasingly prioritized passing tests over developing intelligence and creativity. Excessive corporate control of the media has [limited what news we receive](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediainformation#censored), and often shaped our decisions and the way we think. **Our attention has been subtly diverted from our deeper purpose in life to the more superficial attractions of sex, consumerism, and money.** When we succumb to fear, secrecy, and polarization, and when we lose touch with our sense of purpose in life, elements of the global elite are able to exert ever more control over our lives and world. **The New Paradigm** What can we do about all this?

Then choose to live your intentions and follow your purpose to the best of your ability every day. By choosing to live with clear direction and focus, life becomes deeper and more meaningful. This then weakens the seduction of consumerism and media hype which distract us from our purpose, and allows us to more effectively focus on creating a new paradigm. **Choose to transform fear into acceptance and love.** When we notice ourselves feeling fear, we can trace the roots of that fear, so that we are able to [identify our core challenges](https://www.WantToKnow.info/coreissue) and deal more consciously with them. We can open to guidance from friends, teachers, and spiritual sources in helping us to move from fear to [acceptance and understanding](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife2#acceptance). We can also transform our fears through welcoming the ever-present love of our divine creator, and the love that lies always deep within our own hearts, and in the hearts of those around us. In doing this, we begin to recognize fear as an invitation to growth. Become aware of when you are playing the role of victim, and choose instead to **take personal responsibility for creating a new paradigm**. In blaming others for our problems, we often avoid taking responsibility for how much we are involved in creating these problems through the choices we make. Whenever we catch ourselves playing the role of victim by blaming others (including the power elite) for everything that's wrong in our lives, we can choose to take a [look inside ourselves](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/victim_or_creator_vs), and to explore and take responsibility for our role in what's happening.

Are we withholding information out of our own self-interest, or because this is really [what's best](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife2) for all involved? And on a deeper level, where are we avoiding being honest with ourselves? **Move beyond polarization and the focus on \"good vs. evil\" and \"us vs. them.\"** Consider the possibility that all of us are doing what we believe to be right based upon our beliefs, circumstances, and upbringing. Each of us has [a place in our heart](https://www.momentoflove.org/) that wants only to love and be loved. As we focus less on blaming and judging \"them\" and more on [supporting the highest motive](https://www.WantToKnow.info/transformation#nurturance) in all people - including members of the power elite - we increasingly come to see that we are all one human family, and that we can choose to transform our world by working together for the good of all. **And finally, come together in groups and communities **to support each other in making these positive changes. In these [groups and communities](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources#community), we support each other in transforming fear into acceptance and love. We exchange information about all that is being hidden from us and explore ways to move [beyond polarization](https://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/20a_beyond_duality). We also share our life purpose and intentions and encourage each other to live these as fully as we can. ****And we inspire each other to take responsibility for our lives and to be the best that we can be.

For vaccine manufacturers, it's a bonanza: **Influenza shots ... are a multibillion-dollar global business**. But how good are they? Last month, in a step tantamount to heresy in the public health world, scientists at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota released [a report](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/files/80/ccivi%20report.pdf) saying that **influenza vaccinations provide only modest protection for healthy young and middle-age adults, and little if any protection for those 65 and older. Moreover, the report's authors concluded, federal vaccination recommendations ... are based on inadequate evidence and poorly executed studies.** Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy [stated,] \"It does not protect as promoted. It's all a sales job: it's all public relations.\" While researching the report ... the authors discovered a recurring error in influenza vaccine studies that led to an exaggeration of the vaccine's effectiveness. They also discovered 30 inaccuracies in the statement on influenza vaccines put forth by the expert panel that develops vaccine recommendations, all of which favor the vaccine. The new report from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy is not the first to point out the shortcomings of influenza vaccines, however.

However, such treatments offer a very different outlook with regard to recurring revenue versus chronic therapies,\" analyst Salveen Richter wrote in the note to clients. \"While this proposition carries tremendous value for patients and society, it could represent a challenge for genome medicine developers looking for sustained cash flow.\" Richter cited Gilead Sciences' treatments for hepatitis C, which achieved cure rates of more than 90 percent. The company's U.S. sales for these hepatitis C treatments peaked at $12.5 billion in 2015, but have been falling ever since. \"GILD is a case in point, where the success of its hepatitis C franchise has gradually exhausted the available pool of treatable patients,\" the analyst wrote. \"In the case of infectious diseases such as hepatitis C, curing existing patients also decreases the number of carriers able to transmit the virus to new patients, thus the incident pool also declines. Where an incident pool remains stable (eg, in cancer) the potential for a cure poses less risk to the sustainability of a franchise.\" **Note:** Many cancer treatments have been suppressed, sometimes in brutal ways, because the medical profession would lose the huge profits of traditional cancer treatments.

For a typical angioplasty, a procedure that opens a blocked blood vessel to the heart, the average U.S. price is $32,200, compared with $6,400 in the Netherlands, or $7,400 in Switzerland, the survey finds. A typical M.R.I. scan costs $1,420 in the United States, but around $450 in Britain. An injection of Herceptin, an important breast cancer treatment, costs $211 in the United States, compared with $44 in South Africa. These examples aren't outliers. Researchers at Harvard conducted an exhaustive study last year of things that make health systems in developed countries different from one another. The clear finding of those researchers was that it's this huge gap in prices ... that helps explain why the United States is such an expensive place to be sick. **Note:** For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing [news articles on health](https://www.wanttoknow.info/healthnewsarticles) from reliable major media sources. **How Independent Are Vaccine Defenders?** **2008-07-25, CBS News** [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/25/cbsnews_investigates/main4296175.shtml](https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/25/cbsnews_investigates/main4296175.shtml) They're some of the most trusted voices in the defense of vaccine safety: the American Academy of Pediatrics, Every Child By Two, and pediatrician Dr. Paul Offit. But CBS News has found these three have something more in common - strong financial ties to the industry whose products they promote and defend. The vaccine industry gives millions to the Academy of Pediatrics for conferences, grants, medical education classes and even helped build their headquarters.

In the current system, **if a promising compound can't be patented, it is highly unlikely ever to make it to market - no matter how well it performs in the laboratory.** **The development of new cancer drugs is crippled as a result.** The reason for this problem is that bringing a new drug to market is extremely expensive. In 2001, the estimated cost was $802 million; today it is approximately $1 billion. To ensure a healthy return on such staggering investments, drug companies seek to formulate new drugs in a way that guarantees watertight patents. In the meantime, cancer patients miss out on treatments that may be highly effective and less expensive to boot. In 2004, Johns Hopkins researchers discovered that an off-the-shelf compound called 3-bromopyruvate could arrest the growth of liver cancer in rats. The results were dramatic; moreover, the investigators estimated that the cost to treat patients would be around 70 cents per day. Yet, three years later, no major drug company has shown interest in developing this drug.

Her new book, \"The Truth About the Drug Companies,\" is a sober, clear-eyed attack on the excesses of drug company power. How does the drug industry deceive us? It plies attending physicians with expense-paid junkets to St. Croix and Key West, Fla., where they are given honoraria and consulting fees to listen to promotional presentations. It promotes new or little-known diseases such as \"social anxiety disorder\" and \"premenstrual dysphoric disorder\" as a way of selling the drugs that treat them. It sets up phony front groups disguised as \"patient advocacy organizations.\" It hires ghostwriters to produce misleading scientific articles and then pays academic physicians to sign on as authors. It sends paid lackeys and shills out onto the academic lecture circuit to ''educate\" doctors about a drug's unapproved uses. It hires multinational PR firms to trumpet dubious studies as scientific breakthroughs while burying the studies that are likely to harm sales. It buys up the results of publicly funded research. It maintains a political chokehold on the American public by donating more money to political campaigns than any other industry in the country. For many years the drug industry has reaped the highest profit margins of any industry in America.

Dr. Diane Harper says young girls and their parents should receive more complete warnings before receiving the vaccine to prevent cervical cancer. Dr. Harper helped design and carry out the Phase II and Phase III safety and effectiveness studies to get Gardasil approved, and authored many of the published, scholarly papers about it. She has been a paid speaker and consultant to Merck. **It's highly unusual for a researcher to publicly criticize a medicine or vaccine she helped get approved.** Dr. Harper joins a number of consumer watchdogs, vaccine safety advocates, and parents who question the vaccine's risk-versus-benefit profile. **She says data available for Gardasil shows that ... there is no data showing that it remains effective beyond five years. This raises questions about the CDC's recommendation that the series of shots be given to girls as young as 11-years old.** \"If we vaccinate 11 year olds and the protection doesn't last... we've put them at harm from side effects, small but real, for no benefit,\" says Dr. Harper. \"The benefit to public health is nothing, there is no reduction in cervical cancers, they are just postponed, unless the protection lasts for at least 15 years, and over 70% of all sexually active females of all ages are vaccinated.\" She also says that enough serious side effects have been reported after Gardasil use that the vaccine could prove riskier than the cervical cancer it purports to prevent. Cervical cancer is usually entirely curable when detected early through normal Pap screenings. **Note:** For more on the dangers of vaccines, see the deeply revealing reports from reliable major media sources [available here](https://www.wanttoknow.info/vaccinesnewsarticles). **'Cannot be trusted ... causing harm': Top medical journal takes on big pharma** **2019-12-04, *Sydney Morning Herald *** [https://www.smh.com.au/national/cannot-be-trusted-causing-harm-top-medical-jo...](https://www.smh.com.au/national/cannot-be-trusted-causing-harm-top-medical-journal-takes-on-big-pharma-20191203-p53ggj.html) **A leading medical journal is launching a global campaign to separate medicine from big pharma.

Centre for Disease Control originally thought seasonal flu shots from 2008 might offer extra protection. They were puzzled to find instead, seasonal flu vaccination almost doubled the risk of infection** with pandemic flu. Dr. Danuta Skowronski and her colleagues went on to do five more studies during the summer that showed the same effect in people and in ferrets, which are considered the best animal model of flu. What was originally called \"[the Canadian problem](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/seasonal-flu-shot-may-increase-h1n1-risk-1.829675)\" has since been found in a randomized control trial by researchers in Hong Kong ... Japan and the U.S. Researchers in several countries have found a blunting or \"interference\" effect between previous seasonal vaccines and reduced levels of vaccine protection in later years. \"People do not have a good explanation for why,\" said Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infection prevention and control at Toronto's University Health Network. \"We have kind of hyped this vaccine so much for so long we are starting to believe our own hype. Really, what we should be doing is looking for better vaccines,\" Gardam said. In the meantime, public health officials who aim to protect people from flu complications need to grapple with the imperfections of a vaccine given every year to a moving target of strains. **Note:** Healthcare workers in New York protested the [government mandate](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-H1N1-vaccination-reject-health-care-workers) that they be given this vaccine, from which drug companies made [billions of dollars](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-Vaccines-H1N1-flu-Billions-profit-drug-companies-doctors).

The research overwhelmingly finds the drug to be ineffective, but it was still approved in the U.K. In order to get approval of the drug in Europe, the manufacturer had simply not published its negative data.** Seven trials had been conducted comparing reboxetine against a placebo. Only one, conducted in 254 patients, had a neat, positive result, and that one was published in an academic journal, for doctors and researchers to read. But six more trials were conducted, in almost 10 times as many patients. All of them showed that reboxetine was no better than a dummy sugar pill. None of these trials was published. I had no idea they existed. It got worse. The trials comparing reboxetine against other drugs showed exactly the same picture: three small studies, 507 patients in total, showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other drug. They were all published. But 1,657 patients' worth of data was left unpublished, and this unpublished data showed that patients on reboxetine did worse than those on other drugs. **Note:** For deeply revealing reports from reliable major media sources on pharmaceutical corruption, [click here](https://www.wanttoknow.info/pharmaceuticalcorruptionnewsarticles). **FDA \"Corruption\" Letter Authenticated: Lawyers, Start Your Engines!** **2010-03-12, CBS News** [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-corruption-letter-authenticated-lawyers-start...](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-corruption-letter-authenticated-lawyers-start-your-engines/) The FDA has \"certified\" a 2009 letter sent anonymously by FDA staff to President Obama describing \"systemic corruption and wrongdoing that permeates all levels of FDA.\" The FDA's official recognition of [the letter](http://i.bnet.com/blogs/cert-fda-letter-to-the-president-4-2-09-and-trans-team-1-7-09.pdf) means that lawyers who want to use it to demonstrate that the FDA isn't perfect won't have to go through weeks of tedious discovery demands to find someone at the FDA who can officially say, \"Yup, we sent that.\" That's going to be a headache for drug companies who often defend their drugs in court by saying, \"Hey, the FDA said this product was fine and we did everything they asked -- so it's not fair to hold us responsible.\" Plaintiffs' lawyers can now hold up the letter in court and argue that drug companies have been on notice that **the FDA is riddled with politics, conflicts of interest and outright corruption, and is, as the letter says, \"fundamentally broken**.\" **Written by a group", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__drug-companies-trust-corruption.txt:11:40720d0c05ec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10872, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__drug-companies-trust-corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__drug-companies-trust-corruption", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "headache for drug companies who often defend their drugs in court by saying, \"Hey, the FDA said this product was fine and we did everything they asked -- so it's not fair to hold us responsible.\" Plaintiffs' lawyers can now hold up the letter in court and argue that drug companies have been on notice that **the FDA is riddled with politics, conflicts of interest and outright corruption, and is, as the letter says, \"fundamentally broken**.\" **Written by a group of scientists on FDA letter head -- but with their names blacked out for fear of retaliation -- the letter describes a nightmare of bungling and self-dealing among higher-ups at the drug safety agency.** It begs Obama to step in and reform the shop: \"... many other FDA managers who have failed to protect the American public, who have violated laws, rules, and regulations, who have suppressed or altered scientific or technological findings and conclusions, who have abused their power and authority, and who have engaged in illegal retaliation against those who speak out, have not been held accountable and remain in place.\" **Note:** The FDA [actively persecutes](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-fda-spied-whistleblowing-scientists) whistle-blowers, placed a former [Monsanto lobbyist](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-fda-deputy-with-ties-monsanto-draws-fire) in a high ranking position, and gives industrial food companies [preferential treatment](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-organic-small-farmers-fret-over-fda-regulation) over small farmers.

More than 60 countries have so far ordered large stocks of the antiviral medication - the only oral medicine believed to be effective against the deadly H5N1 strain of the disease - to try to protect their people. The United Nations estimates that a pandemic could kill 150 million people worldwide.** The drug was developed by a Californian biotech company, Gilead Sciences. Mr Rumsfeld was on the board of Gilead from 1988 to 2001, and was its chairman from 1997.** He then left to join the Bush administration, but retained a huge shareholding. The 2005 report showed that, in all, he owned shares worth up to $95.9m, from which he got an income of up to $13m. The firm made a loss in 2003, the year before concern about bird flu started. Then revenues from Tamiflu almost quadrupled, to $44.6m, helping put the company well into the black. Sales almost quadrupled again, to $161.6m last year. **Note:** If the above link fails, [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20090321083457/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-rumsfeld-makes-5m-killing-on-bird-flu-drug-469599.html).

Some doctors have stopped offering immunizations because they say they cannot afford to buy these potentially lifesaving preventive treatments that insurers often reimburse poorly, sometimes even at a loss. Childhood immunizations are so vital to public health that the [Affordable Care Act](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/health/policy/20consumer.html) mandates their coverage at no out-of-pocket cost and they are generally required for school entry. **Old vaccines have been reformulated with higher costs. New ones have entered the market at once-unthinkable prices. Together, since 1986, they have pushed up the average cost to fully vaccinate a child with private insurance to the age of 18 to $2,192 from $100**, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The costs for the federal government, which buys half of all vaccines for the nation's children, have increased 15-fold during that period. The most expensive shot for young children ... is Prevnar 13, which prevents diseases caused by pneumococcal bacteria, from ear infections to pneumonia. Each shot is priced at $136, and most states require children to get four doses before entering day care or preschool. Pfizer, the sole manufacturer, had revenues of nearly [$4 billion](http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/analysts-see-15b-boost-pfizer-better-expected-prevnar-13-data/2014-03-13) from its Prevnar vaccine line last year. **Note:** Read an [excellent article](https://www.jeffereyjaxen.com/blog/vaccine-kingpins-rake-in-billions) on how big Pharma is raking in the big bucks on vaccines which haven't even been adequately tested for safety.

In the United States a legal case brought against drug firm Pfizer turned up internal company documents showing that it employed a New York medical writing agency. One document analyses articles about the anti-depressant Zoloft. Some of the articles lacked only one thing: a doctor's name. In the margin the agency had put the initials TBD, which Healy assumes means 'to be determined'. Dr Richard Smith, editor of the *British Journal of Medicine*, admitted ghostwriting was a 'very big problem'. 'We are being hoodwinked by the drug companies.

The suit says the company and its owners, the Sackler family ... engaged in a decade of deception to push their pharmaceuticals, namely the painkiller OxyContin, on doctors and patients, publicly denying what internal documents show they privately knew to be true: that the highly addictive drugs were resulting in overdoses and deaths. Purdue examined selling overdose antidotes, including Narcan, as \"complementary\" products to the same doctors to whom it sold its opioids, the lawsuit claims, and although the company maintained a ledger of doctors it suspected of inappropriate opioid prescriptions and other forms of abuse, dubbed \"Region Zero,\" it continued to collect revenue from those doctors.

Yes, Ebola is a dangerous disease. According to the World Health Organization, the average [fatality rate is around 50%](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/). Yet the vast majority of these cases have been in African countries where health conditions and even health care is severely lacking in comparison with the industrialized world. Thousands have died in the current pandemic in Africa, yet the number who have died in developed nations can be counted on one hand. Only a few have been infected outside Africa, yet every death and even infection in Europe or the US makes major headlines. Outside of Africa, people have a better chance of being killed by lightening than by Ebola. **Remember the worldwide fear and paranoia spread by the media and governments during the anthrax scare after 9/11, the avian flu crisis in 2005, and the swine flu pandemic in 2009?** In each of these, government and media combined to massively spread fear of widespread deaths that never became a reality. So who benefited from all this fear mongering then, and who is benefiting now? First, let's look at the 2001 anthrax scare. The total number of people eventually infected was around a couple dozen. [Five people died](http://www.npr.org/2011/02/15/93170200/timeline-how-the-anthrax-terror-unfolded). Yet this [*Washington Post*article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/15/AR2005091502456_2.html) cites the FBI's \"damage\" estimate of over $1 billion. Hundreds of millions were spent just to [clean up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_anthrax_attacks#Aftermath) buildings thought to be at risk. Yet were they really, or was this a way of channeling millions to the corporations involved? Bayer sold the US government [one hundred million tablets](http://old.post-gazette.com/nation/20020911molnar911P9.asp) of Cipro at [nearly $100 million](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2739515/Bitter-pill.html) to combat the \"huge\" anthrax threat. Yet the vast majority of those pills were never taken and have now passed their expiration date. So who profited here? Billions of dollars of taxpayer money flowed into the coffers of the corporations involved in handling all of this. More details are [available here](http://www.holmesreport.com/opinion-info/1346/Bayer-Responds-to-Cipro-Crisis.aspx). What about the avian flu in 2005? The mortality rate from this virus was [about 60%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mortality_from_H5N1), similar to the current Ebola outbreak. Predictions were made that this virus could easily spread to anywhere from [two million to one billion](http://www.psandman.com/col/pandemic.htm) people.

How many others did likewise? Note that the usefulness of Tamiflu was [highly questioned](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article208383.ece) in treating avian flu. So who really benefited here? And **why does there seem to be a [revolving door](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/08/02/merck-flu-vaccine-conflicts.aspx) between government and Big Pharma? ** Then there was the swine flu in 2009-2010. The H1N1 swine flu was certainly much more widespread, with CDC data giving an [estimated number of cases](http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates_2009_h1n1.htm) varying from 40 to 90 million and between 9,000 and 18,000 deaths in the US alone. Yet was this flu much different from the normal yearly flu? The annual death rate in the US from the regular flu is [estimated by the CDC](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/08/26/129456941/annual-flu-death-average-fluctuates-depending-on-how-you-slice-it) at 36,000. Predictions of massive deaths around the world, like with the earlier avian flu, never materialized. Once again we have to ask who benefited from all the swine flu fear mongering. A [Reuters article states](http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/04/10/millions-dollars-wasted-on-flu-drug-tamiflu-review-finds/), \"The United States has spent more than $1.3 billion buying a strategic reserve of antivirals including Tamiflu, while the British government has spent almost $703 million (424 million pounds) on a stockpile of some 40 million Tamiflu doses.\" Yet the article quotes a lead researcher stating, \"There is no credible way these drugs could prevent a pandemic,\" **And remember that all these drugs have expiration dates of just a few years, so most of them are now expired. ** During the swine flu scare, we were all asked to get the Pandemrix flu vaccine to prevent the swine flu.

The pandemic never occurred. After reviewing studies of Tamiflu during the avian flu scare, Dr. Tom Jefferson ... had concluded in a 2006 report that the drug was effective. \"But,\" said the article, \"several years later, another physician challenged that conclusion because 8 of 10 studies in a meta-analysis - a review of studies - that Jefferson relied on had never been published.\" That prompted Jefferson to seek the raw data. \"He was stymied when several authors and the manufacturer gave one excuse after another for why it couldn't supply the actual data.** Jefferson's concern turned to outrage when two employees of a communications company ... [revealed] they had been paid to ghostwrite some of the Tamiflu studies [and] had been given explicit instructions to ensure that a key message was embedded in the articles: Flu is a threat, and Tamiflu is the answer. **\"After reanalyzing the raw data finally made available (they still don't have it all), Jefferson and his colleagues published their review [in December 2009], saying that once the unpublished studies were excluded, there was no proof that Tamiflu reduced serious flu complications like pneumonia or death.\" In short, it appears the pharmaceutical companies had been as cunning in conning the public on matters of health as Wall Street had been on matters of wealth. **Note:** For lots more from reliable sources on pharmaceutical corruption, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/pharmaceuticalcorruptionnewsarticles). **Reports accuse WHO of exaggerating H1N1 threat, possible ties to drug makers** **2010-06-04, *Washington Post*** [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/04/AR20100604030...](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/04/AR2010060403034.html) European criticism of the World Health Organization's handling of the H1N1 pandemic intensified ... with the release of two reports that accused the agency", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__ebola-pandemic.txt:3:c436565e104c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10881, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__ebola-pandemic.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__ebola-pandemic", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "In short, it appears the pharmaceutical companies had been as cunning in conning the public on matters of health as Wall Street had been on matters of wealth. **Note:** For lots more from reliable sources on pharmaceutical corruption, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/pharmaceuticalcorruptionnewsarticles). **Reports accuse WHO of exaggerating H1N1 threat, possible ties to drug makers** **2010-06-04, *Washington Post*** [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/04/AR20100604030...](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/04/AR2010060403034.html) European criticism of the World Health Organization's handling of the H1N1 pandemic intensified ... with the release of two reports that accused the agency of exaggerating the threat posed by the virus and failing to disclose possible influence by the pharmaceutical industry on its recommendations for how countries should respond. **The WHO's response caused widespread, unnecessary fear and prompted countries around the world to waste millions of dollars.

The first report ... came from the Social, Health and Family Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which launched an investigation in response to allegations that the WHO's response to the pandemic was influenced by drug companies that make antiviral drugs and vaccines.

That's according to state-by-state test results obtained in a three-month-long CBS News investigation. **Why the uncertainty about who has and who hasn't had H1N1 flu?

Yet with regard to avian flu, hyped sound bites predominate. When President Bush asked Congress for $7.1 billion toward \"pandemic flu preparedness,\" even his critics replied \"not enough.\" **What is lacking in the overall discussion about pandemic flu is disagreement, criticism, and skepticism - once the bedrock of science - from researchers willing to question and test the data. **Some facts: According to the World Health Organization, the first \"outbreak\" of the H5N1 virus, also known as avian flu, killed six people in 1997. Since then, H5N1 has allegedly killed 97 more worldwide, the majority of whom lived in poor, rural areas and had direct contact with dead or sick birds often kept in unsanitary conditions. These numbers do not suggest the human population faces an insurmountable threat from this virus. Peter Palese, flu scientist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, told The New York Times in a [Nov. 8, 2005 article](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/08/science/08flu.html?ex=1289106000&en=8c0ba3f1aeb03a46&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) that H5N1 is a false alarm. The virus has been \"around for more than a dozen years, but it hasn't jumped into the human population.\" The reason? It probably can't. There are better ways to promote America's health than selling sickness through the language of fear.

Some scientists are questioning whether the research should ever have been undertaken in a university laboratory, instead of at a military facility. For the first time the researchers have been able to mutate the H5N1 strain of avian influenza so that it can be transmitted easily through the air in coughs and sneezes. Until now, it was thought that H5N1 bird flu could only be transmitted between humans via very close physical contact.

The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has killed hundreds of millions of birds since it first appeared in 1996, but has so far infected only about 600 people who came into direct contact with infected poultry.** What makes H5N1 so dangerous, though, is that it has killed about 60 per cent of those it has infected, making it one of the most lethal known forms of influenza in modern history - a deadliness moderated only by its inability (so far) to spread easily through airborne water droplets. **Note:** For solid evidence that Lyme disease originated in a secret government germ laboratory, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/11/12_abuse_children_anthrax_suit_germ_laboratory#lyme). **Doctor says bird flu drug is 'useless'** **2005-12-04, *London Times*** [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article208383.ece](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article208383.ece) A Vietnamese doctor who has treated dozens of victims of avian flu claims the drug being stockpiled around the world to combat a pandemic is 'useless' against the virus. Dr Nguyen Tuong Van runs the intensive care unit at the Centre for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi and has treated 41 victims of H5N1. **Van followed World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and gave her patients Tamiflu, but concluded it had no effect.** 'We place no importance on using this drug on our patients,' she said. 'Tamiflu is really only meant for treating ordinary type A flu. It was not designed to combat H5N1 . . . (Tamiflu) is useless.' Roche, the company that makes Tamiflu, has sold stockpiles of the drug to 40 countries and insists there is clear evidence it will protect against a future flu virus. However, it stresses the drug must be given within 48 hours to be effective. The WHO admitted Tamiflu had not been widely successful in humans. 'However, we believe in many Asian countries it hasn't been used until late in the illness,' a spokesman said. **Note: Yet hundreds of millions of dollars were spent to stockpile this drug.** It's quite interesting that the former chairman of the board of directors of the company that made Tamiflu is current Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

The review, authored by Oxford University, claims that **Roche, the drug's Swiss manufacturer, gave a \"false impression\" of its effectiveness **and accuses the company of \"sloppy science\".** The study found that Tamiflu, which was given to 240,000 people in the UK at a rate of 1,000 a week, has been linked to suicides of children in Japan and suggested that, far from easing flu symptoms, it could actually worsen them.** Roche claimed at the time of the 2009 swine flu outbreak that trials had shown that it would reduce hospital admissions and complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis or sinusitis. Based on [these claims], the Department of Health bought around 40 million doses of Tamiflu at a cost of 424 million and prescribed it to around 240,000 people. In 2009, 0.5 per cent of the entire NHS budget was spent on the drug. However, researchers from The Cochrane Collaboration, a not-for-profit organisation which carries out reviews of health data, found that Tamiflu only cut flu-like symptoms from seven days to 6.3 days and there was no evidence of a reduction in hospital admissions. Eight children who took the drug in Japan ended up committing suicide after suffering psychotic episodes. Other side effects included kidney problems, nausea, vomiting and headaches. Many people reported feeling anxious or depressed when taking the drug. **Note:** We sent out numerous messages at the time of all the fear-mongering around the avian and swine flu scares that this was wasting huge amounts of money. Of course the money wasn't just wasted, much of it went into the pockets of Donald Rumsfeld and others, as reported in [this newspaper article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-donald-rumsfeld-makes-5-million-bird-avian-flu-drug-tamiflu-swine-flu). **Evidence grows for narcolepsy link to GSK swine flu shot** **2013-01-22, MSNBC/Reuters** [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50547267#.UQK87vJWKSo](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50547267#.UQK87vJWKSo) Emelie Olsson is plagued by hallucinations and nightmares.

Health chiefs should admit they were wrong - yet again - about a global pandemic. Let me recap. Six months ago [the] BBC was intoning nightly statistics on what \"could\" happen as \"the deadly virus\" took hold. The happy-go-lucky virologist, John Oxford, said half the population could be infected, and that his lowest estimate was 6,000 dead. The chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, bandied about any figure that came into his head, settling on \"65,000 could die\", peaking at 350 corpses a day. The media went berserk. The World Health Organisation declared a \"six-level alert\" so as to \"prepare the world for an imminent attack\". ** If anyone dared question this drivel, they were dismissed by Donaldson as \"extremists\".** When people started reporting swine flu to be even milder than ordinary flu, he accused them of complacency and told them to \"wait", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__ebola-pandemic.txt:9:3d1c497ddc6e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10887, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__ebola-pandemic.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__ebola-pandemic", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "Donaldson, bandied about any figure that came into his head, settling on \"65,000 could die\", peaking at 350 corpses a day.

Gerberding, who led the CDC from 2002 to 2009 and stepped down when President Barack Obama took office, will head up the company's $5 billion global vaccine business that includes shots to prevent chickenpox, cervical cancer and pneumonia. **She had led CDC from one crisis to another, including the investigation into the anthrax attacks that killed five people in 2001, the H5N1 avian influenza, the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS**, and various outbreaks of food poisoning. She may be charged with reigniting flagging sales of Merck's Gardasil vaccine to prevent cervical cancer by protecting against human papillomavirus or HPV. After an encouraging launch Gardasil sales have been falling and were down 22 percent in the third quarter at $311 million. **Note:** So the head of the CDC now is in charge of vaccines at one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Could this be considered conflict of interest? Could this possibly be payback for supporting the vaccine agenda so strongly for years? **In Germany, a Better Vaccine for Politicians?** **2009-10-27, *Time* magazine** [http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1932366,00.html](http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1932366,00.html) As Germany launched its mass-vaccination program against the H1N1 flu virus on Monday, the government found itself fending off accusations of favoritism because it was offering one vaccine believed to have fewer side effects to civil servants, politicians and soldiers, and another, potentially riskier vaccine to everyone else. The German government prepared for its mass-vaccination campaign earlier this year by ordering 50 million doses of the Pandemrix vaccine. **The vaccine, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, contains an immunity-enhancing chemical compound, known as an adjuvant, whose side effects are not yet entirely known. The Interior Ministry confirmed that it had ordered a different vaccine, Celvapan, for government officials and the military.** Celvapan, which is made by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Baxter, does not contain an adjuvant and is believed to have fewer side effects. **Note:** For a revealing article exposing more on this critical issue, [click here](http://www.examiner.com/x-6495-US-Intelligence-Examiner~y2009m10d30-Swine-flu-vaccine-safety-German-politicians-get-safer-swine-flu-vaccine). **Study prompts provinces to rethink flu", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__ebola-pandemic.txt:10:2a8d93b6bcc6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10888, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__ebola-pandemic.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__ebola-pandemic", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "vaccine, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, contains an immunity-enhancing chemical compound, known as an adjuvant, whose side effects are not yet entirely known.

Distributed for peer review last week, **the study confounded infectious-disease experts in suggesting that people vaccinated against seasonal flu are twice as likely to catch swine flu. The paper has since convinced several provincial health agencies to announce hasty suspensions of seasonal flu vaccinations, long-held fixtures of public-health planning.** \"It has confused things very badly,\" said Dr. Ethan Rubinstein, head of adult infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba. \"And it has certainly cost us credibility from the public because of conflicting recommendations. Until last week, there had always been much encouragement to get the seasonal flu vaccine.\" On Sunday Quebec joined Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Nova Scotia in suspending seasonal flu shots for anyone under 65 years of age. Quebec's Health Ministry announced it would postpone vaccinations until January. B.C. is expected to announce a similar suspension during a press conference Monday morning. Other provinces, including Manitoba, are still pondering a response to the research. Dr. Rubinstein, who has read the study, said it appears sound. \"There are a large number of authors, all of them excellent and credible researchers,\" he said. \"And the sample size is very large - 12 or 13 million people taken from the central reporting systems in three provinces. The research is solid.\" **Note:** For lots more from reliable sources on the dangers of vaccines, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/vaccinesnewsarticles). **TV host Andrew Castle: 'my daughter almost died from Tamiflu'** **2009-08-11, *Times of London* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/Swine_flu/article6791102.ece](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/Swine_flu/article6791102.ece) The [UK] Health Secretary appeared on breakfast television this morning in a bid to reassure concerned parents after scientists warned that children should not be given Tamiflu. Instead he was confronted by a GMTV presenter who claimed that the drug had almost killed his daughter. Andy Burnham insisted that the Government was right to advise children to take the anti-viral drug despite a warning from researchers at the University of Oxford who called on the Department of Health urgently to reconsider its pandemic strategy.

Georgina, 16, was given Tamiflu when five pupils at Alleyn's School in south London were diagnosed with the illness in May. Castle, also a BBC tennis commentator, said he feared for his daughter's life as medical professionals backed away from the potentially contagious child. He said: **\"Nobody checked that she had swine flu beforehand. The Health Protection Agency just handed it out at Alleyn's School in south London and a lot of kids suffered in the school very heavily. It almost cost my older child her life.\"** The study published yesterday warned that Tamiflu can cause vomiting in some children, which can lead to dehydration and the need for hospital treatment. **Note:** Remember that the drug companies often place profits above public health.

And an official of the World Health Organization's European operation said the body is closely monitoring the investigation into the events that took place at Baxter International's research facility in Orth-Donau, Austria. The contaminated product, a mix of H3N2 seasonal flu viruses and unlabelled H5N1 viruses, was supplied to an Austrian research company. The Austrian firm, Avir Green Hills Biotechnology, then sent portions of it to sub-contractors in the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Germany. The contamination incident, which is being investigated by the four European countries, came to light when the subcontractor in the Czech Republic inoculated ferrets with the product and they died. Ferrets shouldn't die from exposure to human H3N2 flu viruses. Public health authorities concerned about what has been described as a \"serious error\" on Baxter's part have assumed the death of the ferrets meant the H5N1 virus in the product was live. But the company, Baxter International Inc., has been parsimonious about the amount of information it has released about the event.

By making my body a top priority and committing to the below health practices even when I'm really busy, I have no doubt my body will serve me well until a ripe old age. If you don't currently have good health practices, there's no time to start like now - no matter how old you are. Experiment with different exercises until you find ones that you enjoy. If you don't enjoy what you're doing, you will not likely continue. If you set aside just 15 minutes a day and find health practices that you enjoy, I guarantee you will soon feel the benefits both physically and emotionally, and you will almost certainly live a longer, healthier life. **A healthy body supports a clear mind and heart, which then allows you to more easily create the life you envision and to serve as a powerful force for transformation in your life and our world. ** I am fortunate at age 56 to have a very healthy, strong body which rarely gets sick. I have no doubt that the main reason for my good health is my many regular health practices, most of which I've been doing for decades. Some of them may seem unusual, yet they work for me. I offer them here to you as food for thought. May we all find beautiful ways to take care of our bodies and health. **General Health Practices** **Go barefoot:** I go barefoot as much as possible and practical, including on many runs and hikes. It's natural acupressure! For more on this, see [http://earthinginstitute.net](http://earthinginstitute.net/about-us). Evidence shows the one or two bee stings I get on my feet every year are [good for my health](http://www.naturalnews.com/028370_apitherapy_bee_stings.html). **Cold deluge:** I end my showers by turning off all the hot water and turning up the cold. I love the cold, refreshing hit which leaves me feeling warm and tingly afterward. Sometimes I turn it as hot as I can take it before doing the cold deluge. [Read here](http://www.medicaldaily.com/benefits-cold-showers-7-reasons-why-taking-cool-showers-good-your-health-289524) seven reasons why cold showers are good for your health. Another good article on this can be [found here](http://fitness.mercola.com/sites/fitness/archive/2012/04/27/cold-water-immersion-benefits.aspx). **Germ-positive:** I welcome germs in moderate amounts and even small amounts of mold. I see them as friends that help to build my immune system. Excessive avoidance of germs weakens the immune system, thereby increasing the likelihood of disease. See a [*Washington Post*article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-Germs-good-for-you) and a [*Newsweek*article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-caution-killing-germs-may-be-hazardous-your-health) showing that germs can be good for your health. **Healthy food:** I eat organic as much as possible and avoid all genetically modified and processed food (see [many great reasons](https://www.WantToKnow.info/geneticallymodifiedorganismsnewsarticles) for this).

I eat vegetarian at home, though will eat meat when I'm out. I don't eat any candy, soda, or junk foods at home, though do occasionally when out. I don't like being too strict. I also never consume artificial sweeteners (see [this webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aspartamemsgcoverup) for why). I will eat almost any natural food that still smells and looks good, including some far past the expiration dates, which I find are often bogus. **Avoid medicine:** I very rarely get sick, yet when I do, I avoid all medicines - even alternative ones. I let my body's innate wisdom deal with whatever comes up. The exception is when I will be in close contact with others and I feel a cold coming on. I then take vitamins and alternative medicine (Emergen-C and Yin Chiao) to nip the cold in the bud and avoid infecting others. If there is little risk of infecting others, I prefer to let colds run their course so that my immune system gets a good work out. Note that if something serious happens (like a bone break or bad infection), I will use Western medicine that has a proven track record, though I've only taken antibiotics once in my life. For evidence supporting this health practice, see [this article](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/07/02/prescription-drugs-vs-healthy-diet.aspx) and [this summary](https://www.WantToKnow.info/pharmaceuticalcorruptionnewsarticles) of great news articles on the topic. **Natural:** I don't use soap to wash my body or wash dishes, unless they are really greasy. No deodorant or other artificial skin products either. I prefer to be as natural as possible. **Daily Health Practices** **Life intentions:** Each morning on awakening, I review [my main life intentions](https://www.inspiringcommunity.org/inspiringstories0304#intentionsfred), [breathe sacred love](https://www.weboflove.org), and set intentions for the day even before I get out of bed. **Skin rub:** As soon as I get out of bed, I splash my face with cold water, and then briefly rub/massage all of my skin from head to toes. Great way to awaken the body in the morning. **Memory exercise:** Next I cross my arms, grab my ear lobes with the opposite thumb and index finger, then do 12 deep knee bends while holding this position. This is said to be a good brain memory exercise.

In the several years I've been doing this, I'm thrilled to have seen much improvement in my memory. **Yoga:** I do 15 minutes of yoga in the morning plus five minutes at the end of my daily run. The yoga is back focused (five intense [Bikram yoga](http://www.bikramyoga.com/) poses which stretch the back in all directions). I also lie on my back and do upside down splits with my legs, stretching them both to the sides and forward and back for each leg as far as I can. I place 15 pounds of weights on each foot and do this once or twice a day. I can almost do the splits all the way now. Yea!!! **Languages:** While doing yoga, I listen to a 15-minute BBC news broadcast in Indonesian Mon - Fri and listen to a Mandarin news broadcast on Sat and Sun when I'm home. I have near total comprehension on the Indonesian (I used to [interpret for the US State Dept.](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fredburksresigns) and occasionally still work private gigs as an Indonesian Interpreter) and about 60% on the Chinese (I also interpreted in Mandarin for the US State Dept. for a few years). **Reading:** Each morning I like to do inspirational reading for 20 to 40 minutes, occasionally in Spanish or Indonesian. **30 to 45 minutes at the park:** Almost every day, I go to a nearby park when I run about a mile (including a 150 meter full-speed sprint), do 10 L-seat pull-ups, 12 bar dips, balance walk on a bar (forward and backward with turns), do two yoga stretches, then eye massage and eye exercises while balancing first on one foot, then the other. I also do gymnastics: cartwheels, front handsprings, back flips off rocks, front and back hip circles on a bar, ending with practicing handstands at least three times. [Going upside down is very healthy](http://yoganonymous.com/10-benefits-of-yoga-inversions). I usually take one or two days off a week from all this, and don't do it on days where I go dancing or do a long run or bicycle ride. **Teeth brushing:** I floss and brush my teeth only once a day, yet do it very thoroughly, taking a full three minutes. I use an electronic rotating brush Mon to Fri and a manual brush on weekends for variety. I have only been to the dentist six times in my adult life and, when I do go, they are consistently astonished at how healthy my teeth are considering I very rarely visit a dentist or get my teeth cleaned. **Diary:** Before going to bed, I write key significant experiences from the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__health-practices.txt:2:d10e09527c91", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10894, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__health-practices.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__health-practices", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "day, yet do it very thoroughly, taking a full three minutes.

I use a weekly engagement calendar to purposely limit how much I write. I found when I wrote longer entries in the past, I began to dread doing it every day. I enjoy reading through the entire diary at the end of the year and use it to write a summary of my life each year that is very fulfilling for me. **Gratitude:** Before going to sleep, I [give gratitude](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#gratitude) for at least three things from the day. **Weekly Health Practices** **Long run and ride:** Once a week, I start with 25 minutes of intense uphill bicycle riding (700 foot rise in three miles) from my home in the flats of Berkeley, California up to beautiful Tilden Park. After locking my bike there, I run a six-mile loop on dirt trails through the hills, taking in the panoramic views of Wildcat Peak. I stop in a few places to relax, meditate, and take in the beautiful scenery. After the run, I hop back on my bike and fly back home in 11 minutes. **Dance:** I love to dance my heart out once a week at one of many dances in the area, usually 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. **Silence:** I relax once a week into two hours of silence and contemplation, usually on a weekday evening. **Sun gazing:** I go up onto our roof at sunset to gaze directly at the sun, usually the last five to 10 minutes before it sets. Sometimes I do this several times a week, and sometimes I go a few weeks without it when I'm out of town, when it's cloudy or raining, or when I forget. I've been doing this since about 2004 without any negative effects and have found it to be quite profound. **Important note:** Don't do this more than an hour before sunset or an hour after sunrise or you may hurt your eyes. For more, see [this webpage](http://yogikanna.com/sungazing/). **Monthly Health Practices** **Bikram yoga:** I had really bad back problems in 2003. When I then started doing [Bikram yoga](http://www.bikramyoga.com/) daily in December of that year, my back healed 50% within one month and 90% by three months. I eventually cut back to doing the full 90-minute session once a month and doing five of the poses on my own at home daily.

When I then started doing [Bikram yoga](http://www.bikramyoga.com/) daily in December of that year, my back healed 50% within one month and 90% by three months. I eventually cut back to doing the full 90-minute session once a month and doing five of the poses on my own at home daily. Now my back is as strong as in my early 20s. Yea!!! And I sometimes have [profound realizations](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspiration/spiritual_eyes) as a result of these intense yoga sessions. **Swim:** One hour swim (about 1 1/2 miles). 15 min each of breast stroke, free style, side stroke, and back stroke. I usually end with 100 yards of butterfly (two back and forth laps at our local pool) and an underwater swim of 50 yards after hyperventilating 50 breaths or so. I don't recommend hyperventilating unless you are experienced with it. **Fasting and silence:** I enjoy two different kinds of fasts. Every other month I do one or two days of silence and food fasting. I do drink water, but no food during these fasts. On the alternate months, I do a sleep fast - missing a full night's sleep. And once a year I skip two nights in a row of sleep. On the nights of my sleep fast, I have to keep myself busy and find that I'm generally very productive. Both types of fasting nourish my soul. **Unicycle basketball:** I generally play unicycle basketball with the champion [Berkeley Revolution](http://berkeleyrevolution.com/) team once or twice a month on Tuesday evenings. They have ranked second or third in the world for several years, though I'm usually the oldest and the least talented player. I don't participate in competitions. I just do it for fun. **Just Do It!** My father, my sister, my two brothers and myself all enjoyed some kind of regular exercise as I was growing up. My mom was the only one who didn't really exercise. And interestingly enough, she was the one who got irritated most easily and had the most complaints. She eventually decided she wanted to start exercising. She tried running and swimming, but didn't really enjoy it. Then, at age 45, mom found bicycle riding. She started with just five miles a day. Then about a year later she upped it to 12 miles a day and even started climbing some steep hills on her bike. **And amazingly, mom became much more relaxed and joyful almost as soon as she started biking.** Mom went on to become a top bicycle rider, doing lots of 100-mile rides and almost always coming in first for her age group on public rides. She even completed the [Davis Double](http://www.davisbikeclub.org/annual_events/organized_rides/davis_double_century) (200 miles in one day) ten times!

I joined her on a tandem for her 10th Davis Double when she was 67 years old. Now at 83 years old and with poor eyesight, mom can't ride as much as she used to, but several times a year, we still go out on rides of between 24 and 48 miles together. She also cycles with another friend as much as she can. If my mom found a healthy exercise that worked for her, so can you. If you are new to all this, I can't stress enough the importance of moving gradually into whatever health practices you choose. If you start trying handstands when you've never even done a headstand, you just might end up smashing your face. **Yet the important thing is that you do start.** Choose something more than just a leisurely walk, which doesn't get your heart working much (but is better than nothing). Speed walking counts. Swimming is great and very gentle on the body. Find something you enjoy doing that gets your heart pumping for at least 15 minutes. Whatever you choose, make a commitment to do it at least three times a week and preferably five or six. Do take one or two days of rest a week, as I believe it's good to give your body an occasional rest. By committing to whatever health practices you choose, you are showing yourself that you really care about yourself. I invite you to take the challenge, to make the commitment, and to then watch as the months and years pass how much better you feel in your body, and even how much better you end up feeling about yourself. I wish you all the best, and have fun with it!

The mushroom-derived hallucinogen, called psilocybin, is known to trigger transformative spiritual states, but at high doses it can also result in \"bad trips\" marked by terror and panic. \"The important point here is that we found the sweet spot where we can optimize the positive persistent effects and avoid some of the fear and anxiety that can occur and can be quite disruptive,\" says lead author Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins.

Two years later, he watched a patient suffering from PTSD undergo MDMA-assisted therapy. \"That completely persuaded me of its therapeutic potential,\" Doblin says. In 1985, Doblin learned that the DEA was moving to ban the drug ... and founded a nonprofit - the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies - to fight the prohibition. In 2000 [Doblin] met Michael Mithoefer, a therapist specializing in PTSD. Mithoefer had grown frustrated by the available treatments. Mithoefer and his wife and co-therapist, Annie, conducted the first MAPS-funded Phase II trial in 2004, which used MDMA to treat PTSD in victims of rape and childhood sexual abuse. These were patients with chronic cases that had proved resistant to other treatment methods. A second group, made up of veterans, firefighters and police officers, followed. **Therapists refer to MDMA as an empathogen - something that enables patients to feel empathy not just for others but also for themselves. Of the 90 people who completed the 12-month follow-up after Phase II, 68% of them \"did not meet PTSD criteria**,\" according to the study results MAPS submitted to the FDA.

Some view psychedelics as ... a way to approach problems differently. There's no definitive scientific evidence that LSD or other hallucinogens improve creativity, and the DEA classifies LSD as a highly addictive, Schedule I drug. But the belief that they might work as a creative tool is enough to fuel some technologists' hope for professional epiphanies. Tim Ferriss, a Silicon Valley investor and author of \"The 4-Hour Workweek,\" says he knows many successful entrepreneurs who dabble in psychedelics. \"**The billionaires I know, almost without exception, use hallucinogens on a regular basis,\" Ferriss said. \"[They're] trying to be very disruptive and look at the problems in the world ... and ask completely new questions**.\" The phenomenon was satirized on HBO's Silicon Valley when psychedelic mushrooms guide one of the show's main characters in the hunt for a new name for their startup. A recent study at Imperial College London provides a possible explanation. Twenty participants ingested LSD and then had their brain activity monitored in an fMRI machine. The drug [allowed] new patterns of communication to form. \"Psychedelics dismantle 'well-worn' networks, and this allows novel communication patterns to occur. Modules that don't usually talk to each other are talking to each other more,\" explained Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, the researcher who conducted the study. **Note:** Food justice champion [Michael Pollan](http://www.wanttoknow.info/a-food-inc%20-documentary-exposing-corporate-food-manipulations) recently wrote [a fascinating article](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/trip-treatment) prominently featured in the venerable magazine *The New Yorker* about the amazing power of psilocybin mushrooms to create profound healing in carefully controlled environments.

But I did not foresee that after having dedicated myself for 40 years to a life of the law, including more than two decades as a New York State judge, my quest for ameliorative and palliative care would lead me to marijuana. My survival has demanded an enormous price, including months of chemotherapy, radiation hell and brutal surgery. Inhaled marijuana is the only medicine that gives me some relief from nausea, stimulates my appetite, and makes it easier to fall asleep. The oral synthetic substitute, Marinol, prescribed by my doctors, was useless. **Rather than watch the agony of my suffering, friends have chosen, at some personal risk, to provide the substance. I find a few puffs of marijuana before dinner gives me ammunition in the battle to eat. A few more puffs at bedtime permits desperately needed sleep. This is not a law-and-order issue; it is a medical and a human rights issue.** Being treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, I am receiving the absolute gold standard of medical care. But doctors cannot be expected to do what the law prohibits, even when they know it is in the best interests of their patients. When palliative care is understood as a fundamental human and medical right, marijuana for medical use should be beyond controversy. **Note:** The author is Gustin L.

It was the 80s, and by the time one in 10 people had slipped into the depths of heroin use - bankers, university students, carpenters, socialites, miners - Portugal was in a state of panic. **In 2001 ... Portugal became the first country to decriminalise the possession and consumption of all illicit substances**. Rather than being arrested, those caught with a personal supply might be given a warning, a small fine, or told to appear before a local commission - a doctor, a lawyer and a social worker - about treatment, harm reduction, and the support services that were available to them. **The opioid crisis soon stabilised, and the ensuing years saw dramatic drops in problematic drug use, HIV and hepatitis infection rates, overdose deaths, drug-related crime and incarceration rates.** HIV infection plummeted from an all-time high in 2000 of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__psychedelic-drugs-news-articles.txt:5:cd7f3067b52b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10911, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__psychedelic-drugs-news-articles.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__psychedelic-drugs-news-articles", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "a personal supply might be given a warning, a small fine, or told to appear before a local commission - a doctor, a lawyer and a social worker - about treatment, harm reduction, and the support services that were available to them. **The opioid crisis soon stabilised, and the ensuing years saw dramatic drops in problematic drug use, HIV and hepatitis infection rates, overdose deaths, drug-related crime and incarceration rates.** HIV infection plummeted from an all-time high in 2000 of 104.2 new cases per million to 4.2 cases per million in 2015. Portugal's remarkable recovery ... could not have happened without an enormous cultural shift, and a change in how the country viewed drugs. Portugal's policy rests on three pillars: one, that there's no such thing as a soft or hard drug, only healthy and unhealthy relationships with drugs; two, that an individual's unhealthy relationship with drugs often conceals frayed relationships with loved ones, with the world around them, and with themselves; and three, that the eradication of all drugs is an impossible goal. In spite of Portugal's tangible results, other countries have been reluctant to follow. **Note:** Portugal's [successful policy](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-why-hardly-anyone-dies-from-drug-overdose-portugal) has contributed to public health outcomes that [starkly contrast US trends](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/overdoses-are-leading-cause-of-death-americans-under-50/). **The Promise of Ecstasy for PTSD** **2017-11-03, *New York Times*** [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/opinion/ecstasy-ptsd.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/opinion/ecstasy-ptsd.html) In July, the Food and Drug Administration took the important step of [approving two final-phase clinical trials](http://www.maps.org/news/media/6786-press-release-fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-mdma-assisted-psychotherapy-for-ptsd,-agrees-on-special-protocol-assessment-for-phase-3-trials) to determine whether a party drug that has long been on the Drug Enforcement Administration's Schedule I list of banned substances could be used to treat a psychiatric condition that afflicts millions. The drug is MDMA, a psychedelic commonly known as Ecstasy. The trials aim to determine whether the drug is, as earlier trials have suggested, a safe and effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. **The F.D.A. approval is a beacon of hope for the roughly eight million Americans believed to suffer from PTSD, a group that includes victims of abuse, refugees and combat veterans**. The shortcomings in the way we have typically treated PTSD mean that many are condemned to suffer from the condition for years, even decades, with little relief. Less than 20 percent of patients are estimated to get effective treatment through prescription psychiatric drugs ... which, along with psychotherapy, have been the global standard of mental health care since the 1990s. **This could change with the F.D.A.'s decision, which has given MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD the status of a potential \"breakthrough therapy.\" **This designation permits the fast-tracking of trials in hopes of proving the drug, which has psychedelic and stimulant effects, to be safe and capable of doing what no other drug on the market can. **Note:** Read more about how MDMA has been found to be highly [effective for treating PTSD](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--party-drug-may-help-brain-cope-with-trauma) in a therapeutic context.

When medical marijuana is available, pain patients are increasingly choosing pot over powerful and deadly prescription narcotics. Now a [new study](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/35/7/1230) [provides] clear evidence of a missing link in the causal chain running from medical marijuana to falling overdoses. Researchers at the University of Georgia scoured the database of all prescription drugs paid for under Medicare Part D from 2010 to 2013. In the 17 states with a medical-marijuana law in place by 2013, prescriptions for painkillers and other classes of drugs fell sharply compared with states that did not have a medical-marijuana law. They found that, **in medical-marijuana states, the average doctor prescribed 265 fewer doses of antidepressants each year, 486 fewer doses of seizure medication, 541 fewer anti-nausea doses and 562 fewer doses of anti-anxiety medication. But most strikingly, the typical physician in a medical-marijuana state prescribed 1,826 fewer doses of painkillers** in a given year. Estimating the cost savings to Medicare from the decreased prescribing, [the study] found that about $165 million was saved in the 17 medical marijuana states in 2013. The estimated annual Medicare prescription savings would be nearly half a billion dollars if all 50 states were to implement similar programs. **Note:** The war on drugs has been called a \"[trillion dollar failure](http://www.wanttoknow.info/a--war-drugs-trilliondollar-failure)\", and an increasing number of deaths are [caused by prescription opioid overdose](http://www.wanttoknow.info/a-drug-overdose-deaths-up-11th-consecutive-year) in the US each year.

The results from [that study](http://jop.sagepub.com/content/30/12/1165.full), and a [similar small, controlled trial](http://jop.sagepub.com/content/30/12/1181.full), were striking. **About 80 percent of cancer patients showed clinically significant reductions in both psychological disorders, a response sustained some seven months after the single dose. Side effects were minimal. In both trials, the intensity of the mystical experience described by patients correlated with the degree to which their depression and anxiety decreased**. Although cancer patients will not have access to therapeutically administered psilocybin anytime soon, the findings add vigor to applications to expand research in a multicenter trial with hundreds of participants. Psilocybin trials are underway in the United States and Europe for alcoholism, tobacco addiction and treatment-resistant depression. Other hallucinogens are also being studied for clinical application. This week, the Food and Drug Administration approved a [large-scale trial](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/us/ptsd-mdma-ecstasy.html) investigating MDMA, the illegal party drug better known as Ecstasy, for post-traumatic stress disorder. **Note:** See [another article](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/psychedelic-drugs-lsd-magic-mushrooms-new-study-psychiatry-mental-illness-terminal-cancer-patients-a7449331.html) in the UK's *Independent* showing remarkable results from these studies.

Then ... the so-called \"war on drugs\" began. For nearly a generation, science on these substances shut down. But that's changing**. In the past 20 years or so, a small amount of research has once again begun to focus on these chemicals, showing that they have promise for treating a range of conditions, from addiction to depression and anxiety, says Evan Wood, a psychiatric researcher at the University of British Columbia. In 2006, researchers at the University of Arizona [published a study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17196053) showing obsessive-compulsive patients who ingested psilocybin had immediate and lasting reductions in problematic symptoms. The same year, Johns Hopkins University physician and researcher Roland Griffiths [showed](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Press_releases/2006/GriffithsPsilocybin.pdf) that in healthy volunteers, psilocybin produced lasting benefits like improved mood and peacefulness six months after ingestion. [Similar work](http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=210962) has shown psilocybin can help treat anxiety associated with cancer, at UCLA and New York University. And a [study in late 2014](http://www.newsweek.com/lsd-permanently-reduces-anxiety-cancer-patients-285398) found that LSD permanently reduced anxiety in a small number of patients. Wood says he's most excited about research into using psychedelics to treat addiction.

I traveled around the world to interview medical leaders, experts, growers and patients. I spoke candidly to them, asking tough questions. What I found was stunning. Long before I began this project, I had steadily reviewed the scientific literature on medical marijuana from the United States and thought it was fairly unimpressive. Reading these papers five years ago, it was hard to make a case for medicinal marijuana. I even wrote about this in a *TIME* magazine article, back in 2009, titled \"Why I would Vote No on Pot.\" Well, I am here to apologize. I apologize because I didn't look hard enough, until now. I didn't look far enough. I didn't review papers from smaller labs in other countries doing some remarkable research, and I was too dismissive of the loud chorus of legitimate patients whose symptoms improved on cannabis. I mistakenly believed the Drug Enforcement Agency listed marijuana as a schedule 1 substance because of sound scientific proof. Surely, they must have quality reasoning as to why marijuana is in the category of the most dangerous drugs that have \"no accepted medicinal use and a high potential for abuse.\" They didn't have the science to support that claim, and **I now know that when it comes to marijuana neither of those things are true. It doesn't have a high potential for abuse, and there are very legitimate medical applications. In fact, sometimes marijuana is the only thing that works.** **Note:** This article was authored by CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

But CBS News has found these three have something more in common - strong financial ties to the industry whose products they promote and defend. The vaccine industry gives millions to the Academy of Pediatrics for conferences, grants, medical education classes and even helped build their headquarters. The totals are kept secret, but public documents reveal bits and pieces. A $342,000 payment from Wyeth, maker of the pneumococcal vaccine - which makes $2 billion a year in sales. A $433,000 contribution from Merck, the same year the academy endorsed Merck's HPV vaccine - which made $1.5 billion a year in sales. Every Child By Two, a group that promotes early immunization for all children, admits the group takes money from the vaccine industry, too - but wouldn't tell us how much. **Then there's Paul Offit, perhaps the most widely-quoted defender of vaccine safety.

A still smoldering outbreak of measles in Quebec is the largest in the Americas in over a decade. An investigation into an outbreak in a high school in a town that was heavily hit by the virus found that about half of the cases were in teens who had received the recommended two doses of vaccine in childhood - in other words, teens whom authorities would have expected to have been protected from the measles virus.** It's generally assumed that the measles vaccine ... should protect against measles infection about 99 per cent of the time. So the discovery that 52 of the 98 teens who caught measles were fully vaccinated came as a shock to the researchers who conducted the investigation.** **Note:** For an excellent report endorsed by dozens of respected doctors and nurses on the serious risks and dangers of vaccines, [click here](http://nhne-pulse.org/report-international-medical-council-on-vaccination). **A coverup for a cause of Autism?** **2005-06-22, MSNBC** [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8243264/ns/msnbc-morning_joe/t/coverup-cause-autism](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8243264/ns/msnbc-morning_joe/t/coverup-cause-autism) **JOE SCARBOROUGH, Host:** Six out of every 1,000 kids get it, and nobody knows exactly why.

Kennedy Jr. is a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense [Council]. Let's talk tonight about thimerosal. There are a lot of people out there ... very concerned about the impact of this drug, which is found in vaccines, and how it causes autism. Talk about that. **ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.:** That's right. Thimerosal is a preservative that was put in vaccines back in the 1930s. Almost immediately after it was put in, autism cases began to appear. Autism had never been known before. It was unknown to science. Then the vaccines were increased in 1989 by the CDC and by a couple of other government agencies. What happened was the vaccine schedule was increased. We went up from receiving about 10 vaccines in our generation to these kids receive 24 vaccines. And they all had this thimerosal in them, this mercury.

It considers a host of peer-reviewed, published theories that show possible connections between vaccines and autism. The article in the *Journal of Immunotoxicology* is entitled \"Theoretical aspects of autism: Causes--A review.\" The author is Helen Ratajczak, surprisingly herself a former senior scientist at a pharmaceutical firm. Ratajczak did what nobody else apparently has bothered to do: she reviewed the body of published science since autism was first described in 1943. Not just one theory suggested by research such as the role of MMR shots, or the mercury preservative thimerosal; but all of them. Ratajczak's article states, in part, that \"Documented causes of autism include genetic mutations and/or deletions, viral infections, and encephalitis following vaccination. Therefore, **autism is the result of genetic defects and/or inflammation of the brain.\" The article goes on to discuss many potential vaccine-related culprits, including the increasing number of vaccines given in a short period of time. Ratajczak also looks at a factor that hasn't been widely discussed: human DNA contained in vaccines.** Ratajczak reports that about the same time vaccine makers took most thimerosal out of most vaccines (with the exception of flu shots which still widely contain thimerosal), they began making some vaccines using human tissue. **Note:** For an excellent report endorsed by dozens of respected doctors and nurses on the serious risks and dangers of vaccines, [click here](http://nhne-pulse.org/report-international-medical-council-on-vaccination). **Flu vaccine paradox adds to public health debate** **2015-01-16, CBC News (Canada's public broadcasting system)** [http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flu-vaccine-paradox-adds-to-public-health-debat...](http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flu-vaccine-paradox-adds-to-public-health-debate-1.2912790) People who receive flu vaccines year after year can sometimes show reduced protection, an effect that Canadian infectious disease specialists say muddies public health messages", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__vaccine-articles.txt:2:8c55106c7ae4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10924, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__vaccine-articles.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__vaccine-articles", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "of flu shots which still widely contain thimerosal), they began making some vaccines using human tissue. **Note:** For an excellent report endorsed by dozens of respected doctors and nurses on the serious risks and dangers of vaccines, [click here](http://nhne-pulse.org/report-international-medical-council-on-vaccination). **Flu vaccine paradox adds to public health debate** **2015-01-16, CBC News (Canada's public broadcasting system)** [http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flu-vaccine-paradox-adds-to-public-health-debat...](http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flu-vaccine-paradox-adds-to-public-health-debate-1.2912790) People who receive flu vaccines year after year can sometimes show reduced protection, an effect that Canadian infectious disease specialists say muddies public health messages for annual flu vaccine campaigns. **During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control originally thought seasonal flu shots from 2008 might offer extra protection. They were puzzled to find instead, seasonal flu vaccination almost doubled the risk of infection** with pandemic flu. Dr. Danuta Skowronski and her colleagues went on to do five more studies during the summer that showed the same effect in people and in ferrets, which are considered the best animal model of flu. What was originally called \"[the Canadian problem](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/seasonal-flu-shot-may-increase-h1n1-risk-1.829675)\" has since been found in a randomized control trial by researchers in Hong Kong ... Japan and the U.S. Researchers in several countries have found a blunting or \"interference\" effect between previous seasonal vaccines and reduced levels of vaccine protection in later years. \"People do not have a good explanation for why,\" said Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infection prevention and control at Toronto's University Health Network. \"We have kind of hyped this vaccine so much for so long we are starting to believe our own hype. Really, what we should be doing is looking for better vaccines,\" Gardam said. In the meantime, public health officials who aim to protect people from flu complications need to grapple with the imperfections of a vaccine given every year to a moving target of strains. **Note:** Healthcare workers in New York protested the [government mandate](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-H1N1-vaccination-reject-health-care-workers) that they be given this vaccine, from which drug companies made [billions of dollars](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-Vaccines-H1N1-flu-Billions-profit-drug-companies-doctors).

Drug companies have long known that to sell some products, you would have to first sell people on the disease. In the 1950s and 1960s, Merck launched an extensive campaign to lower the diagnostic threshold for hypertension, and in doing so enlarging the market for its diuretic drug, Diuril. Could influenza ... be yet one more case of disease mongering? Marketing influenza vaccines ... involves marketing influenza as a threat of great proportions. The CDC's website explains that \"Flu seasons ... can be severe,\" citing a death toll of \"3000 to a high of about 49000 people.\" However, a far less volatile and more reassuring picture of influenza seems likely if one considers that recorded deaths from influenza declined sharply over the middle of the 20th century ... all before the great expansion of vaccination campaigns in the 2000s. Yet across the country, mandatory influenza vaccination policies have cropped up ... precisely because not everyone wants the vaccination, and compulsion appears the only way to achieve high vaccination rates. **Note:** Read the entire revealing article [at this link](https://pdf.yt/d/XGILX3HeUh5FMY03).

Batches of polio vaccine tainted with \"simian virus 40\" (SV40) were given between 1955 and 1963. This was because monkey kidney cells were used in the [vaccine's] production process.** It is [now] conceded that SV40 was present in the early vaccine - and the latest research, published in the *Lancet* journal, has linked it to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which has a role in the body's fight against infection, and affects mainly the over 40s.

In Denmark, Thimerosal, a controversial mercury compound used as a preservative in certain vaccines, was removed from all Danish vaccines in 1992. The well-publicized Danish study published in Pediatrics 2003 claimed that autism rates actually increased after Thimerosal was phased out. This study subsequently became a cornerstone for the notion that mercury does not cause autism. However, one of the FOIA documents obtained from CDC clearly indicates that this study omitted large amounts of data showing autism rates actually dropping after mercury was removed from Danish vaccines. **Note:** For the complete text of the article, which has been taken down from the *Sacramento Bee* website, [click here.](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scandal-exposed-in-major-study-of-autism-and-mercury-132519518.html) Read about a key scientific study which showed that monkeys given standard human vaccines developed autism symptoms, at [this link](http://www.naturalnews.com/035787_vaccines_autism_monkeys.html).

The federal officials and industry representatives had assembled to discuss a disturbing new study that raised alarming questions about the safety of a host of common childhood vaccines administered to infants and young children. A mercury-based preservative in the vaccines -- thimerosal -- appeared to be responsible for a dramatic increase in autism. **But instead of taking immediate steps to alert the public and rid the vaccine supply of thimerosal, the officials and executives at Simpsonwood spent most of the next two days discussing how to cover up the damaging data.** According to transcripts obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, many at the meeting were concerned about how the damaging revelations about thimerosal would affect the vaccine industry's bottom line.

A pair of lawsuits - one of which is filed by former employees and the other by doctors - make this allegation and a federal judge is allowing both claims to proceed. **The former employees - virologists who filed a whistleblower lawsuit four years ago - charge Merck knew its vaccine was less effective than the purported 95% efficacy level. And they alleged that senior management was aware, complicit and in charge of testing that concealed the actual effectiveness. **They claim to have witnessed fIrsthand what they describe as \"improper testing and data falsification in which Merck engaged in order to conceal what the drug maker knew about the vaccine's diminished efficacy.

The feds declined to join the lawsuit, which was unsealed two years ago. Shortly afterwards, the physicians subsequently filed the other lawsuit charge the vaccine was mislabeled and was not the product for which the government or other purchasers paid, which meant that Merck violated the False Claims Act.

The journal *BioMed Research International* now provides direct evidence that the CDC's safety assurances about the mercury-containing preservative are not fact-based, according to the article's lead author, Brian Hooker. The paper [cites] over 165 studies that have found thimerosal to be harmful, including 16 studies that had reported [serious detrimental] outcomes in human infants and children. **\"Substantial scientific evidence exists and has existed for many years that the vaccine ingredient thimerosal is a developmental neurotoxin\"** says George Lucier, former Associate Director of the National Toxicology Program. Studies showing harm from thimerosal sharply contradict published outcomes of six CDC coauthored and sponsored papers - the very studies that CDC relies upon to declare that thimerosal is \"safe\" for use in infant and maternal vaccines. Dr. Hooker ... said of the six CDC studies, \"Each of these papers is fatally flawed from a statistics standpoint and several of the papers represent issues of scientific malfeasance. For example, **important data showing a relationship between thimerosal exposure and autism are withheld from three of the publications. This type of cherry-picking of data by the CDC in order to change the results of important research studies to support flawed and dangerous vaccination policies should not be tolerated.\"** **Note:** A [Reuters article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-CDC-director-president-Merck-vaccines) reports that the former head of the US's CDC was later named president of Merck's vaccine division with accompanying high salary.

CBS News has learned the family of Hannah Poling will receive more than $1.5 million dollars for her life care, lost earnings, and pain and suffering for the first year alone. In addition to the first year, the family will receive more than $500,000 per year to pay for Hannah's care. Those familiar with the case believe the compensation could easily amount to $20 million over the child's lifetime. Hannah was described as normal, happy and precocious in her first 18 months. Then, in July 2000, she was vaccinated against nine diseases in one doctor's visit: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, varicella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenzae. Afterward, her health declined rapidly. She developed high fevers, stopped eating, didn't respond when spoken to, began showing signs of autism, and began having screaming fits. **In acknowledging Hannah's injuries, the government said vaccines aggravated an unknown mitochondrial disorder Hannah had which didn't \"cause\" her autism, but \"resulted\" in it. It's unknown how many other children have similar undiagnosed mitochondrial disorder. All other autism \"test cases\" have been defeated at trial.** Approximately 4,800 are awaiting disposition in federal vaccine court. **Note:** A [CBS affiliate reports](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-study-us-quietly-paid-families-vaccinelinked-autism-cases) that \"since the late 1980s, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) has paid money for 83 cases involving autism.\" The article also mentions this has been kept quiet.

Dr. Diane Harper says young girls and their parents should receive more complete warnings before receiving the vaccine to prevent cervical cancer. Dr. Harper helped design and carry out the Phase II and Phase III safety and effectiveness studies to get Gardasil approved, and authored many of the published, scholarly papers about it. She has been a paid speaker and consultant to Merck. **It's highly unusual for a researcher to publicly criticize a medicine or vaccine she helped get approved.** Dr. Harper joins a number of consumer watchdogs, vaccine safety advocates, and parents who question the vaccine's risk-versus-benefit profile. **She says data available for Gardasil shows that ... there is no data showing that it remains effective", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__vaccine-articles.txt:10:5151b1d98044", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10932, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__vaccine-articles.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__vaccine-articles", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "effectiveness studies to get Gardasil approved, and authored many of the published, scholarly papers about it.

This raises questions about the CDC's recommendation that the series of shots be given to girls as young as 11-years old.** \"If we vaccinate 11 year olds and the protection doesn't last... we've put them at harm from side effects, small but real, for no benefit,\" says Dr. Harper. \"The benefit to public health is nothing, there is no reduction in cervical cancers, they are just postponed, unless the protection lasts for at least 15 years, and over 70% of all sexually active females of all ages are vaccinated.\" She also says that enough serious side effects have been reported after Gardasil use that the vaccine could prove riskier than the cervical cancer it purports to prevent. Cervical cancer is usually entirely curable when detected early through normal Pap screenings. **The Age of Autism: 'A pretty big secret'** **2005-12-07, *Washington Times*/UPI** [https://web.archive.org/web/20051213040915/http://www.washingtontimes.com/upi...](https://web.archive.org/web/20051213040915/http://www.washingtontimes.com/upi/20051204-060313-6829r.htm) Where are the autistic Amish? In Lancaster County, heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, there should be well over 100 with some form of the disorder. There is evidence of only three. Julia is one of them. She ... is adopted from China. She had most of her vaccines given to her in the United States. [Of the other, one definitely had a vaccine, and the other's vaccine status is unknown.] Thousands of children cared for by Homefirst Health Services in metropolitan Chicago have at least two things in common with thousands of Amish children in rural Lancaster: They have never been vaccinated. And they don't have autism. **\"We have about 30,000 or 35,000 children that we've taken care of over the years, and I don't think we have a single case of autism in children delivered by us who never received vaccines,\" said Dr. Mayer Eisenstein**, Homefirst's medical director. Eisenstein, in fact, is author of the book \"Don't Vaccinate Before You Educate!\" Earlier this year Florida pediatrician Dr. Jeff Bradstreet said there is virtually no autism in home-schooling families who decline to vaccinate for religious reasons - lending credence to Eisenstein's observations. \"It's largely non-existent,\" said Bradstreet, who treats children with autism from around the country. Thimerosal, which is 49.6 percent ethyl mercury by weight, was phased out of most U.S. childhood immunizations beginning in 1999, but the CDC recommends flu shots for pregnant women and last year began recommending them for children 6 to 23 months old.

'I kept telling myself everybody gets vaccinated - this is OK,' she said. When Kaylee was 18 months old, her white-blonde hair began falling out and she stopped talking. Meanwhile, Kerns had twin boys - Andrew and Daniel. When they were 15 months old, they received three vaccines. A week later, they stopped talking. All three children have since been diagnosed as autistic. Flu vaccine sold in multidose vials still contains the preservative, and the government urges flu shots for pregnant women and young children even though not enough thimerosal-free ones are available, critics say. Finding answers is tough because autism, a little-understood developmental disorder, often is diagnosed at the very ages when children get vaccines. **The stories are remarkably similar: A seemingly normal child gets a shot and days, weeks or months later, withdraws from the world, stops speaking, becomes upset at random stimulation such as a doorbell, and adopts compulsive behaviors like head-banging.** **Note: **Thimerosal has now been removed from childhood vaccines, however the government and drug industry continue to deny that there is any link between mercury in vaccines and autism.

The incidence of autism has grown dramatically over the last two decades, from about one in every 2,000 children to as high as one in every 166.** The purported link between autism and mercury has been a subject of intense debate. In the past it has centered primarily on the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal, which was once widely used in vaccines. Many parents have argued that thimerosal causes autism because their children seemed to develop the neurological disorder shortly after they received childhood vaccinations. **Note:** An [MSNBC/Associated Press report](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-fda-rejects-new-limits-mercury-vaccines) shows that the FDA rejected limits on thimerosal and that \"most doses of flu vaccine still contain thimerosal.\" **The Man Behind The Vaccine Mystery** **2002-12-12, CBS News** [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/12/eveningnews/main532886.shtml](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/12/eveningnews/main532886.shtml) It's been a mystery in Washington for weeks. **Just before President Bush signed the homeland security bill into law an unknown member of Congress inserted a provision into the legislation that blocks lawsuits against the maker of a controversial vaccine preservative called \"thimerosal,\" used in vaccines that are given to children.** Drug giant Eli Lilly and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__vaccine-articles.txt:13:942caa304a24", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10935, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__vaccine-articles.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__vaccine-articles", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "rejected limits on thimerosal and that \"most doses of flu vaccine still contain thimerosal.\" **The Man Behind The Vaccine Mystery** **2002-12-12, CBS News** [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/12/eveningnews/main532886.shtml](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/12/eveningnews/main532886.shtml) It's been a mystery in Washington for weeks. **Just before President Bush signed the homeland security bill into law an unknown member of Congress inserted a provision into the legislation that blocks lawsuits against the maker of a controversial vaccine preservative called \"thimerosal,\" used in vaccines that are given to children.** Drug giant Eli Lilly and Company makes thimerosal. It's the mercury in the preservative that many parents say causes autism in thousands of children. But nobody in Congress would admit to adding the provision, reports CBS News Correspondent Jim Acosta - until now. House Majority Leader Dick Armey tells CBS News he did it to keep vaccine-makers from going out of business under the weight of mounting lawsuits. \"I did it and I'm proud of it,\" says Armey, R-Texas. \"It's a matter of national security,\" Armey says.

There is plenty of ammunition for doubt in the medical establishment on this subject. The conflicts of interest are impossible to ignore. Remember **there are more big pharma lobbyists on Capitol Hill than Congressman and Senators combined. ** These questions should be the seeds of doubt necessary to get a truly curious person interested. First and foremost: Why was thimerosal [which contains mercury] taken out of most childhood vaccines, if it is allegedly safe? Many vaccines still contain \"[trace amounts](https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228)\" of mercury, 1 mcg or less per dose, according to the FDA.

Kennedy Jr. In June 2000, a group of top government scientists and health officials gathered for a meeting at the isolated Simpsonwood conference center in Norcross, Ga. Convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the meeting was held at this Methodist retreat center, nestled in wooded farmland next to the Chattahoochee River, to ensure complete secrecy. The agency had issued no public announcement of the session - only private invitations to 52 attendees. There were high-level officials from the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration, the top vaccine specialist from the World Health Organization in Geneva, and representatives of every major vaccine manufacturer, including GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Wyeth and Aventis Pasteur. All of the scientific data under discussion, CDC officials repeatedly reminded the participants, was strictly \"embargoed.\" There would be no making photocopies of documents, no taking papers with them when they left. **The federal officials and industry representatives had assembled to discuss a disturbing new study that raised alarming questions about the safety of a host of common childhood vaccines administered to infants and young children. According to a CDC epidemiologist named Tom Verstraeten, who had analyzed the agency's massive database containing the medical records of 100,000 children, a mercury-based preservative in the vaccines - thimerosal - appeared to be responsible for a dramatic increase in autism and a host of other neurological disorders among children.** \"I was actually stunned by what I saw,\" Verstraeten told those assembled at Simpsonwood, citing the staggering number of earlier studies that indicate a link between thimerosal and speech delays, attention-deficit disorder, hyperactivity and autism. Since 1991, when the CDC and the FDA had recommended that three additional vaccines laced with the preservative be given to extremely young infants - in one case, within hours of birth - the estimated number of cases of autism had increased fifteenfold, from one in every 2,500 children to one in 166 children. Even for scientists and doctors accustomed to confronting issues of life and death, the findings were frightening. \"You can play with this all you want,\" Dr. Bill Weil, a consultant for the American Academy of Pediatrics, told the group. The results \"are statistically significant.\" Dr. Richard Johnston, an immunologist and pediatrician from the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__vaccines-autism-mercury.txt:1:3482c5715e3f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10943, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__vaccines-autism-mercury.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__vaccines-autism-mercury", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "case, within hours of birth - the estimated number of cases of autism had increased fifteenfold, from one in every 2,500 children to one in 166 children.

The results \"are statistically significant.\" Dr. Richard Johnston, an immunologist and pediatrician from the University of Colorado whose grandson had been born early on the morning of the meeting's first day, was even more alarmed. \"My gut feeling?\" he said. \"Forgive this personal comment - I do not want my grandson to get a thimerosal-containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.\" **But instead of taking immediate steps to alert the public and rid the vaccine supply of thimerosal, the officials and executives at Simpsonwood spent most of the next two days discussing how to cover up the damaging data. According to transcripts obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, many at the meeting were concerned about how the damaging revelations about thimerosal would affect the vaccine industry's bottom line. ** \"We are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits,\" said Dr. Robert Brent, a pediatrician at the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Delaware. \"This will be a resource to our very busy plaintiff attorneys in this country.\" Dr. Bob Chen, head of vaccine safety for the CDC, expressed relief that \"given the sensitivity of the information, we have been able to keep it out of the hands of, let's say, less responsible hands.\" Dr. John Clements, vaccines advisor at the World Health Organization, declared flatly that the study \"should not have been done at all\" and warned that the results \"will be taken by others and will be used in ways beyond the control of this group. The research results have to be handled.\" **In fact, the government has proved to be far more adept at handling the damage than at protecting children's health. The CDC paid the Institute of Medicine to conduct a new study to whitewash the risks of thimerosal, ordering researchers to \"rule out\" the chemical's link to autism**. It withheld Verstraeten's findings, even though they had been slated for immediate publication, and told other scientists that his original data had been \"lost\" and could not be replicated. And to thwart the Freedom of Information Act, it handed its giant database of vaccine records over to a private company, declaring it off-limits to researchers. By the time Verstraeten finally published his study in 2003, he had gone to work for GlaxoSmithKline and reworked his data to bury the link between thimerosal and autism. Vaccine manufacturers had already begun to phase thimerosal out of injections given to American infants - but they continued", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__vaccines-autism-mercury.txt:2:736659c70dad", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10944, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__vaccines-autism-mercury.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__vaccines-autism-mercury", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "\"lost\" and could not be replicated.

By the time Verstraeten finally published his study in 2003, he had gone to work for GlaxoSmithKline and reworked his data to bury the link between thimerosal and autism. Vaccine manufacturers had already begun to phase thimerosal out of injections given to American infants - but they continued to sell off their mercury-based supplies of vaccines until last year. The CDC and FDA gave them a hand, buying up the tainted vaccines for export to developing countries and allowing drug companies to continue using the preservative in some American vaccines - including several pediatric flu shots as well as tetanus boosters routinely given to 11-year-olds. **The drug companies are also getting help from powerful lawmakers in Washington. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, who has received $873,000 in contributions from the pharmaceutical industry, has been working to immunize vaccine makers from liability in 4,200 lawsuits that have been filed by the parents of injured children.** On five separate occasions, Frist has tried to seal all of the government's vaccine-related documents - including the Simpsonwood transcripts - and shield Eli Lilly, the developer of thimerosal, from subpoenas. In 2002, the day after Frist quietly slipped a rider known as the \"Eli Lilly Protection Act\" into a homeland security bill, the company contributed $10,000 to his campaign and bought 5,000 copies of his book on bioterrorism. Congress repealed the measure in 2003 - but earlier this year, Frist slipped another provision into an anti-terrorism bill that would deny compensation to children suffering from vaccine-related brain disorders. \"The lawsuits are of such magnitude that they could put vaccine producers out of business and limit our capacity to deal with a biological attack by terrorists,\" says Dean Rosen, health policy advisor to Frist. Even many conservatives are shocked by the government's effort to cover up the dangers of thimerosal. Rep. Dan Burton, a Republican from Indiana, oversaw a three-year investigation of thimerosal after his grandson was diagnosed with autism. \"Thimerosal used as a preservative in vaccines is directly related to the autism epidemic,\" his House Government Reform Committee concluded in its final report. \"This epidemic in all probability may have been prevented or curtailed had the FDA not been asleep at the switch regarding a lack of safety data regarding injected thimerosal, a known neurotoxin.\" The FDA and other public-health agencies failed to act, the committee added, out of \"institutional malfeasance for self protection\" and \"misplaced protectionism of the pharmaceutical industry.\" **The story of how government health agencies colluded with Big Pharma to hide the risks of thimerosal from the public is a chilling case study of institutional arrogance, power and greed.

I was drawn into the controversy only reluctantly.** As an attorney and environmentalist who has spent years working on issues of mercury toxicity, I frequently met mothers of autistic children who were absolutely convinced that their kids had been injured by vaccines. Privately, I was skeptical. I doubted that autism could be blamed on a single source, and I certainly understood the government's need to reassure parents that vaccinations are safe; the eradication of deadly childhood diseases depends on it. I tended to agree with skeptics like Rep. Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California, who criticized his colleagues on the House Government Reform Committee for leaping to conclusions about autism and vaccinations. \"Why should we scare people about immunization,\" Waxman pointed out at one hearing, \"until we know the facts?\" **It was only after reading the Simpsonwood transcripts, studying the leading scientific research and talking with many of the nation's preeminent authorities on mercury that I became convinced that the link between thimerosal and the epidemic of childhood neurological disorders is real.** Five of my own children are members of the Thimerosal Generation - those born between 1989 and 2003 - who received heavy doses of mercury from vaccines. \"The elementary grades are overwhelmed with children who have symptoms of neurological or immune-system damage,\" Patti White, a school nurse, told the House Government Reform Committee in 1999. \"Vaccines are supposed to be making us healthier; however, in 25 years of nursing I have never seen so many damaged, sick kids. Something very, very wrong is happening to our children.\" **More than 500,000 kids currently suffer from autism, and pediatricians diagnose more than 40,000 new cases every year. The disease was unknown until 1943, when it was identified and diagnosed among 11 children born in the months after thimerosal was first added to baby vaccines in 1931. ** Some skeptics dispute that the rise in autism is caused by thimerosal-tainted vaccinations. They argue that the increase is a result of better diagnosis - a theory that seems questionable at best, given that most of the new cases of autism are clustered within a single generation of children. \"If the epidemic is truly an artifact of poor diagnosis,\" scoffs Dr. Boyd Haley, one of the world's authorities on mercury toxicity, \"then where are all the 20-year-old autistics?\" Other researchers point out that Americans are exposed to a greater cumulative \"load\" of mercury than ever before, from contaminated fish to dental fillings, and suggest", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__vaccines-autism-mercury.txt:4:42ac6088f523", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10946, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__vaccines-autism-mercury.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__vaccines-autism-mercury", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "- a theory that seems questionable at best, given that most of the new cases of autism are clustered within a single generation of children. \"If the epidemic is truly an artifact of poor diagnosis,\" scoffs Dr. Boyd Haley, one of the world's authorities on mercury toxicity, \"then where are all the 20-year-old autistics?\" Other researchers point out that Americans are exposed to a greater cumulative \"load\" of mercury than ever before, from contaminated fish to dental fillings, and suggest that thimerosal in vaccines may be only part of a much larger problem. It's a concern that certainly deserves far more attention than it has received - but it overlooks the fact that the mercury concentrations in vaccines dwarf other sources of exposure to our children. **What is most striking is the lengths to which many of the leading detectives have gone to ignore - and cover up - the evidence against thimerosal.** From the very beginning, the scientific case against the mercury additive has been overwhelming. The preservative, which is used to stem fungi and bacterial growth in vaccines, contains ethylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. **Truckloads of studies have shown that mercury tends to accumulate in the brains of primates and other animals after they are injected with vaccines - and that the developing brains of infants are particularly susceptible.** In 1977, a Russian study found that adults exposed to much lower concentrations of ethylmercury than those given to American children still suffered brain damage years later. **Russia banned thimerosal from children's vaccines 20 years ago, and Denmark, Austria, Japan, Great Britain and all the Scandinavian countries have since followed suit. ** \"You couldn't even construct a study that shows thimerosal is safe,\" says Haley, who heads the chemistry department at the University of Kentucky. \"It's just too darn toxic. If you inject thimerosal into an animal, its brain will sicken. If you apply it to living tissue, the cells die. If you put it in a petri dish, the culture dies. Knowing these things, it would be shocking if one could inject it into an infant without causing damage.\" **Internal documents reveal that Eli Lilly, which first developed thimerosal, knew from the start that its product could cause damage - and even death - in both animals and humans**. In 1930, the company tested thimerosal by administering it to 22 patients with terminal meningitis, all of whom died within weeks of being injected - a fact Lilly didn't bother to report in its study declaring thimerosal safe. In 1935, researchers at another vaccine manufacturer, Pittman-Moore, warned Lilly that its claims about thimerosal's safety \"did not check with ours.\" Half the dogs Pittman injected with thimerosal-based vaccines became sick, leading researchers there to declare the preservative \"unsatisfactory as a serum intended for use on dogs.\" In the decades that followed, the evidence against thimerosal continued to mount. During the Second", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__vaccines-autism-mercury.txt:5:7be693976251", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10947, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__vaccines-autism-mercury.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__vaccines-autism-mercury", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "weeks of being injected - a fact Lilly didn't bother to report in its study declaring thimerosal safe.

During the Second World War, when the Department of Defense used the preservative in vaccines on soldiers, it required Lilly to label it \"poison.\" In 1967, a study in Applied Microbiology found that thimerosal killed mice when added to injected vaccines. Four years later, Lilly's own studies discerned that thimerosal was \"toxic to tissue cells\" in concentrations as low as one part per million - 100 times weaker than the concentration in a typical vaccine. Even so, the company continued to promote thimerosal as \"nontoxic\" and also incorporated it into topical disinfectants. In 1977, 10 babies at a Toronto hospital died when an antiseptic preserved with thimerosal was dabbed onto their umbilical cords. **In 1982, the FDA proposed a ban on over-the-counter products that contained thimerosal, and in 1991 the agency considered banning it from animal vaccines. But tragically, that same year, the CDC recommended that infants be injected with a series of mercury-laced vaccines.** Newborns would be vaccinated for hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, and 2-month-old infants would be immunized for haemophilus influenzae B and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis. The drug industry knew the additional vaccines posed a danger. The same year that the CDC approved the new vaccines, Dr. Maurice Hilleman, one of the fathers of Merck's vaccine programs, warned the company that 6-month-olds who were administered the shots would suffer dangerous exposure to mercury. He recommended that thimerosal be discontinued, \"especially when used on infants and children,\" noting that the industry knew of nontoxic alternatives. \"The best way to go,\" he added, \"is to switch to dispensing the actual vaccines without adding preservatives.\" *[**Important Note:** For a stunning admission by Dr. Hilleman that AIDS was knowingly imported to the US by pharmaceutical companies, see this shocking [10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13QiSV_lrDQ&t=38s).]* For Merck and other drug companies, however, the obstacle was money. Thimerosal enables the pharmaceutical industry to package vaccines in vials that contain multiple doses, which require additional protection because they are more easily contaminated by multiple needle entries. The larger vials cost half as much to produce as smaller, single-dose vials, making it cheaper for international agencies to distribute them to impoverished regions at risk of epidemics. Faced with this \"cost consideration,\" Merck ignored Hilleman's warnings, and government officials continued to push more and more thimerosal-based vaccines for children. **Before 1989, American preschoolers received only three vaccines - for polio, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and measles-mumps-rubella.

A decade later, thanks to federal recommendations, children were receiving a total of 22 immunizations by the time they reached first grade. ** **As the number of vaccines increased, the rate of autism among children exploded.** During the 1990s, 40 million children were injected with thimerosal-based vaccines, receiving unprecedented levels of mercury during a period critical for brain development. Despite the well-documented dangers of thimerosal, it appears that no one bothered to add up the cumulative dose of mercury that children would receive from the mandated vaccines. \"What took the FDA so long to do the calculations?\" Peter Patriarca, director of viral products for the agency, asked in an e-mail to the CDC in 1999. \"Why didn't CDC and the advisory bodies do these calculations when they rapidly expanded the childhood immunization schedule?\" But by that time, the damage was done. Infants who received all their vaccines, plus boosters, by the age of 6 months were being injected with levels of ethylmercury 187 [micrograms] greater than the EPA's limit for daily exposure to methylmercury, a related neurotoxin. Although the vaccine industry insists that ethylmercury poses little danger because it breaks down rapidly and is removed by the body, several studies - including one published in April by the National Institutes of Health - suggest that ethylmercury is actually more toxic to developing brains and stays in the brain longer than methylmercury. Officials responsible for childhood immunizations insist that the additional vaccines were necessary to protect infants from disease and that thimerosal is still essential in developing nations, which, they often claim, cannot afford the single-dose vials that don't require a preservative. Dr. Paul Offit, one of CDC's top vaccine advisors, told me, \"I think if we really have an influenza pandemic - and certainly we will in the next 20 years, because we always do - there's no way on God's earth that we immunize 280 million people with single-dose vials.

Dr. Sam Katz, the committee's chair, was a paid consultant for most of the major vaccine makers. Dr. Neal Halsey, another committee member, worked as a researcher for the vaccine companies and received honoraria from Abbott Labs for his research on the hepatitis B vaccine. **Indeed, in the tight circle of scientists who work on vaccines, such conflicts of interest are common.** Rep. Burton says that the CDC \"routinely allows scientists with blatant conflicts of interest to serve on intellectual advisory committees that make recommendations on new vaccines,\" even though they have \"interests in the products and companies for which they are supposed to be providing unbiased oversight.\" Offit, who shares a patent on the vaccine, acknowledged to me that he \"would make money\" if his vote to approve it eventually leads to a marketable product. But he dismissed my suggestion that a scientist's direct financial stake in CDC approval might bias his judgment. \"It provides no conflict for me,\" he insists. \"I have simply been informed by the process, not corrupted by it. When I sat around that table, my sole intent was trying to make recommendations that best benefited the children in this country. It's offensive to say that physicians and public-health people are in the pocket of industry and thus are making decisions that they know are unsafe for children. It's just not the way it works.\" Other vaccine scientists and regulators gave me similar assurances. Like Offit, they view themselves as enlightened guardians of children's health, proud of their \"partnerships\" with pharmaceutical companies, immune to the seductions of personal profit, besieged by irrational activists whose anti-vaccine campaigns are endangering children's health. They are often resentful of questioning. \"Science,\" says Offit, \"is best left to scientists.\" Still, some government officials were alarmed by the apparent conflicts of interest. In his e-mail to CDC administrators in 1999, Paul Patriarca of the FDA blasted federal regulators for failing to adequately scrutinize the danger posed by the added baby vaccines. \"I'm not sure there will be an easy way out of the potential perception that the FDA, CDC and immunization-policy bodies may have been asleep at the switch re: thimerosal until now,\" Patriarca wrote. The close ties between regulatory officials and the pharmaceutical industry, he added, \"will also raise questions about various advisory bodies regarding aggressive recommendations for use\" of thimerosal in child vaccines. **If federal regulators and government scientists failed to grasp the potential risks of thimerosal over the years, no one could claim ignorance after the secret meeting at Simpsonwood.

But rather than conduct more studies to test the link to autism and other forms of brain damage, the CDC placed politics over science. The agency turned its database on childhood vaccines - which had been developed largely at taxpayer expense - over to a private agency, America's Health Insurance Plans, ensuring that it could not be used for additional research. It also instructed the Institute of Medicine, an advisory organization that is part of the National Academy of Sciences, to produce a study debunking the link between thimerosal and brain disorders.** The CDC \"wants us to declare, well, that these things are pretty safe,\" Dr. Marie McCormick, who chaired the IOM's Immunization Safety Review Committee, told her fellow researchers when they first met in January 2001. \"We are not ever going to come down that [autism] is a true side effect\" of thimerosal exposure. According to transcripts of the meeting, the committee's chief staffer, Kathleen Stratton, predicted that the IOM would conclude that the evidence was \"inadequate to accept or reject a causal relation\" between thimerosal and autism. That, she added, was the result \"Walt wants\" - a reference to Dr. Walter Orenstein, director of the National Immunization Program for the CDC. For those who had devoted their lives to promoting vaccination, the revelations about thimerosal threatened to undermine everything they had worked for. \"We've got a dragon by the tail here,\" said Dr. Michael Kaback, another committee member. \"The more negative that [our] presentation is, the less likely people are to use vaccination, immunization - and we know what the results of that will be. We are kind of caught in a trap. How we work our way out of the trap, I think is the charge.\" **Even in public, federal officials made it clear that their primary goal in studying thimerosal was to dispel doubts about vaccines.** \"Four current studies are taking place to rule out the proposed link between autism and thimerosal,\" Dr. Gordon Douglas, then-director of strategic planning for vaccine research at the National Institutes of Health, assured a Princeton University gathering in May 2001. \"In order to undo the harmful effects of research claiming to link the [measles] vaccine to an elevated risk of autism, we need to conduct and publicize additional studies to assure parents of safety.\" Douglas formerly served as president of vaccinations for Merck, where he ignored warnings about thimerosal's risks. **In May of last year, the Institute", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__vaccines-autism-mercury.txt:9:3b2f3dbf9bc6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10951, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__vaccines-autism-mercury.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__vaccines-autism-mercury", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "Gordon Douglas, then-director of strategic planning for vaccine research at the National Institutes of Health, assured a Princeton University gathering in May 2001. \"In order to undo the harmful effects of research claiming to link the [measles] vaccine to an elevated risk of autism, we need to conduct and publicize additional studies to assure parents of safety.\" Douglas formerly served as president of vaccinations for Merck, where he ignored warnings about thimerosal's risks. **In May of last year, the Institute of Medicine issued its final report. Its conclusion: There is no proven link between autism and thimerosal in vaccines. Rather than reviewing the large body of literature describing the toxicity of thimerosal, the report relied on four disastrously flawed epidemiological studies examining European countries, where children received much smaller doses of thimerosal than American kids.** It also cited a new version of the Verstraeten study, published in the journal Pediatrics, that had been reworked to reduce the link between thimerosal and autism. The new study included children too young to have been diagnosed with autism and overlooked others who showed signs of the disease. The IOM declared the case closed and - in a startling position for a scientific body - recommended that no further research be conducted. The report may have satisfied the CDC, but it convinced no one. Rep. David Weldon, a Republican physician from Florida who serves on the House Government Reform Committee, attacked the Institute of Medicine, saying it relied on a handful of studies that were \"fatally flawed\" by \"poor design\" and failed to represent \"all the available scientific and medical research.\" CDC officials are not interested in an honest search for the truth, Weldon told me, because \"an association between vaccines and autism would force them to admit that their policies irreparably damaged thousands of children. Who would want to make that conclusion about themselves?\" Under pressure from Congress, parents and a few of its own panel members, the Institute of Medicine reluctantly convened a second panel to review the findings of the first. In February, the new panel, composed of different scientists, criticized the earlier panel for its lack of transparency and urged the CDC to make its vaccine database available to the public. **So far, though, only two scientists have managed to gain access. Dr. Mark Geier, president of the Genetics Center of America, and his son, David, spent a year battling to obtain the medical records from the CDC. Since August 2002, when members of Congress pressured the agency to turn over the data, the Geiers have completed six studies that demonstrate a powerful correlation between thimerosal and neurological damage in children. ** One study, which compares the cumulative dose of mercury received by children born between 1981 and 1985 with those born between 1990 and 1996, found a \"very significant relationship\" between autism and vaccines.

Another study of educational performance found that kids who received higher doses of thimerosal in vaccines were nearly three times as likely to be diagnosed with autism and more than three times as likely to suffer from speech disorders and mental retardation. Another soon-to-be-published study shows that autism rates are in decline following the recent elimination of thimerosal from most vaccines. As the federal government worked to prevent scientists from studying vaccines, others have stepped in to study the link to autism. In April, reporter Dan Olmsted of UPI undertook [one of the more interesting studies](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-autism-Vaccines-Amish) himself. Searching for children who had not been exposed to mercury in vaccines - the kind of population that scientists typically use as a \"control\" in experiments - **Olmsted scoured the Amish of Lancaster County, Penn., who refuse to immunize their infants. Given the national rate of autism, Olmsted calculated that there should be 130 autistics among the Amish. He found only four. One had been exposed to high levels of mercury from a power plant. The other three - including one child adopted from outside the Amish community - had received their vaccines. ** At the state level, many officials have also conducted in-depth reviews of thimerosal. While the Institute of Medicine was busy whitewashing the risks, the Iowa Legislature was carefully combing through all of the available scientific and biological data. **\"After three years of review, I became convinced there was sufficient credible research to show a link between mercury and the increased incidences in autism,\" says state Sen. Ken Veenstra, a Republican who oversaw the investigation. \"The fact that Iowa's 700 percent increase in autism began in the 1990s, right after more and more vaccines were added to the children's vaccine schedules, is solid evidence alone.\" Last year, Iowa became the first state to ban mercury in vaccines, followed by California. Similar bans are now under consideration in 32 other states. ** But instead of following suit, the FDA continues to allow manufacturers to include thimerosal in scores of over-the-counter medications as well as steroids and injected collagen. Even more alarming, **the government continues to ship vaccines preserved with thimerosal to developing countries - some of which are now experiencing a sudden explosion in autism rates.** **In China, where the disease was virtually unknown prior to the introduction of thimerosal by U.S. drug manufacturers in 1999, news reports indicate that there are now more than 1.8", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__vaccines-autism-mercury.txt:11:6996b81a81c3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10953, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__vaccines-autism-mercury.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__vaccines-autism-mercury", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "suit, the FDA continues to allow manufacturers to include thimerosal in scores of over-the-counter medications as well as steroids and injected collagen.

The World Health Organization continues to insist thimerosal is safe, but it promises to keep the possibility that it is linked to neurological disorders \"under review.\" I devoted time to study this issue because I believe that this is a moral crisis that must be addressed. **If, as the evidence suggests, our public-health authorities knowingly allowed the pharmaceutical industry to poison an entire generation of American children, their actions arguably constitute one of the biggest scandals in the annals of American medicine.** \"The CDC is guilty of incompetence and gross negligence,\" says Mark Blaxill, vice president of Safe Minds, a nonprofit organization concerned about the role of mercury in medicines. \"The damage caused by vaccine exposure is massive. It's bigger than asbestos, bigger than tobacco, bigger than anything you've ever seen.\" It's hard to calculate the damage to our country - and to the international efforts to eradicate epidemic diseases - if Third World nations come to believe that America's most heralded foreign-aid initiative is poisoning their children. It's not difficult to predict how this scenario will be interpreted by America's enemies abroad. The scientists and researchers - many of them sincere, even idealistic - who are participating in efforts to hide the science on thimerosal claim that they are trying to advance the lofty goal of protecting children in developing nations from disease pandemics. They are badly misguided. Their failure to come clean on thimerosal will come back horribly to haunt our country and the world's poorest populations. *Robert F.

Despite this knowledge, these officials allowed a 2003 article to be published in Pediatrics that excluded this information, misrepresented the decline as an increase, and led to the mistaken conclusion that Thimerosal in vaccines does not cause autism. **Note:** For the complete text of the article, which has strangely been taken down from the *Sacramento Bee* website, [click here](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scandal-exposed-in-major-study-of-autism-and-mercury-132519518.html).

The incidence of autism has grown dramatically over the last two decades, from about one in every 2,000 children to as high as one in every 166.** The purported link between autism and mercury has been a subject of intense debate. In the past it has centered primarily on the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal, which was once widely used in vaccines. Many parents have argued that thimerosal causes autism because their children seemed to develop the neurological disorder shortly after they received childhood vaccinations. **Swine flu vaccine 'linked to' sleeping disorder *The Telegraph* (One of the UK's leading newspapers), March 29, 2012** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9171414/Swine-flu-vaccine-linked...](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9171414/Swine-flu-vaccine-linked-to-sleeping-disorder.html) A study in Finland has found that children vaccinated against the H1N1 swine flu virus with Pandemrix were more likely to develop the sleep disorder narcolepsy.

In Lancaster County, heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, there should be well over 100 with some form of the disorder. There is evidence of only three. Julia is one of them. She ... is adopted from China. She had most of her vaccines given to her in the United States. [Of the other, one definitely had a vaccine, and the other's vaccine status is unknown.] Thousands of children cared for by Homefirst Health Services in metropolitan Chicago have at least two things in common with thousands of Amish children in rural Lancaster: They have never been vaccinated. And they don't have autism. **\"We have about 30,000 or 35,000 children that we've taken care of over the years, and I don't think we have a single case of autism in children delivered by us who never received vaccines,\" said Dr. Mayer Eisenstein, Homefirst's medical director.** Eisenstein, in fact, is author of the book \"Don't Vaccinate Before You Educate!\" Earlier this year Florida pediatrician Dr. Jeff Bradstreet said there is virtually no autism in home-schooling families who decline to vaccinate for religious reasons - lending credence to Eisenstein's observations. \"It's largely non-existent,\" said Bradstreet, who treats children with autism from around the country. Thimerosal, which is 49.6 percent ethyl mercury by weight, was phased out of most U.S. childhood immunizations beginning in 1999, but the CDC recommends flu shots for pregnant women and last year began recommending them for children 6 to 23 months old. Most of those shots contain thimerosal. **Note: **The above article appears to have been removed from the *Washington Times* website.

Flu vaccine sold in multidose vials still contains the preservative, and the government urges flu shots for pregnant women and young children even though not enough thimerosal-free ones are available, critics say. Finding answers is tough because autism, a little-understood developmental disorder, often is diagnosed at the very ages when children get vaccines. **The stories are remarkably similar: A seemingly normal child gets a shot and days, weeks or months later, withdraws from the world, stops speaking, becomes upset at random stimulation such as a doorbell, and adopts compulsive behaviors like head-banging.** **Note: **MSNBC appears to have removed this article, though you can still find it on [this webpage](https://www.gainesville.com/story/news/2005/06/26/a-debate-that-just-wont-die/31696729007/).

The problem: five days before he had published a study showing the unvaccinated children in his practice were significantly more healthy than those who were vaccinated. Dr. Paul (his preferred form of address) published [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33266457/) titled \"Relative Incidence of Office Visits and Cumulative Rates of Billed Diagnoses Along the Axis of Vaccination\" in the [International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph). The full study can be accessed free of charge on [this webpage](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346088816_Relative_Incidence_of_Office_Visits_and_Cumulative_Rates_of_Billed_Diagnoses_Along_the_Axis_of_Vaccination). The study involved a comparison of all of the 3,324 children Dr. Paul had seen in his practice for over 10 years from June 2008 to January 2019. 2,763 of those had been vaccinated with between 1 and 40 vaccines, while 561 had received no vaccines. The study revealed a clear curve where the more vaccines a child received, the more chronic diseases they later developed. Watch an excellent, engaging video featuring Dr. Paul discussing his study, another important survey comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated children, and introducing a couple families who have suffered from vaccines. Here's the link: **[https://www.doctorsandscience.com/shows](https://www.doctorsandscience.com/shows)** In the survey mentioned in this video, it was found that 5% of unvaccinated people had chronic health issues, while 50% of those vaccinated did. 10% of those vaccinated had diabetes, while none of those who were not vaccinated did. The data compiled on these and many other diseases is quite compelling. The official line on vaccines is that they are safe and effective. The claim is that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh any side effects caused by the vaccines. Yet over 50 studies comparing individuals who were vaccinated with those who were not have raised serious questions about this. A collection of these studies has been compiled on [this webpage](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Vaxxed-Unvaxxed-Parts-I-IX-1.pdf). If you read the summaries of these studies, you will likely find the data quite impressive. If this information resonates for you, please share this with those who might be open to hearing evidence that varies from the official story on vaccination. May we all have the will and courage to look deeper than what the government and pharmaceuticals companies tell us.

When a potential danger like this stirs up fear in the public, the media often stokes those fears far beyond what is warranted, as it brings lots of attention and profits to the media and their corporate sponsors. Thankfully, [some reporters](https://www.WantToKnow.info/zika-virusnewsarticles) are willing to show that the fear is being blown way out of proportion on this virus, just as was done with the avian and swine flus (see [this webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/avianflubirdnewsarticles)) and more recently the ebola virus. Dr. Joseph Mercola, who runs the world's most popular natural health website and has over two million subscribers to his email list, has written an excellent essay showing how media propaganda is greatly exaggerating the real risk of the Zika virus. Remember that the more we live in fear, the more easy it is for us to be manipulated. Educate yourself by reading the article below and exploring the excellent footnotes and links provided.

The condition, in which babies are born with unusually small heads, was initially reported to have surged from an average of about 150 cases annually to more than 4,780 cases since October 2015. Microcephaly Cases Vastly Over-Reported The Brazilian government has already admitted that overly generous parameters resulted in dramatic over-reporting of the rare condition public health officials have associated with the Zika virus, which has been dubbed by the media as the \"shrunken head\" virus. To be on the safe side, when Zika-affected areas began seeing a rise in microcephaly, the Brazilian government asked health officials to report any case in which a child was born with a head circumference smaller than 33 centimeters. False positives were expected, and when they realized that most of these babies were in fact healthy and normal, the threshold was lowered to 32 centimeters in December. The limit may be lowered even further, to 31.9 centimeters for boys and 31.5 centimeters for girls. As reported by *The New York Times*:[4](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) *\"Of the cases examined so far, **404 have been confirmed as having microcephaly. Only 17 of them tested positive for the Zika virus**...* *Another 709 babies have been ruled out as having microcephaly ... underscoring the risks of false positives making the epidemic appear larger than it actually is. The remaining 3,670 cases are still being investigated.\" * As noted by *The New York Times*, there's actually very little scientific evidence tying the Zika virus to this particular condition. Still, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Zika virus a global health emergency[5](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) on February 1, noting that the \"main worry\" is the virus' potential link to microcephaly and subsequent brain damage. Poverty, Pollution, and Vitamin Deficiencies May Affect Microcephaly Rates in Brazil The Zika virus was initially identified in 1947 in Uganda, where it was originally limited to rhesus monkeys. It's an arbovirus, meaning the disease is transmitted via mosquito, tick or flea bites. In humans, Zika infection typically [causes only mild flu-like symptoms](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-zika-virus-6-things-know-about-growing-outbreak), if any, and there does not appear to be any prior evidence suggesting it might cause birth defects.

That certainly doesn't exclude the possibility, of course, but there are many other factors and co-factors that offer a far more likely and rational explanation for the rise in microcephaly in this area of Brazil, besides Zika-carrying mosquitoes. **For starters, the \"outbreak\" is occurring in a largely poverty-stricken agricultural area of Brazil that uses large amounts of banned pesticides.[8](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources),[9](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources),[10](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources)**[https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) Between these factors and the lack of sanitation and widespread vitamin A and zinc deficiency, you already have the basic framework for an increase in poor health outcomes among newborn infants in that area.[11](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) Environmental pollution[12](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources),[13](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) and toxic pesticide exposure have been positively linked to a wide array of adverse health effects, including [birth defects](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/09/08/pesticides-threaten-human-health.aspx). When you add all these co-factors together, an increase in microcephaly doesn't seem like such a far-fetched outcome. Vitamin A Deficiency Linked to Microcephaly Vitamin A and zinc deficiency is considered endemic in Brazil,[14](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources),[15](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources),[16](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) and both of these nutritional deficiencies are known to depress immune function.[17](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources),[18](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources),[19](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) More importantly, vitamin A deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of microcephaly *specifically,*[20](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources),[21](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) and zinc is known to play an important role in the structure and function of the brain.[22](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) Even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists malnutrition and exposure to toxic chemicals as two of the three known risk factors. The third is certain infections during pregnancy, including rubella, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and others.[23](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) Atrazine Also Implicated in Microcephaly The pesticide Atrazine also appears to be a viable culprit. According to research[25](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) published in 2011, small head circumference was listed as a side effect of prenatal Atrazine exposure. Atrazine is used to prevent pre- and post-emergence weeds and is the second most commonly used herbicide after Roundup. As noted by Sott.net:[26](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) *\"The most obvious cause of birth defects in this area is direct contact and absorption of pesticides. A study of pesticide use on tomatoes[27](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) in the Northern State of Pernambuco, Brazil, indicates high exposure to pesticide workers and poor application methods which threaten the ecology of the area. * *Women washed the pesticide application equipment, generally in the work environment, without protective clothing or without observing the recommended three-fold washing process ...

A report[28](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources),[29](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) by an Argentine physician's organization called \"Physicians in the Crop-Sprayed Towns\" also challenges the theory that Zika virus is responsible for the microcephaly cases in Brazil. They note that for the past 18 months, a chemical larvicide that causes malformations in mosquitoes (pyroproxyfen**) **has been applied to the drinking water in the affected area of Brazil. Pyroproxyfen is manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical, a Japanese subsidiary of Monsanto, and has been used in a state-controlled program to eradicate mosquitoes. This chemical inhibits growth in mosquito larvae, thereby producing malformations that disable and/or kill the mosquitoes. According to \"Physicians in the Crop-Sprayed Towns,\" **it's also an endocrine disruptor and teratogenic, meaning it causes birth defects. The organization also points out that Zika virus has never been associated with birth defects previously, even in areas where 75 percent of the population has been infected.** According to the report: *\"Malformations detected in thousands of children from pregnant women living in areas where the Brazilian state added Pyroproxyfen to drinking water are not a coincidence, even though the Ministry of Health places a direct blame on the Zika virus for this damage.\"* Aerial Spraying of Neonicotinoids Also Causes Skeletal Malformations The list of pesticides that have the potential to disrupt fetal development is long. Yet another suspect is Imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid. In October 2012 - around the same time that these women would have been getting pregnant - Brazil lifted its ban on aerial spraying of neonicotinoids. In[30](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) 2001, it was reported that Imidacloprid fed to pregnant rats and rabbits in \"maternally toxic\" doses caused skeletal malformation in a small percentage of fetuses.[31](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources),[32](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) In December 2013, the U.K.'s *Daily Mail*[33](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) also reported that neonicotinoids were suspected of causing developmental problems in babies and children. Another 2013 study[34](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) showed adverse events with embryo development and neonicotinoids. **Perhaps it's not any single one of these pesticides that is to blame. Perhaps the rise in microcephaly cases is the result of exposure to a terrible mixture of toxic pesticides before or during pregnancy.** Mandatory Vaccination Program of Pregnant Women Took Effect 2015 Also, in October 2014 the Brazilian government mandated that all pregnant women must receive the pertussis-containing Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine, effective as of 2015.[35](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) The fact that birth defects began rising toward the end of 2015 seems suspicious in light of this mandate - especially when you consider that pertussis vaccine has previously been linked to brain inflammation and [brain damage](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/11/02/why-is-this-vaccine-causing-increased-infant-mortality.aspx) in infants, and the safety of administering Tdap", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__zika-virus-questions.txt:3:d1630e9d1b56", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10964, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__zika-virus-questions.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__zika-virus-questions", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "Mandatory Vaccination Program of Pregnant Women Took Effect 2015 Also, in October 2014 the Brazilian government mandated that all pregnant women must receive the pertussis-containing Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine, effective as of 2015.[35](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) The fact that birth defects began rising toward the end of 2015 seems suspicious in light of this mandate - especially when you consider that pertussis vaccine has previously been linked to brain inflammation and [brain damage](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/11/02/why-is-this-vaccine-causing-increased-infant-mortality.aspx) in infants, and the safety of administering Tdap to pregnant women has never been proven.[36](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) A number of previous studies have demonstrated that stimulating the immune system of a pregnant woman is a very bad idea.

Interestingly enough, the Gates Foundation has financed the development of genetically-engineered (GE) mosquitoes,[44](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) designed by a biotech company called Oxitec to combat dengue fever and Zika - a project some suspect may have somehow backfired, resulting in a Zika *outbreak* instead.[45](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) Considering the fact that the transgenic mosquitoes are designed to kill the offspring before they reach breeding maturity - they're carrying a \"suicide\" or \"self-destruct gene\"[46](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) if you will - you may wonder how such mosquitoes could possibly *promote* the spread of Zika. Well, they *can't.* Not intentionally, anyway, which is what some people have suggested. There are some potential problems though. This genetic \"kill switch\" starts to fail in the presence of the antibiotic tetracycline.[47](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) Brazil is the third largest consumer of antibiotics for food and animal production[48](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) and, according to a 2009 analysis,[49](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) an estimated 75 percent of the tetracyclines administered to farm animals end up being excreted in waste. The use of manure and sewage sludge as fertilizers is a major route of spread of antibiotics in the environment. (Little is known about the environmental impact of tetracycline, but Brazilian researchers[50](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) *have *found alarming situations where the presence of these drugs in drinking water has resulted in bacterial resistance.)

'Health Experts' Call for Return of DDT Groups like the Manhattan Institute are even calling for the return of [DDT](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/04/29/pesticide-exposure.aspx)[56](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) to address the mosquito problem! This is despite the fact that DDT passes freely through the placenta during pregnancy,[57](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) where it gains direct access to the developing fetus and its brain.[58](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) Studies have linked DDT to high blood pressure, decreased fertility, premature delivery, adult diabetes, and Alzheimer's.[59](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) Moreover, DDT has also been linked to microcephaly,[60](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) so using this toxin would definitely not be the answer to the current problem! As noted by STAT News:[61](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) *\"The United States banned DDT in 1972 after it was found to persist in the environment for decades, build up in food chains, and kill eagles, pelicans, and other wildlife. But the pesticide was never banned globally. * *Though the 2001 Stockholm Convention called on countries to eliminate use of DDT and related chemicals, DDT is still used in African and other countries to control malaria-carrying mosquitoes (which, as predicted, evolved widespread resistance to the chemical).* Foggers and Mosquito Sprays Don't Work on This Mosquito It's astounding how short-sighted many are, but that's what happens when you incite panic - people don't stop to *think*. In this case, recommendations to use toxic foggers and sprays is bound to do FAR more harm than good, if for no other reason than the fact that they're ineffective against Aedes aegypti*, *the species of mosquito in question.[62](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) These tiny black and white striped mosquitoes do not fly far - their range being a mere 300 to 600 feet. Since it's so difficult to catch them airborne, insecticidal sprays and foggers are mostly useless for controlling them. Also, they feed during the daytime, not at night, which is typically when the fog-trucks will roll through the neighborhood. Other questionable suggestions on the table include using X-rays and/or Gamma rays to sterilize mosquitoes. According to Reuters:[64](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) *\"Such laboratory-bred male mosquitoes could then be released in the wild to mate with the females of the species who then bear eggs that never hatch, thus reducing the number of insects in a given area without killing any animals or using chemicals.\" * Emergency Declaration Begins Another Round of Massive Profiteering ** The emergency declaration begins another round of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:h__zika-virus-questions.txt:5:931fbf194475", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10966, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "h__zika-virus-questions.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "h__zika-virus-questions", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "the neighborhood.

Yet it's worth remembering that any pandemic vaccine fast tracked to market in the U.S. during a \"public health emergency\" is completely shielded from liability for injuries and deaths. Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Merck are all looking to develop a Zika vaccine. The Indian company Bharat Biotech somehow got a head start, and began working on two Zika vaccines in November 2014.[67](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) Would it surprise you to find out that this company is also linked to the Gates Foundation? They received $50 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to research and conduct human trials on a malaria vaccine.[68](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) U.S. Overreacts Based on Poorly Constructed Fear Porn Like many other nations, the U.S. has overreacted to the news and is increasing mosquito eradication efforts. According to some exaggerated models, an estimated 200 million Americans, or over 60 PERCENT of the U.S. population, may become infected with Zika this summer.[71](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) So far, about three dozen cases of Zika virus infection have been confirmed in 11 U.S. states - most of which, according to the report, were thought to have been acquired by people while out of the country. As noted by Reuters:[73](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) *\"With no specific federal guideline yet in place to control the spread of the Zika virus in the United States, some mosquito-heavy states like Florida are stepping up spraying and education programs. But, the North and West have yet to boost prevention. Only one out of the more than 30 confirmed cases of Zika in the country appears to have been transmitted locally, in Dallas, Texas. * *Public health officials are bracing for the time when warmer weather increases the number of mosquitoes that can transmit the virus by biting an infected person and spreading it to others.

Is this wise? Chances are we may be in for some nasty surprises. As noted by Helen Wallace in 2012, a British environmentalist with the organization GeneWatch:[76](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) *\"This mosquito is Dr. Frankenstein's monster, plain and simple. To open a box and let these man-made creatures fly free is a risk with dangers we haven't even begun to contemplate.\"* ** We may not like the mosquito, but that doesn't mean it serves no function in the ecosystem. If we successfully eradicate this mosquito, what might the ramifications be ecosystem-wide?** How Does U.S. Explain 25,000 Microcephaly Cases Annually - Without Zika? **In the U.S., approximately 25,000 infants are diagnosed with microcephaly each year.[77](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) Brazil has about 70 percent of the population the U.S. has, and now reports just over 400 cases, 17 of which tested positive for the Zika virus. So is this *really* the global emergency it's being made out to be? ** And more importantly, is Zika virus *really* responsible for these birth defects? Colombia reports that 3,177 pregnant women have tested positive for Zika virus, yet no cases of microcephaly have occurred.[78](https://www.WantToKnow.info/h/zika-virus-questions-sources) **The evidence suggests implicating Zika virus may be a matter of *convenience *- leaders of the public-private partnership between industry and government are quickly blaming the rise in microcephaly on disease-carrying mosquitoes in order to sell more GE mosquitoes, to sell more toxic insecticides, and to have an excuse to develop and sell more vaccines. ** ** All the while, they are keeping hidden some of the most likely culprits - poor nutrition and toxic environmental exposures like pesticides, as well as vaccines given during pregnancy when the fetus is most susceptible to harm.** By throwing up a convenient veil in the form of Zika-infected mosquitoes, business can not only go on as usual, but *grow and expand *profits to boot.

Sooner or later the insanity must end. We cannot expect a healthy infant and child population when pregnant women are assaulted with toxins at every turn. And MORE toxins is NOT the answer!

May we all choose ever more often to live through loving. With love and best wishes, Fred **HINTS FOR HEALING YOURSELF** By Lloyd J. Thomas, Ph.D. \"The greatest force in the human body is the natural drive of the body to heal itself.\" wrote Dr. Norman Cousins after he had recovered from a \"terminal\" illness. He did this partly with organic foods, clean water, deep renewing sleep, a peaceful home environment, faith, lots of laughter, and videos which uplifted his spirit and lightened his terminal diagnosis. Certainly medicine, professional diagnosis and treatment are important aspects of becoming well. But medical science still remains ignorant as to precisely why some people heal and others succumb to disease. Indeed, the healing process itself remains a rather mysterious event. We do know however, that the individual person has a lot more power and control over his or her own healing than was ever acknowledged before. Here are some \"hints\" which might help you realize your own power and ability to help you heal. 1. **Practice acceptance of your illness.** Acceptance of your illness is not the same as resigning yourself to it. Resignation can lead to depression and depression is not supportive of healing. While you are ill, acceptance of disease as a part of you will allow you to create in yourself the atmosphere of caring, tenderness, and love in which your illness is more likely to heal. It also allows energy to be freed for other activities and other interests. 2. **View illness not as a loss, but as an opportunity for new growth and development.** If a starfish loses one of its arms, it merely goes about growing another. If a salamander loses its tail, its primitive nervous system begins regenerating another immediately. Certainly our human nervous systems are more sophisticated than those of a starfish or salamander. When we heal, we grow new tissue, new nerves, and new cells. While you are healing physically, why not also grow new ideas, new attitudes, new ways of viewing ourselves and the world, and new loves? 3. **See your illness as your body's attempt to redirect your life in a positive direction.** Avoid harshly judging your illness and resenting your body for having it. Avoid judging yourself altogether! Your body is always valiantly trying to be well. It has powerful tools in its biochemical, cellular, and nervous repertoire to regain its healthful balance. If you are positive and peaceful about your own ability to be well, then illness just becomes a \"redirection\" of your life. Someone once said, \"Illness is God's way of getting your attention!\" Pay attention to that message and allow it to redirect your life. 4. **Realize that death is not a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:healingourselves.txt:0:839b70ae61a6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10971, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "healingourselves.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "healingourselves", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "judging yourself altogether! Your body is always valiantly trying to be well. It has powerful tools in its biochemical, cellular, and nervous repertoire to regain its healthful balance. If you are positive and peaceful about your own ability to be well, then illness just becomes a \"redirection\" of your life. Someone once said, \"Illness is God's way of getting your attention!\" Pay attention to that message and allow it to redirect your life. 4. **Realize that death is not a disease, and it is not a failure.** The death rate for all living beings is still one hundred per cent. If staying alive is your only goal, you will most certainly fail at attaining it. As you accept the inevitability of your own death and realize you only have a limited amount of time to experience being alive, you increasingly realize that you might as well enjoy (as best as you possibly can) the moment-to-moment experience of aliveness, including your illness or pain. 5. **Avoid making physical wholeness your goal.** Nobody exists with a perfect physical body. Our functioning varies from moment to moment and certainly from day to day. A lot of people heal into peace of mind and self-love without ever becoming physically well. Consider the possibility that making goals of developing your own inner peace and your own ability to forgive and love yourself might promote your healing a lot faster than self-hate, self-criticism, and resentment toward your illness. Use your illness as a situation to learn about hope, love, acceptance, forgiveness, peace of mind, openness to living, and mindfulness to the moment. In doing so, you just may cause the disease to go into remission or to heal in the process. 6. **Our bodies respond to self-love and the love sent to us by others.** If you send your own body loving messages, and if you are *open to receive the love of others, *your body's immune system responds with something like \"Hey, this person likes being alive, lets get to work and fight for his or her life with all the power and energy we can muster.\" Negative thoughts produce certain chemicals in our bodies. Positive thoughts produce another set of chemicals. The former weakens the immune system. The latter strengthens it. 7. **Finally, use your body and the life in your body to love.** Loving is the only path to immortality. Your love lives on long after you physically die. If you spend most of your life hating, you spend most of it dying. If you spend it loving, you leave a legacy of peace and development to all those persons you touch with your love. A legacy of love. What a gift to offer future generations! Spend most of your life loving and you will only spend a few brief moments dying.

Which type will we worry about this year, and what kind of shots will we be told to take? **Remember the swine flu scare of 1976? That was the year the U.S. government told us all that swine flu could turn out to be a killer that could spread across the nation, and Washington decided that every man, woman and child in the nation should get a shot to prevent a nation-wide outbreak, a pandemic.** **Well 46 million of us obediently took the shot, and now 4,000 Americans are claiming damages from Uncle Sam amounting to three and a half billion dollars because of what happened when they took that shot.** By far the greatest number of the claims - two thirds of them are for neurological damage, or even death, allegedly triggered by the flu shot. We pick up the story back in 1976, when the threat posed by the swine flu virus seemed very real indeed. PRESIDENT GERALD FORD; This virus was the cause of a pandemic in 1918 and 1919 that resulted in over half a million deaths in the United States, as well as 20 million deaths around the world. WALLACE: Thus the U.S. government's publicity machine was cranked into action to urge all America to protect itself against the swine flu menace. (Excerpt from TV commercial urging everyone to get a swine flu shot.) One of those who did roll up her sleeve was Judy Roberts. She was perfectly healthy, an active woman, when, in November of 1976, she took her shot. Two weeks later, she says, she began to feel a numbness starting up her legs. JUDY ROBERTS: And I joked about it at that time. I said I'll be numb to the knees by Friday if this keeps up. By the following week, I was totally paralyzed. WALLACE: So completely paralyzed, in fact, that they had to operate on her to enable her to breathe. And for six months, Judy Roberts", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__1976_swine_flu_vaccine_60_minutes_transcript.txt:0:5735efdf4f9f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10974, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__1976_swine_flu_vaccine_60_minutes_transcript.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__1976_swine_flu_vaccine_60_minutes_transcript", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "when, in November of 1976, she took her shot. Two weeks later, she says, she began to feel a numbness starting up her legs. JUDY ROBERTS: And I joked about it at that time. I said I'll be numb to the knees by Friday if this keeps up. By the following week, I was totally paralyzed. WALLACE: So completely paralyzed, in fact, that they had to operate on her to enable her to breathe. And for six months, Judy Roberts was a quadriplegic. The diagnosis: A neurological disorder called \"Guillain-Barre Syndrome\" - GBS for short. These neurological diseases are little understood. They affect people in different ways. As you can see in these home movies taken by a friend, **Judy Roberts' paralysis confined her mostly to a wheelchair for over a year. But this disease can even kill. Indeed, there are 300 claims now pending from the families of GBS victims who died, allegedly as a result of the swine flu shot.** In other GBS victims, the crippling effects diminish and all but disappear. But for Judy Roberts, progress back to good health has been painful and partial. Now, I notice that your smile, Judy, is a little bit constricted. ROBERTS: Yes, it is. WALLACE: Is it different from what it used to be? ROBERTS: Very different, I have a - a greatly decreased mobility in my lips. And I can't drink through a straw on the right-band side. I can't blow out birthday candles. I don't whistle any more, for which my husband is grateful. WALLACE: It may be a little difficult for you to answer this question, but have you recovered as much as you are going to recover? ROBERTS: Yes. This - this is it. WALLACE: So you will now have a legacy of braces on your legs for the rest of your life? ROBERTS: Yes. The weakness in my hands will stay and the leg braces will stay. WALLACE: So Judy Roberts and her husband have filed a claim against the U.S. government. They're asking $12 million, though they don't expect to get nearly that much. Judy, why did you take the flu shot? ROBERTS: I'd never taken any other flu shots, but I felt like this was going to be a major epidemic, and the only way to prevent a major epidemic of a - a really deadly variety of flu was for every body to be immunized. WALLACE: Where did this so called \"deadly variety of flu\", where did it first hit back in 1976? It began right here at Fort Dix in New Jersey in January of that year, when a number of recruits began to complain of respiratory ailments, something like the common cold. An Army doctor here sent samples of their throat cultures to the New Jersey Public Health Lab to find our just what kind of bug was going around", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__1976_swine_flu_vaccine_60_minutes_transcript.txt:1:8987c6f5693c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10975, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__1976_swine_flu_vaccine_60_minutes_transcript.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__1976_swine_flu_vaccine_60_minutes_transcript", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "to be immunized.

An Army doctor here sent samples of their throat cultures to the New Jersey Public Health Lab to find our just what kind of bug was going around here. **One of those samples was from a Private David Lewis, who had left his sick bed to go on a forced march. Private Lewis had collapsed on that march, and his sergeant had revived him by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. But the sergeant showed no signs of illness. A few days later, Private Lewis died.** ROBERTS: If this disease is so potentially fatal that it's going to kill a young, healthy man, a middle-aged schoolteacher doesn't have a prayer. WALLACE: The New Jersey lab identified most of those solders' throat cultures as the normal kind of flu virus going around that year, but they could not make out what kind of virus was in the culture from the dead soldier, and from four others who were sick. So they sent those cultures to the Federal Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, for further study. A few days later they got the verdict: swine flu. **But that much-publicized outbreak of swine flu at Fort Dix involved only Private Lewis, who died, and those four other soldiers, who recovered completely without the swine flu shot.** **ROBERTS: If I had known at that time that the boy had been in a sick bed, got up, went out on a forced march and then collapsed and died, I would never have taken the shot.** DR DAVID SENCER: The rationale for our recommendation was not on the basis of the death of a - a single individual, but it was on the basis that when we do see a change in the characteristics of the influenza virus, it is a massive public-health problem in the country. WALLACE: Dr David Sencer, then head of the CDC - the Center of Disease Control in Atlanta - is now in private industry. He devised the swine flu program and he pushed it. **WALLACE: You began to give flu shots to the American people in October of '76?** **DR SENCER: October 1st.** **WALLACE: By that time, how many cases of swine flu around the world had been reported?** DR SENCER: There had been several reported, but none confirmed. There had been cases in Australia that were reported by the press, by the news media. There were cases in - WALLACE: None confirmed?

Did you ever uncover any other outbreaks of swine flu anywhere in the world? DR SENCER: No WALLACE: Now, nearly everyone was to receive a shot in a public health facility where a doctor might not be present, therefore it was up to the CDC to come up with some kind of official consent form giving the public all the information it needed about the swine flu shot.** This form stated that the swine flu vaccine had been tested. What it didn't say was that after those tests were completed, the scientists developed another vaccine and that it was the one given to most of the 46 million who took the shot. That vaccine was called \"X-53a\". Was X-53a ever field tested?** **DR SENCER: I-I can't say. I would have to -** **WALLACE: It wasn't** DR SENCER: I don't know WALLACE: Well, I would think that you're in charge of the program DR SENCER: 1 would have to check the records. I haven't looked at this in some time. WALLACE: The information form the consent form was also supposed to warn people about any risk of serious complications following the shot. But did it? ROBERTS: No, I had never heard of any reactions other than a sore arm, fever, this sort of thing. WALLACE: Judy Roberts' husband, Gene, also took the shot. GENE ROBERTS: Yes, I looked at that document, I signed it. Nothing on there said I was going to have a heart attack, or I can get Guillain Barre, which I'd never heard of. WALLACE: What if people from the government, from the Center for Disease Control, what if they had indeed, known about it, what would be your feeling? JUDY ROBERTS: They should have told us. WALLACE: Did anyone ever come to you and say, \"You know something, fellows, there's the possibility of neurological damage if you get into a mass immunization program?\" DR SENCER: No WALLACE: No one ever did? DR SENCER: No WALLACE: Do you know Michael Hattwick? DR SENCER: Yes, uh-hmm. WALLACE: Dr Michael Hattwick directed the surveillance team for the swine flu program at the CDC. His job was to find out what possible complications could arise from taking the shot and to report his findings to those in charge. **Did you know ahead of time, Dr Hattwick that there had been case reports of neurological disorders, neurological illness, apparently associated with the injection of influenza vaccine?** **DR MICHAEL HATTWICK: Absolutely** WALLACE: You did?

DR HAJTWICK: That's nonsense. I can't believe that they would say that they did not know that there were neurological illnesses associated with influenza vaccination. That simply is not true. We did know that. **DR SENCER: I have said that Dr Hattwick had never told me of his feelings on this subject.** **WALLACE: Then he's lying?** **DR SENCER: I guess you would have to make that assumption.** WALLACE: Then why does this report from your own agency, dated July 1976, list neurological complications as a possibility? DR SENCER: I think the consensus of the scientific community was that the evidence relating neurologic disorders to influenza immunization was such that they did not feel that this association was a real one. WALLACE: You didn't feel it was necessary to tell the American people that information DR SENCER: I think that over the - the years we have tried to inform the American people as - as fully as possible. WALLACE: As part of informing Americans about the swine flu threat, Dr Sencer's CDC also helped create the advertising to get the public to take the shot. Let me read to your from one of your own agency's memos planning the campaign to urge Americans to take the shot. **\"The swine flu vaccine has been taken by many important persons,\" he wrote. \"Example: President Ford, Henry Kissinger, Elton John, Muhammad Ah, Mary Tyler Moore, Rudolf Nureyev, Walter Cronkite, Ralph Nader, Edward Kennedy\" -etcetera, etcetera, True?** **DR SENCER: I'm not familiar with that particular piece of paper, but I do know that, at least of that group, President Ford did take the vaccination.** **WALLACE: Did you talk to these people beforehand to find out if they planned to take the shot?** **DR SENCER: I did not, no.** WALLACE: Did anybody? DR SENC ER: I do not know. WALLACE: Did you get permission to use their names in your campaign?

Never did.** WALLACE: Did you ask your own doctor about taking the swine flu shot? MOORE: Yes, and at the time he thought it might be a good idea. But I resisted it, because I was leery of having the symptoms that sometimes go with that kind of inoculation. WALLACE: So you didn't? MOORE: No, I didn't. WALLACE: Have you spoken to your doctor since? MOORE: Yes. WALLACE: And? MOORE: He's delighted that I didn't take that shot. WALLACE: You're in charge. Somebody's in charge. DR SENCER: There are - WALLACE: This is your advertising strategy that I have a copy of here. DR SENCER: Who's it signed by? WALLACE: This one is unsigned. But you--you'll acknowledge that it was your baby so to speak? DR SENCER: It could have been from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. It could be from CDC. I don't know. I'll be happy to take responsibility for it. WALLACE: It's been three years now since you fell ill by GBS right? ROBERTS: Right. WALLACE: Has the federal government, in your estimation, played fair with you about your claim? ROBERTS: No, I don't think so. It seems to be dragging on and on and on, and really no end in sight that I can see at this point. JOSEPH CALIFANO: With respect to the cases of Guillain Barre... WALLACE: Former Secretary of HEW Joseph Caifano, too was disturbed that there was no end in sight. So a year and a half ago, he proposed that Uncle Sam would cut the bureaucratic red tape for victims suffering from GBS and would pay up quickly. CALIFANO: We shouldn't hold them to an impossible or too difficult standard of proving that they were hurt. Even if we pay a few people a few thousand dollars that might not have deserved it, I think justice requires that we promptly pay those people who do deserve it. WALLACE: Who's making the decision to be so hard-nosed about settling? CALIFANO: Well, I assume the Justice Department is. WALLACE: Griffin Bell, before he left? CALIFANO: Well, the Justice Department agreed to the statement I made. It was cleared word for word with the lawyers in the Justice Department by my HEW lawyers.

GENE ROBERTS: I think the government knows its wrong. JUDY ROBERTS: If it drags out long enough, that people will just give up, let it go. GENE ROBERTS: I-I am a little more adamant in my thoughts than my wife is, because I asked - told Judy to take the shot. **She wasn't going to take it, and she never had had shots. And I'm mad with my government because they knew the fact, but they didn't realize those facts because they - if they had released them, the people wouldn't have taken it.** And they can come out tomorrow and tell me there's going to be an epidemic, and they can drop off like flies to - next to me, I will not take another shot that my government tells me to take. WALLACE: Meantime, Judy Roberts and some 4,000 others like her are still waiting for their day in court. **Note:** To watch this video clip online, [click here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/swine_flu_vaccine_1).

Among the myths this article busts? \"If you cross your eyes, they'll stay that way.\" \"Eat the crust of your bread because it's full of antioxidants,\" and, \"to get rid of hiccups, have someone startle you.\" There is a massive amount of medical misinformation circulating now, which is causing an epidemic of chronic disease unprecedented in human history. With all the medical misinformation we're exposed to on a daily basis, it's disappointing to see CNN waste time and space on yet another entertainment-style fluff piece, discussing \"health myths\" that have no little bearing on your health. Below I review 10 real health myths that CNN didn't bother to mention, even though these are the cause of a lot of unnecessary suffering and premature death. Because there is no shortage of real health myths that can, and do, have a massive impact on tens of thousands if not millions of people. Here is my list of the top 10 health myths, none of which CNN bothered to mention: **1: Cardio is the Best Type of Exercise** In recent years, researchers have begun to realize that conventional cardio, such as jogging, is not all it's been cracked up to be, and that you can actually improve your health and increase fat burning by making slight modifications to your cardio routine. **The", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__better_health_tips.txt:0:b473becc6b9b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10981, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__better_health_tips.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__better_health_tips", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "massive impact on tens of thousands if not millions of people. Here is my list of the top 10 health myths, none of which CNN bothered to mention: **1: Cardio is the Best Type of Exercise** In recent years, researchers have begun to realize that conventional cardio, such as jogging, is not all it's been cracked up to be, and that you can actually improve your health and increase fat burning by making slight modifications to your cardio routine. **The problem is that traditional cardio only works on the slow twitch muscle fibers in your red muscle, completely ignoring your white muscle super-fast twitch fibers.** \"Peak 8\" refers to peak exercises done once or twice a week, in which you raise your heart rate up to your anaerobic threshold for 20 to 30 seconds, followed by a 90-second recovery period. To perform these properly you will want to get very close to, if not exceed, your maximum heart rate by the last interval. Your maximum heart rate is calculated as 220 minus your age. Researchers have found that interval cardio produces a unique metabolic response that is in large part responsible for its superior benefits. Intermittent sprinting produces high levels of chemical compounds called catecholamines, which allow more fat to be burned from under your skin and within your muscles. The resulting increase in fat oxidation is thought to drive the increased weight loss. It is also the only type of exercise that will increase growth hormone levels. This becomes especially important after the age of 30, when growth hormones steadily decline. It is much safer and far less expensive to have your body make growth hormone naturally though [Peak 8 type exercises](http://fitness.mercola.com/sites/fitness/archive/2010/11/13/phil-campbell-on-peak-8-exercises.aspx) than to inject it like many athletes do to the tune of $1500 per month. **2: Vaccines are Safe and Effective ** I completely understand that for many this issue is not debatable as they believe that vaccines are one of the greatest gifts to public health in the history of civilization. If you believe that, then let me encourage you to open your mind and explore other views held by many well respected physicians, scientists, clinicians and pro-vaccine safety educators.

When it comes to vaccines, there are three primary questions that need to be considered. **First, is the vaccine in question safe? ** **Secondly, does it effectively prevent disease? ** **And third, which vaccines can safely and effectively be given together or in close succession? ** Unfortunately, these issues have not been sufficiently studied for most vaccines, and those vaccines that have been studied frequently show that they are either unsafe, ineffective, or both! **When several vaccines are administered together, or in close succession, their interaction may completely [overwhelm your child's developing immune system](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/04/01/the-dangers-of-excessive-childhood-vaccinations.aspx).** Now consider", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__better_health_tips.txt:1:a7b45cb390bc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10982, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__better_health_tips.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__better_health_tips", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "is the vaccine in question safe? ** **Secondly, does it effectively prevent disease? ** **And third, which vaccines can safely and effectively be given together or in close succession? ** Unfortunately, these issues have not been sufficiently studied for most vaccines, and those vaccines that have been studied frequently show that they are either unsafe, ineffective, or both! **When several vaccines are administered together, or in close succession, their interaction may completely [overwhelm your child's developing immune system](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/04/01/the-dangers-of-excessive-childhood-vaccinations.aspx).** Now consider that if your child is vaccinated according to the CDC's recommended schedule, by the time your child starts kindergarten he or she will have received 48 doses of 14 vaccines. Of these, 36 doses will be given during the first 18 months of life - a time when your child's body and brain is undergoing massive development! Public health officials have NEVER proven that it is indeed safe to inject this volume of vaccines into infants. What's more, they cannot explain why, concurrent with an increasing number of vaccinations, there has been an explosion of neurological and immune system disorders in American children. This issue covers so much ground, it's impossible to even try to summarize the many hazards and the lack of efficiency data for all the vaccines currently being given, in this article.

However, the health dangers of fluoride are so numerous; they far outweigh any benefit to your teeth, and that's IF water fluoridation actually did what it's claimed to do. Today, even promoters of fluoridation concede that the major benefits are only from *topical *applications; fluoride works from the outside of the tooth, not from inside of your body, so why swallow it? **Statistics tell us that water fluoridation is ineffective for preventing caries. There is practically no difference in tooth decay between fluoridated and non-fluoridated countries, and no difference between states that have a high- or low percentage of their water fluoridated.** Meanwhile, fluoride can cause significant harm, from dental fluorosis to thyroid damage to reduced IQ and much more. I've joined forces with [the Fluoride Action Network](http://www.fluoridealert.org/) (FAN) to help end water fluoridation in Canada and the United States. For more about the dangers of fluoride, and information about how to get involved in this campaign, please see [this article](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/07/01/paul-connett-interview.aspx), which also includes an excellent interview with Dr. Paul Connett, who created FAN and is one of the foremost experts on this topic. ****[Better health tip: For an MSNBC/Reuters article revealing scientific skepticism on the benefits of fluoridated water, [click", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__better_health_tips.txt:2:1dac128ff20d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10983, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__better_health_tips.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__better_health_tips", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "joined forces with [the Fluoride Action Network](http://www.fluoridealert.org/) (FAN) to help end water fluoridation in Canada and the United States.

Within 9 years of their introduction in 1996, multiple chronic illnesses jumped from 7 percent to 13 percent of the population, food allergies doubled in less time, and many other ailments have exponentially increased. Millions may already be suffering health problems caused by genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their diet. [The American Academy of Environmental Medicine has already urged doctors to prescribe non-GMO diets](https://www.aaemonline.org/gmo.php) for all patients, citing studies that show how GMOs cause disorders such as vital organ damage, gastrointestinal and immune system problems, accelerated aging, infertility, and dysfunctional regulation of insulin and cholesterol. **But not only are GM foods a health disaster, they also pose a significant environmental threat, and industry promises of financial benefits have turned out to be false as well.** For a quick introduction, I recommend reading the article [10 Reasons to Avoid Genetically Modified Foods](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/02/27/10-reasons-why-no-one-needs-gm-foods.aspx), which delves into everything from the health problems associated with eating GM foods to the evidence against GM crops as a sustainable, economically and environmentally viable alternative to traditional farming.

But despite all the bad press linking sun exposure to skin cancer, there's almost *no evidence* at all to support that stance. There is, however, plenty of evidence to the contrary. **Over the years, several studies have already confirmed that appropriate sun exposure actually helps *prevent* skin cancer. In fact, melanoma occurrence has been found to decrease with greater sun exposure, and [can be increased by sunscreens](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/07/01/four-out-of-five-sunscreens-may-be-hazardous-to-your-health.aspx). **In my [interview with vitamin D expert Dr. Robert Heaney](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/03/24/Does-Sun-Exposure-Really-Cause-Melanoma.aspx), he explains how the conventional recommendations are in fact causing the very health problem they claim to prevent. How does sunlight prevent, rather than cause, skin cancer? In short, it's the vitamin D formed in your skin from exposure to sunlight that provides this built in cancer protection. The vitamin D goes directly to genes in your skin that help prevent the types of abnormalities that ultraviolet light causes. Unfortunately,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__better_health_tips.txt:3:31d500e798a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10984, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__better_health_tips.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__better_health_tips", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "**In my [interview with vitamin D expert Dr. Robert Heaney](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/03/24/Does-Sun-Exposure-Really-Cause-Melanoma.aspx), he explains how the conventional recommendations are in fact causing the very health problem they claim to prevent. How does sunlight prevent, rather than cause, skin cancer? In short, it's the vitamin D formed in your skin from exposure to sunlight that provides this built in cancer protection. The vitamin D goes directly to genes in your skin that help prevent the types of abnormalities that ultraviolet light causes. Unfortunately, if you follow the conventional recommendation to avoid sun exposure or always use sunscreen, your skin will not make any vitamin D, leaving you without this built-in cancer protection. Statistics confirm the truth of these findings, as melanoma rates have increased right along with sun avoidance and increased use of sunscreens. If avoiding the sun actually *was* the answer, then melanoma rates should have decreased exponentially over the past couple of decades. Instead, sun avoidance and the excessive use of sun screen are actually the two primary reasons for the rise in melanoma.

Dietary fats are also needed for the conversion of carotene to vitamin A, for mineral absorption, and for a host of other biological processes. In fact, saturated is the preferred fuel for your heart! For more information about saturated fats and the essential role they play in maintaining your health, please read my previous article [*The Truth About Saturated Fat*.](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/01/05/the-truth-about-saturated-fat.aspx) **7: Artificial Sweeteners are Safe, Well Tested and Promote Weight Loss** Most people use artificial sweeteners to lose weight. The amazing irony is that nearly all the studies that have carefully analyzed their effectiveness show that those who use artificial sweeteners actually gain more weight than those who consume caloric sweeteners. **In 2005, data gathered from the 25-year long San Antonio Heart Study showed that drinking [*diet*soft drinks increased the likelihood of serious weight gain](https://news.uthscsa.edu/new-analysis-suggests-diet-soda-paradox-less-sugar-more-weight/) - far more so than regular soda.** On average, each diet soft drink the participants consumed per day increased their risk of becoming overweight by 65 percent within the next seven", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__better_health_tips.txt:4:e9c91230501c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10985, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__better_health_tips.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__better_health_tips", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "the studies that have carefully analyzed their effectiveness show that those who use artificial sweeteners actually gain more weight than those who consume caloric sweeteners. **In 2005, data gathered from the 25-year long San Antonio Heart Study showed that drinking [*diet*soft drinks increased the likelihood of serious weight gain](https://news.uthscsa.edu/new-analysis-suggests-diet-soda-paradox-less-sugar-more-weight/) - far more so than regular soda.** On average, each diet soft drink the participants consumed per day increased their risk of becoming overweight by 65 percent within the next seven to eight years, and made them 41 percent more likely to become obese. The reasons for this ironic reality are still being investigated, but there are several potential causes, including: Sweet taste alone appears to increase hunger, regardless of caloric content. Artificial sweeteners appear to [simply perpetuate a craving for sweets](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2040783), and overall sugar consumption is therefore not reduced-leading to further problems controlling your weight. Artificial sweeteners may disrupt your body's natural ability to \"count calories,\" as evidenced in studies such as this 2004 [study at Purdue University](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=933%5Bpage%5D+AND+2004/07%5Bpdat%5D+AND+Davidson%5Bauthor%5D&cmd=detailssearch), which found that rats fed artificially sweetened liquids ate *more* high-calorie food than rats fed high-caloric sweetened liquids. There are also a large number of health dangers associated with artificial sweeteners and aspartame in particular. I've started compiling a growing list of studies pertaining to health problems associated with aspartame, which you can [find here](http://aspartame.mercola.com/studies.aspx). If you're still on the fence, I highly recommend reviewing these studies for yourself so that you can make an educated decision. [Better health tip: For an incredibly revealing, carefully researched documentary on the dangers of artificial sweeteners, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aspartamemsgcoverup).] **8: Soy is a Health Food ** The meteoric rise of soy as a \"health food\" is a perfect example of how a brilliant marketing strategy can fool millions. But make no mistake about it, unfermented soy products are NOT healthful additions to your diet. If you find this recommendation startling then I would encourage you to review my [*Why Soy Can Damage Your Health*](http://www.mercola.com/article/soy/index.htm), which contains links to dozens of articles on the topic, and a video I recently did. **On the contrary, thousands of studies have linked unfermented soy to malnutrition, digestive distress, immune-system breakdown, thyroid dysfunction, cognitive decline, reproductive disorders and infertility-even cancer and heart disease. Not only that, but [more than 90 percent of American soy crops are genetically modified](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-smith/genetically-modified-soy_b_544575.html), which carries its own set of health risks.** Here is a sampling of the detrimental health effects that have been linked to soy consumption: Breast cancer Brain damage Infant abnormalities Thyroid disorders Kidney stones Immune system impairment Severe, potentially fatal food allergies Impaired fertility Danger during pregnancy and nursing I am not opposed to *all *soy, however. *Organic* and, most importantly, *properly fermented* soy does have great health benefits.

As a general rule, I strongly recommend [eliminating grains as well as sugars](http://www.mercola.com/article/insulin.htm) from your diet, especially if you have any of the above conditions that are related to insulin resistance. The higher your insulin levels and the more prominent your signs of insulin overload are, the more ambitious your grain elimination needs to be. **If you are one of the fortunate ones without insulin resistance and of normal body weight, then grains are fine, especially whole grains.** It is wise to continue to monitor your grain consumption and your health as life is dynamic and constantly changing. What might be fine when you are 25 or 30 could become a major problem at 40 when your growth hormone and level of exercise is different. **10: Low-Fat Diets are Healthy** The low-fat myth may have done more harm to the health of millions than any other dietary recommendation. Again, just as the recommendations to avoid sunshine has increased melanoma rates, the low-fat craze led to increased consumption of [trans-fats](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2002/07/27/trans-fat-part-two.aspx), which we now know increases your risk of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. To end the confusion, it's very important to realize that *eating fat will not make you fat!* **The primary cause of excess weight and all the chronic diseases associated with it, is actually [the consumption of too much sugar -- especially fructose](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/08/14/some-carbs-turn-to-fat-fast-in-your-body.aspx), but also all sorts of grains, which rapidly convert to sugar in your body.** If only the low-fat craze had been a low-sugar craze, then we wouldn't have nearly as much chronic disease as we have today.

Though providing a much fuller story and some excellent information, the full version of \"Cancer: The Forbidden Cures\" has a tendency to paint allopathic medicine as all bad. Clearly Western medicine has its place. Yet there is ample evidence that it can be somewhat myopic in its views on alternative medicine.

Chemotherapy drugs net [billions of dollars in profits](https://www.WantToKnow.info/health/health-corruption) every year, fattening the wallets of physicians and drug company officers and stockholders. The respected American Medical Association (AMA) also reaps major profits from cancer medication advertisements and promotions. **Few people are aware of the unsavory history of the AMA and its *Journal of the American Medical Association *(*JAMA*).** This influential organization and its leaders became wealthy and powerful in the first half of the 20th century through selectively granting a seal of approval for untested drugs only to companies who would pay hefty fees to the AMA, and through major income from the tobacco industry for [*JAMA*'s promotions of cigarette smoking](http://www.naturalnews.com/021949_tobacco_smoking_health.html) and its [false claims](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-when-doctors-even-santa-endorsed-tobacco) about cigarette safety.

Fishbein, who was glowingly featured in a 1937 [cover story of*Time*magazine](http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19370621,00.html), was actively involved in suppressing the alleged cancer cures in two of the five cases presented in this documentary, as well as many others not mentioned.

Fishbein was also the main force behind the AMA's promotion of smoking. After leaving the AMA, he became [consultant to a tobacco company](http://tobaccodocuments.org/ness/35836.html) dedicated to minimizing any link between smoking and cancer. Quite the opposite of the *New England Journal of Medicine*'s courageous chief editor Marcia Angell, who worked tirelessly to [expose the blatant manipulations](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies) of the drug industry, Fishbein was seen by many as much more interested in making money than in protecting public health. \"Cancer: The Forbidden Cures\" further shows how **famous cancer institutes like the esteemed Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prevented both studies and the publication of any information that might show that alternative treatments did, in fact, have significant cancer cure rates.** Read what Sloan-Kettering's own assistant director of public affairs, Dr. Ralph Moss (now [a top advocate](http://cancerdecisions.com) of alternative cancer therapies),", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__cancer_cures.txt:1:2c428d8af3e8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10990, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__cancer_cures.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__cancer_cures", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the drug industry, Fishbein was seen by many as much more interested in making money than in protecting public health. \"Cancer: The Forbidden Cures\" further shows how **famous cancer institutes like the esteemed Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prevented both studies and the publication of any information that might show that alternative treatments did, in fact, have significant cancer cure rates.** Read what Sloan-Kettering's own assistant director of public affairs, Dr. Ralph Moss (now [a top advocate](http://cancerdecisions.com) of alternative cancer therapies), had to say about this in his essay at[this link](http://www.consumerhealth.org/articles/display.cfm?ID=19990303164550).

If there were a magic bullet, though, it might be something like dichloroacetate, or DCA, a drug that kills cancer cells by exploiting a fundamental weakness found in a wide range of solid tumors. So far, though, it kills them just in test tubes and in rats infected with human cancer cells; it has never been tested against cancer in living human beings. DCA ... is an existing drug whose side effects are well-studied and relatively tolerable. Also, it's a small molecule that might be able to cross the blood-brain barrier to reach otherwise intractable brain tumors. Within days after a technical paper on DCA appeared in the journal Cancer Cell last week, the lead author, Dr. Evangelos Michelakis of the University of Alberta, was deluged with calls and e-mails from prospective patients-to whom he can say only, \"Hang in there.\" DCA is a remarkably simple molecule. It acts in the body to promote the activity of the mitochondria. Researchers have assumed that the mitochondria in cancer cells were irreparably damaged. But Michelakis wondered if that was really true. With his colleagues he used DCA to turn back on the mitochondria in cancer cells-which promptly died. **One of the great things about DCA is that it's a simple compound, in the public domain, and could be produced for pennies a dose. But that's also a problem, because big drug companies are unlikely to spend a billion dollars or so on large-scale clinical trials for a compound they can't patent.** ([Anyone interested in helping can click here](http://www.dca.med.ualberta.ca/Home/index.cfm)) **Note:** For a 2010 follow-up by Dr. Michelakis with promising results, [click here](http://www.dca.med.ualberta.ca/Home/Updates/2010-05-12_Update.cfm) and watch the 10-minute video at [this link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUZn_KnN28w).

A small team of researchers is working to understand the genetic and immunological basis of the surprising phenomenon. Preliminary studies hint at the existence of a similar resistance in humans. Researchers hope that harnessing the biological process could lead to a new approach to treating cancer. But Dr. Zhen Cui of Wake Forest, whose team published the findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, said he expected rapid replication of the results because the findings were so clear-cut and easily observed. \"This is a truly remarkable phenomenon -- and it really needs confirmation from other institutions,\" he said. The team took white blood cells from the immune mice ... and injected them into mice already carrying a variety of tumors, some of which were extremely aggressive. In every case, the cancers were destroyed, even if the cells were injected at a point distant from the tumor. Healthy tissues were not affected. The mice that received the cells, furthermore, were protected from new tumors for the rest of their lives. The researchers have no idea how the immunity continues. **Note:** Why was this not in the headlines and not given a title like \"Cancer Cure Found for Mice\"? Most major papers didn't even report the story, and an article in the [*New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/health/09canc.html) was simply titled \"A Strain of Mice Appears Able to Resist Cancer Cells.\" Could it be that the power brokers in the medical industry know that a cancer cure would cause huge financial losses for them?

The results fall short of an immediate cancer cure, but they are encouraging, medical professionals say. JoEllen Welsh, a researcher with the State University of New York at Albany, has studied the effects of vitamin D for 25 years. **Part of her research involves taking human breast cancer cells and treating them with a potent form of vitamin D. Within a few days, half the cancer cells shriveled up and died.** Welsh said the vitamin has the same effect as a drug used for breast cancer treatment. \"Vitamin D enters the cells and triggers the cell death process,\" she [said]. \"It's similar to what we see when we treat cells with", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__cancer_cures.txt:4:9230fdcf2022", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10993, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__cancer_cures.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__cancer_cures", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "the effects of vitamin D for 25 years. **Part of her research involves taking human breast cancer cells and treating them with a potent form of vitamin D.

The vitamin's effects were even more dramatic on breast cancer cells injected into mice. After several weeks of treatment,** the cancer tumors in the mice shrank by an average of more than 50 percent. **Some tumors disappeared.

Indeed, it is a discovery that could end the pain and suffering of countless millions and change life on Earth forever. Certainly, the medical world would rush to embrace you with every imaginable accolade and financial reward imaginable. You would think so, wouldn't you? Unfortunately, arguably the greatest medical genius in all recorded history suffered a fate literally the opposite of the foregoing logical scenario. **In fact, the history of medicine is replete with stories of genius betrayed by backward thought and jealously, but most pathetically, by greed and money. ** In the nineteenth century, [Semmelweiss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis) struggled mightily to convince surgeons that it was a good idea to sterilize their instruments and use sterile surgical procedures. [Pasteur](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/louis_pasteur.htm) was ridiculed for years for his theory that germs could cause disease. Scores of other medical visionaries went through hell for simply challenging the medical status quo of the day, including such legends as Roentgen and his X-rays, Morton for promoting the 'absurd' idea of anaesthesia, Harvey for his theory of the circulation of blood, and many others in recent decades including: W.F.

Often, the visionary who challenges it pays a heavy price for his 'heresy.' ** So, you have just discovered a new therapy which can eradicate any microbial disease but, so far, you and your amazing cure aren't very popular. What do you do next? Well, certainly the research foundations and teaching institutions would welcome news of your astounding discovery. Won't they be thrilled to learn you have a cure for the very same diseases they are receiving hundreds of millions of dollars per year to investigate? Maybe not, if it means the end of the gravy train for all your research to find a cure. These people have mortgages to pay and families to support. Perhaps you should take your discovery to the pharmaceutical industry; certainly it would be of great interest to those protectors of humanity, right? **But remember, you have developed a universal cure which could make most drugs obsolete, so the pharmaceutical industry just might be less than thrilled to hear about your work.** In fact, the bigshots might even make it certain that your human disease-ending technology never sees the light of day, by preventing it from becoming licensed by the regulatory agencies. Now, assuming your amazing cure is an electronic instrument, the only cost of using it is electricity. And it is harmless to patients, who can recover without losing their hair, the family home, and their life savings. So, with your technology, there is no longer any reason for people with cancer to pay over $300,000 per patient - to become deathly ill from chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and surgery. It sounds like you won't find many friends and support among practicing oncologists, radiologists, and surgeons, doesn't it? You might try the hospitals and big clinics. But how thrilled are they going to be about a therapy administered in any doctor's office; which reverses illness before the patient has to be hospitalized? Thanks to you, the staffs of these institutions would essentially be out of work. Well then, how about the insurance companies? Surely, they would be delighted to save the expense of hospitalization - at least the companies which haven't invested in hospitals, where the staff is now sitting around waiting for someone to break a leg or be in a car accident ... and the ones who don't lose policyholders as a result of your invention ... and the companies which aren't trying to divest their pharmaceutical stock.

Probably the only friends you'll have will be the patients and those progressive doctors who see change as an opportunity, rather than a threat to their established money-making machines. Those people will love you. But they don't call the shots. **What follows now is the story of exactly such a sensational therapy and what happened to it. In one of the blackest episodes in recorded history, this remarkable electronic therapy was sabotaged and buried by a ruthless group of men. It has re-emerged in the underground medical/alternative health world only since the mid-1980's. This is the story of Royal Raymond Rife and his fabulous discoveries and electronic instruments. ** If you have never heard of Rife before, prepare to be angered and incredulous at what this great man achieved for all of us only to have it practically driven from the face of the planet. But, reserve your final judgment and decision until after you have read this. Of course, some may regard this as just an amusing piece of fiction. However, for those who are willing to do some investigating on their own, there will be mentioned several highly-respected doctors and medical authorities who worked with Rife, as well as some of the remarkable technical aspects of his creation. So let's now turn to the story of the most amazing medical pioneer of the 20th century. **The Life of Royal Rife: Quest for a Cancer Cure** Royal Raymond Rife was a brilliant scientist born in 1888 and died in 1971. After studying at Johns Hopkins, Rife developed technology which is still commonly used today in the fields of optics, electronics, radiochemistry, biochemistry, ballistics, and aviation. **He received 14 major awards and honors and was given an honorary Doctorate by the University of Heidelberg for his work.** During the 66 years that Rife spent designing and building medical instruments, he worked for Zeiss Optics, the U.S. Government, and several private benefactors. Because Rife was self-educated in so many different fields, he intuitively looked for his answers in areas beyond the rigid scientific structure of his day. He had mastered so many different disciplines that he literally had, at his intellectual disposal, the skills and knowledge of an entire team of scientists and technicians from a number of different scientific fields. So, whenever new technology was needed to perform a new task, Rife simply invented and then", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__cancercures__cancer_cures.txt:2:c5a3bb67c103", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 10998, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "Government, and several private benefactors. Because Rife was self-educated in so many different fields, he intuitively looked for his answers in areas beyond the rigid scientific structure of his day. He had mastered so many different disciplines that he literally had, at his intellectual disposal, the skills and knowledge of an entire team of scientists and technicians from a number of different scientific fields. So, whenever new technology was needed to perform a new task, Rife simply invented and then built it himself. Rife's inventions include a heterodyning ultraviolet microscope [see [*New York Times*article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/311122nytimes.rifemicroscope.pdf)], a microdissector, and a micromanipulator. When you thoroughly understand Rife's achievements, you may well decide that his was one of the most gifted, versatile, scientific minds in human history. By 1920, Rife had finished building the world's first virus microscope. **By 1933, he had perfected that technology and had constructed the incredibly complex [Universal Microscope](https://web.archive.org/web/20060622202732/http://rife.org/newspaper/flygrows.jpg), which had nearly 6,000 different parts and was capable of magnifying objects 30,000 times their normal size. With this incredible microscope, Rife became the first human being to actually see a live virus.** Modern electron microscopes instantly kill everything beneath them, viewing only the mummified remains and debris. What the Rife microscope can see is the bustling activity of living viruses as they change form to accommodate changes in environment, replicate rapidly in response to carcinogens, and transform normal cells into tumor cells. But how was Rife able to accomplish this, in an age when electronics and medicine were still just evolving? Here are a few technical details to placate the skeptics... **Rife painstakingly identified the individual spectroscopic signature of each microbe, using a slit spectroscope attachment.** Then, he slowly rotated block quartz prisms to focus light of a single wavelength upon the microorganism he was examining. This wavelength was selected because it resonated with the spectroscopic signature frequency of the microbe based on the now-established fact that [every molecule oscillates at its own distinct frequency](https://web.archive.org/web/20120221001848/http://www.biomedic.co.uk/bioresonancetechnology.html). The atoms that come together to form a molecule are held together in that molecular configuration with a covalent energy bond which both emits and absorbs its own specific electromagnetic frequency. No two species of molecule have the same electromagnetic oscillations or energetic signature. Resonance amplifies light in the same way two ocean waves intensify each other when they merge together. The result of using a resonant wavelength is that micro-organisms which are invisible in white light suddenly become visible in a brilliant flash of light when they are exposed to the color frequency that resonates with their own distinct spectroscopic signature. Rife was thus able to see these otherwise invisible organisms and watch them actively invading tissues cultures. Rife's discovery enabled him to view organisms that no one else could see with ordinary microscopes.

But ultraviolet light is outside the range of human vision, it is 'invisible' to us. Rife's brilliance allowed him to overcome this limitation by heterodyning, a technique which became popular in early radio broadcasting.** He illuminated the microbe (usually a virus or bacteria) with two [harmonic] wavelengths of ... ultraviolet light frequency which resonated with the spectral signature of the microbe. These two wavelengths produced interference where they merged. This interference was, in effect, a third, longer wave which fell into the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This was how Rife made invisible microbes visible without killing them, a feat which today's electron microscopes cannot duplicate. [For a 1944 Smithsonian Institution report which includes information on Rife's amazing microscopes, [click here](http://www.archive.org/stream/annualreportofbo1944smit/annualreportofbo1944smit_djvu.txt) and do a page search for the word \"Rife\"] By this time, Rife was so far ahead of his colleagues of the 1930's that they could not comprehend what he was doing without actually traveling to San Diego to Rife's laboratory to look through his Virus Microscope for themselves. And many did exactly that. One was Virginia Livingston. She eventually moved from New Jersey to Rife's Point Loma (San Diego) neighborhood and became a frequent visitor to his lab. Virginia Livingston is now often given the credit for identifying the organism which causes human cancer, beginning with research papers she began publishing in 1948. **Research into Cancer and Cancer Cures** In reality, Royal Rife had identified the human cancer virus first. ... In 1920, Rife made over 20,000 unsuccessful attempts to transform normal cells into tumor cells. He finally succeeded when he irradiated the cancer virus, passed it through a cell-catching ultra-fine porcelain filter, and injected it into lab animals.** Not content to prove this virus would cause one tumor, Rife then created 400 tumors in succession from the same culture. He documented everything with film, photographs, and meticulous records. **He named the cancer virus 'Cryptocides primordiales.' Virginia Livingston, in her papers, renamed it Progenitor Cryptocides. Royal Rife was never even mentioned in her papers. In fact, Rife seldom got credit for his monumental discoveries. He was a quiet, unassuming scientist, dedicated to expanding his discoveries rather than to ambition, fame, and glory. His distaste for medical politics (which he could afford to ignore thanks to generous trusts set up by private benefactors) left him at a disadvantage", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__cancercures__cancer_cures.txt:4:1014ed89028e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11000, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "meticulous records. **He named the cancer virus 'Cryptocides primordiales.'

He was a quiet, unassuming scientist, dedicated to expanding his discoveries rather than to ambition, fame, and glory. His distaste for medical politics (which he could afford to ignore thanks to generous trusts set up by private benefactors) left him at a disadvantage later, when powerful forces attacked him. Coupled with the influence of the pharmaceutical industry in purging his papers from medical journals, it is hardly surprising that few have heard of Rife today. Meanwhile, debate raged between those who had seen viruses changing into different forms beneath Rife's microscopes, and those who had not. Those who condemned without investigation, such as the influential Dr. Thomas Rivers, claimed these forms didn't exist. Because his microscope did not reveal them, Rivers argued that there was \"no logical basis for belief in this theory.\" **The same argument is used today in evaluating many other 'alternative' medical treatments; if there is no precedent, then it must not be valid. Nothing can convince a closed mind.** Most had never actually looked though the San Diego microscopes, as air travel in the 1930's was uncomfortable, primitive, and rather risky. So, the debate about the life cycle of viruses was resolved in favor of those who never saw it (even modern electron microscopes show frozen images, not the life cycle of viruses in process). Nevertheless, many scientists and doctors have since confirmed Rife's discovery of the cancer virus and its pleomorphic nature, using darkfield techniques, the [Naessens microscope](https://web.archive.org/web/20211005224317/https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/eppp-archive/100/201/300/cdn_medical_association/cmaj/vol-158/issue-12/1621.htm), and laboratory experiments. **Rife ignored the debate, preferring to concentrate on refining his method of destroying these tiny killer viruses. He used the same principle to kill them which made them visible: resonance. By increasing the intensity of a frequency which resonated naturally with these microbes, Rife increased their natural oscillations until they distorted and disintegrated from structural stresses.** Rife called this frequency 'the mortal oscillatory rate,' or 'MOR', and it did no harm whatsoever to the surrounding tissues. Rife's instruments used the principle of harmonics. This principle can be illustrated by using an intense musical note to shatter a wine glass: the molecules of the glass are already oscillating at some harmonic (multiple) of that musical note; they are in resonance with it. Because everything else has a different resonant frequency, nothing but the glass is destroyed. There are literally hundreds of trillions of different resonant frequencies, and every species and molecule has its very own. It took Rife many years until he discovered the frequencies which specifically destroyed herpes, polio, spinal meningitis, tetanus, influenza, and an immense number of other dangerous disease organisms.

It took Rife many years until he discovered the frequencies which specifically destroyed herpes, polio, spinal meningitis, tetanus, influenza, and an immense number of other dangerous disease organisms. Rife also worked with the top scientists and doctors of his day, who also confirmed or endorsed various areas of his work. They included: [Arthur Kendall](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1658030/) (Director, Northwestern Medical School); [E.C. Rosenow, Sr.](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/76/1965/192) (longtime Chief of Bacteriology, Mayo Clinic); Rufus Klein-Schmidt (President of USC); Dr. [Milbank Johnson](https://web.archive.org/web/20080116020916/http://www.dfe.net/Milbank_Johnson.html) (Director of the Southern California AMA); Whalen Morrison (Chief Surgeon, Santa Fe Railway); George Fischer (Childrens Hospital, N.Y.); Edward Kopps (Metabolic Clinic, La Jolla); and many others. On November 20, 1931, forty-four of the nation's most respected medical authorities honored Royal Rife with a banquet billed as \"The End To All Diseases\" at the Pasadena estate of Dr. Milbank Johnson. **In 1934, the University of Southern California appointed a special medical research committee to bring terminal cancer patients from Pasadena County Hospital to Rife's San Diego Laboratory and clinic for treatment. The team included doctors and pathologists assigned to examine the patients - if still alive - in 90 days. ** **After the 90 days of treatment, the committee concluded that 86.5% of the patients had been completely cured. The treatment was then adjusted and the remaining 13.5% of the patients also responded within the next four weeks. The total recovery rate using Rife's technology was 100%.** **Suppression and Ridicule** ** But by 1939, almost all of these distinguished doctors and scientists were denying that they had ever met Rife. **What happened to make so many brilliant men have complete memory lapses? It seems that news of Rife's miracles with terminal patients had reached other ears. Remember our hypothetical question at the beginning of this report: What would happen if you discovered a potential cure for everything? You are now about to find out. At first, a token attempt was made to buy out Rife. **Morris Fishbein, who had acquired the entire stock of the American Medical Association [AMA] by 1934, sent an attorney to Rife with 'an offer you can't refuse.' Rife refused.** We may never know the exact terms of this offer. But we do know the terms of an offer Fishbein made to Harry Hoxsey for control of his herbal cancer remedy. Fishbein's associates would receive all profits for nine years and Hoxsey would receive nothing. Then, if they were satisfied that it worked, Hoxsey would receive 10% of the profits. Hoxsey decided that he would rather continue to make the profits himself. When Hoxsey turned Fishbein down, Fishbein used his immensely powerful political connections to have Hoxsey arrested 125 times in a period of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__cancercures__cancer_cures.txt:6:c1cb6cab5760", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11002, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "the terms of an offer Fishbein made to Harry Hoxsey for control of his herbal cancer remedy.

Hoxsey decided that he would rather continue to make the profits himself. When Hoxsey turned Fishbein down, Fishbein used his immensely powerful political connections to have Hoxsey arrested 125 times in a period of 16 months. The charges (based on practice without a license) were always thrown out of court, but the harassment drove Hoxsey insane. [see article in *JAMA*, the journal of the AMA, [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/health/cancercures/cancer_cures_video#fishbein)] But Fishbein must have realized that this strategy would backfire with Rife. First, Rife could not be arrested like Hoxsey for practicing without a license. A trial on trumped-up charges would mean that testimony supporting Rife would be introduced by prominent medical authorities working with Rife. And the defense would undoubtedly take the opportunity to introduce evidence such as the 1934 medical study done with USC. **The last thing in the world that the pharmaceutical industry wanted was a public trial about a painless therapy that cured 100% of the terminal cancer patients and cost nothing to use but a little electricity. It might give people the idea that they didn't need drugs. ** And finally, Rife had spent decades accumulating meticulous evidence of his work, including film and stop-motion photographs. No, different tactics were needed. The first incident was the gradual pilfering of components, photographs, film, and written records from Rife's lab. The culprit was never caught. **Then, while Rife struggled to reproduce his missing data (in a day when photocopies and computers were not available), someone vandalized his precious virus microscopes. Pieces of the 5,682 piece Universal microscope were stolen. Earlier, an arson fire had destroyed the multi-million dollar [Burnett Lab](https://web.archive.org/web/20041019072912/http://www.njpalisades.org/cn2001_03-04.htm) in New Jersey**, just as the scientists there were preparing to announce confirmation of Rife's work. But the final blow came later, when police illegally confiscated the remainder of Rife's 50 years of research. Then in 1939, agents of a family which controlled the drug industry assisted Philip Hoyland in a frivolous lawsuit against his own partners in the Beam Ray Corporation. This was the only company manufacturing Rife's frequency instruments (Rife was not a partner). Hoyland lost, but his assisted legal assault had the desired effect: the company was bankrupted by legal expenses. And during the Great Depression, this meant that commercial production of Rife's frequency instruments ceased completely. And remember what a universal cure meant to hospitals and research foundations? **Doctors who tried to defend Rife lost their foundations grants and hospital privileges. On the other hand, big money was spent ensuring that doctors who had seen Rife's therapy would forget what they saw. Almost no price was too much to suppress", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__cancercures__cancer_cures.txt:7:5dd3f5aac1f0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11003, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "the desired effect: the company was bankrupted by legal expenses.

On the other hand, big money was spent ensuring that doctors who had seen Rife's therapy would forget what they saw. Almost no price was too much to suppress it.** Remember that, today, treatment of a single cancer patient averages over $300,000. It's BIG business. Thus, Arthur Kendall, the Director of the Northwestern School of Medicine who worked with Rife on the cancer virus, accepted almost a quarter of a million dollars to suddenly 'retire' in Mexico. That was an exorbitant amount of money in the Depression. Dr. George Dock, another prominent figure who collaborated with Rife, was silenced with an enormous grant, along with the highest honors the AMA could bestow. Between the carrots and the sticks, everyone except Dr. Couche and Dr. Milbank Johnson gave up Rife's work and went back to prescribing drugs. **To finish the job, the medical journals, supported almost entirely by drug company revenues and controlled by the AMA, refused to publish any paper by anyone on Rife's therapy.** Therefore, an entire generation of medical students graduated into practice without ever once hearing of Rife's breakthroughs. The magnitude of this crime eclipses every mass murder in history. Cancer picks us off quietly. By 1960 the casualties from this tiny virus exceeded the carnage of all the wars America ever fought. In 1989, it was estimated that 40% of us will experience cancer at some time in our lives. In Rife's lifetime, he had witnessed the progress of civilization from horse-and-buggy travel to jet planes. In that same time, he saw the epidemic of cancer increase from 1 in 24 Americans in 1905 to 1 in 3 in 1971 when he died. He also witnessed the phenomenal growth of the American Cancer Society, the Salk Foundation, and many others collecting hundreds of millions of dollars for diseases that were cured long before in his own San Diego laboratories. In one period, 176,500 cancer drugs were submitted for approval. Any that showed 'favorable' results in only one-sixth of one percent of the cases being studied could be licensed. Some of these drugs had a mortality rate of 14-17%. When death came from the drug, not the cancer, the case was recorded as a 'complete' or 'partial remission' because the patient didn't actually die from the cancer. The inevitable conclusion reached by Rife was that his life-long labor and discoveries had not only been ignored, but probably would be buried with him. At that point, he ceased to produce much of anything and spent the last third of his life seeking oblivion in alcohol. It dulled", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__cancercures__cancer_cures.txt:8:eb7bc2f6eb18", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11004, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "rate of 14-17%.

At that point, he ceased to produce much of anything and spent the last third of his life seeking oblivion in alcohol. It dulled the pain and his acute awareness of half a century of wasted effort - ignored - while the unnecessary suffering of millions continued so that a vested few might profit. And profit they did, and profit they do. In 1971, Royal Rife died from a combination of valium and alcohol at the age of 83. Perhaps his continual exposure to his own Rife frequencies helped his body endure abuse for so many years. **Modern Resurgence of Rife's Technology for Cancer Cures** Fortunately, his death was not the end of his electronic therapy. A few humanitarian doctors and engineers reconstructed his frequency instruments and kept his genius alive. **Rife technology became public knowledge again in 1986 with the publication of *[The Cancer Cure That Worked](http://www.amazon.com/Cancer-Cure-That-Worked-Suppression/dp/0919951309?tag=wanttinfo-20)*, by Barry Lynes, and other material about Royal Rife and his monumental work.** There is wide variation in the cost, design, and quality of the modern portable Rife frequency research instruments available. Costs vary from about $1200 to $3600 with price being no legitimate indicator of the technical competence in the design of the instrument or performance of the instrument. Some of the most expensive units have serious technical limitations and are essentially a waste of money. At the other extreme, some researchers do get crude results from inexpensive simple, unmodified frequency generators, but this is just as misguided as spending too much money. Without the proper modifications, the basic frequency generator gives only minimal and inconsistent results. Please recall that the actual destruction of the viruses and bacteria is not accomplished by the frequency displayed on these cheap generators, but by certain shorter harmonics of that particular frequency which are often blocked by the crudity of a cheap and rudimentary instrument itself. This very problem led Rife to ultimately abandon the 'ray tube' design in favor of today's version. The newer technology applies the frequencies and their harmonics to the body through the use of hand-held, footplate, or stick-on electrodes. Proper frequency exposure and flushing of the body with large amounts of clean, pure water is critical to achieve the kind of results Rife got. These procedures are fully explained in the manuals of the best units on the market. So, unless you would be satisfied with sporadic results for minor conditions, it is suggested you use only the highest quality equipment and only the proper, proven procedures in your personal research. **One day, the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__cancercures__cancer_cures.txt:9:1ad9882e7ac9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11005, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "hand-held, footplate, or stick-on electrodes.

While perfectly legal for veterinarians to use to save the lives of animals, Rife's brilliant frequency therapy remains taboo to orthodox mainstream medicine because of the continuing threat it poses to the international pharmaceutical medical monopoly that controls the lives - and deaths - of the vast majority of the people on this planet. **Special Note:** We have not researched any of the many current devices which claim to be based on Royal Rife technology.

Chemotherapy drugs net [billions of dollars in profits](https://www.WantToKnow.info/health/health-corruption) every year, fattening the wallets of physicians and drug company officers and stockholders. The respected American Medical Association (AMA) also reaps major profits from cancer medication advertisements and promotions. **Few people are aware of the unsavory history of the AMA and its *Journal of the American Medical Association *(*JAMA*).** This influential organization and its leaders became wealthy and powerful in the first half of the 20th century through selectively granting a seal of approval for untested drugs only to companies who would pay hefty fees to the AMA, and through major income from the tobacco industry for [*JAMA*'s promotions of cigarette smoking](http://www.naturalnews.com/021949_tobacco_smoking_health.html) and its [false claims](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-when-doctors-even-santa-endorsed-tobacco) about cigarette safety. For a brief essay describing these corrupt practices and more, [click here](http://www.naturalnews.com/023195_AMA_the_home.html). \"Cancer: The Forbidden Cures\" reveals that the controversial man who was [chief editor](http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/236/19/2212.1.short) of the *JAMA *for 26 years, Morris Fishbein, worked tirelessly to prevent any potential cancer cure that was not under the control of the medical establishment from seeing the light of day. Fishbein, who was glowingly featured in a 1937 [cover story of*Time*magazine](https://web.archive.org/web/20080429220024/https://time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19370621,00.html), was actively involved in suppressing the alleged cancer cures in two of the five cases presented in this documentary, as well as many others not mentioned. [An article](https://web.archive.org/web/20110624161949/https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760551-1,00.html) in *Time* only two years later describes how Fishbein and the AMA were indicted for profiteering through limiting a patient's choice of doctor and preventing competition among doctors. Fishbein was also the main force behind the AMA's promotion of smoking. After leaving the AMA, he became [consultant to a tobacco company](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563588/) dedicated to minimizing any link between smoking and cancer. Quite the opposite of the *New England Journal of Medicine*'s courageous chief editor Marcia Angell, who worked tirelessly to [expose the blatant manipulations](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies) of the drug industry, Fishbein was seen by many as much more interested in making money than in protecting public health. \"Cancer: The Forbidden Cures\" further shows how **famous cancer institutes like the esteemed Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prevented both studies and the publication of any information that might show that alternative treatments did, in fact, have significant cancer cure rates.** Read what Sloan-Kettering's own assistant director of public affairs, Dr. Ralph Moss (now [a top advocate](http://cancerdecisions.com) of alternative cancer therapies), had to say about this", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__cancercures__cancer_cures_video.txt:1:4aab3e613b78", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11009, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures_video.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__cancercures__cancer_cures_video", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "seen by many as much more interested in making money than in protecting public health. \"Cancer: The Forbidden Cures\" further shows how **famous cancer institutes like the esteemed Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prevented both studies and the publication of any information that might show that alternative treatments did, in fact, have significant cancer cure rates.** Read what Sloan-Kettering's own assistant director of public affairs, Dr. Ralph Moss (now [a top advocate](http://cancerdecisions.com) of alternative cancer therapies), had to say about this in his free book available at[this link](https://www.mossreports.com/product/doctored-results/).

If there were a magic bullet, though, it might be something like dichloroacetate, or DCA, a drug that kills cancer cells by exploiting a fundamental weakness found in a wide range of solid tumors. So far, though, it kills them just in test tubes and in rats infected with human cancer cells; it has never been tested against cancer in living human beings. DCA ... is an existing drug whose side effects are well-studied and relatively tolerable. Also, it's a small molecule that might be able to cross the blood-brain barrier to reach otherwise intractable brain tumors. Within days after a technical paper on DCA appeared in the journal Cancer Cell last week, the lead author, Dr. Evangelos Michelakis of the University of Alberta, was deluged with calls and e-mails from prospective patients-to whom he can say only, \"Hang in there.\" DCA is a remarkably simple molecule. It acts in the body to promote the activity of the mitochondria. Researchers have assumed that the mitochondria in cancer cells were irreparably damaged. But Michelakis wondered if that was really true. With his colleagues he used DCA to turn back on the mitochondria in cancer cells-which promptly died. **One of the great things about DCA is that it's a simple compound, in the public domain, and could be produced for pennies a dose. But that's also a problem, because big drug companies are unlikely to spend a billion dollars or so on large-scale clinical trials for a compound they can't patent.** **Note:** Read a [2010 follow-up](https://web.archive.org/web/20100522184427/http://www.dca.med.ualberta.ca/Home/Updates/2010-05-12_Update.cfm) by Dr. Michelakis with promising results and watch a [10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUZn_KnN28w).

But Dr. Zhen Cui of Wake Forest, whose team published the findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, said he expected rapid replication of the results because the findings were so clear-cut and easily observed. \"This is a truly remarkable phenomenon -- and it really needs confirmation from other institutions,\" he said. The team took white blood cells from the immune mice ... and injected them into mice already carrying a variety of tumors, some of which were extremely aggressive. In every case, the cancers were destroyed, even if the cells were injected at a point distant from the tumor. Healthy tissues were not affected. The mice that received the cells, furthermore, were protected from new tumors for the rest of their lives. The researchers have no idea how the immunity continues. **Note:** Why was this not in the headlines and not given a title like \"Cancer Cure Found for Mice\"? Most major papers didn't even report the story, and an article in the [*New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/health/09canc.html) was simply titled \"A Strain of Mice Appears Able to Resist Cancer Cells.\" Could it be that the power brokers in the medical industry know that a cancer cure would cause huge financial losses for them?

The results fall short of an immediate cancer cure, but they are encouraging, medical professionals say. JoEllen Welsh, a researcher with the State University of New York at Albany, has studied the effects of vitamin D for 25 years. **Part of her research involves taking human breast cancer cells and treating them with a potent form of vitamin D. Within a few days, half the cancer cells shriveled up and died.** Welsh said the vitamin has the same effect as a drug used for breast cancer treatment. \"Vitamin D enters the cells and triggers the cell death process,\" she [said]. \"It's similar to what we see when we treat cells with Tamoxifen,\" a drug used to treat breast cancer.

Below, we've included some of our key findings. Gender dysphoria is the psychological distress that arises from a mismatch between a person's self-described gender identity and the biological sex they were born with. In recent years, there has been an [unprecedented explosion](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/10/science/transgender-teenagers-national-survey.html) in the number of young people experiencing gender dysphoria, [particularly among girls](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/24/an-explosion-what-is-behind-the-rise-in-girls-questioning-their-gender-identity), many of whom have no prior history of gender distress. According to Reuters, in 2021, about [42,000 children and teens](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-transyouth-data/) across the United States were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, nearly triple the number in 2017. [Tens of thousands of children](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-transyouth-care/) have received off-label medication and surgeries for their gender dysphoria, and surgeons say top surgeries are [becoming more common](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/26/health/top-surgery-transgender-teenagers.html) among youth. Transgender medical care experiences vary widely. Many can be life-changing and even life-saving. Yet not all experiences align with the mainstream narratives we often hear. **Despite the illusion of consensus presented to us by mainstream media, there's no scientific consensus around transgender medicine and surgeries for youth.** A [growing movement of young people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyJGijjI2JU) who transition to a different gender, then detransition, are [voicing regrets](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/article/keira-bell-interview-justice-cass-gender-ncczjgn0d) over [irreversible medical harms](feeling abandoned) and [feeling abandoned](https://nationalpost.com/news/young-detransitioners-abandoned) by both the trans community and the medical system for speaking out.

Outside the US, other countries have carefully reviewed the science and found little evidence to support these medical interventions for children. Norway has deemed puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries for children \"experimental\" and recommended restricting these treatments to research settings. The UK, Sweden, Finland, and Scotland have limited the use of these medications, acknowledging the rising reports of youth detransition and concluding that the risks outweigh the benefits. They all recommend [psychological care](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/11/24/trans-kids-therapy-psychologist/) as the first line of treatment for minors. The option to delay puberty and offer hormones or surgeries to children experiencing gender dysphoria has only been available in the U.S. for roughly a decade. We still lack comprehensive data on long-term outcomes for youth. While questioning these medical interventions for minors is often seen as an attack on trans people, the serious risks associated with these interventions are clearly cause for concern. **Even those who publicly promote this kind of medicine question its ethics behind closed doors.** In fact, the psychologist who popularized the use of puberty blockers in children to treat gender dysphoria [eventually became doubtful about the long-term impact of pubertal suppression](https://www.thefp.com/p/top-trans-doctors-blow-the-whistle), questioning how it might influence brain development.

WPATH president and respected gender surgeon Dr. Marcia Bowers [admitted](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/09/disturbing-leaks-from-us-gender-group-wpath-ring-alarm-bells-in-nhs) that she hasn't heard of anyone able to achieve orgasm when blocked at Tanner 2, which is the beginning of puberty and can be as young as nine in girls. Dr. Bowers has now [publically recommended](https://www.thefp.com/p/top-trans-doctors-blow-the-whistle) against early puberty blockade, citing [permanent sexual dysfunction in children](https://www.thefp.com/p/top-trans-doctors-blow-the-whistle) whose puberty was blocked early. We're often told that trans kids face higher suicide rates and that immediate medical intervention is the only way to prevent more suicides. Yet what's rarely discussed is the [overwhelming prevalence of comorbidities in kids with gender dysphoria](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/opinion/transgender-children-gender-dysphoria.html) that also drive suicide ideation-including autism, depression, anxiety, trauma, eating disorders, and more. With almost [50% of US children having experienced a mental disorder](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness), how can we conclusively say it's gender dysphoria alone that puts them at risk? **The fears fueling the rush to place kids on puberty blockers, hormones, and surgeries are deeply human-but they're also shaped by a misrepresentation of the issue. Simplifying the problem to a single cause denies these children the nuanced care they deserve and plays on our worst fears.** Following the UK's ban on puberty blockers, data from the world's largest transgender youth clinic in the country revealed [three suicides](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-022-02287-7) out of 15,000 patients, equating to 0.03%. The study emphasized that it wasn't clear if other confounding mental health factors also contributed to the outcome, and the patients who died were at various stages of the care system-suggesting no consistent link to any specific aspect of care. **Yet what was clear is that [restriction of puberty blocking medication did not increase suicide rates](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9x8j5p0992o).** In the conclusion, the [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-022-02287-7) states: *The fact that deaths were so rare should provide some reassurance to transgender youth and their families, though of course this does not detract from the distress caused by self-harming behaviors that are non-fatal. **It is irresponsible to exaggerate the prevalence of suicide.

Instead of publishing this data, the study [remains unpublished for political reasons](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-us-study-puberty-blockers-goes-unpublished-because-politics-doctor-says), fearing the data could be \"weaponized\" and used to fuel further bans on youth gender treatments. Children experiencing gender dysphoria require specialized care. But that's very different from enabling minors in a vulnerable state of mind to irreversibly alter their bodies with the latest in medical and pharmaceutical science. A study of 10 pediatric gender clinics there found that [half do not require](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/11/24/trans-kids-therapy-psychologist/) psychological assessment before initiating puberty blockers or hormones. The *New York Times* reports that [80% of childhood gender dysphoria resolves by puberty](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/opinion/transgender-children-gender-dysphoria.html), citing a study conducted by a psychiatrist who opened one of the first pediatric gender clinics in Finland but [now questions the use of puberty blockers and hormones for youth](conducted by a psychiatrist). Our Mindful News Brief further dives into this. Medical professionals are afraid to express their opinions on gender-affirming care due to [concerns over career damage and online abuse](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/12/this-isnt-how-good-scientific-debate-happens-academics-on-culture-of-fear-in-gender-medicine-research). Efforts by the trans community, medical system, and the media to silence detransitioners and stifle open discussion about what's happening in the field are deeply troubling. **This not only harms detransitioned individuals by invalidating their lived experiences in a way that mirrors the very issues gender-affirming care aims to address, but it also undermines trust in the objectivity of this field.** Transgender medicine for minors is worth [billions to Big Pharma](https://washingtonstand.com/commentary/genderindustrial-complex-worth-billions-annually-report). Transgender people also require lifelong hormone treatments, making them ideal customers for drug companies. Hospitals, doctors, and various specialty service providers all rake in millions from the trade as well. Tune into our 25-minute video for much more.

It will help you understand my deep distrust of the major pharmaceutical companies. First, a brief background to the story. As some of you know, I was a debunker of major conspiracies until [my eyes were opened](https://www.wanttoknow.info/g/fredburks/down_the_rabbit_hole#rabbithole) by one life-changing video in July of 2001. I had served in the White House as a [language interpreter for presidents](https://www.wanttoknow.info/fredburksresigns) and had seen nothing of the sort. So I would quietly laugh at one housemate and a few other friends who tried to convince me that crazy things were going on well hidden from the public. **After my sudden awakening to these deeper realities, I dove full time into exploring what was really going on behind the scenes.** This is what led to my setting up [WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info) in early 2003 to share my findings with all who wanted to know. I soon found many avenues of exploration. One of the most intriguing and rewarding came on my interpreting trips visiting many places and people around the country and even overseas. I had the pleasure of meeting hundreds of fascinating people in my travels. When I had the opportunity to really connect with someone, I would drop subtle hints about my Internet work to see if they might be interested or even have a story to share. Most people don't take the bait, but I was thrilled at how many did. A few shared incredible and quite valuable information. One official slipped papers under the door of my hotel room while I was interpreting for Bush in Bali. Yet the most eye-opening and disturbing story I heard came from a guy I'll call Craig who was sitting next to me when I was flying home from an interpreting assignment in 2003. More than any other, his story convinced me that big Pharma is not to be trusted when big profits are involved. **I've waited this many years to tell this story,** as it could be used by those involved to do serious damage to Craig (not his real name) for telling me his secrets. I feel enough time has passed now that I can tell the story without giving names and it is very unlikely he will suffer any consequences. The story is especially poignant now with the discussion of vaccine trials and safety. Once we struck up a conversation on our long flight, Craig turned out to be a fascinating character. He flew all over the country doing facials and make-up for the rich and famous. It turns out he was one of the top make-up artists for a well know fashion company.

He flew all over the country doing facials and make-up for the rich and famous. It turns out he was one of the top make-up artists for a well know fashion company. When I mentioned to him about WantToKnow.info, he looked at me quite intensely for a moment. **He then asked if I wanted to hear his story of major corruption that had happened a few years earlier. I was all ears. ** So on one of his trips to Las Vegas, Craig arrives at his hotel only to discover that the hotel is overbooked and has no room for him. He's quite upset about this and demands they find a room for him. They call around, but due to a big event in town, no rooms are available anywhere. Craig gets super upset and threatens to make trouble for the hotel through his connections if they don't find something soon. 15 minutes later, he's given a room in another hotel. On settled in to his new hotel room, Craig is still fuming about the hotel's screw up. He decides to check his email to get his mind off it. After a couple minutes, he is startled when he opens a very strange email. It informs him about the results of a study on a new drug (which even now is used commonly in hospital emergency rooms). This drug was developed and tested by the large corporation which owns his company. **The email informs him that over 1% of participants in some of the drug trials died as a direct result of this medication. It goes on to say that top executives have made deals with the contacts in the FDA to cover this up, so that the FDA will still agree to give approval to the drug, despite the high death rate.** Craig is quite shaken after reading this email. He knows that one of the top executives in the parent corporation that owns his company has the same name as his, as he's received a couple emails in the past meant for this guy that were mistakenly sent to him. He figures he must have mistakenly received this message which was meant for that executive. He also is quite nervous knowing that whoever sent the email would not be happy to know he read it. A short time later, Craig receives a phone call. A man on the other end is ranting and screaming at him, saying, \"Who the hell do you think you are reading other people's email! If you say a word about any of this you can kiss your ass good-bye!\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__do-not-trust-big-pharma.txt:1:35e40c97dfcb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11020, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__do-not-trust-big-pharma.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__do-not-trust-big-pharma", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "have mistakenly received this message which was meant for that executive.

A man on the other end is ranting and screaming at him, saying, \"Who the hell do you think you are reading other people's email! If you say a word about any of this you can kiss your ass good-bye!\" To make things even stranger, because of his hotel change, no one knows where Craig is staying, not even his partner. How did this guy know where he was and get his phone number? He hadn't called or told anyone of his change of hotel due to the originally booked hotel's mistake. This call really shakes him up. Now, later in the evening, **Craig turns on his computer to check his email again only to find that all of his emails have been completely erased and that his entire email program is gone! Then, two weeks later, his computer literally melts from the inside out, completely destroying it.** The experienced company technician he brings it to says he has never seen anything like it. I was stunned to hear Craig's disturbing story. He had no reason to make up something like this or lie to me. Before the story, we had just been having an engaging conversation and he seemed perfectly normal and reasonable. As this was only one of many intriguing stories I'd heard from people I had run into, and as I had learned by then about [huge corruption in many drug companies](https://www.wanttoknow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies), I'm almost certain his story was true. I took notes at the time which I used to write this story now. If a drug company would collude with government in a way that sacrificed many people's lives in exchange for big profits, I concluded that it is best to not trust both government and big Pharma in anything involving profits. So when the avian flu hit in 2005-06, the swine flu in 2009-10 and the Zika Virus in 2015-16,** I thoroughly researched each pandemic and found easily verifiable corruption and government collusion that led to many billions of tax dollars being funneled into the coffers of big Pharma** through purchases of drugs that were almost completely wasted. You can read my findings in verifiable research presented on [this webpage](https://www.wanttoknow.info/h/coronavirus-what-if#pandemics). So when the coronavirus hit, I was immediately suspicious with the amount of intense fear being spread by the media and government. I also questioned the huge push for vaccines, which [according to the UK's*Financial Times*](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-vaccines-among-big-pharmas-bestselling-products), are among big Pharma's best selling products that bring in huge profits. The damage done by the virus has been absolutely tragic, yet given all this, you can likely understand why I deeply question the official story of what's happening", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__do-not-trust-big-pharma.txt:2:b72c93b53173", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11021, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__do-not-trust-big-pharma.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__do-not-trust-big-pharma", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "presented on [this webpage](https://www.wanttoknow.info/h/coronavirus-what-if#pandemics).

And there are [many reasons for concern](https://www.wanttoknow.info/h/covid-19-vaccines-warning) around these little-tested vaccines. Having researched and reported on such matters full time now for over 16 years, I have very little doubt that there is a deeper agenda going on. Another amazing woman has come to similar conclusions after her decades of research. Catherine Austin Fitts was the Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under George H.W. Bush. Yet when she tried to clean up the massive corruption she found there, she was attacked in many ways and became a whistleblower. You can read this courageous hero's amazing and inspiring story about this on [this webpage](https://www.wanttoknow.info/banking_finance/trillions-missing-catherine-austin-fitts). I mention Catherine because the best summary of the deeper levels of deception I've found on the coronavirus is a 45-minute interview she gave. An economic genius of the highest order, in this video she brilliantly explores the deeper agenda of all that's going on with the coronavirus and how it relates to a major shift in our monetary system. **If you want to be fully informed, I most highly recommend you consider the information in the interview at the link below.** In the first 10 minutes she presents a great summary of her research. [**https://www.bitchute.com/video/LQZVU6b6kTdz/**](https://www.bitchute.com/video/LQZVU6b6kTdz/) The coronavirus is causing tragic suffering and death around the world. Yet could it be that big Pharma and rogue elements of government are taking advantage of the situation to pad their pockets and gain greater control? By informing ourselves, questioning the official story using the most reliable sources available, and working together to expose corruption and support to good of all of us, I have no doubt we can make a real difference in our world. May we find ever more ways to relieve the suffering and inspire each other to our innate greatness.

In August of 2025, Jason Kilanski, the videographer who shot the four-minute video at the link below contacted our website. In a lengthy email exchange, he provided lots more information confirming our suspicions. See the addendum at the end of the essay for this excellent additional information.] Dear friends, I once attended a lecture by Al Gore's science advisor in which he said he had been invited to see some of the most secret biological research programs being undertaken by the U.S. military. He said it gave him nightmares for months. Below, we present credible information revealing how the Pentagon discussed vaccinating large populations in the Middle East with what is being called FunVax - a fundamentalist vaccine. **As explained by Pentagon researchers, the FunVax uses an airborne virus to indiscriminately infect populations considered high risk for religious fundamentalism. **The virus in this vaccine purportedly has been tested and shown to reduce fundamentalism and religiosity in all who are infected by damaging what is called the \"God gene.\" Though this may sound like some bizarre science fiction novel, the four-minute Pentagon video presentation and official FunVax report below show that this vaccine against fundamentalism is actively being tested for implementation. As it has been a number of years since this date of this video and report, it is entirely possible this program has already been started. **Four-minute Pentagon video presentation of FunVax dated April 13, 2005 [https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/health/pengtagon_vaccine_modify_behavior](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/health/pengtagon_vaccine_modify_behavior)** **Government report on the fundamentalist vaccine: Quarterly FunVax Review, June 1, 2007 [https://www.WantToKnow.info/health/funvax070601.pdf](https://www.WantToKnow.info/health/funvax070601.pdf)** There is some possibility that the above video and document are faked. But if they are, it is very intelligent disinformation. Who would spend all of the time and money required to come up with such a sophisticated and coherent story? And why? Knowing how science and the military often work together, a program like this is all too possible. For those who doubt the government would carry out such a campaign, consider a July 12, 2011 [*New York Times*report](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-vaccination-ruse-used-pursuit-bin-laden) that the CIA organized a fake vaccine drive to get Osama bin Laden's family DNA.

The VMAT2 gene, also referred to as the \"[God gene](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/16378.php),\" has received wide coverage in the media. It is the gene which has been shown to have the most relationship to spirituality. *Time* magazine featured the God gene story on it's [front cover](https://web.archive.org/web/20070429175818/https://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20041025,00.html) on Oct. 25, 2004. For the fascinating article on VMAT2 in that issue of *Time*, titled, \"Religion: Is God in Our Genes?\", [click here.](https://web.archive.org/web/20070311143110/https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,995465,00.html) **So the Pentagon has found a way to decrease religious fervor using an airborne vaccine. What are the ethical implications of this? Do we really want to get involved in manipulating people's genes, especially when those subjected to this are not being informed? Do we really want to decrease spirituality in unknowing citizens through a vaccine? And why isn't this disturbing news being reported and debated in the major media?** The Pentagon report states that tests have been conducted on six different methods of dispersing the virus: \"high altitude release, water supply release, insect transmission, diffusion by a ground level object such as a car, diffusion from a stationary object such as a bottle and infection of food supply such as cattle or produce.\" You have to wonder where these tests were conducted and on whom. The minutes of the report also mention discussion of a \"proposal for a suicide gene.\" Here's a quote from the FunVax report's recommendations section: *Of the [600 variants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16537595) of [Vesicular Stomatitiis Virus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicular_stomatitis_virus) tested, VSV287 had the greatest decrease of VMAT2 within mice. However, this may not be the case for human subjects. All 600 strains of VSV should be retested on human subjects in the clinical group.* Once again, we have to ask who these human subjects will be. Will they be informed of what is happening and give their consent? Would anyone in their right mind give consent to have one of their key genes altered? We know in the past that low-ranking soldiers were used for tests like this and recruited with special bonuses, but not told about the real objectives of the test. **For a long list of secret government tests in which soldiers, prisoners, and even the general public were unknowingly treated like human guinea pigs**, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/humanguineapigs) (links provided to verify each case).

The FunVax report concludes that \"high atmospheric dispersal or dispersal by ground level moving objects appear to be the most practical. Once initial dispersal is accomplished, infection will be transmitted person to person.\" Atmospheric dispersal would likely use what has been referred to as chemtrails. Many have claimed chemtrails are simply paranoid fantasies of conspiracy theorists. This document and other easily verifiable information on chemtrails [available at this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/chemtrails) prove that jets have been used to spread substances on the unsuspecting general population numerous times. **A final concluding note in the FunVax report states that \"complete knockout of VMAT2 in mice as well as monkeys has shown to be lethal.\"** So the God gene is apparently necessary for life. Yet the Pentagon is planning to use this vital gene to manipulate people's beliefs. Why isn't the media investigating this major story?

Monsanto and the food industry have poured $35 million into a campaign in California against Proposition 37, which would require the labeling of foods which contain genetically modified (GM) contents. **Though [over 60 countries](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-imhoff-prop-37-gmo-labeling-20121011,0,7997497.story) require GM food labeling, no state in the U.S. has this requirement.** Yet as the major media articles below have shown, over 90% of polled U.S. residents would rather have the right to know. The huge industry campaign against GM labeling in California has clearly had an effect. Poll results show that in late September 67% of respondents favored Proposition 37, yet by Oct. 10th that [number had dropped](http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-poll-shows-support-plummeting-for-labeling-20121011,0,4000679.story) below 50%, largely as a result of incessant advertising sponsored by Monsanto and other major food corporations. Sadly, proponents of labeling have less than [$5 million](http://www.kcet.org/news/ballotbrief/elections2012/propositions/prop-37-funding-genetically-engineered-food.html) to present information on the many studies showing how harmful genetically modified foods can be. **Below are highly revealing news articles reported in the major media which reveal the many risks and dangers of GM foods, as well as the intense and deceptive campaign by big industry to promote these foods as healthy and avoid labeling.** Links are provided to many reliable sources showing the harmful effects of these foods.

In 1992, the FDA ruled that genetically engineered foods didn't need independent safety tests or labeling requirements before being introduced. But one of its own scientists disagreed, warning there were \"profound differences\" with genetically engineered foods. Genetically engineered seed manufacturers were allowed to sell their products without telling consumers. A 2006 survey found that 74 percent of Americans had no idea that genetically engineered foods were already being sold.

There is causation [as] confirmed in several animal studies**. Specificity of the association of GM foods and specific disease processes is also supported. In spite of this risk, the biotechnology industry claims that GM foods can feed the world through production of higher crop yields. However, a recent report by the Union of Concerned Scientists reviewed 12 academic studies and indicates otherwise: \"The several thousand field trials over the last 20 years ... indicate a significant undertaking. Yet none of these field trials have resulted in increased yield ... with the exception of Bt corn.\" Therefore, because GM foods pose a serious health risk in the areas of toxicology, allergy and immune function, reproductive health, and metabolic, physiologic and genetic health and are without benefit, ... because GM foods have not been properly tested for human consumption, and because there is ample evidence of probable harm, **the AAEM asks: [1] Physicians to educate their patients, the medical community, and the public to avoid GM foods when possible** and provide educational materials concerning GM foods and health risks.

It's been standard practice in all member countries of the European Union for years. The latest published research shows that **61 countries have some form of mandatory labeling for foods containing genetically modified crop ingredients.** The companies that sell genetically modified seeds and manufactured foods argue that American consumers don't need such detailed labels. They say, \"Just trust us.\" That is a lot to ask. Product labels are the front line of consumer protection. **Research and development on genetically engineered products ... are largely done by private sector, not public sector, scientists because companies very aggressively protect their patents.** The level of secrecy and the combative nature of the industry fuel public distrust. Unfortunately, consumers cannot look to the federal government to increase their trust. Some government officials in positions that make policy on genetically engineered products may hold biases born of [their previous jobs with GMO seed companies](http://www.examiner.com/article/obama-appoints-monsanto-fox-to-guard-food-safety-hen-house). Distrust is amplified by questions over who really benefits from GMO foods. As we saw in the multibillion-dollar tobacco case settlement in 1998, companies cannot always be trusted to put health before profit. Another concern is the skyrocketing price of seed for farmers. Finally, GMO products on the market offer American consumers no clear benefits. Proposition 37 simply requires basic transparency and truthful packaging, and companies would have 18 months to implement it. And it would protect consumers' right to know in a product category central to health. **Note:** For a powerful essay showing the harmful effects of genetically modified foods, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/deception10pg). **Biotechnology Food: From the Lab to a Debacle** **2001-01-25, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/25/business/25FOOD.html?pagewanted=all](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/25/business/25FOOD.html?pagewanted=all) In late 1986, four executives of the Monsanto Company, the leader in agricultural biotechnology, paid a visit to Vice President George Bush at the White House.

Dr. Louis J. Pribyl, one of 17 government scientists working on a policy for genetically engineered food, ... knew from studies that toxins could be unintentionally created when new genes were introduced into a plant's cells. The government was dismissing that risk and any other possible risk as no different from those of conventionally derived food. That meant biotechnology companies would not need government approval to sell the foods they were developing. **\"This is the industry's pet idea, namely that there are no unintended effects that will raise the F.D.A.'s level of concern,\" Dr. Pribyl wrote in a fiery memo to the F.D.A. scientist overseeing the policy's development. \"But time and time again, there is no data to back up their contention.\"** **WikiLeaks: US targets EU over GM crops** **2011-01-03, *The Guardian* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/03/wikileaks-us-eu-gm-crops](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/03/wikileaks-us-eu-gm-crops) **The US embassy in Paris advised Washington to start a military-style trade war against any European Union country which opposed genetically modified (GM) crops, newly released WikiLeaks cables show.** In response to moves by France to ban a Monsanto GM corn variety in late 2007, the ambassador, Craig Stapleton, a friend and business partner of former US president George Bush, asked Washington to penalise the EU and particularly countries which did not support the use of GM crops. \"Moving to retaliation will make clear that the current path has real costs to EU interests and could help strengthen European pro-biotech voices,\" said Stapleton, who with Bush co-owned the St Louis-based Texas Rangers baseball team in the 1990s [and is [married to Dorothy Walker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Roberts_Stapleton), a first cousin of former U.S. president George H.W.

Genetically modified foods don't offer the eater any benefits whatsoever - only a potential, as yet undetermined risk. ** Monsanto and its allies have fought the labeling of genetically modified food ... vigorously since 1992, when the industry managed to persuade the [F.D.A.] - over the [objection of its own scientists](http://www.biointegrity.org/list.html) - that the new crops were \"substantially equivalent\" to the old and so did not need to be labeled, much less regulated. **The F.D.A. policy was co-written by [a lawyer](http://www.examiner.com/article/obama-appoints-monsanto-fox-to-guard-food-safety-hen-house) whose former firm worked for Monsanto. More than 60 other countries have seen fit to label genetically modified food, including those in the European Union, Japan, Russia and China. Monsanto and DuPont, the two leading merchants of genetically modified seed, have invested more than $12 million to defeat Prop 37. Americans have been eating genetically engineered food for 18 years, and as supporters of the technology are quick to point out, we don't seem to be dropping like flies. But they miss the point. The fight over labeling G.M. food is not foremost about food safety or environmental harm, legitimate though these questions are. The fight is about the power of Big Food.

Professor Barney Gordon, of the university's department of agronomy, said he started the research - reported in the journal *Better Crops* - because many farmers who had changed over to the GM crop had \"noticed that yields are not as high as expected even under optimal conditions\". He added: \"People were asking the question 'how come I don't get as high a yield as I used to?'\" He grew a Monsanto GM soybean and an almost identical conventional variety in the same field. The modified crop produced only 70 bushels of grain per acre, compared with 77 bushels from the non-GM one. The GM crop - engineered to resist Monsanto's own weedkiller, Roundup - recovered only when he added extra manganese, leading to suggestions that the modification hindered the crop's take-up of the essential element from the soil. The new study confirms earlier research at the University of Nebraska, which found that another Monsanto GM soya produced 6 per cent less than its closest conventional relative, and 11 per cent less than the best non-GM soya available. **Pesticide use ramping up as GMO crop technology backfires: study** **2012-10-01, NBC News/Reuters** [http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/02/14178036-study-us-farmers...](http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/02/14178036-study-us-farmers-using-more-pesticides-on-superweeds) U.S. farmers are using more hazardous pesticides to fight weeds and insects due largely to heavy adoption of genetically modified crop technologies that are sparking a rise of \"superweeds\" and hard-to-kill insects, according to a newly released study.

His technocratic ideology runs counter to the best informed science. The World Bank and United Nations funded 900 scientists over three years in order to create an International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD). Its conclusions were diametrically opposed, at both philosophical and practical levels, to those espoused by Gates and clearly state that the use of GM crops is not a meaningful solution to the complex situation of world hunger. The IAASTD suggests that rather than pursuing industrial farming models, **\"agro-ecological\" methods provide the most viable means to enhance global food security.** These include implementing practical scientific research based on traditional seed varieties and local farming practices adapted to the local ecology over millennia. Agro-ecology has consistently proven capable of sustainably increasing productivity. Conversely,** the present GM crops generally have not increased yields over the long run, despite their increased costs and dependence on agricultural chemicals,** as highlighted in the 2009 Union of Concerned Scientists report, [\"Failure to Yield.\"](http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_agriculture/science_and_impacts/science/failure-to-yield.html) **Note:** For an excellent summary of the risks posed by genetically-modified foods, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/deception10pg). **Genetically modified cows produce 'human' milk** **2011-04-02, *The Telegraph* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/agriculture/geneticmodification/8423536/Gene...](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/agriculture/geneticmodification/8423536/Genetically-modified-cows-produce-human-milk.html) Scientists have created genetically modified cattle that produce \"human\" milk in a bid to make cows' milk more nutritious.

Plant pathologist and retired Purdue University professor Don Huber has written a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack warning that a newly discovered and widespread \"electron microscopic pathogen appears to significantly impact the health of plants, animals, and probably human beings.\" Huber coordinates a committee of the American Phytopathological Society as part of the USDA National Plant Disease Recovery System.

In a little-noticed move last week, the European Commission defied most of the governments to which it is supposed to answer to give the green light to growing a [genetically] modified potato across the continent. It was the first time a GM crop had been authorised for cultivation in 13 years. But, now the long moratorium has been broken, similar approvals for others are expected rapidly to follow. **The decision has its origins in a couple of secret, top-level meetings called by Jose Manuel Barroso, the Commission's strongly pro-GM president. He invited the prime ministers of each of the 27 EU member states to send a personal representative along to discuss how to \"speed up\" the spread of the technology and \"deal with\" public opposition.** About three times as many Europeans oppose genetic modification as support it. As a result, GM crops cover only about 0.12 per cent of Europe's agricultural land - and the continent accounts for just 0.08 per cent of the area growing them worldwide. And they have been losing ground. In the past two years, both France and Germany banned the Monsanto maize, joining Austria, Hungary, Greece and Luxembourg. **Note:** Though Europeans are very aware of the threat of genetically modified foods and have worked hard to prohibit them, the media in the US have managed to stifle almost any reporting on the topic.

Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, believes that genetically engineered fish should not be allowed into the food supply unless it is proved safe for humans and the environment. At the very least, it should be labeled. One of the most critical issues before the [Food and Drug Administration] is the potential for genetically engineered fish to cause consumers to experience increased allergic responses. Unfortunately,** the FDA allowed AquaBounty Technologies, the company developing the genetically engineered salmon, to declare that there was no increase in allergy-causing potential in their AquAdvantage salmon, based on data from just six engineered fish - even when the data suggested the genetic engineering process itself did increase the allergy-causing potential. **Public opinion clearly and consistently supports mandatory labeling. Our polling found that 95 percent of the public wants labeling of genetically engineered animals, while other polls found that only 35 percent of the public said that they would be willing to eat seafood that has been genetically engineered.

The food, she recalls, was very good - but then something went very wrong. \"I thought, oh my God, what is happening to me? I felt like I was going to die.\" In the emergency room in nearby Oakland the diagnosis was severe allergic reaction and from here Grace Booth's story reached officials in Washington. At the time the national corn market was in an uproar. Starlink, a gene modified corn not approved for human food, had been found in taco shells and recalls were emptying the shelves of corn products. The fear was possible allergic reactions. At that moment, **Booth says, she had no idea that the corn tortillas in her lunch were about to be recalled. In the wake of the recalls more than 50 Americans, including Booth, claimed they had reactions to Starlink corn. That forced the government to launch the first full-scale allergy investigation in the history of biotech food. **It has taken months, but the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration have collected food samples and blood from two dozen people whose cases were believed most serious. [Symptoms] \"[v]aried from just abdominal pain and diarrhea [or] skin rashes to some patients ... having very severe life-threatening reactions,\" said Dr. Marc Rothenberg, the allergy chief at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. He is an adviser to the government in the Starlink investigation. Its slow going he says because investigators first had to find the Starlink protein and then invent a blood test. **Note:** With so many examples of allergic reactions and more to GM foods, why does the FDA continue to insist that these foods are safe? Could it be because many top leaders at the FDA [once worked at Monsanto](http://www.examiner.com/article/obama-appoints-monsanto-fox-to-guard-food-safety-hen-house)?

It could have a huge impact on you, your health, and even the world we live in. I can't recommend it highly enough. The landmark film will be available for free viewing until May 22nd. **You can watch it now by going to [this webpage](https://in188.isrefer.com/go/sifs/fredburks/).** **If you don't have time to watch the entire film, please at least view the [three-minute trailer](https://secretingredientsmovie.com/trailer) and read the short description below.** After watching \"Secret Ingredients\" many viewers literally changed their diet on-the-spot. When Karen Slusher watched \"Secret Ingredients\" with her two kids, their response was not what you would expect from teenagers. Once they learned the truth about food and disease, they actually got upset at their mom for having allowed non-organic food into the house. The three of them grabbed garbage bags and remedied the situation-cleaning out all things non-organic. The award-winning documentary by Jeffrey Smith and Amy Hart has inspired similar kitchen makeovers all over and appears to have achieved the unique status as the quickest motivator to an organic lifestyle. As one report put it, \"You emerge empowered, ready to transform your life with the right ingredients.\" One dietician said, \"This film is a life-changing, health-promoting must-see for anyone who eats.\" **Heartfelt Transformations** The most riveting feature of \"Secret Ingredients\" is the nearly miraculous health transformations that occur in one person after another, right after they switched to organic food.** Infertile couples have children, rashes clear up, allergies disappear, brain fog lifts, cancer patients get relief, and even autistic kids show astounding improvements. **Dr. Michelle Geriari says, \"The personal stories shared in the film are compelling, truly inspiring and self-empowering.\" Interviews with experts such as Dr. David Perlmutter, *New York Times* bestselling author and physician, link the real-life stores to research on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and the Roundup herbicide sprayed on them. Aided by stunning animations, the viewers see clearly how the killing of our beneficial gut bacteria (microbiome), gaps forming in our intestines (leaky gut), damage to our cells' energy system (mitochondria), and changes in our brain chemistry (serotonin) can easily promote the chronic conditions seen in the film and suffered by millions. **Physicians in the movie confirm that they see dramatic recoveries in their patients who adopt an organic diet-free from GMOs and Roundup.** But some patients don't fully appreciate the role of food until they later revert to old eating habits and their symptoms return. According to the Organic and Non-GMO Report, \"In less than 90 minutes, you come away highly educated on the subject of GMOs and the herbicide glyphosate [Roundup], inspired to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__gm-foods-documentary.txt:0:57e36cfb3e79", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11043, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__gm-foods-documentary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__gm-foods-documentary", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "in the film and suffered by millions. **Physicians in the movie confirm that they see dramatic recoveries in their patients who adopt an organic diet-free from GMOs and Roundup.** But some patients don't fully appreciate the role of food until they later revert to old eating habits and their symptoms return.

Our purchasing power can ultimately shift the food supply.\" Smith knows first-hand how educated consumers change the system. His bestselling books, (e.g. Seeds of Deception - [10-page summary here](https://www.wanttoknow.info/deception10pg)), his films (e.g. [Genetic Roulette](https://geneticroulettemovie.com/)), and the work of his [Institute for Responsible Technology](https://responsibletechnology.org/) have greatly contributed to the current non-GMO tipping point underway in the U.S. With 46% of the Americans seeking non-GMO food, major companies are scrambling to eliminate GMO ingredients. \"Secret Ingredients\" points out, however, that eating non-GMO alone is not enough. Roundup and other toxic pesticides are sprayed even on non-GMO foods. The clarion call of the film is to Eat Organic. To watch the film, visit [this webpage](https://in188.isrefer.com/go/sifs/fredburks/). After watching it, you'll find some help there to make the transition to organic easier and more affordable. Once again, I can't recommend this film highly enough.

She is currently a senior lecturer in social medicine at Harvard Medical School. Her book, *The Truth About the Drug Companies,* provides yet another eye-opening example of how greed has taken over many facets of business and government, and offers empowering ideas on what we can do about it. *New England Journal of Medicine* Volume 351:1580-1581, October 7, 2004, Number 15 [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200410073511522](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200410073511522) (payment may be required to view article) **The Truth About the Drug Companies: ****How They Deceive Us and What to Do About It** **In this book, her most recent, Marcia Angell explores pharmaceutical research, deplores the rapidly expanding involvement (and distortion of truth) of Big Pharma, and implores us all (physicians, patients, politicians) to do something about it.** The dust-jacket blurb asserts that Angell, \"during her two decades at *The New England Journal of Medicine* had a front-row seat on the growing corruption of the pharmaceutical industry.\" Since leaving the *Journal,* she's gone behind the curtains of Big Pharma, Big University, and Big Faculty. Drawing on her own work and on her thoughtful analysis of research, company financial statements, and investigative reports into drug development and marketing, Angell writes with the unambiguous and unyielding style that *Journal* readers came to expect and trust. The current slide toward the commercialization and corruption of clinical research coincided with the election of President Ronald Reagan in 1980 and the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, a new set of laws that permitted and encouraged universities and small businesses to patent discoveries from research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). **Research paid for by the public to serve the public instantly became a private, and salable good - one that is producing drug sales of more than $200 billion a year.** Commercialization had both specific and broad effects.

Readers of this journal and others are familiar with investigations into the control that research sponsors at pharmaceutical companies exert on the design and analysis of clinical trials (including the distortion of primary outcome measures in trials) and the issue of reporting, nonreporting, and biased reporting of results. Angell reminds us of the increasingly cozy relationships between big industry and the faculties of universities. **Not only are narcissistic donors renaming the medical schools; they are buying access to the best minds of their faculties.** Angell's examples of the large consulting fees paid by industry to individual faculty members and to NIH scientists and directors are astounding. The broader effects are felt in the commercialization of universities, medical faculties, and our profession. In 2000, in a letter written in response to Angell's *Journal* editorial, \"[Is Academic Medicine for Sale?](https://web.archive.org/web/20080307181700/http://www.mindfully.org/Health/Academic-Medicine-Sale18may00.htm)\" a reader supplied the answer: \"No. The current owner is very happy with it.\" The increasing intrusion of industry into medical education and the almost complete domination of continuing medical education (especially regarding drugs) by the marketing departments of large pharmaceutical companies are a scandal. The same companies also spend heavily to lobby governments. According to Angell, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the pharmaceutical industry's U.S. trade association has \"the largest lobby in Washington,\" which in 2002 employed 675 lobbyists (including 26 former members of Congress) at a cost of more than $91 million. The result has been above-average growth in corporate profits during both Republican and Democratic administrations. **The most recent and perplexing lobbying effort caused Congress explicitly to prohibit Medicare from using its huge purchasing power to get lower prices for drugs**, thus opening up a dollar pipeline, in the form of higher drug prices, directly from taxpayers to corporate coffers. These changes, along with the cave-in by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 that permitted direct-to-consumer advertising to bypass mention in their ads of all but the most serious side effects, have further augmented profits. The overall effect has been a corruption not only of science but also of the dissemination of science. Angell documents that, contrary to what they claim, large pharmaceutical companies have \"paltry output\" in innovative research. In fact, as permitted by Bayh-Dole, pharmaceutical companies buy discoveries coming out of the basic-science enterprises, including universities and publicly funded granting agencies. The real costs of research on drugs by pharmaceutical companies are much less than the oft-quoted $800 million or so per new drug brought to market.

The real costs of research on drugs by pharmaceutical companies are much less than the oft-quoted $800 million or so per new drug brought to market. Most of their research is on me-too drugs - unoriginal, tax-deductible (and thus paid for in lost taxes by the public), and mostly unnecessary. The Big Pharma companies are, in essence, manufacturing and marketing companies. Angell's concluding chapter, the least convincing in an otherwise fascinating and penetrating book, contains the solutions, all of them predictable: control me-too drugs, re-empower the FDA, oversee Big Pharma's clinical research, curb patent length and abuse, keep Big Pharma out of medical education, make company financial statements transparent (so we can tell what the costs of research really are, as distinct from marketing), and impose price controls or guidelines. Granted, the problems are so prevalent and the corporate tentacles so entwined with our way of being that it is hard to see what else to recommend. **But perhaps Angell is right. We must change the way we manage research and the development and distribution of new drugs. Not only are health and health care at risk, but so are the research enterprise and the reputations of universities and governments. The integrity of scientific research is too important to be left to the invisible hand of the marketplace.** Book review written by [John Hoey, M.D.](https://web.archive.org/web/20080221085416/http://www.openmedicine.ca/article/view/73/69), former editor-in-chief of the *Canadian Medical Association Journal * To purchase *The Truth About Drug Companies* from amazon.com, [click here](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375760946/ref=lpr_g_1/103-1222077-0576601?tag=wanttinfo-20&v=glance&s=books&n=507846) The quote at the top is from [Dr. Angell's summary](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies) of her own book in the New York Review of Books. **For a riveting 10-page summary of Dr. Angell's book, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies) For more reliable, verifiable health corruption information [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/healthinformation)**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__health-corruption.txt:2:1812f780865a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11048, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__health-practices.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__health-practices", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Health Practices **Health Practices Awesome Health Practices for a Better, Longer Life ** Dear friends, **There's only one thing we're guaranteed to have until the end of our life - our body.** If you don't take good care of your body now, you may regret it in your elder years.

I eat vegetarian at home, though will eat meat when I'm out and it's offered to me. I don't eat any candy, soda, or junk foods at home, though do occasionally when out. I don't like being too strict. I also never consume artificial sweeteners (see [this webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aspartamemsgcoverup) for why). I will eat almost any natural food that still smells and looks good, including some far past the expiration dates, which I find are often bogus. **Avoid medicine:** I very rarely get sick, yet when I do, I avoid all medicines - even alternative ones. I let my body's innate wisdom deal with whatever comes up. The exception is when I will be in close contact with others and I feel a cold coming on. I then take vitamins and alternative medicine (Emergen-C and Yin Chiao) to nip the cold in the bud and avoid infecting others. If there is little risk of infecting others, I prefer to let colds run their course so that my immune system gets a good work out. Note that if something serious happens (like a bone break or bad infection), I will use Western medicine that has a proven track record, though I've only taken antibiotics once in my life. For evidence supporting this health practice, see [this article](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/07/02/prescription-drugs-vs-healthy-diet.aspx) and [this summary](https://www.WantToKnow.info/pharmaceuticalcorruptionnewsarticles) of great news articles on the topic. **Natural:** I don't use soap to wash my body or wash dishes, unless they are really greasy. No deodorant or other artificial skin products either. I prefer to be as natural as possible. **Daily Health Practices** **Life intentions:** Each morning on awakening, I review [my main life intentions](https://www.inspiringcommunity.org/inspiringstories0304#intentionsfred), [breathe sacred love](https://www.weboflove.org), and set intentions for the day before I get out of bed. This sets a great tone for the day. **Skin rub:** As soon as I get out of bed, I splash my face with cold water, and then briefly rub/massage all of my skin from head to toes. Great way to awaken the body in the morning. **Memory exercise:** Next I cross my arms, grab my ear lobes with the opposite thumb and index finger, then do 12 deep knee bends while holding this position. This is said to be a good brain memory exercise. For more, see [this inspiring CBS News video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSwhpF9iJSs) and [this article](http://padmum.wordpress.com/2011/04/30/exercise-for-memory-call-it-yoga-if-you-will).

In the years I've been doing this, I'm thrilled to have seen noticeable improvement in my memory. **Yoga:** I do 15 minutes of yoga in the morning plus five minutes at the end of my daily run. The yoga is back focused (five intense [Bikram yoga](http://www.bikramyoga.com/) poses which stretch the back in all directions). I also lie on my back and do upside down splits with my legs, stretching them both to the sides and forward and back for each leg as far as I can. I place 15 pounds of weights on each foot and do this once or twice a day. I can finally do the splits all the way now. Yea!!! **Reading:** Each morning I like to do inspirational reading for 20 to 40 minutes to start my day inspired. **45 to 60 minutes at the park:** Several times a week, I go to a nearby park when I run a total of about one and a half miles (including a 150 meter full-speed sprint), do 10 L-seat pull-ups, 12 bar dips, balance walk on a bar (forward and backward with turns), do two yoga stretches, then eye massage and eye exercises while balancing first on one foot, then the other. I also do gymnastics: cartwheels, front handsprings, front and back hip circles on a bar, ending with practicing handstands at least three times. [Going upside down is very healthy](http://yoganonymous.com/10-benefits-of-yoga-inversions). **Teeth brushing:** I floss and brush my teeth only once a day, yet do it very thoroughly, taking a full three minutes. I use an electronic rotating brush Mon to Fri and a manual brush on weekends for variety. I only go to the dentist every two years, and when I do go, they are consistently surprised at how healthy my teeth are. **Diary:** Before going to bed, I write key significant experiences from the day in a daily diary limited to five to ten minutes of writing. I use a weekly engagement calendar to purposely limit how much I write. I found when I wrote longer entries in the past, I began to dread doing it every day. I enjoy reading through the entire diary at the end of the year and use it to write a summary of my life each year that is very fulfilling for me. **Gratitude:** Before going to sleep, I [give gratitude](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#gratitude) for at least three things from the day and invite whatever lessons in dream school will best serve me in my waking life. **Weekly Health Practices** **Long run", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__health-practices.txt:2:162347fd53c8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11051, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__health-practices.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__health-practices", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "longer entries in the past, I began to dread doing it every day.

After locking my bike there, I run a five-mile loop on dirt trails through the hills, taking in the panoramic views of Wildcat Peak. I stop in a few places to relax, meditate, and take in the beautiful scenery. After the run, I hop back on my bike and fly back home in 12 minutes. **Dance:** I love to dance my heart out once a week at one of many dances in the area, usually 1 1/2 to 2 hours. **Silence/Meditation:** I relax once a week into two hours of silence and meditation, usually on a weekday evening. I also enjoy meditating about 15 minutes almost every day. **Sun gazing:** I go up onto our roof at sunset to gaze directly at the sun, usually the last five to 10 minutes before it sets. Sometimes I do this several times a week, and sometimes I go a few weeks without it when I'm out of town, when it's cloudy or raining, or when I forget. I've been doing this since about 2004 without any negative effects and have found it to be quite profound. **Important note:** Don't do this more than an hour before sunset or an hour after sunrise or you may hurt your eyes. For more, see [this webpage](https://medium.com/inspirechangegrow/sun-gazing-explore-and-empower-yourself-with-the-healing-powers-of-the-sun-19d6eea78a61). **Monthly Health Practices** **Hot yoga:** I had really bad back problems in 2003. When I then started doing [hot yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_yoga) daily in December of that year, my back healed 50% within one month and 90% by three months. I eventually cut back to doing the full 90-minute session once a month and doing five of the poses on my own at home daily. Now my back is as strong as in my early 20s. Yea!!! And I sometimes have [profound realizations](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspiration/spiritual_eyes) as a result of these intense yoga sessions. **Swim:** One hour swim (about 1 1/2 miles). 15 min each of breast stroke, free style, side stroke, and back stroke. I usually end with 100 yards of butterfly (two back and forth laps at our local pool) and an underwater swim of 50 yards after hyperventilating 50 breaths or so. I don't recommend hyperventilating unless you are experienced with it. **Fasting and silence:** I", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__health-practices.txt:3:e5567c32bdb0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11052, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__health-practices.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__health-practices", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "Yea!!!

I don't recommend hyperventilating unless you are experienced with it. **Fasting and silence:** I enjoy two different kinds of fasts. Every month I do one full day of silence and food fasting. Every four months I make it two days. I do drink water, but no food during these fasts. Every other month, I also do a sleep fast - missing a full night's sleep. And once a year I skip two nights in a row of sleep. On the nights of my sleep fast, I have to keep myself busy and find that I'm generally very productive. Both types of fasting nourish my soul. **Just Do It!** My father, my sister, my two brothers and myself all enjoyed some kind of regular exercise as I was growing up. My mom was the only one who didn't really exercise. And interestingly enough, she was the one who got irritated most easily and had the most complaints. She eventually decided she wanted to start exercising. She tried running and swimming, but didn't really enjoy it. Then, at age 45, mom found bicycle riding. She started with just five miles a day. Then about a year later she upped it to 12 miles a day and even started climbing some steep hills on her bike. **And amazingly, mom became much more relaxed and joyful almost as soon as she started biking.** Mom went on to become a top bicycle rider, doing lots of 100-mile rides and almost always coming in first for her age group on public rides. She even completed the [Davis Double](http://www.davisbikeclub.org/annual_events/organized_rides/davis_double_century) (200 miles in one day) ten times! I joined her on a tandem for her 10th Davis Double when she was 67 years old. Now at 87 years old and with poor eyesight, mom can't ride much, but a couple times a year, we still go out on rides of between 10 and 24 miles together. If my mom found a healthy exercise that worked for her, so can you. If you are new to all this, I can't stress enough the importance of moving gradually into whatever health practices you choose. If you start trying handstands when you've never even done a headstand, you just might end up smashing your face. **Yet the important thing is that you do start.** Choose something more than just a leisurely walk, which doesn't get your heart working much (but is better than nothing).

Speed walking counts. Swimming is great and very gentle on the body. Find something you enjoy doing that gets your heart pumping for at least 15 minutes. Whatever you choose, make a commitment to do it at least three times a week and preferably five or six. Do take one or two days of rest a week, as I believe it's good to give your body an occasional rest. By committing to whatever health practices you choose, you are showing yourself that you really care about yourself and your body. I invite you to take the challenge, to make the commitment, and to then watch as the months and years pass how much better you feel in your body, and even how much better you end up feeling about yourself. I wish you all the best, and have fun with it!

Aspartame is sold under the brand names Nutra-Sweet and Equal and is found in such popular products as Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi, Diet Snapple and Sugar Free Kool-Aid. Hundreds of millions of people consume it worldwide. Dr. Soffritti ... oversees 180 scientists and researchers in 30 countries. **Dr. Soffritti's study concluded that [aspartame] was associated with unusually high rates of lymphomas, leukemias and other cancers.** [The study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16507461) ... involved 1,900 laboratory rats and cost $1 million. Soffritti said he was inspired to look at aspartame because of what he calls \"inadequacies\" in the cancer studies done by Searle in the 1970's. Others have also challenged Searle's studies. **Years before the F.D.A. approved aspartame, the agency had serious concerns about the accuracy and credibility of Searle's aspartame studies. From 1977 to 1985 -- during much of the approval process -- Searle was headed by Donald H. Rumsfeld,** who is now the secretary of defense. Searle was acquired by Monsanto in 1985.

First garlic lowers bad cholesterol, then-after more study-it doesn't. Hormone replacement reduces the risk of heart disease in postmenopausal women, until a huge study finds that it doesn't. But what if wrong answers aren't the exception but the rule? More and more scholars who scrutinize health research are now making that claim. **It isn't just an individual study here and there that's flawed, they charge. Instead, the very framework of medical investigation may be off-kilter, leading time and again to findings that are at best unproved and at worst dangerously wrong.** The result is a system that leads patients and physicians astray-spurring often costly regimens that won't help and may even harm you. Even a cursory glance at medical journals shows that once heralded studies keep falling by the wayside. A major study concluded there's no good evidence that statins (drugs like Lipitor and Crestor) help people with no history of heart disease. The study ... was based on an evaluation of 14 individual trials with 34,272 patients. Cost of statins: more than $20 billion per year. \"Positive\" drug trials, which find that a treatment is effective, and \"negative\" trials, in which a drug fails, take the same amount of time to conduct. But negative trials took an extra two to four years to be published. With billions of dollars on the line, companies are loath to declare a new drug ineffective. As a result of the lag in publishing negative studies, patients receive a treatment that is actually ineffective. From clinical trials of new drugs to cutting-edge genetics, biomedical research is riddled with incorrect findings. **A New Way to Fight Cancer?** **2007-01-23, *Newsweek*** [http://www.newsweek.com/2007/02/22/a-new-way-to-fight-cancer.html](http://www.newsweek.com/2007/02/22/a-new-way-to-fight-cancer.html) There are no magic bullets in the fight against cancer: that's the first thing every responsible scientist mentions when discussing a possible new treatment, no matter how promising.

If there were a magic bullet, though, it might be something like dichloroacetate, or DCA, a drug that kills cancer cells by exploiting a fundamental weakness found in a wide range of solid tumors. So far, though, it kills them just in test tubes and in rats infected with human cancer cells; it has never been tested against cancer in living human beings. DCA ... is an existing drug whose side effects are well-studied and relatively tolerable. Also, it's a small molecule that might be able to cross the blood-brain barrier to reach otherwise intractable brain tumors. Within days after a technical paper on DCA appeared in the journal Cancer Cell last week, the lead author, Dr. Evangelos Michelakis of the University of Alberta, was deluged with calls and e-mails from prospective patients-to whom he can say only, \"Hang in there.\" DCA is a remarkably simple molecule. It acts in the body to promote the activity of the mitochondria. Researchers have assumed that the mitochondria in cancer cells were irreparably damaged. But Michelakis wondered if that was really true. With his colleagues he used DCA to turn back on the mitochondria in cancer cells-which promptly died. **One of the great things about DCA is that it's a simple compound, in the public domain, and could be produced for pennies a dose. But that's also a problem, because big drug companies are unlikely to spend a billion dollars or so on large-scale clinical trials for a compound they can't patent.** ([Anyone interested in helping can click here](http://www.dca.med.ualberta.ca/Home/index.cfm).) **Note:** For a 2010 follow-up by Dr. Michelakis with promising results, watch the 10-minute video at [this link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUZn_KnN28w).

Why haven't any [other mass media](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediacorruption) reported this major story? Why aren't many millions of dollars being poured into research? **Notice even *Newsweek* acknowledges that the drug companies are not interested in finding a cure for cancer if they can't make a profit from it.** Some suspect the drug companies have even suppressed cancer cures found in the past.

It promotes new or little-known diseases such as \"social anxiety disorder\" and \"premenstrual dysphoric disorder\" as a way of selling the drugs that treat them.

In the last 15 years, two international studies sparked outrage. U.S.-funded doctors failed to give the AIDS drug AZT to all the HIV-infected pregnant women in a study in Uganda even though it would have protected their newborns. The other study, by Pfizer Inc., gave an antibiotic named Trovan to children with meningitis in Nigeria, although there were doubts about its effectiveness. Critics blamed the experiment for the deaths of 11 children and the disabling of scores of others. Pfizer settled a lawsuit with Nigerian officials for $75 million but admitted no wrongdoing. **Note:** Though it appears these highly unethical studies have stopped in the US, the article points out that many drug companies are now doing their studies in countries where ethical codes are not strong.

CBS News has learned the family of Hannah Poling will receive more than $1.5 million dollars for her life care, lost earnings, and pain and suffering for the first year alone. In addition to the first year, the family will receive more than $500,000 per year to pay for Hannah's care. Those familiar with the case believe the compensation could easily amount to $20 million over the child's lifetime. Hannah was described as normal, happy and precocious in her first 18 months. Then, in July 2000, she was vaccinated against nine diseases in one doctor's visit: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, varicella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenzae. Afterward, her health declined rapidly. She developed high fevers, stopped eating, didn't respond when spoken to, began showing signs of autism, and began having screaming fits. **In acknowledging Hannah's injuries, the government said vaccines aggravated an unknown mitochondrial disorder Hannah had which didn't \"cause\" her autism, but \"resulted\" in it. It's unknown how many other children have similar undiagnosed mitochondrial disorder. All other autism \"test cases\" have been defeated at trial.** Approximately 4,800 are awaiting disposition in federal vaccine court. **Note:** For a powerful report by Robert F.

In Nevada, there are sheep whose livers and hearts are largely human. In California, mice peer from their cages with human brain cells firing inside their skulls. Biologists call these hybrid animals chimeras, after the mythical Greek creature with a lion's head, a goat's body and a serpent's tail. Chimeras are allowing scientists to watch, for the first time, how nascent human cells and organs mature and interact ... inside the bodies of living creatures. But with no federal guidelines in place ... how human must a chimera be before more stringent research rules should kick in? Chimerism becomes a more sensitive topic when it involves growing entire human organs inside animals. And it becomes especially sensitive when it deals in brain cells. Imagine, said Robert Streiffer, a professor of philosophy and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin, a human-chimpanzee chimera endowed with speech ... what some have called a \"humanzee.\" Perhaps the most ambitious efforts to make use of chimeras come from Irving Weissman, director of Stanford University's Institute of Cancer/Stem Cell Biology and Medicine. Weissman helped make the first mouse with a nearly complete human immune system. More recently his team injected human neural stem cells into mouse fetuses, creating mice whose brains are about 1 percent human. **Now Weissman says he is thinking about making chimeric mice whose brains are 100 percent human.** **Note:** If the above link fails, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/humananimalhybrids). **Vaccine virus 'cancer link'** **2002-03-08, BBC News** [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1860042.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1860042.stm) **A monkey virus found in early versions of a vaccine against polio may be linked to a common type of cancer, suggest scientists.

The experimental treatment developed by researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, turned weak and feeble old mice into healthy animals by regenerating their aged bodies. The surprise recovery of the animals has raised hopes among scientists that it may be possible to achieve a similar feat in humans - or at least to slow down the ageing process. **\"What we saw in these animals was not a slowing down or stabilisation of the ageing process. We saw a dramatic reversal - and that was unexpected,\" said Ronald DePinho, who led the study, which was published in the journal *Nature***. The Harvard group focused on a process called telomere shortening. Most cells in the body contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, which carry our DNA. At the ends of each chromosome is a protective cap called a telomere. Each time a cell divides, the telomeres are snipped shorter, until eventually they stop working and the cell dies or goes into a suspended state called \"senescence\". The process is behind much of the wear and tear associated with ageing. At Harvard, they bred genetically manipulated mice that lacked an enzyme called telomerase that stops telomeres getting shorter. When DePinho gave the mice injections to reactivate the enzyme, it repaired the damaged tissues and reversed the signs of ageing. **Note:** For key reports from reliable sources on important health issues, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/healthnewsarticles-20-20). **New Alarm Bells About Chemicals and Cancer** **2010-05-06, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/opinion/06kristof.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/opinion/06kristof.html) The President's Cancer Panel is the Mount Everest of the medical mainstream, so it is astonishing to learn that it is poised to join ranks with the organic food movement and declare: chemicals threaten our bodies.

And so is the newspaper business. So maybe it's not surprising that one of the most powerful papers in the country attempted an unholy alliance, trying to turn a profit from its newsroom's coverage of the fight for health care reform. You may have missed the story because it broke on the eve of the July 4th weekend. **The publisher of *The Washington Post*, Katharine Weymouth - one of the most powerful people in the nation's capital - invited top officials from the White House, the Cabinet and Congress to her home for an intimate, off-the-record dinner to discuss health care reform with some of her reporters and editors covering the story. But she then invited CEOs and lobbyists from the health care industry to come, too - providing they fork over $25,000 a head**, or a quarter of a million if they want to sponsor a whole series of these cozy little get-togethers. And what is the inducement she offers them? Nothing less than - and I'm quoting the invitation verbatim - \"An exclusive opportunity to participate in the health care reform debate among the select few who will actually get it done.\" The invitation promises this private, intimate, and off-the-record dinner is an extension \"of *The Washington Post* brand of journalistic inquiry into the issues, a unique opportunity for stakeholders to hear and be heard.\" Let that sink in. The \"stakeholders\" in health care reform in this case do not include the rabble - the folks across the country who actually need quality health care but can't afford it.

Adrian Gibbs, a scientist on the team that was behind the development of Tamiflu, says in a report he is submitting today that swine flu might have been created using eggs to grow viruses and make new vaccines, and could have been accidently leaked to the general public. \"It might be some sort of simple error that's not being recognized,\" Gibbs said on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Gibbs admitted there are other ways to explain swine flu's origin. \"One of the simplest explanations", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__health_information_articles_save_life.txt:11:4f903f8e29b8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11066, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__health_information_articles_save_life.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__health_information_articles_save_life", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "behind the development of Tamiflu, says in a report he is submitting today that swine flu might have been created using eggs to grow viruses and make new vaccines, and could have been accidently leaked to the general public. \"It might be some sort of simple error that's not being recognized,\" Gibbs said on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Gibbs admitted there are other ways to explain swine flu's origin. \"One of the simplest explanations if that it's a laboratory escape, but there are lots of others,\" he said.

After some deep soul searching, he made the critical decision to resign without pension and talk openly about the health insurance corruption he has personally witnessed in this increasingly profit-driven industry. **Potter's essay below reveals in detail how the industry's former priority of quality health care has now given way to the bottom line.** To honor this courageous man, let us spread the word and work together to find equitable ways to provide needed health care for all. With best wishes, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) [Former language interpreter](https://www.wanttoknow.info/g/fredburks/down_the_rabbit_hole) for Presidents Bush and Clinton **The Health Care Industry vs. Health Reform** **By [Wendell Potter](http://www.prwatch.org/user/35267)** I'm the former insurance industry insider now speaking out about how big for-profit insurers have hijacked our health care system and turned it into a giant ATM for Wall Street investors, and how the industry is using its massive wealth and influence to determine what is (and is not) included in the health care reform legislation members of Congress are now writing. Although by most measures I had a great career in the insurance industry (four years at Humana and nearly 15 at CIGNA), in recent years I had grown increasingly uncomfortable serving as one of the industry's top PR executives. In addition to my responsibilities at CIGNA, which included serving as the company's chief spokesman to the media on all corporate and financial matters, I also served on a lot of trade association committees and industry-financed coalitions, many of which were essentially front groups for insurers. So I was in a unique position to see not only how Wall Street analysts and investors influence decisions insurance company executives make but also how the industry has carried out behind-the-scenes PR and lobbying campaigns to kill or weaken any health care reform efforts that threatened insurers' profitability. **I also have seen how the industry's practices - especially those of the for-profit insurers that are under constant pressure from Wall Street to meet their profit expectations - have contributed to the tragedy of nearly 50", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__health_insurance_industry_corruption.txt:0:a3d2fbe87246", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11069, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__health_insurance_industry_corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__health_insurance_industry_corruption", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "position to see not only how Wall Street analysts and investors influence decisions insurance company executives make but also how the industry has carried out behind-the-scenes PR and lobbying campaigns to kill or weaken any health care reform efforts that threatened insurers' profitability. **I also have seen how the industry's practices - especially those of the for-profit insurers that are under constant pressure from Wall Street to meet their profit expectations - have contributed to the tragedy of nearly 50 million people being uninsured as well as to the growing number of Americans who, because insurers now require them to pay thousands of dollars out of their own pockets before their coverage kicks in - are underinsured. An estimated 25 million of us now fall into that category.** What I saw happening over the past few years was a steady movement away from the concept of insurance and toward \"individual responsibility,\" a term used a lot by insurers and their ideological allies. This is playing out as a continuous shifting of the financial burden of health care costs away from insurers and employers and onto the backs of individuals. As a result, more and more sick people are not going to the doctor or picking up their prescriptions because of costs. If they are unfortunate enough to become seriously ill or injured, many people enrolled in these plans find themselves on the hook for such high medical bills that they are losing their homes to foreclosure or being forced into bankruptcy. As an industry spokesman, I was expected to put a positive spin on this trend that the industry created and euphemistically refers to as \"consumerism\" and to promote so-called \"consumer-driven\" health plans. I ultimately reached the point of feeling like a huckster. **I thought I could live with being a well-paid huckster and hang in there a few more years until I could retire. I probably would have if I hadn't made a completely spur-of-the-moment decision a couple of years ago that changed the direction of my life.** While visiting my folks in northeast Tennessee where I grew up, I read in the local paper about a health \"expedition\" being held that weekend a few miles up U.S. 23 in Wise, Va. Doctors, nurses and other medical professionals were volunteering their time to provide free medical care to people who lived in the area. What intrigued me most was that Remote Area Medical, a non-profit group whose original mission was to provide free care to people in remote villages in South America, was organizing the expedition. I decided to check it out. That 50-mile stretch of U.S. 23, which twists through the mountains where thousands of men have made their living working in the coalmines, turned out to be my \"road to Damascus.\" Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw when I reached the Wise County Fairgrounds,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__health_insurance_industry_corruption.txt:1:c7659d47c212", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11070, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__health_insurance_industry_corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__health_insurance_industry_corruption", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "that Remote Area Medical, a non-profit group whose original mission was to provide free care to people in remote villages in South America, was organizing the expedition.

Hundreds of people had camped out all night in the parking lot to be assured of seeing a doctor or dentist when the gates opened. By the time I got there, long lines of people stretched from every animal stall and tent where the volunteers were treating patients. **That scene was so visually and emotionally stunning it was all I could do to hold back tears. How could it be that citizens of the richest nation in the world were being treated this way?** A couple of weeks later I was boarding a corporate jet to fly from Philadelphia to a meeting in Connecticut. When the flight attendant served my lunch on gold-rimmed china and gave me a gold-plated knife and fork to eat it with, I realized for the first time that someone's insurance premiums were paying for me to travel in such luxury. I also realized that one of the reasons those people in Wise County had to wait in long lines to be treated in animal stalls was because our Wall Street-driven health care system has created one of the most inequitable health care systems on the planet. Although I quit my job last year, I did not make a final decision to speak out as a former insider until recently when it became clear to me that the insurance industry and its allies (often including drug and medical device makers, business groups and even the American Medical Association) were succeeding in shaping the current debate on health care reform. While the thought of speaking out had crossed my mind during the months leading up to the day I gave notice, I initially decided instead to hang out my shingle as a consultant to small businesses and nonprofit organizations. I decided to take the shingle down, though, at least for a while, when I heard members of Congress reciting talking points like the ones I used to write to scare people away from real reform. I'll have more to say about that over the coming weeks and months, but, for now, remember this: whenever you hear a politician or pundit use the term \"government-run health care\" and warn that the creation of a public health insurance option that would compete with private insurers (or heaven forbid, a single-payer system like the one Canada has) will \"lead us down the path to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__health_insurance_industry_corruption.txt:2:85b42f6def9a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11071, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__health_insurance_industry_corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__health_insurance_industry_corruption", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "like the ones I used to write to scare people away from real reform.

So I have joined forces with thousands of other Americans who are trying to persuade our lawmakers to listen to us for a change, not just to the insurance and drug company executives who are spending millions to shape reform to benefit them and the Wall Street hedge fund managers they are beholden to.** Take it from me, a former insider, who knows what really motivates those folks. You need to know where the hard-earned money you pay in health insurance premiums - if you lucky enough to have coverage at all - really goes. I decided to speak out knowing that some people will not like what I have to say and will do all they can to discredit me. In anticipation of that, here are some facts: I am not doing this because my former employer was pushing me out the door or because I had become a disgruntled employee. I had not been passed over for a promotion or anything like that. As I noted earlier, I had a financially rewarding career in the industry, and I'm very grateful for that. I had numerous promotions, raises, bonuses, stock options and stock grants over the years. When I left my last job, I was as close on the corporate ladder to the CEO as any PR person has ever climbed at the company. I reported to the general counsel, the company's top lawyer, whose boss is the chairman and CEO, a man I like and worked closely with over many years. The decision to leave was entirely my own, and I left on good terms with everybody at the company. In fact, I agreed to postpone my last day at work by more than two months at the company's request. My coworkers gave me a terrific going-away party, and I received dozens of kind notes from people all across the country including friends at other companies and at America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade association. **I still consider all of them my friends. In fact, the thing I have missed most since I left is working as part of a team, even", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__health_insurance_industry_corruption.txt:3:87e15d77271b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11072, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__health_insurance_industry_corruption.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__health_insurance_industry_corruption", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "agreed to postpone my last day at work by more than two months at the company's request.

In fact, the thing I have missed most since I left is working as part of a team, even though I eventually came to the conclusion that I was playing for the wrong side.** Being a consultant has its advantages, but I have missed the camaraderie. After a few months, I thought that maybe I should consider working for another company again. At one point, a former boss told me that another insurer had posted a PR job and encouraged me to contact a former CIGNA executive who worked there about it. Against my better judgment, I did, but I immediately decided not to pursue it. The last thing I wanted to do was to go from one big insurer to another one. What the hell was I thinking? I'm writing this because, knowing how things work, I'm fully expecting insurers' PR firms to quietly feed friends of the industry (which include a roster of editorial writers and pundits, lawmakers and many others who fall under the broad category of \"third-party advocates,\") with anything they can think of to discredit me and what I say. This will go on behind the scenes because the insurers will want to preserve the image they are working so hard to cultivate - as a group of kind and caring folks who think only of you and your health and are working hard as real partners to Congress and the White House to find \"a uniquely American solution\" to what ails our system. I expect this because I have worked closely with the industry's PR firms over many years whenever the insurers were being threatened with bad publicity, litigation or legislation that might hinder profits. One of the reasons I chose to become affiliated with the [Center for Media and Democracy](http://www.prwatch.org/) [CMD] is because of the important work the organization does to expose often devious, dishonest and unethical PR practices that further the self interests of big corporations and special interest groups at the expense of the American people and the democratic principles this country was founded on. After a long career in PR, I am looking forward to providing an insider's perspective as a senior fellow at CMD, and I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak out for the rights and dignity of ordinary people.

Changing to a healthy diet fosters calmer, healthier, more focused behavior.** This highly revealing study demonstrates that excessive amounts of fast food can lead to severely compromised behavior changes, and suggests that both a healthy diet and avoiding genetically modified foods is the best choice for you and your kids.

Smith, author of [*Seeds of Deception*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/deception10pg) Before the Appleton Wisconsin high school changed their cafeteria's diet of processed foods to wholesome, nutritious food, the school was described as out-of-control. There were weapons violations, student disruptions, and a cop on duty full-time. After the change in school meals, the students were calm, focused, and orderly. There were no more weapons violations, and no suicides, expulsions, dropouts, or drug violations. The new diet and improved behavior has lasted for seven years, and now other schools are changing their meal programs with similar results. Years ago, a science class at Appleton found support for their new diet by conducting a cruel and unusual experiment with three mice.

Years ago, a science class at Appleton found support for their new diet by conducting a cruel and unusual experiment with three mice. They fed them the junk food that kids in other high schools eat everyday. The mice freaked out. Their behavior was totally different than the three mice in the neighboring cage. The neighboring mice had good karma; they were fed nutritious whole foods and behaved like mice. They slept during the day inside their cardboard tube, played with each other, and acted very mouse-like. **The junk food mice, on the other hand, destroyed their cardboard tube, were no longer nocturnal, stopped playing with each other, fought often, and two mice eventually killed the third and ate it.** After the three month experiment, the students rehabilitated the two surviving junk food mice with a diet of whole foods. After about three weeks, the mice came around. Sister Luigi Frigo repeats this experiment every year in her second grade class in Cudahy, Wisconsin, but mercifully, for only four days. Even on the first day of junk food, the mice's behavior \"changes drastically.\" They become lazy, antisocial, and nervous. And it still takes the mice about two to three weeks on unprocessed foods to return to normal. One year, the second graders tried to do the experiment again a few months later with the same mice, but this time the animals refused to eat the junk food. Across the ocean in Holland, a student fed one group of mice genetically modified (GM) corn and soy, and another group the non-GM variety. The GM mice stopped playing with each other and withdrew into their own parts of the cage. When the student tried to pick them up, unlike their well-behaved neighbors, the GM mice scampered around in apparent fear and tried to climb the walls. One mouse in the GM group was found dead at the end of the experiment. **It's interesting to note that the junk food fed to the mice in the Wisconsin experiments also contained genetically modified ingredients. And although the Appleton school lunch program did not specifically attempt to remove GM foods, it happened anyway. That's because GM foods such as soy and corn and their derivatives are largely found in processed foods. So when the school switched to unprocessed alternatives, almost all ingredients derived from GM crops were taken out automatically.** Does this mean that GM foods negatively affect the behavior of humans or animals? It would certainly be irresponsible to say so on the basis of a single student mice experiment and the results at Appleton. On the other hand, it is equally irresponsible to say that it doesn't. We are just beginning to understand the influence of food on behavior.

It would certainly be irresponsible to say so on the basis of a single student mice experiment and the results at Appleton. On the other hand, it is equally irresponsible to say that it doesn't. We are just beginning to understand the influence of food on behavior. A study in Science in December 2002 concluded that \"food molecules act like hormones, regulating body functioning and triggering cell division. The molecules can cause mental imbalances ranging from attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder to serious mental illness.\" The problem is we do not know which food molecules have what effect. The bigger problem is that the composition of GM foods can change radically without our knowledge. Genetically modified foods have genes inserted into their DNA. But genes are not Legos; they don't just snap into place. **Gene insertion creates unpredicted, irreversible changes. In one study, for example, a gene chip monitored the DNA before and after a single foreign gene was inserted. As much as 5 percent of the DNA's genes changed the amount of protein they were producing.** Not only is that huge in itself, but these changes can multiply through complex interactions down the line. In spite of the potential for dramatic changes in the composition of GM foods, they are typically measured for only a small number of known nutrient levels. But even if we could identify all the changed compounds, at this point we wouldn't know which might be responsible for the antisocial nature of mice or humans. Likewise, we are only beginning to identify the medicinal compounds in food. We now know, for example, that the pigment in blueberries may revive the brain's neural communication system, and the antioxidant found in grape skins may fight cancer and reduce heart disease. But what about other valuable compounds we don't know about that might change or disappear in GM varieties? **Consider GM soy. In July 1999, years after it was on the market, independent researchers published a study showing that it contains 12-14 percent less cancer-fighting phytoestrogens.** What else has changed that we don't know about? [Monsanto responded with its own study, which concluded that soy's phytoestrogen levels vary too much to even carry out a statistical analysis. They failed to disclose, however, that the laboratory that conducted Monsanto's experiment had been instructed to use an obsolete method to detect phytoestrogens results.] In 1996, Monsanto published a paper in the *Journal of Nutrition* that concluded in the title, \"The composition of glyphosate-tolerant soybean seeds is equivalent to that of conventional soybeans.\" The study only compared a small number of nutrients and a close look at their charts revealed significant differences in the fat, ash, and carbohydrate content. In addition,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__healthy_diet_changes.txt:2:71b21c52713c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11079, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__healthy_diet_changes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__healthy_diet_changes", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "failed to disclose, however, that the laboratory that conducted Monsanto's experiment had been instructed to use an obsolete method to detect phytoestrogens results.] In 1996, Monsanto published a paper in the *Journal of Nutrition* that concluded in the title, \"The composition of glyphosate-tolerant soybean seeds is equivalent to that of conventional soybeans.\" The study only compared a small number of nutrients and a close look at their charts revealed significant differences in the fat, ash, and carbohydrate content. In addition, GM soy meal contained 27 percent more trypsin inhibitor, a well-known soy allergen. The study also used questionable methods. Nutrient comparisons are routinely conducted on plants grown in identical conditions so that variables such as weather and soil can be ruled out. Otherwise, differences in plant composition could be easily missed. In Monsanto's study, soybeans were planted in widely varying climates and geography. Although one of their trials was a side-by-side comparison between GM and non-GM soy, for some reason the results were left out of the paper altogether.** Years later, a medical writer found the missing data in the archives of the *Journal of Nutrition* and made them public. No wonder the scientists left them out. The GM soy showed significantly lower levels of protein, a fatty acid, and phenylalanine, an essential amino acid.** Also, toasted GM soy meal contained nearly twice the amount of a lectin that may block the body's ability to assimilate other nutrients. Furthermore, the toasted GM soy contained as much as seven times the amount of trypsin inhibitor, indicating that the allergen may survive cooking more in the GM variety. (This might explain the 50 percent jump in soy allergies in the UK, just after GM soy was introduced.) We don't know all the changes that occur with genetic engineering, but certainly GM crops are not the same. Ask the animals.** Eyewitness reports from all over North America describe how several types of animals, when given a choice, avoided eating GM food.** These included cows, pigs, elk, deer, raccoons, squirrels, rats, and mice. In fact, the Dutch student mentioned above first determined that his mice had a two-to-one preference for non-GM before forcing half of them to eat only the engineered variety. **Differences in GM food will likely have a much larger impact on children. They are three to four times more susceptible to allergies.** Also, they convert more of the food into body-building material. Altered nutrients or added toxins can result in developmental problems. For this reason, animal nutrition studies are typically conducted on young, developing animals. After the feeding trial, organs are weighed and often studied under magnification. If scientists used mature animals instead of young ones, even severe nutritional problems might not be detected. The Monsanto study used mature animals instead of young ones. They also diluted their GM soy with non-GM protein ten- or twelve-fold before feeding the animals.

The Monsanto study used mature animals instead of young ones. They also diluted their GM soy with non-GM protein ten- or twelve-fold before feeding the animals. And they never weighed the organs or examined them under a microscope. The study, which is the only major animal feeding study on GM soy ever published, is dismissed by critics as rigged to avoid finding problems. Unfortunately, there is a much bigger experiment going on one which we are all a part of. We're being fed GM foods daily, without knowing the impact of these foods on our health, our behavior, or our children. Thousands of schools around the world, particularly in Europe, have decided not to let their kids be used as guinea pigs. They have banned GM foods. The impact of changes in the composition of GM foods is only one of several reasons why these foods may be dangerous. Other reasons may be far worse (see [http://www.seedsofdeception.com](http://www.seedsofdeception.com)). **With the epidemic of obesity and diabetes and with the results in Appleton, parents and schools are waking up to the critical role that diet plays.

Even though this topic affects us all in significant ways, there was a media blackout on the event.

Some 40% of farmland nationally is owned, in ever-larger tracts, by absentee landlords who don't farm but rent to others (in the Corn Belt bullseye of Iowa, it's more than half). Billionaires, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, are among the largest private owners of US farmland.

[Our recent Substack article](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/make-our-communities-healthier-againinspiring) explores real, hopeful solutions already underway**, like social and green prescriptions, which connect people with nature and each other. We also explore community-driven efforts to heal the deadly loneliness epidemic, as well as the regenerative agriculture and the organic food movements that nurture both our bodies and the planet. When we can think and feel well together, that's a double win for the common good. When we can recognize what's pushing us - in our personal lives and as a society - we already have a degree of freedom from it. Freeing ourselves from harmful systems starts from within, and what we do to grow and evolve as individuals in a world filled with manipulation and propaganda. It starts with what we do to heal our bodies and minds from toxic chemicals, toxic beliefs, and toxic ways of relating with each other. It deepens as we harmonize our choices with the natural world. Challenging information can paradoxically remind us of the greater good. It is the courage of the people and the love for the common good that brings these injustices to light-fueling open dialogue and constructive action.

In fact, you probably didn't have the flu at all. That's according to state-by-state test results obtained in a three-month-long CBS News investigation.\" The CBS report goes on to point out that the CDC strangely advised states to stop testing and to stop counting the number of swine flu cases last July. The [CDC website](http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/reportingqa.htm) explains that states are no longer differentiating between the regular flu and the swine flu, lumping instead all influenza and pneumonia-related hospitalizations and deaths in one undifferentiated category. This alone could lead to a great exaggeration of reported swine flu cases, particularly as the [CDC website](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/disease.htm) states that every year in the U.S. on average 5 to 20% of the population gets the seasonal flu. This means between 15 and 60 million people come down with some version of the flu every year. Complications from the seasonal flu are claimed to kill about 36,000 people (100 per day on average), while more than 200,000 are hospitalized annually. **Why on Earth would the CDC decide to stop counting swine flu cases?** The CBS website states, \"The rationale given for the CDC guidance to forego testing and tracking individual cases was: why waste resources testing for H1N1 flu when the government has already confirmed there's an epidemic?\" The [CDC website](http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/reportingqa.htm) gives several puzzling reasons, including \"there are too many cases of flu to test and confirm.\" Yet with millions of cases of cancer and heart disease every year, states have never been told to stop testing for these. If the swine flu is as dangerous and deadly as alleged, we would expect more testing and not a halt. The CBS article further elaborates, \"Some public health officials privately disagreed with the decision to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__swine_flu_cdc.txt:0:a6a110349044", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11092, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__swine_flu_cdc.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__swine_flu_cdc", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "confirmed there's an epidemic?\" The [CDC website](http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/reportingqa.htm) gives several puzzling reasons, including \"there are too many cases of flu to test and confirm.\" Yet with millions of cases of cancer and heart disease every year, states have never been told to stop testing for these. If the swine flu is as dangerous and deadly as alleged, we would expect more testing and not a halt. The CBS article further elaborates, \"Some public health officials privately disagreed with the decision to stop testing and counting, telling CBS News that continued tracking of this new and possibly changing virus was important because H1N1 has a different epidemiology, affects younger people more than seasonal flu and has been shown to have a higher case fatality rate than other flu virus strains.\" CBS reporters asked CDC to provide materials from states on lab-confirmed swine flu cases before the count stopped in July. **CDC not only was initially unwilling to provide the information, they obstructed the investigation (watch [CBS News clip](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/21/cbsnews_investigates/main5404829.shtml) on this).** CBS then submitted a freedom of information request to HHS (Department of Health and Human Services) for this same information, but again received no response for two months. So the intrepid CBS team requested the information directly from all 50 states. On receiving these statistics, CBS reporters were astounded to find that for cases labeled probable or presumed swine flu, further testing showed that \"the vast majority of cases were negative for H1N1 as well as seasonal flu, despite the fact that many states were specifically testing patients deemed to be most likely to have H1N1 flu, based on symptoms and risk factors, such as travel to Mexico.\" **Many states found that only 1 - 2% of \"probable\" or \"presumed\" swine flu cases in fact were swine flu. **It may be that because of all the hype and fear being spread by the media and government, people's heightened anxiety and fear of having the dreaded swine flu caused them to go to their doctor for a simple fever, headache, or runny nose, thus leading to a very large number of false assessments. The numbers of swine flu cases thus appear to have been greatly exaggerated by as much as 50 times or more even before July. And as the CDC ordered states to stop counting in July, we have no way to make an accurate count now. Thus the numbers being used by the media and fed to people like President Obama have no reliable value and can be even further inflated, leading to even more fear and false claims of swine flu. Consider also that with the CDC's claim of 100 deaths per day due to the regular flu, even if the figure of 1,000 deaths in the past six months due to swine flu were true, it is far less than the death toll of even one month of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__swine_flu_cdc.txt:1:9ce13bcf46f2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11093, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__swine_flu_cdc.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__swine_flu_cdc", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "by the media and fed to people like President Obama have no reliable value and can be even further inflated, leading to even more fear and false claims of swine flu.

One claim used to promote fear is that the flu season is just starting. The public will be in great danger when the season soon kicks into full gear. **Yet the flu season in the southern hemisphere, which has seasons opposite to the north, is now over, and the swine flu did not wreak havoc as predicted.** A September [Reuters News article](http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE5826PW20090903) states, \"The U.S. government said an analysis of the epidemics in Australia, Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, and Uruguay showed that while H1N1 dominated the flu seasons there, it was only moderately severe. The pandemic did stress healthcare systems, but not for long.\" Why would the CDC exaggerate the risk of this disease? According to the [CDC website](http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/vaccination/public/vaccination_qa_pub.htm), \"The federal government has purchased a total of 250 million doses of 2009 H1N1 vaccine.\" Remember that the U.S. population is about [300 million](http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=uspopulation&met=population&tdim=true&q=us+population). The CDC has spent billions of our tax dollars to purchase these vaccines and obviously wants nearly everyone to get vaccinated. The drug companies have raked in [billions of dollars in profits](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/big-business-swine-flu/story?id=8820642) from this vaccine, even if a large portion of the vaccines is never used. The government has also [granted immunity](http://www.examiner.com/us-intelligence-in-national/fred-burks~y2009m8d1-Swine-flu-vaccine-Government-grants-immunity) from lawsuits to vaccine producers, so that those injured or killed by the vaccine may have no recourse for settlement. Maybe they learned from their mistakes with the 1976 swine flu scare, in which over 40 million Americans were vaccinated after government and media joined to pump fear out to the nation. Only one person was confirmed dead from the actual swine flu in 1976, yet hundreds filed death claims and thousands filed claims for paralysis from the swine flu vaccine. The vaccine caused Guillain-Barre Syndrome, an [acknowledged risk factor](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1206807/Swine-flu-jab-link-killer-nerve-disease-Leaked-letter-reveals-concern-neurologists-25-deaths-America.html) with the current vaccine. **Don't miss the powerful CBS *60 Minutes* video clip [at this link](http://www.examiner.com/us-intelligence-in-national/fred-burks~y2009m7d10-CBS-60-Minutes-300-death-claims-from-1976-swine-flu-vaccine-only-one-death-from-flu) showing blatant corruption and fear mongering in the 1976 swine flu scare. ** Numerous top MDs and health professionals have publicly stated that our health care system and even our politicians have been seriously corrupted by the vast wealth of the pharmaceutical industry.

Eliminating ... waste could save $750 billion annually with no harm to patient outcomes.\" The powerful pharmaceutical lobby has played a key role in causing U.S. health costs to be [50% higher](http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE5504Z320090601?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true) than that of most other developed nations, yet as [this MSNBC article states](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33209461/ns/politics-health_care_reform/), \"The United States is the only developed nation that does not have a comprehensive national health care plan, leaving about 50 million people without health insurance.\" Now the drug companies are using their power and influence to get politicians and the media behind the lucrative, yet questionable swine flu vaccine. **For lots more reliable information on strange manipulations involving the swine flu vaccine, [click here](http://www.examiner.com/us-intelligence-in-national/fred-burks~y2009m10d6-Flu-vaccines-H1N1-flu-swine-flu-vaccine-news).** And see the box below for ideas on what you can do to further educate yourself and spread the word about the swine flu deception.

Yet at the height of the avian flu scare, European researchers conducted a review of numerous studies of of anti-viral medications, which was then published in the prestigious medical journal *Lancet* on Jan. 19, 2006. [According to this review](http://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/review.php?rid=27) of 51 randomized controlled trials, Tamiflu was useless against the avian flu and many other flus. Contrary to the CDC, their recommendation was not to use Tamiflu. What about now? ** **Swine Flu: A Pandemic of Fear ** Intense media coverage of the swine flu has driven a pandemic wave of fear across our nation and world. Following the CDC's recommendations, people with a cough or a cold are staying home from work, some paralyzed by fear that they might die in the impending pandemic being predicted by newspapers and TV news programs around the world. Yet what or who is really behind the swine flu and this pandemic of fear? And why is the CDC recommending Tamiflu for prevention and treatment when it's use with avian and other flus has been found to be ineffective in numerous studies? And most important, what can we do about it? The [CDC website states](http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/swineflu_you.htm), \"CDC recommends the use of oseltamivir or zanamivir for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with these swine influenza viruses.\" Oseltamivir is Tamiflu, the same drug recommended for the avian flu only a few years ago. **Yet Tamiflu has been shown numerous times to be ineffective against avian flu, which in case you haven't noticed, never came close to being a pandemic.** Excerpts from a Dec. 4, 2005 [*Times of London*article](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2091-1903144,00.html) on the experience of a top avian flu expert are revealing: A Vietnamese doctor who has treated dozens of victims of avian flu claims the drug being stockpiled around the world to combat a pandemic is 'useless' against the virus. Dr Nguyen Tuong Van runs the intensive care unit at the Centre for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi and has treated 41 victims of H5N1. Van followed World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and gave her patients Tamiflu, but concluded it had no effect. Roche, the company that makes Tamiflu, has sold stockpiles of the drug to 40 countries and insists there is clear evidence it will protect against a future flu virus.

[According to this review](http://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/review.php?rid=27) of 51 randomized controlled trials, Tamiflu was useless against the avian flu and many other flus. As [reported in*Time*magazine](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1151856,00.html) and the [*Wall Street Journal*](http://pharmaceuticalengineering.blogharbor.com/blog/PharmaceuticalNews/_archives/2006/1/offset=70), the study's authors found no \"credible evidence\" that Tamiflu works against avian flu. Contrary to the CDC, their recommendation was not to use Tamiflu. As the media was spreading fear about the avian flu around the world, the CDC came out with the Tamiflu recommendation, yet provided little evidence of its effectiveness. Only later was the recommendation seriously questioned. How could the CDC be so confident in its recommendation without significant research?** How can health officials claim Tamiflu is effective with any certainty now, when the current rash of swine flu cases were discovered such a short time ago?** ** Tamiflu: Resistant Strains, Side Effects, and Expiration Date ** Using the avian flu again as a point of reference and caution, [CBS and Associated Press](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/21/health/main1156563.shtml) reported on Dec. 12, 2005 that some avian flu victims died after developing resistance to Tamiflu: In a development health experts are calling alarming, two bird flu patients in Vietnam died after developing resistance to Tamiflu, the key drug that governments are stockpiling in case of a large-scale outbreak. **The experts said the deaths were disturbing because the two girls had received early and aggressive treatment with Tamiflu and had gotten the recommended doses.** And then there were the deaths not from the flu or drug resistant strains, but from the side effects of Tamiflu. According to a report in Australia's respected *Sydney Morning Herald* on March 1, 2007, there were [18 juvenile fatalities](http://www.smh.com.au/news/health/bird-flu-vaccine-linked-to-18-teenage-suicides-in-japan/2007/02/28/1172338708146.html) linked to side effects of Tamiflu in 17 months. And though the U.S. media largely failed to report it, Japan [banned Tamiflu for teenagers](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11451-japan-bans-tamiflu-for-teenagers.html) that same month. According to the [official Tamiflu website](http://www.tamiflu.com/sideeffects.aspx), \"people with the flu, particularly children and adolescents, may be at an increased risk of self injury and confusion shortly after taking Tamiflu and should be closely monitored for signs of unusual behavior.\" Yet governments spent billions of dollars stockpiling Tamiflu even after all this information was reported. **According to a Feb. 2, 2007 [*New York Times*report](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE4D6153FF931A35751C0A9619C8B63&sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=all), the U.S. government at the time was creating a $1.4 billion stockpile of Tamiflu, while admitting that \"it is useful only when taken within the first 48 hours, and Tamiflu-resistant strains of the flu have already been found in Vietnam and in Egypt.\"** That's $1.4 billion tax dollars being spent on a drug of questionable effectiveness.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__swine_flu_cdc_recommendations.txt:1:ce7e2c378fc0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11098, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__swine_flu_cdc_recommendations.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__swine_flu_cdc_recommendations", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Yet governments spent billions of dollars stockpiling Tamiflu even after all this information was reported. **According to a Feb. 2, 2007 [*New York Times*report](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE4D6153FF931A35751C0A9619C8B63&sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=all), the U.S. government at the time was creating a $1.4 billion stockpile of Tamiflu, while admitting that \"it is useful only when taken within the first 48 hours, and Tamiflu-resistant strains of the flu have already been found in Vietnam and in Egypt.\"** That's $1.4 billion tax dollars being spent on a drug of questionable effectiveness. Other countries cumulatively also spent massive amounts on the drug. According to the pharmaceutical company which owns [exclusive distribution rights](http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2005/11/16/afx2339778.html) to the drug, Roche Laboratories, Tamiflu's [shelf life is 48 months](http://www.rocheusa.com/programs/tamiflu_backorder_0104.pdf), so all the medications stockpiled may eventually be useless. How many hundreds of millions of dollars will go to waste? How much more money will flow into the coffers of the major pharmaceuticals as a result of the current scare? And why are so few questioning the recommendation of Tamiflu to prevent and treat swine flu when conclusive studies have not been carried out? **Pharmaceutical Stocks Soar ** As a result of all the fear built up around the avian flu a few years ago, stock prices for Roche and Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company which [developed Tamiflu](http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2005/11/16/afx2339778.html), soared when the drug was recommended by the government as the best treatment. And few know that Donald Rumsfeld was chairman of the board of directors of Gilead from 1997 until 2001, when he was appointed U.S. Secretary of Defense. **Gilead stock increased so much that Britain's respected daily newspaper *The Independent* [reported on March 12, 2006](http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article350787.ece) that Rumsfeld alone \"made more than $5m (£2.9m) in capital gains from selling shares in the biotechnology firm that discovered and developed Tamiflu. **$5 million is a nice little profit on one drug. The article further points out that Tamiflu is \"the drug being bought in massive amounts by Governments to treat a possible human pandemic of [avian flu].\" Here are other key excerpts from that revealing article on Tamiflu: The drug was developed by a Californian biotech company, Gilead Sciences. Mr Rumsfeld was on the board of Gilead from 1988 to 2001, and was its chairman from 1997. He then left to join the Bush administration, but retained a huge shareholding. The 2005 report showed that, in all, he owned shares worth up to $95.9m, from which he got an income of up to $13m. The firm made a loss in 2003, the year before concern about bird flu started. Then revenues from Tamiflu almost quadrupled [in 2004], to $44.6m, helping put the company well into the black. Sales almost quadrupled again, to $161.6m last year [2005]. The massive stockpiles of Tamiflu built up by governments around the world to combat the impending avian flu pandemic were never needed. The pandemic never came close to happening.

As [reported by the WHO](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2009_04_23/en/index.html) on April 23, 2009, the total number of confirmed deaths worldwide due to avian flu since 2003 was 257. **For comparison, the [CDC estimates](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm) that influenza alone causes over 36,000 deaths every year in the United States. **Yet look at all the profits generated by the massive amount of fear spread through the media for the pandemic that never happened. In the current swine flu scare, **Gilead, Roche, and the politicians invested in them are gifted with another major opportunity to fleece the public as their stocks soar and governments again move to stockpile this drug of questionable effectiveness.** How much can we trust government when huge profits are at stake? How much influence do the lobbyists of the huge pharmaceuticals have over our elected representatives? And is there a possibility that the government might even have had a hand in the creation of both the [avian flu](http://educate-yourself.org/cn/lenhorowitzdebunksavianfluhysteria11oct05.shtml) and [swine flu](http://current.com/items/90008640_dr-horowitz-dr-robertson-novavax-responsible-for-strain-of-swine-flu-busted.htm)? These are questions that warrant media and public attention as this current wave of fear spreads. Regarding pharmaceutical lobbyists, a 2007 [CBS News article](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/03/29/60minutes/main2625305.shtml) states, \"Congressmen are outnumbered two to one by lobbyists for an industry that spends roughly a $100 million a year in campaign contributions and lobbying expenses to protect its profits.\" Dr. Marcia Angell, the [former editor in chief](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/other/interviews/angell.html) of the prestigious *New England Journal of Medicine*, [has stated](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies), \"Over the past two decades the pharmaceutical industry has moved very far from its original high purpose of discovering and producing useful new drugs. Now primarily a marketing machine to sell drugs of dubious benefit, this industry uses its wealth and power to co-opt every institution that might stand in its way, including the US Congress, the FDA, academic medical centers, and the medical profession itself.\" Dr. Angell has penned a [scathing essay](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies) on the widespread corruption in medicine which should be required reading for all citizens. **Profiting from Fear ** A surprisingly inspiring, [well researched article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/brighterfuture) of only two pages on the respected [WantToKnow.info website](https://www.WantToKnow.info) shows how fear is used by certain wealthy, [elite groups](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) to manipulate public perception and rake in the profits. Along similar lines, a [revealing 2006 article](http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0321/p09s01-coop.html) in the *Christian Science Monitor* questions the pandemic of fear created by government and media in relation to the avian flu: Americans consider the United States to be a country where debate flourishes.

Yet with regard to avian flu, hyped sound bites predominate. When President Bush asked Congress for $7.1 billion toward \"pandemic flu preparedness,\" even his critics replied \"not enough.\" What is lacking in the overall discussion about pandemic flu is disagreement, criticism, and skepticism - once the bedrock of science - from researchers willing to question and test the data. There are better ways to promote America's health than selling sickness through the language of fear. Even in the middle of the avian flu scare, some experts claimed that the flu was not a threat and was being used as hype. As [one newspaper](http://www.gainesville.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051101/LOCAL/51101021/1078/news) prophetically commented in late 2005, \"Dr. Marc Siegel, a practicing internist and associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine ... isn't buying into the scare scenario.** 'If anything is contagious right now, it's judgment clouded by fear,'** Siegel said.\" Even a [*New York Times*article](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/27/health/28qna.html?ex=1301202000&en=ce4ccbd2930111fa&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) questioned all the fear hype. And now, is the swine flu much different just a few years later? In a [most excellent article](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/04/29/Swine-Flu.aspx) on the current swine flu crisis, popular health analyst Dr. Joseph Mercola states: This isn't the first time the public has been warned about swine flu. The[last time was in 1976](http://www.philly.com/inquirer/health_science/daily/20090429_1976_Ft__Dix_swine_flu_outbreak_offers_guidance.html), right before I entered medical school. I remember it very clearly. It resulted in a massive swine flu vaccine campaign. Within a few months, claims totaling $1.3 billion had been filed by victims who had suffered paralysis from the vaccine. The vaccine was also blamed for 25 deaths. However, several hundred people developed crippling Guillain-Barré Syndrome after they were injected with the swine flu vaccine. Even healthy 20-year-olds ended up as paraplegics. And the swine flu pandemic itself? It never materialized. **For a list of excellent recommendations on how to protect yourself from the swine flu without dangerous drugs and vaccinations, see the list at the end of Dr. Mercola's [highly informative article](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/04/29/Swine-Flu.aspx), which has received over 700,000 views in the first three days it was posted. ** **What's Our Role in This? ** At the same time as we question the media and government, we have to also ask ourselves, why are we so easily affected by fear and sensationalism in the media?

The FDA rejected the petition.** Thimerosal, about 50 percent mercury by weight, has been used since the 1930s to kill microbes in vaccines. There have been suspicions that [thimerosal causes autism](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050825mercuryautismlink). However, studies that tracked thousands of children consistently have found no association between the brain disorder and the mercury-based preservative. Critics contend the studies are flawed. Since 2001, all vaccines given to children 6 and younger have been either thimerosal-free or contained only trace amounts of the preservative. Thimerosal has been phased out of some, but not all, adult vaccines as well. **Most doses of the flu vaccine still contain thimerosal.** There also are minute amounts of mercury, as thimerosal or phenylmercuric acetate, in roughly 45 eye ointments, nasal sprays and nasal solutions, the FDA said. **Note:** Why are they still using mercury in flu shots when it is not necessary? Heavy metals are well known to be toxic to the human body.

Bowing to pressure, Merck said Tuesday that it is immediately suspending its controversial campaign. [Yet] legislatures in roughly 20 states have introduced measures that would mandate girls have the vaccine to attend school. Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Feb. 2 issued an executive order requiring Texas girls entering the sixth grade as of 2008 get the vaccinations. The country has been \"burned\" by some drugs whose serious side effects emerged only after they were in wide use, including Merck's withdrawn painkiller Vioxx. The vaccine also is controversial because of its price - $360 for the three doses required. **Note:** $360 for every girl in school would amount to quite a hefty transfer of funds from taxpayers into the pockets of Merck.

But my next guest says ... part of the blame ... needs to fall on government. And it has to do with a drug called thimerosal. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense [Council]. Let's talk tonight about thimerosal. There are a lot of people out there ... very concerned about the impact of this drug, which is found in vaccines, and how it causes autism. KENNEDY: Thimerosal is a preservative that was put in vaccines back in the 1930s. Almost immediately after it was put in, autism cases began to appear. Autism had never been known before. Then the vaccines were increased in 1989 by the CDC and by a couple of other government agencies. We went up from receiving about 10 vaccines in our generation to these kids receive 24 vaccines. And they all had this thimerosal in them, this mercury. And **nobody bothered to do an analysis of what the cumulative impact of all that mercury was doing to kids. As it turns out, we are injecting our children with 400 times the amount of mercury that FDA or EPA considers safe. A child on his first day that he is born is injected with a hepatitis B shot.

The get-tough policy in the Washington suburbs of Prince George's County was one of the strongest efforts made by any U.S. school system to ensure its youngsters receive their required immunizations. Two months into the school year, school officials realized that more than 2,000 students in the county still didn't have the vaccinations they were supposed to have before attending class. So Circuit Court Judge C. Philip Nichols ordered parents in a letter to appear at the courthouse Saturday and either get their children vaccinated on the spot or risk up to 10 days in jail. \"It was very heavy handed,\" [school mom Aloma Martin] said of the county's action. \"From that letter, it sounded like they were going to start putting us in jail.\" Any children who still lack immunizations could be expelled. Their parents could then be brought up on truancy charges, which can result in a 10-day jail sentence for a first offense and 30 days for a second. Maryland, like all states, requires children to be immunized against several childhood illnesses including polio, mumps and measles. Several organizations opposed to mass vaccinations demonstrated outside the courthouse. While the medical consensus is that vaccines are safe and effective, **some people blame immunizations for a rise in autism and other medical problems. \"People should have a choice\" in getting their children immunized, said Charles Frohman, representing a physicians' group opposed to vaccines.** **Researchers Question Wide Use of HPV Vaccines** **2008-08-21, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/health/21vaccine.html?partner=rssuserland&e...](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/health/21vaccine.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=al) Two vaccines against cervical cancer are being widely used without sufficient evidence about whether they are worth their high cost or even whether they will effectively stop women from getting the disease, two articles in this week's New England Journal of Medicine conclude.

Bush is launching an ambitious plan to guard against an avian flu pandemic, an administration program to prepare for a potential anthrax attack is running into new and unexpected hurdles. VaxGen Inc., a California biotech firm ... last year was awarded an $877.5 million contract to supply a newly invented, and so far unlicensed, anthrax vaccine. **For months, investigators on both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns that the administration may have invested too big a chunk of the nation's biodefenses in one obscure and relatively untested company.** Last year's decision by HHS to award the contract to the little-known VaxGen is being scrutinized by at least two congressional committees. The company's product will have to pass more large-scale tests proving its safety and effectiveness on people before it is fully licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for use on humans. A New York Times report last December noted that ... the company had faced lawsuits filed by investors who claimed VaxGen misinformed them about an AIDS vaccine that the company had heavily promoted but which later failed to work. **Note:** For more on how greed and corruption in the pharmaceutical industry affects your health and wallet, see our [Health Information Center](healthinformation). **Deadly Immunity - by Robert F.

The federal officials and industry representatives had assembled to discuss a disturbing new study that raised alarming questions about the safety of a host of common childhood vaccines administered to infants and young children. A mercury-based preservative in the vaccines -- thimerosal -- appeared to be responsible for a dramatic increase in autism. **But instead of taking immediate steps to alert the public and rid the vaccine supply of thimerosal, the officials and executives at Simpsonwood spent most of the next two days discussing how to cover up the damaging data.** According to transcripts obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, many at the meeting were concerned about how the damaging revelations about thimerosal would affect the vaccine industry's bottom line. The CDC paid the Institute of Medicine to conduct a new study to whitewash the risks of thimerosal, ordering researchers to \"rule out\" the chemical's link to autism. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, who has received $873,000 in contributions from the pharmaceutical industry, has been working to immunize vaccine makers from liability in 4,200 lawsuits that have been filed by the parents of injured children. More than 500,000 kids currently suffer from autism. The disease was unknown until 1943, when it was identified and diagnosed among 11 children born in the months after thimerosal was first added to baby vaccines in 1931. Internal documents reveal that Eli Lilly, which first developed thimerosal, knew from the start that its product could cause damage -- and even death -- in both animals and humans. **Note:** A good, though somewhat watered down version of the above article was published in the *Boston Globe* on July 1, 2005.

Thimerosal, which is nearly 50 percent ethyl mercury, has largely been eliminated from most routine childhood vaccines, although it is present in most flu shots. **More than 4,200 parents have filed claims in the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, alleging that their children suffered autism or other neurological disorders from mercury in their shots.** **The Man Behind The Vaccine Mystery** **2002-12-12, CBS News** [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/12/eveningnews/main532886.shtml](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/12/eveningnews/main532886.shtml) It's been a mystery in Washington for weeks. **Just before President Bush signed the homeland security bill into law an unknown member of Congress inserted a provision into the legislation that blocks lawsuits against the maker of a controversial vaccine preservative called \"thimerosal,\" used in vaccines that are given to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:health__vaccine_risks.txt:4:c552f4c8e6b6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11108, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "health__vaccine_risks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "health__vaccine_risks", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, alleging that their children suffered autism or other neurological disorders from mercury in their shots.** **The Man Behind The Vaccine Mystery** **2002-12-12, CBS News** [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/12/eveningnews/main532886.shtml](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/12/eveningnews/main532886.shtml) It's been a mystery in Washington for weeks. **Just before President Bush signed the homeland security bill into law an unknown member of Congress inserted a provision into the legislation that blocks lawsuits against the maker of a controversial vaccine preservative called \"thimerosal,\" used in vaccines that are given to children.** Drug giant Eli Lilly and Company makes thimerosal. It's the mercury in the preservative that many parents say causes autism in thousands of children. But nobody in Congress would admit to adding the provision, reports CBS News Correspondent Jim Acosta - until now. House Majority Leader Dick Armey tells CBS News he did it to keep vaccine-makers from going out of business under the weight of mounting lawsuits. \"I did it and I'm proud of it,\" says Armey, R-Texas. \"It's a matter of national security,\" Armey says. Because Armey is retiring at the end of the year, some say the outgoing majority leader is the perfect fall guy to take the heat and shield the White House from embarrassment. **Note: **Though this is old news, it is very important news showing how beholden the government is to the powerful drug companies, and how great the fear of thimerosal lawsuits is. **How to Deal with Swine Flu: Heeding the Mistakes of 1976** **2009-04-27, *Time* Magazine** [http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1894129,00.html](http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1894129,00.html) In February 1976, an outbreak of swine flu struck Fort Dix Army base in New Jersey, killing a 19-year-old private and infecting hundreds of soldiers. Concerned that the U.S. was on the verge of a devastating epidemic, President Gerald Ford ordered a nationwide vaccination program at a cost of $135 million (some $500 million in today's money). Within weeks, reports surfaced of people developing Guillain-Barré syndrome, a paralyzing nerve disease that can be caused by the vaccine. By April, more than 30 people had died of the condition. Facing protests, federal officials abruptly canceled the program on Dec. 16. The epidemic failed to materialize. Medical historians and epidemiologists say ... the decisions made in the wake of the '76 outbreak - and the public's response to them - provide a cautionary tale for public health officials, who may soon have to consider whether to institute draconian measures to combat the disease. \"I think 1976 provides an example of how not to handle a flu outbreak,\" says Hugh Pennington, an emeritus professor of virology at Britain's University of Aberdeen.

And an official of the World Health Organization's European operation said the body is closely monitoring the investigation into the events that took place at Baxter International's research facility. The contaminated product, a mix of H3N2 seasonal flu viruses and unlabelled H5N1 viruses, was supplied to an Austrian research company. The contamination incident ... came to light when the subcontractor in the Czech Republic inoculated ferrets with the product and they died. Ferrets shouldn't die from exposure to human H3N2 flu viruses. Public health authorities concerned about what has been described as a \"serious error\" on Baxter's part have assumed the death of the ferrets meant the H5N1 virus in the product was live. But the company, Baxter International Inc., has been parsimonious about the amount of information it has released about the event. On Friday, **the company's director of global bioscience communications confirmed what scientists have suspected. \"It was live,\" Christopher Bona said in an email. Accidental release of a mixture of live H5N1 and H3N2 viruses could have resulted in dire consequences**. **Note:** How on earth did the avian flu virus ever get into vaccines?

Rick Perry on Thursday angrily defended his relationship with Merck & Co. and his executive order requiring that schoolgirls receive the drugmaker's vaccine against the sexually transmitted cervical-cancer virus. Perry's chief of staff had met with key aides about the vaccine on Oct. 16, the same day Merck's political action committee donated $5,000 to the governor's campaign. **In issuing the order, the governor made Texas the first state to require the vaccine Gardasil for all schoolgirls. But many lawmakers have complained about his bypassing the Legislature altogether.** The executive order has inflamed conservatives, who said it contradicts Texas' abstinence-only sexual education policies and intrudes into families' lives. Critics have previously questioned Perry's ties to Merck. Mike Toomey, Perry's former chief of staff, now lobbies for the drug company. And the governor accepted a total of $6,000 from Merck during his re-election campaign. Merck has waged a behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign to get state legislatures to require girls to get the three-dose vaccine to enroll in school. **Note:** The drug company lobby is the most powerful in the U.S., as reported by the former editor-in-chief of one of the most respected medical journals in the U.S. [Click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/health/health-corruption) for more. **Gardasil vaccine doubts grow** **2008-08-11, *Los Angeles Times*** [http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-gardasil11-2008aug11,0,2921629.s...](http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-gardasil11-2008aug11,0,2921629.story) Though most medical organizations strongly advocate using the HPV vaccine, some doctors and parents ... are asking whether the vaccine's benefits really outweigh its costs.

Some experts [are] worried about possible allergic reactions to the vaccine because it requires a massive dose - 12 times that of the seasonal inoculation. **Note:** Who pays for and who profits from the purchase of these 20 million vaccine doses?

Before the Senate acted, **Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt awarded a $62.5 million contract to Emeryville, Calif.-based Chiron Corp. to manufacture bird flu vaccine.** The Bush administration is putting the final touches on its plan for how to fight the next super-flu ... amid growing concern that **the H5N1 influenza strain spreading among birds from Asia to Europe could trigger a pandemic if it mutates into a form easily spread from person to person**. The massive out-of-budget expenditure ... would increase stockpiles of the antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza, thought to be effective against current strains of bird flu. **Note:** Isn't is interesting that over $60 million dollars (potentially $8 billion!) has been \"awarded\" for a vaccine against a bird flu that hasn't even mutated yet? How can they know that it will mutate and kill millions of people? How do we know these vaccines will work when it hasn't even mutated? Note also that the pharmaceutical industry, which manufactures vaccines, has the largest lobby in all Washington and is raking in huge profits. **What you can do: ** Inform your media and political representatives of this important information.

The abstract, conclusion and two key graphs from this study are posted below. **Common sense would tell us that an infant's immune system is not well developed and that the 26 vaccines scheduled for infants by the age of one year in the U.S. could easily overtax the coping mechanisms of many infants. **Now the data from this study confirms that those countries which give only 12 to 14 vaccines to infants have much lower infant death rates (by as much as 50% or more) than the U.S. and other countries with higher numbers of vaccinations. Remember that huge pharmaceuticals which focus on [maximizing shareholder value](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/09/how-the-cult-of-shareholder-value-wrecked-american-business/) above all else make billions of dollars on these vaccines. They do everything they can to hide information like this to protect their huge profits.

Nations were also grouped into five different vaccine dose ranges: 12-14, 15-17, 18-20, 21-23, and 24-26. The mean IMRs of all nations within each group were then calculated. Linear regression analysis of unweighted mean IMRs showed a high statistically significant correlation between increasing number of vaccine doses and increasing infant mortality rates, with r = 0.992 (p = 0.0009). **Using the Tukey-Kramer test, statistically significant differences in mean IMRs were found between nations giving 12-14 vaccine doses and those giving 21-23, and 24-26 doses.

The graph below shows the strong overall correlation with few exceptions. **Conclusion** The US childhood immunization schedule requires 26 vaccine doses for infants aged less than 1 year, the most in the world, yet 33 [out of 34] nations have better IMRs. Using linear regression, the immunization schedules of these 34 nations were examined and a correlation coefficient of 0.70 (p < 0.0001) was found between IMRs and the number of vaccine doses routinely given to infants. When nations were grouped into five different vaccine dose ranges (12-14, 15-17, 18-20, 21-23, and 24-26), 98.3% of the total variance in IMR was explained by the unweighted linear regression model. These findings demonstrate a counter-intuitive relationship: **nations that require more vaccine doses tend to have higher infant mortality rates.** Efforts to reduce the relatively high US IMR have been elusive. Finding ways to lower preterm birth rates should be a high priority. However, preventing premature births is just a partial solution to reduce infant deaths. **A closer inspection of correlations between vaccine doses, biochemical or synergistic toxicity, and IMRs, is essential.

Some public health doctors want to turn schools into vaccination clinics where children will be the first to be injected with experimental swine flu vaccines. [[1]](#_edn1) **Less Than 50,000 Swine Flu Cases Worldwide** Every day we are being warned by doctors at the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to worry a lot about the H1N1 influenza A virus, which was first identified in Mexico in April 2009 and is being called the new swine flu. As of June 15, 2009, the World Health Organization states that 76 countries have reported more than 35,000 cases, including 163 deaths. 108 of those deaths have occurred in Mexico. [[2]](#_edn2) We are being told that nearly 18,000 Americans have gotten sick from the new swine flu virus, with about 5 percent being hospitalized and 45 dying. [[3]](#_edn3) It looks like people, who are in poor health to begin with are at greater risk of having complications and dying from the new swine flu, which has symptoms just like regular influenza. [[4][5]](#_edn4) This is not surprising because people in poor health are always at greater risk of having complications and dying from infectious disease. **Most Flu-Like Illness Not True Influenza ** What a lot of people don't know is that true type A or type B influenza only causes about 20 percent of all flu-like symptoms that people experience during any given flu season.

[[6]](#_edn6) **80 percent of all flu-like illness in a normal flu season is NOT caused by the type A and B strains of influenza for which annual flu shots are given. And vaccine acquired immunity is temporary, while immunity gained after recovering from influenza is longer lasting. **[[7][8]](#_edn7) **1968 Flu Pandemic Killed 34,000 Americans** The new type A H1N1 influenza virus public health doctors say is making people sick around the world is an unusual combination of human, bird and pig viruses. [[9]](#_edn9) Nobody seems to know exactly how this new virus was created and why it suddenly emerged from Mexico in mid-April - or if it will behave like past pandemic influenza viruses that caused 68,000 American deaths in 1957 and killed 34,000 Americans in 1968. [[10]](#_edn10) (**The CDC states that 36,000 Americans die from influenza complications annually, with most of those deaths occurring in the elderly and those in poor health**). Influenza pandemics usually start with mild symptoms and progress to more severe symptoms before populations acquire immunity to the virus and it dies out. **Older Americans May Have Antibodies Against Swine Flu** The good news about the new swine flu going around is that there are signs those of us born before 1957, may be naturally protected and at LOWER risk of being infected. [[11][12]](#_edn11) Why? Because we recovered from influenza caused by similar influenza strains that circulated in past decades and have long lasting antibodies that help us resist infection. So the aging baby boomers have something to be happy about. **Vaccinated Children Don't Have Natural Antibodies** But will health officials allow our children and grandchildren to get those same kind of natural protective antibodies to type A and B influenza, including this new swine flu? It doesn't look like it. First, doctors in America have been insisting for the past few years that every child from six months old to age 18 must get an annual flu shot.

[[16]](#_edn16) Doctors at the Centers for Disease Control, who followed the lead of the World Health Organization, have done the same and are exercising unprecedented power that Congress handed over to them after 9-11. **Fast Tracking of Experimental Vaccines With Novel Adjuvants ** **Whenever the CDC declares a public health emergency, that declaration allows the Food and Drug Administration to permit emergency use authorization for drug companies to fast track creation of experimental drugs and vaccines that do not have to be tested as thoroughly as vaccines that go through the normal FDA licensing process. [[17]](#_edn17) In this case, Congress responded to the public health emergency declaration by giving a group of drug companies one billion dollars [[18]](#_edn18)** to fast track experimental swine flu vaccines that may include whole live [[19]](#_edn19), killed or genetically engineered human and animal influenza viruses, chemicals, and potentially reactive oil based adjuvants that manipulate the immune system to boost the vaccine's potency. [[20][21][22]](#_edn20) **States Enact Stronger Quarantine & No Free Assembly Laws** **In some states, like Massachusetts, public health doctors have persuaded legislators to quickly pass pandemic influenza legislation that will allow state officials to enter homes and businesses without the approval of occupants; to investigate and quarantine individuals without their consent; to require licensed health care providers to give citizens vaccines and to ban the free assembly of citizens in the state.** [[23][24]](#_edn23) **What Can You Do?** What does this declaration of a public health emergency in the U.S. mean for you and your family? It means that, right now, you need to become educated about vaccination, influenza, vaccine risks, and the public health laws in your state. You need to find out what your rights and options are under new public health laws that may require you and your children to get vaccinated or be quarantined.

In this time of fear, we cannot let that fear take away our freedom to make voluntary health choices, including vaccine choices, so we have the power to make sure that the cure is not more dangerous than the disease. **Note:** The above essay was originally published on the [NVIC website](http://www.nvic.org/NVIC-Vaccine-News/June-2009/Swine-Flu-Vaccine--Will-We-Have-A-Choice--by-Barba.aspx).

On one hand, 2023 was yet another year plagued with corruption, tragedy, and social conflict. Department of Homeland Security agencies have [militarized US streets](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-after-20-years-department-homeland-security-a-moneyguzzling-failure), conducting [surveillance of U.S. citizens](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--us-openly-stockpiling-dirt-all-its-citizens) engaged in constitutionally protected activities. Human rights and civil liberty groups [wrote a report](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-119k-people-hurt-riotcontrol-weapons-since-2015) this year that 119,000 people have been significantly hurt by crowd-control weapons since 2015.\n\nYet looking back at the hundreds of news articles we've summarized, this year's news was also abundant with revelations, courageous reporting, and the liberation of alternative perspectives and news platforms. In this newsletter, we'll take a look back and explore this year's news on censorship issues, COVID, the US war machine, UFO disclosure, and health and food corruption.\n\nThe information we cover is often challenging, unsettling and complex. Yet we value questioning authority in healthy ways. We can't shift the chaos we're in until we name it. When we can recognize what's pushing us - in our personal lives and as a society - we already have a degree of freedom from it. Facing the truth of the world heals divides and empowers constructive change. Root causes of human and environmental suffering are uncovered: the money, players, and belief systems that drive the machine. Most importantly, challenging information can paradoxically remind us of the greater good. It is the courage of the people and the love for the common good that bring these injustices to light-fueling open dialogue and constructive action.\n\n**Finding Balance: WantToKnow.info Inspiration Center**\n\nWantToKnow.info believes it is important to balance disturbing cover-up information with inspirational writings which call us to be all that we can be and to work together for positive change.

Andreas Heisler, President of Swiss-based independent medical and health network ALETHEIA Hey WantToKnow.info readers, A democratic culture can be defined as one that invites open dialogue of different views, promotes transparency, and builds trust. Yet trust in American media and public institutions is currently at [an all-time low](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-how-american-institutions-went-from-trust-bust). In response, people all over the world are reviving the common good by exposing important information that protects people and the environment from private exploitation. A few weeks ago, I had the meaningful opportunity to attend *Rise and Resist*, the annual [Children's Health Defense (CHD) conference](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-2023-conference/) in Savannah, Georgia. For 3 days, courageous thought leaders and whistleblowers within science, law, medicine, and technology came to speak on important issues shaping our lives: medical and government corruption, vaccine injured families and children, chronic health epidemics, environmental toxins, food system solutions, media censorship, and the financial system crisis. The ability to talk openly about these issues is a healthy sign of critical thinking and collective problem-solving. Yet unfortunately, they have had very little coverage in the mainstream press. To [MSN News](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/i-feel-like-i-ve-come-home-today-rfk-jr-speaks-to-crowd-at-anti-vax-conference-despite-claiming-he-supports-vaccines/ar-AA1jIvcb) and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-comes-home-anti-vaccine-group-commits-break-us-infectious-disea-rcna123551), the event was labeled as an anti-vax conference and mainly focused on one aspect of the conference: CHD founder and presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr.'s speech and his \"[grim comments to strangers](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/i-feel-like-i-ve-come-home-today-rfk-jr-speaks-to-crowd-at-anti-vax-conference-despite-claiming-he-supports-vaccines/ar-AA1jIvcb).\" The conference was nothing like how these news articles were painting it to be. Mainstream media coverage of the event was obviously biased. The issues that were foregrounded threaten official narratives, and they expose harmful agendas of those in power.

Public discourse has to be narrowed and manipulated, to prevent large-scale inquiry into these corruptions that these corporate elites benefit from. **Here's what actually happened at the conference, and why it matters.** The weekend was rich of legal and scientific panel discussions, peer-reviewed and evidence-based science, powerful human stories, film screenings, [successful CHD litigation cases](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/legal_justice/chd-victories-positive-outcomes-and-groundbreaking-litigation/) revealing undeniable corporate and government harm, and cutting-edge thoughts about the future of healthcare and science.

As a former educator that ran a wellness center and mentored all types of youth from elementary to high school ages, I can attest to the alarming rates of illness in our youth. This should be making headlines. Why is this not being thoroughly investigated? Rise and Resist was not just about vaccine harms. The conference offered a multifactorial approach to understanding root causes of chronic illness and disease, especially in children. Toxic chemicals in our food are linked to [cancer](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-disturbing-weedkiller-ingredient-tied-cancer-found-80-us-urine-samples), [severe depression, and cognitive decline](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-glyphosate-linked-severe-depression-cognitive-decline-us-adults).

A short time later, the FDA gave Pfizer's emergency authorization for its vaccine to be used publicly. Despite Jackson's claims, the FDA only visited 9 of the 153 Pfizer trial sites, before giving Pfizer full approval for its vaccine. Meanwhile, vaccine injuries are not as rare as we're told.

According to Sasha Latypova, a former pharmaceutical industry executive who now specializes in pharmaceutical fraud, **\"Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosures show the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and BARDA contracts with the pharmaceutical companies were structured such that these protections weren't required.\"** **Pharmacide: death and injury by Big Pharma corruption.** One new term I learned at the conference was **pharmacide: death and injury by Big Pharma corruption.** This is a word coined by CHD's new initiative, [Reform Pharma](https://reformpharmanow.org/). [https://reformpharmanow.org/](https://reformpharmanow.org/) Guided by a [bold and detailed 10-Point Plan](https://reformpharmanow.org/10-point-plan/), the vision is simple: restore health integrity and medical freedom. In times like these, we need solutions and ideas to bring forth a society of healthy and empowered people. And as CHD President Mary Holland said during the conference, we all have a need to trust authority figures. However, our authority figures have been compromised. **Government censorship is a tool to hide exploitation and injustice. The suppression of dissent creates the \"[illusion of consensus](https://www.illusionconsensus.com/p/exclusive-interview-with-dr-joseph#details)\" in medicine, leading to a society that unquestioningly trusts official narratives at the expense of countless injuries and deaths. **What gives Big Government, Tech, and Pharma the right to censor and ridicule information that opposes their interests? Why do we give so much power to these institutions to the point where they can stifle free speech? What are we to do about what some consider \"misinformation\" today, but not on examination later? If there is any risk to these medicines and vaccines, there must be choice and informed consent-not harsh mandates, censorship, medical gaslighting, and cancel culture. The silencing of alternative narratives weakens our collective muscles to collaborate and solve problems across our differences.** Access to the open flow of information opens up the doors for effective participatory action and public forums of open and fair debate.

People had tears in their eyes, as we took a moment of silence. Feeling this together was a profound reminder that we are not alone. The thread of humanity connects us all. Conference attendees had the opportunity to watch a special film screening of *[Protocol 7](https://protocol7.movie)*, a new drama-thriller film by physician and filmmaker Andy Wakefield that is set to be released next year. The film is based on true stories, centering around a small-town lawyer who confronts corporate pharmaceutical fraud when her adopted son is severely injured by the MMR vaccine. It was a poignant and emotionally stirring film that left the whole audience standing in ovation. During the Q&A after the film, the lead actress Rachel Whittle shared her courageous process of taking on this role. She knew that choosing to be in this film would impact her ability to attract other acting opportunities, due to the controversial nature of vaccine issues. Yet I'll never forget what she said with tears flowing down her face. **\"How would I feel about myself if I knew about these harms... and didn't do anything about it?\"** I left Rise and Resist feeling deeply inspired by the collective goodness in the room. You could feel an energy of possibility, strength, and hope in the air. So many of us were touched by the stunning courage of the people that spoke at the conference. In the eyes of the mainstream press (and Wikipedia), these people are villains and \"anti-vaxxers.\" They represent a massive threat to establishment, commercial interests. These people have lost their jobs, medical licenses, and credibility. Yet they have not lost their heart, and their commitment to saving lives through science, advocacy, and litigation. In the words of Holland during the closing session of *Rise and Resist*, **people are waking up and the truth will come out.

She is currently a senior lecturer in social medicine at Harvard Medical School. Her book, *The Truth About the Drug Companies,* provides yet another eye-opening example of how greed has taken over many facets of business and government, and offers empowering ideas on what we can do about it. *New England Journal of Medicine* Volume 351:1580-1581, October 7, 2004, Number 15 [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/351/15/1580](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/351/15/1580) (payment may be required to view article) **The Truth About the Drug Companies: ****How They Deceive Us and What to Do About It** **In this book, her most recent, Marcia Angell explores pharmaceutical research, deplores the rapidly expanding involvement (and distortion of truth) of Big Pharma, and implores us all (physicians, patients, politicians) to do something about it.** The dust-jacket blurb asserts that Angell, \"during her two decades at *The New England Journal of Medicine* had a front-row seat on the growing corruption of the pharmaceutical industry.\" Since leaving the *Journal,* she's gone behind the curtains of Big Pharma, Big University, and Big Faculty. Drawing on her own work and on her thoughtful analysis of research, company financial statements, and investigative reports into drug development and marketing, Angell writes with the unambiguous and unyielding style that *Journal* readers came to expect and trust. The current slide toward the commercialization and corruption of clinical research coincided with the election of President Ronald Reagan in 1980 and the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, a new set of laws that permitted and encouraged universities and small businesses to patent discoveries from research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). **Research paid for by the public to serve the public instantly became a private, and salable good - one that is producing drug sales of more than $200 billion a year.** Commercialization had both specific and broad effects.

Readers of this journal and others are familiar with investigations into the control that research sponsors at pharmaceutical companies exert on the design and analysis of clinical trials (including the distortion of primary outcome measures in trials) and the issue of reporting, nonreporting, and biased reporting of results. Angell reminds us of the increasingly cozy relationships between big industry and the faculties of universities. **Not only are narcissistic donors renaming the medical schools; they are buying access to the best minds of their faculties.** Angell's examples of the large consulting fees paid by industry to individual faculty members and to NIH scientists and directors are astounding. The broader effects are felt in the commercialization of universities, medical faculties, and our profession. In 2000, in a letter written in response to Angell's *Journal* editorial, \"[Is Academic Medicine for Sale?](https://web.archive.org/web/20080307181700/http://www.mindfully.org/Health/Academic-Medicine-Sale18may00.htm)\" a reader supplied the answer: \"No. The current owner is very happy with it.\" The increasing intrusion of industry into medical education and the almost complete domination of continuing medical education (especially regarding drugs) by the marketing departments of large pharmaceutical companies are a scandal. The same companies also spend heavily to lobby governments. According to Angell, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the pharmaceutical industry's U.S. trade association has \"the largest lobby in Washington,\" which in 2002 employed 675 lobbyists (including 26 former members of Congress) at a cost of more than $91 million. The result has been above-average growth in corporate profits during both Republican and Democratic administrations. **The most recent and perplexing lobbying effort caused Congress explicitly to prohibit Medicare from using its huge purchasing power to get lower prices for drugs**, thus opening up a dollar pipeline, in the form of higher drug prices, directly from taxpayers to corporate coffers. These changes, along with the cave-in by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 that permitted direct-to-consumer advertising to bypass mention in their ads of all but the most serious side effects, have further augmented profits. The overall effect has been a corruption not only of science but also of the dissemination of science. Angell documents that, contrary to what they claim, large pharmaceutical companies have \"paltry output\" in innovative research. In fact, as permitted by Bayh-Dole, pharmaceutical companies buy discoveries coming out of the basic-science enterprises, including universities and publicly funded granting agencies. The real costs of research on drugs by pharmaceutical companies are much less than the oft-quoted $800 million or so per new drug brought to market. Most of their research is on me-too drugs - unoriginal,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:healthcoverup.txt:1:7746b3657c3a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11140, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "healthcoverup.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "healthcoverup", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the dissemination of science.

The real costs of research on drugs by pharmaceutical companies are much less than the oft-quoted $800 million or so per new drug brought to market. Most of their research is on me-too drugs - unoriginal, tax-deductible (and thus paid for in lost taxes by the public), and mostly unnecessary. The Big Pharma companies are, in essence, manufacturing and marketing companies. Angell's concluding chapter, the least convincing in an otherwise fascinating and penetrating book, contains the solutions, all of them predictable: control me-too drugs, re-empower the FDA, oversee Big Pharma's clinical research, curb patent length and abuse, keep Big Pharma out of medical education, make company financial statements transparent (so we can tell what the costs of research really are, as distinct from marketing), and impose price controls or guidelines. Granted, the problems are so prevalent and the corporate tentacles so entwined with our way of being that it is hard to see what else to recommend. **But perhaps Angell is right. We must change the way we manage research and the development and distribution of new drugs. Not only are health and health care at risk, but so are the research enterprise and the reputations of universities and governments.

Below are a few key quotes from a summary of this eye-opening book in the [New York Review of Books](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies): **\"[In 2002] the combined profits for the ten drug companies in the Fortune 500 were more than the profits for all the other 490 businesses put", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:healthemail.txt:0:405d21ffb7a8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11142, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "healthemail.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "healthemail", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "hard evidence backed up with hundreds of excellent footnotes and empowering suggestions on what we can do, Dr. Angell's book is a must read for all who care about the future of our health.

Over the past two decades the pharmaceutical industry has moved very far from its original high purpose of discovering and producing useful new drugs. Now primarily a marketing machine to sell drugs of dubious benefit, this industry uses its wealth and power to co-opt every institution that might stand in its way, including the US Congress, the FDA, academic medical centers, and the medical profession itself.\"** \"The great majority of 'new' drugs are not new at all but merely variations of older drugs already on the market. These are called 'me-too' drugs. The idea is to grab a share of an established, lucrative market by producing something very similar to a top-selling drug. As Dr. Sharon Levine, associate executive director of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Group, put it: 'If I'm a manufacturer and I can change one molecule and get another twenty years of patent rights, and convince physicians to prescribe and consumers to demand the next form of Prilosec just as my patent expires, then why would I be spending money on a lot less certain endeavor, which is looking for brand-new drugs?'\" \"Of the 78 drugs approved by the FDA in 2002, only 17 contained new active ingredients, and only seven of these were classified by the FDA as improvements over older drugs. The other 71 drugs approved that year were variations of old drugs or deemed no better than drugs already on the market. In other words, they were me-too drugs.\" **\"The Medicare prescription drug benefit enacted in 2003, and scheduled to go into effect in 2006, promises a windfall for big pharma since it forbids the government from negotiating prices. The immediate jump in pharmaceutical stock prices after the bill passed indicated that the industry and investors were well aware of the windfall.\"** \"Drug companies have the largest lobby in Washington, and they give copiously to political campaigns. Legislators are now so beholden to the pharmaceutical industry that it will be exceedingly difficult to break its lock on them. But the one thing legislators need more than campaign contributions is votes. That is why citizens should know what is really going on. Contrary to the industry's public relations, they don't get what they pay for. The fact is that this industry is taking us for a ride, and there will be no real reform without an aroused and determined public to make it happen.\" **For", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:healthemail.txt:1:8deecfd6d4d7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11143, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "healthemail.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "healthemail", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "pharmaceutical industry that it will be exceedingly difficult to break its lock on them.

Marine scientists say archaeological remains discovered 36 metres (120 feet) underwater in the Gulf of Cambay off the western coast of India could be over 9,000 years old. **The vast city - which is five miles long and two miles wide - is believed to predate the oldest known remains in the subcontinent by more than 5,000 years.** Debris recovered from the site - including construction material, pottery, sections of walls, beads, sculpture and human bones and teeth has been carbon dated and found to be nearly 9,500 years old. The city is believed to be even older than the ancient Harappan civilisation, which dates back around 4,000 years.

Canadian company [Advanced Digital Communications] used sophisticated sonar equipment to find and film stone structures more than 2,000 feet (650 metres) below the sea's surface.** The explorers first spotted the underwater city last year, when scanning equipment started to produce images of symmetrically organized stone structures reminiscent of an urban development. In July, the researchers returned to the site with an explorative robot device capable of highly advanced underwater filming work. The images the robot brought back confirmed the presence of huge, smooth blocks with the appearance of cut granite. **They believe these formations could have been built more than 6,000 years ago**, a date which precedes the great pyramids of Egypt by 1,500 years. \"It's a really wonderful structure which really looks like it could have been a large urban centre,\" ADC explorer Paulina Zelitsky told the Reuters news agency. **Note:** For an excellent discussion by former *Economist* reporter Graham Hancock of this most amazing find which brings into question the accepted theories of civilization, [click here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvNEVvHgOOY). **Was Edison Adversary Father Of 'Star Wars'?** **1986-08-10, *Chicago Tribune*** [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-08-10/news/8602270598_1_nikola-tesla-...](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-08-10/news/8602270598_1_nikola-tesla-clouds-guglielmo-marconi) Weren't we taught that radio was invented by an Italian named Guglielmo Marconi?

But he powered it and all of his other projects with inefficient direct current (DC) electricity. It was Tesla who discovered how to use the far more powerful phased form of alternating current (AC) electricity that is virtually the universal type of electricity employed by modern civilization. There are indications that Tesla also discovered many of the devices ... for the Pentagon's controversial Star Wars antimissile defense system. \"Tesla dreamed of supplying limitless amounts of power freely and equally available to all persons on Earth,\" said Grotz. And he was convinced he could do so by broadcasting electrical power across large distances just as radio transmits far smaller amounts of energy. **[Tesla's] tests ... caused lights to burn as much as 26 miles away, according to news reports of the time. ** **Note:** Tesla was written out of history texts likely because he advocated providing methods for extremely cheap electricity available to everyone. He successfully transmitted electricity through the air to lights 26 miles away. Yet the rich energy power brokers of his time could not stand for this.

An ancient version of one book has an extra phrase. Another appears to have been revised to retroactively insert a prophecy after the events happened. Scholars in this out-of-the-way corner of the Hebrew University campus have been quietly at work for 53 years on one of the most ambitious projects attempted in biblical studies - publishing the authoritative edition of the Old Testament, also known as the Hebrew Bible, and tracking every single evolution of the text over centuries and millennia. **The ongoing work of the academic detectives of the Bible Project, as their undertaking is known, shows that this text at the root of Judaism, Christianity and Islam was somewhat fluid for long periods of its history, and that its transmission through the ages was messier and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:history__forbidden_archeology_suppressed_history.txt:2:b69c7ba5220c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11154, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "history__forbidden_archeology_suppressed_history.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "history__forbidden_archeology_suppressed_history", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "ambitious projects attempted in biblical studies - publishing the authoritative edition of the Old Testament, also known as the Hebrew Bible, and tracking every single evolution of the text over centuries and millennia. **The ongoing work of the academic detectives of the Bible Project, as their undertaking is known, shows that this text at the root of Judaism, Christianity and Islam was somewhat fluid for long periods of its history, and that its transmission through the ages was messier and more human than most of us imagine.** The sheer volume of information makes the Bible Project's version \"the most comprehensive critical edition of the Hebrew Bible in existence at the present time,\" said David Marcus, a Bible scholar at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, who is not involved with the project. **Gobekli Tepe: The Birth of Religion** **2011-06-01, *National Geographic*** [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/gobekli-tepe/mann-text](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/gobekli-tepe/mann-text) Every now and then the dawn of civilization is reenacted on a remote hilltop in southern Turkey. Dozens of massive stone pillars [at this site are] arranged into a set of rings, one mashed up against the next. Known as Gobekli Tepe ... the site is [made] from cleanly carved limestone pillars splashed with bas-reliefs of animals-a cavalcade of gazelles, snakes, foxes, scorpions, and ferocious wild boars. The assemblage was built some 11,600 years ago, seven millennia before the Great Pyramid of Giza. It contains the oldest known temple. Indeed, **Gobekli Tepe is the oldest known example of monumental architecture. Archaeologists are still excavating Gobekli Tepe and debating its meaning. What they do know is that the site is the most significant in a volley of unexpected findings that have overturned earlier ideas about our species' deep past.** Just 20 years ago most researchers believed they knew the time, place, and rough sequence of the Neolithic Revolution-the critical transition that resulted in the birth of agriculture, taking Homo sapiens from scattered groups of hunter-gatherers to farming villages and from there to technologically sophisticated societies with great temples and towers and kings and priests who directed the labor of their subjects and recorded their feats in written form. But in recent years multiple new discoveries, Gobekli Tepe preeminent among them, have begun forcing archaeologists to reconsider. **Note:** Other discoveries reported in BBC and elsewhere suggest civilizations on Earth much earlier than most archeologists believe. As this fascinating article indicates, the early site uncovered at Gobekli Tepe may be related to a number of newly-excavated sites in the Levant from the \"[Natufian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natufian_culture)\" period, yet archeologists are still puzzling over this one. **In Hunt for Nazis, an Incomplete History** **2010-11-14, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/14/us/14documents.html](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/14/us/14documents.html) A secret internal history of the Justice Department's Nazi-hunting unit, the Office of Special Investigations, chronicles numerous hidden chapters in the office's 31-year-existence.

It also deletes references to what American officials knew about his atrocities, including the assertion from a Justice Department officials that he might \"be guilty of acts more heinous than anyone else currently under investigation.\" [many additional examples follow] **Note:** This suppressed report contains clear evidence that top Nazi war criminals were given aliases and allowed to escape prosecution by elements both outside and inside of government.

Classical texts suggest that all its inhabitants perished when the city sank beneath the waves after suffering a disastrous combination of earthquake and tidal wave. Some scholars have speculated that the catastrophe may well have been the source of Plato's story of Atlantis, a land that supposedly suffered a similar fate. During the summer, Greek and American researchers ... began digging 3m deep trenches within an area of modern orchards and vineyards of about one square mile. **These revealed archaic walls, classical ceramic fragments and, perhaps most significantly, evidence that the ruins had been submerged beneath the sea. \"We uncovered archaic walls buried in clay containing sea shells,\" said one of the researchers, Dr Steven Soter from the American Museum of Natural History.** **Note:** Here is solid evidence of ancient manmade structures that were submerged for a period under sea water, yet now are above sea level. The evidence suggests an ancient civilization from many thousands of years ago, yet most archeologists will not entertain this idea.

The dispute involves Robert Marx, a Florida author and treasure hunter, who asserts that the Brazilian Navy dumped a thick layer of silt on the remains of a Roman vessel that he discovered inside Rio de Janeiro's bay. **The reason he gave for the Navy's action was that proof of a Roman presence would require Brazil to rewrite its recorded history, which has the Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares Cabral discovering the country in 1500.** All ... permits for underwater exploration and digging, a prolific field in Brazil, have been canceled as a result of the Marx controversy ... Navy officials said. The story goes back to 1976 when lobster divers first found potsherds studded with barnacles. Then a Brazilian diver brought up two complete jars with twin handles, tapering at the bottom, the kind that ancient Mediterranean peoples widely used for storage and are known as amphoras. According to Elizabeth Will, a professor of classics and specialist in ancient Roman amphoras at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, the jars are very similar to the ones produced at Kouass, a Roman Empire colony that was a center for amphora-making on the Atlantic coast of Morocco.

The book is ... intelligent, detailed, well-researched and credibly nuanced. The book's aim is to kill off once and for all the public-schoolboy perception of [Cecil] Rhodes as the model Englishman who selflessly deployed his vast diamond wealth to the task of civilising Southern Africa while adding, virtually single-handedly, a chunk of territory the size of Europe to Her Majesty's imperial possessions. The picture that persuasively emerges in the book [is] of a man of immense charm and demonic single-mindedness.

He beat his rivals not by fighting them but by seducing them. By bribery (Rhodes coined the expression \"every man has his price\") or sheer force of personality, or more often both, he submitted members of the British cabinet, Kruger's Boers and proud African chieftains to his colossal will. Such were his powers of persuasion that after a smallpox epidemic struck Kimberley in 1883, he prevailed upon local doctors to sign false documents declaring the outbreak to be a rare skin disease. Thus did he prevent the temporary closure of his diamond mines and thus did at least 751 people needlessly, hideously die. By the end of the book Thomas leaves us in no doubt as to Rhodes' greatness, but he concludes that it was a misdirected greatness, a story of talents squandered and opportunities lost. **Note:** Often portrayed in history books as one of the most influential men of the 19th century, Rhodes not only believed his was the superior race, in his will [he advocated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Rhodes#Death_and_legacy) \"for the establishment, promotion and development of a Secret Society, the true aim and object whereof shall be for the extension of British rule throughout the world.\" For major media reports revealing other secret societies with similar aims, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles).

Biological pathogens they developed were tested on volunteers from a pacifist church and were also released in public places. In the 1950s, the Seventh-day Adventist Church struck an extraordinary deal with the US Army. It would provide test subjects for experiments on biological weapons at the Fort Detrick research centre near Washington DC. The volunteers were conscientious objectors who agreed to be infected with debilitating pathogens. In return, they were exempted from frontline warfare.

That source of hydrocarbons seeps up through the earth's layers and slowly replenishes oil sources. In other words, it turns the fossil-fuel paradigm upside down. Thomas Gold, a respected astronomer and professor emeritus at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, has held for years that **oil is actually a renewable, primordial syrup continually manufactured by the Earth under ultrahot conditions and tremendous pressures. As this substance migrates toward the surface, it is attacked by bacteria, making it appear to have an organic origin dating back to the dinosaurs**, he says. That ... raises the tantalizing possibility that oil may not be the limited resource it is assumed to be. In 2008 ... a group of Russian and Ukrainian scientists [said] that oil and gas don't come from fossils; they're synthesized deep within the earth's mantle by heat, pressure, and other purely chemical means, before gradually rising to the surface. The idea that oil comes from fossils \"is a myth\" that needs changing according to petroleum engineer Vladimir Kutcherov, speaking at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. \"All kinds of rocks could have oil and gas deposits.\" Alexander Kitchka of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences estimates that 60 percent of the content of all oil is abiotic in origin and not from fossil fuels. **Note:** For more on this, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-source-oil-natural-gas-not-organic).

Jacques Vallee [is] the French-born computer whiz and venture capitalist who ... served as the model for Francois Truffaut's UFO-hunting character in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" He's a co-author of a newly published book, \"[Wonders in the Sky](http://www.amazon.com/Wonders-Sky-Unexplained-Objects-Antiquity/dp/1585428205/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1288990765&sr=8-1),\" that lists 500 unexplained aerial observations dating back as far as 1460 B.C. and going up to the dawn of the industrial age in 1879. About 90 percent of UFO reports turn out to have perfectly natural explanations, but Vallee says the reports that remain unexplained are provocative enough that they deserve more thoroughgoing study. Jacques Vallee: Many of the reports in our book came from professional scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries [including] two directors of the Paris Observatory. Thanks to the Internet, now we have the means to look at vast collections of records. Many of the cases, both ancient and modern, involve a number of trained people - sometimes the entire crew of an aircraft ... and official reports by pilots which in many cases involved near-collisions. There are [pilots and military people](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up) willing to talk openly about what they've seen. There is a database of over 500 reports by pilots in the first person. There are radar records, visual observations, electromagnetic observations. **All of us who have investigated this have spoken to pilots and radar operators who said that after a sighting, a couple of people in blue jeans showed up with some identification from somewhere and confiscated the tapes or the film, and they took it somewhere and no one ever saw it again. ** **Note:** The list of sightings at the end of this article from highly reliable observers reporting before humans could fly is quite intriguing.

Until about 3,500 years ago, a spectacular ancient civilisation was flourishing in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ancient Minoans were building palaces, paved streets and sewers, while most Europeans were still living in primitive huts. But around 1500BC the people who spawned the myths of the Minotaur and the Labyrinth abruptly disappeared. Now the mystery of their cataclysmic end may finally have been solved. A group of scientists have uncovered new evidence that the island of Crete was hit by a massive tsunami at the same time that Minoan culture disappeared. \"The geo-archaeological deposits contain a number of distinct tsunami signatures,\" says Dutch-born geologist Professor Hendrik Bruins. \"Minoan building material, pottery and cups along with food residue ... were mixed up with rounded beach pebbles and sea shells. \"The latter can only have been scooped up from the sea-bed by one mechanism - a powerful tsunami,\" says Professor Bruins. The scientists have obtained radiocarbon dates for the deposits that show the tsunami could have hit the coast at exactly the same time as an eruption of the Santorini volcano. It caused massive climatic disruption and the blast was heard over 3000 miles away. The [resulting] wave would have been as powerful as the one that devastated the coastlines of Thailand and Sri Lanka. The myth of Atlantis, the city state that was lost beneath the sea, was first mentioned by Plato over 2000 years ago. **Note:** So the \"myth\" of Atlantis may not have been just a myth after all. How many other myths might eventually be found to be based in fact? **Google Ocean: Has Atlantis been found off Africa?** **2009-02-20, *The Telegraph* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/4731313/Google-Ocean-Has-Atlanti...](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/4731313/Google-Ocean-Has-Atlantis-been-found-off-Africa.html) A \"grid of streets\" on the seabed at one of the proposed locations of the lost city of Atlantis has been spotted on Google Ocean.

Atlantis experts said that the unexplained grid is located at one of the possible sites of the legendary island, which was described by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. According to his account, the city sank beneath the ocean after its residents made a failed effort to conquer Athens around 9000 BC. Dr Charles Orser, curator of historical archaeology at New York State University told The Sun that the find was fascinating and warranted further inspection. The legend of Atlantis has excited the public imagination for centuries. In recent years \"evidence\" of the lost kingdom has been found off the coast of Cyprus and in southern Spain. **Note:** Many archeological finds which don't match accepted history have been suppressed and covered up.

Coral Castle, in Homestead, Fla., just south of Miami, is an intricate rock garden made of enormous pieces of coral, many of them weighing several tons. But more amazingly, Coral Castle was built entirely by one man -- Latvian immigrant Ed Leedskalnin, who stood just 5 feet tall and weighed 100 pounds. To this day, no one knows how he did it. The castle is an extraordinary feat of engineering, and experts have puzzled over how Leedskalnin, who only had a fourth-grade education, constructed Coral Castle by himself. For example, how did this little man build a 9-ton coral gate constructed so precisely that you can push it open using one finger? There are many theories on how Leedskalnin accomplished this amazing feat. **Some say he had help from extraterrestrials, others believe he discovered the secrets behind anti-gravity and levitation. Leedskalnin was a self-taught expert on magnetic currents,** and one theory holds that he positioned the site to be perfectly aligned with Earth's poles to eliminate the forces of gravity, allowing him to move stones weighing several tons each.

The media explosion turned the former Democratic presidential front-runner into a punch line and arguably hastened his campaign's free fall. It's also an instructive look at how television news and entertainment works today. \"It was totally unfair,\" said Joe Trippi, who lost his job as Dean's campaign manager in the fallout. \"I don't think there was any question about it.\" Trippi accepts that the footage was newsworthy, but he figured it was a one-day story. Instead, **CNN cable and broadcast news networks aired Dean's Iowa exclamation 633 times** **- and that doesn't include local news or talk shows -** **in the four days after it was made**, according to the Hotline, a Washington-based newsletter. \"It shouldn't be an anvil that you keep hammering to destroy his candidacy,\" Trippi said. The cable news networks ran and reran the video. They analyzed it. They ran footage of the late-night comedians joking about it. They played the instant Internet songs that sampled Dean's shout. Virtually overnight, the \"I Have a Scream\" speech became legend. **It took on such a life, said Paul Slavin, senior vice president of ABC News, that \"the amount of attention it was receiving necessitated more attention.\"** Neither Slavin nor Mark Lukasiewicz, NBC News executive producer in charge of political coverage, believe the coverage was overdone. Roger Ailes, Fox News chairman, told ABC News it was \"overplayed a bit.\" ** ** [http://www.makethemaccountable.com/podvin/media/040201_TheScream.htm](http://www.makethemaccountable.com/podvin/media/040201_TheScream.htm) (Excerpts below) ** ** ** ****The Scream** by David Podvin On December 1, 2003, **Howard Dean** was ahead by twenty points in the polls when he appeared", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:howarddeansdemise.txt:0:2d4b1e49c4d0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11165, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "howarddeansdemise.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "howarddeansdemise", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Slavin, senior vice president of ABC News, that \"the amount of attention it was receiving necessitated more attention.\"** Neither Slavin nor Mark Lukasiewicz, NBC News executive producer in charge of political coverage, believe the coverage was overdone.

It amounted to a declaration of war on the corporations that administer the flow of information in the United States. The media giants quickly responded by crushing his high-flying campaign with the greatest of ease. This time, they didn't even have to invent a scandal in order to achieve the desired result; **merely by chanting the word \"unelectable\" at maximum volume, the mainstream media maneuvered democratic voters into switching their support to someone who poses no threat to the status quo**. John Kerry is a member of a group of politicians whose disagreements with the mercantile elite tend to be merely rhetorical. Any doubts about Kerry's level of commitment to his stated progressive beliefs were answered in 1994 when he proclaimed himself \"delighted\" with the Republican takeover of Congress ([Boston Globe](http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062103.shtml), [New York Times](http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70915F83D5C0C768EDDA80894DC404482)). The media oligarchy knows that a general election race between Kerry and George W. Bush will insure a continuation of its monopoly, regardless of who wins. The news cartel had always been hostile to Dean. Independent surveys revealed that he had received the most negative coverage of any candidate except Dennis Kucinich (the only other contender who strongly favors mandatory media divestment). But after his statement on Hardball, reporting about Dean abruptly came to an end and was replaced by supposition. **By mid-December, the news divisions of the four major television networks were reporting as fact that Dean was unelectable**. The print media echoed the theme; on December 17, the *Washington Post* printed a front-page story that posited Dean could not win the presidency. The *Post* quickly followed up with an onslaught of articles and editorials reasserting that claim. Before the month was over, Dean's lack of electability had been highlighted in *The New York Times*, the Wall *Street Journal*, the *Boston Globe*, the *Chicago Tribune*, the *Los Angeles Times*, and every other major paper in the United States. As 2004 began, *Time* and *Newsweek* simultaneously ran cover stories emphasizing that Dean was unelectable.

In the weeks before the Iowa caucus, the ongoing topic of discussion on the political panel shows was that Dean was unelectable. National talk radio shows repeatedly stressed that Dean was unelectable. The corporate Internet declared that Dean was unelectable. And the mainstream media continued with the storyline that Dean was unelectable right up until Iowans attended their caucuses. **Iowa Democrats could not watch a television or listen to a radio or read a newspaper or go online without learning that Howard Dean was unelectable.** On January 19, Democratic caucus goers in Iowa - who were the initial intended audience for this propaganda disguised as reportage - overwhelmingly repudiated Dean, telling pollsters they believed he was unelectable. Later that evening, Dean yelled encouragement to his supporters at a pep rally, an incident that provided the pretext for the coup de grce. **During the week leading up to the New Hampshire primary, the media obsessed about Dean's \"bizarre\" rally incident**, adding \"un-presidential\" and \"emotionally unstable\" to its descriptions of the governor. The unified message was that Dean had self-destructed. When he finished a distant second in New Hampshire, journalists and pundits hailed the defeat as confirmation of their premise that Dean had always been unelectable. Yet there had been no tangible basis for that assertion. At the beginning of 2004, a poll conducted by *Time* magazine showed that Dean trailed Bush by only six points. That was a smaller deficit than Gore faced shortly before the general election in 2000, and he wound up getting the most popular votes. Undaunted by this evidence to the contrary, reporters adhered to the motif that Dean had absolutely no chance. **It is not what a politician does that creates a scandal. It is whether the television networks and major metropolitan newspapers respond to the incident with saturation coverage**. When a presidential candidate who was committed to deregulating the corporate media got caught lying about breaking the law, the importance of the event was minimized. When a presidential candidate who was committed to breaking up the corporate media got caught shouting at a pep rally, the importance of the event was maximized. **Howard Dean's campaign now lies in ruins because he chose to confront the multinational conglomerates that run this country.** If Dean is so resilient that he fights his way back into contention, the Fourth Estate will be ready to batter him again. In the United States of America, people who pose a threat to the reigning corporate establishment are destroyed. Or, as the Soviets used to put it, emotionally unstable individuals who deviate from the party line are guilty of engaging in \"self-destruction\".", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:howarddeansdemise.txt:2:d478e72153eb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11167, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "humananimalhybrids.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "humananimalhybrids", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Human-Animal Hybrids ** Human-Animal Hybrids** **\"In Minnesota, pigs are being born with human blood in their veins.

The respected British newspaper *The Guardian* in 2008 posted [a key story](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/apr/02/medicalresearch.ethicsofscience) on the first human/animal hybrid embryos. And a [2016 NPR article](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/08/07/489082005/the-chimera-quandary-is-it-ethical-to-create-hybrid-embryos) raises questions about the ethics involved in creating human/animal hybrids. **Scientists are experimenting with creating hybrids between humans and animals called \"chimeras\" without clear ethical guidelines.** And remember that secret military and intelligence projects are generally at least 10 years in advance of any research being done in public. In 2003 while working with the U.S. Department of State, I attended a lecture by [Dr. Michael Nelson](http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/mrn24/), a professor at Georgetown University and former science advisor to Al Gore. He described a visit deep into the bowels of the most cutting edge secret government research projects. **Describing disturbing experiments there, Dr. Nelson said he saw living matter being genetically engineered to combine with inanimate materials, such that the objects created were half-alive, with DNA giving them a form of pseudo-life. **After witnessing this highly troubling research, he said he experienced nightmares for weeks. No guidelines have been developed to monitor such activities, and most people are not even aware of these top secret experiments being conducted by the government. With proper rules and guidelines in place, science gives us many wonderful technological advances. But without these guidelines, we are treading in very dangerous territory.

Wells in which a rogue doctor develops creatures that are part animal and part human. They are real creations of real scientists, stretching the boundaries of stem cell research. Biologists call these hybrid animals chimeras, after the mythical Greek creature with a lion's head, a goat's body and a serpent's tail. They are the products of experiments in which human stem cells were added to developing animal fetuses. Chimeras are allowing scientists to watch, for the first time, how nascent human cells and organs mature and interact -- not in the cold isolation of laboratory dishes but inside the bodies of living creatures. Some are already revealing deep secrets of human biology and pointing the way toward new medical treatments. **But with no federal guidelines in place, an awkward question hovers above the work: How human must a chimera be before more stringent research rules should kick in?** The National Academy of Sciences, which advises the federal government, has been studying the issue and hopes to make recommendations by February. Yet the range of opinions it has received so far suggests that reaching consensus may be difficult. During one recent meeting, scientists disagreed on such basic issues as whether it would be unethical for a human embryo to begin its development in an animal's womb, and whether a mouse would be better or worse off with a brain made of human neurons. \"This is an area where we really need to come to a reasonable consensus,\" said James Battey, chairman of the National Institutes of Health's Stem Cell Task Force. \"We need to establish some kind of guidelines as to what the scientific community ought to do and ought not to do.\" **Beyond Twins and Moms** Chimeras (ki-MER-ahs) -- meaning mixtures of two or more individuals in a single body -- are not inherently unnatural. Most twins carry at least a few cells from the sibling with whom they shared a womb, and most mothers carry in their blood at least a few cells from each child they have born. Recipients of organ transplants are also chimeras, as are the many people whose defective heart valves have been replaced with those from pigs or cows. And scientists for years have added human genes to bacteria and even to farm animals -- feats of genetic engineering that allow those critters to make human proteins", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:humananimalhybrids.txt:1:9b325eef2963", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11169, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "humananimalhybrids.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "humananimalhybrids", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "from the sibling with whom they shared a womb, and most mothers carry in their blood at least a few cells from each child they have born.

And scientists for years have added human genes to bacteria and even to farm animals -- feats of genetic engineering that allow those critters to make human proteins such as insulin for use as medicines. **\"Chimeras are not as strange and alien as at first blush they seem,\" said Henry Greely, a law professor and ethicist at Stanford University who has reviewed proposals to create human-mouse chimeras there.** But chimerism becomes a more sensitive topic when it involves growing entire human organs inside animals. And it becomes especially sensitive when it deals in brain cells, the building blocks of the organ credited with making humans human. In experiments like those, Greely told the academy last month, \"there is a nontrivial risk of conferring some significant aspects of humanity\" on the animal. Greely and his colleagues did not conclude that such experiments should never be done. Indeed, he and many other philosophers have been wrestling with the question of why so many people believe it is wrong to breach the species barrier. Does the repugnance reflect an understanding of an important natural law? Or is it just another cultural bias, like the once widespread rejection of interracial marriage? Many turn to the Bible's repeated invocation that animals should multiply \"after their kind\" as evidence that such experiments are wrong. Others, however, have concluded that the core problem is not necessarily the creation of chimeras but rather the way they are likely to be treated. **Imagine, said Robert Streiffer, a professor of philosophy and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin, a human-chimpanzee chimera endowed with speech and an enhanced potential to learn -- what some have called a \"humanzee.\"** \"There's a knee-jerk reaction that enhancing the moral status of an animal is bad,\" Streiffer said. \"But if you did it, and you gave it the protections it deserves, how could the animal complain?\" Unfortunately, said Harvard political philosopher Michael J. Sandel, speaking last fall at a meeting of the President's Council on Bioethics, such protections are unlikely. \"Chances are we would make them perform menial jobs or dangerous jobs,\" Sandel said. \"That would be an objection.\" **A Research Breakthrough** The potential power of chimeras as research tools became clear about a decade ago in a series of dramatic experiments by Evan Balaban, now at McGill University in Montreal. **Balaban took small sections of brain from developing quails and transplanted them into the developing brains of chickens. ** **The resulting chickens exhibited vocal trills and head bobs unique to quails, proving that the transplanted parts of the brain contained the neural", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:humananimalhybrids.txt:2:5059a56bcf03", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11170, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "humananimalhybrids.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "humananimalhybrids", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "said. \"That would be an objection.\" **A Research Breakthrough** The potential power of chimeras as research tools became clear about a decade ago in a series of dramatic experiments by Evan Balaban, now at McGill University in Montreal. **Balaban took small sections of brain from developing quails and transplanted them into the developing brains of chickens. ** **The resulting chickens exhibited vocal trills and head bobs unique to quails, proving that the transplanted parts of the brain contained the neural circuitry for quail calls.** It also offered astonishing proof that complex behaviors could be transferred across species. No one has proposed similar experiments between, say, humans and apes. But the discovery of human embryonic stem cells in 1998 allowed researchers to envision related experiments that might reveal a lot about how embryos grow. The cells, found in 5-day-old human embryos, multiply prolifically and -- unlike adult cells -- have the potential to turn into any of the body's 200 or so cell types. Scientists hope to cultivate them in laboratory dishes and grow replacement tissues for patients. But with those applications years away, the cells are gaining in popularity for basic research. The most radical experiment, still not conducted, would be to inject human stem cells into an animal embryo and then transfer that chimeric embryo into an animal's womb. Scientists suspect the proliferating human cells would spread throughout the animal embryo as it matured into a fetus and integrate themselves into every organ. Such \"humanized\" animals could have countless uses. They would almost certainly provide better ways to test a new drug's efficacy and toxicity, for example, than the ordinary mice typically used today. But few scientists are eager to do that experiment. **The risk, they say, is that some human cells will find their way to the developing testes or ovaries, where they might grow into human sperm and eggs. If two such chimeras -- say, mice -- were to mate, a human embryo might form, trapped in a mouse.** Not everyone agrees that this would be a terrible result. \"What would be so dreadful?\" asked Ann McLaren, a renowned developmental biologist at the University of Cambridge in England. After all, she said, no human embryo could develop successfully in a mouse womb. It would simply die, she told the academy. No harm done. But others disagree -- if only out of fear of a public backlash. \"Certainly you'd get a negative response from people to have a human embryo trying to grow in the wrong place,\" said Cynthia B. Cohen, a senior research fellow at Georgetown University's Kennedy Institute of Ethics and a member of Canada's Stem Cell Oversight Committee, which supported a ban on such experiments there. **How Human? ** But what about experiments in which scientists add human stem cells not to an animal embryo but to an animal fetus, which has already made its", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:humananimalhybrids.txt:3:f1d6eb13f93e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11171, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "humananimalhybrids.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "humananimalhybrids", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "you'd get a negative response from people to have a human embryo trying to grow in the wrong place,\" said Cynthia B. Cohen, a senior research fellow at Georgetown University's Kennedy Institute of Ethics and a member of Canada's Stem Cell Oversight Committee, which supported a ban on such experiments there. **How Human? ** But what about experiments in which scientists add human stem cells not to an animal embryo but to an animal fetus, which has already made its eggs and sperm? Then the only question is how human a creature one dares to make. In one ongoing set of experiments, Jeffrey L. Platt at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has created human-pig chimeras by adding human-blood-forming stem cells to pig fetuses. The resulting pigs have both pig and human blood in their vessels. **And it's not just pig blood cells being swept along with human blood cells; some of the cells themselves have merged, creating hybrids.** **It is important to have learned that human and pig cells can fuse, Platt said, because he and others have been considering transplanting modified pig organs into people and have been wondering if that might pose a risk of pig viruses getting into patient's cells. Now scientists know the risk is real, he said, because the viruses may gain access when the two cells fuse.** In other experiments led by Esmail Zanjani, chairman of animal biotechnology at the University of Nevada at Reno, scientists have been adding human stem cells to sheep fetuses. The team now has sheep whose livers are up to 80 percent human -- and make all the compounds human livers make. Zanjani's goal is to make the humanized livers available to people who need transplants. The sheep portions will be rejected by the immune system, he predicted, while the human part will take root. \"I don't see why anyone would raise objections to our work,\" Zanjani said in an interview. **Immunity Advantages ** Perhaps the most ambitious efforts to make use of chimeras come from Irving Weissman, director of Stanford University's Institute of Cancer/Stem Cell Biology and Medicine. **Weissman helped make the first mouse with a nearly complete human immune system** -- an animal that has proved invaluable for tests of new drugs against the AIDS virus, which does not infect conventional mice. **More recently his team injected human neural stem cells into mouse fetuses, creating mice whose brains are about 1 percent human.** By dissecting the mice at various stages, the researchers were able to see how the added brain cells moved about as they multiplied and made connections with mouse cells. Already, he said, they have learned things they \"never would have learned had there been a bioethical ban.\" Now he wants to add human brain stem cells that have the defects that cause Parkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease and other brain ailments -- and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:humananimalhybrids.txt:4:82ba50248751", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11172, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "humananimalhybrids.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "humananimalhybrids", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "whose brains are about 1 percent human.** By dissecting the mice at various stages, the researchers were able to see how the added brain cells moved about as they multiplied and made connections with mouse cells. Already, he said, they have learned things they \"never would have learned had there been a bioethical ban.\" Now he wants to add human brain stem cells that have the defects that cause Parkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease and other brain ailments -- and study how those cells make connections. Scientists suspect that these diseases, though they manifest themselves in adulthood, begin when something goes wrong early in development. If those errors can be found, researchers would have a much better chance of designing useful drugs, Weissman said. And those drugs could be tested in the chimeras in ways not possible in patients. **Now Weissman says he is thinking about making chimeric mice whose brains are 100 percent human.** He proposes keeping tabs on the mice as they develop. If the brains look as if they are taking on a distinctly human architecture -- a development that could hint at a glimmer of humanness -- they could be killed, he said. If they look as if they are organizing themselves in a mouse brain architecture, they could be used for research. So far this is just a \"thought experiment,\" Weissman said, but he asked the university's ethics group for an opinion anyway. \"Everyone said the mice would be useful,\" he said. \"But no one was sure if it should be done.\" ** ****Note:** The original article on human-animal hybrids can be found on the *Washington Post* website on [this webpage](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63731-2004Nov19.html).

These trials are often conducted in areas with large numbers of poor and illiterate people who grant their consent by signing an \"X\" or making a thumb print on a form. The tests are rarely monitored by the FDA, and have in some cases proved deadly. 49 babies die in New Delhi, India during a 30-month trial. The cost of testing in countries without safety regulations is much lower; and, due to lax or nonexistent oversight, pharmaceutical corporations (or research companies they've contracted out to) are able to more easily suppress research that demonstrates harmful effects and only report positive results.

The GAO concluded that as much as 16 percent of the billions of dollars in FEMA help to individuals after the two hurricanes was unwarranted. FEMA paid an individual $2,358 in rental assistance, while at the same time paying about $8,000 for the same person to stay 70 nights at more than $100 per night in a Hawaii hotel.

These planners were not involved in the frantic preparations for Katrina. **By coincidence, they were working on a yearlong project to prepare federal and state officials for a Category 3 hurricane striking New Orleans.** Their fictitious storm eerily foreshadowed the havoc wrought by Category 4 Katrina a few days later, raising questions about whether government leaders did everything possible...to protect New Orleans residents from a well-documented threat. ** Gone With the Water (Hurricane Predicted Again One Year Ago) October 2004, *National Geographic*** [http://www3.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0410/feature5/](http://www3.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0410/feature5/) [http://205.188.130.53/ngm/0410/feature5/index.html](http://205.188.130.53/ngm/0410/feature5/index.html) As the whirling maelstrom approached the coast, more than a million people evacuated to higher ground. Some 200,000 remained, however-the car-less, the homeless, the aged and infirm. It took two months to pump the city dry, and by then the Big Easy was buried under a blanket of putrid sediment, a million people were homeless, and 50,000 were dead. It was the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States. When did this calamity happen? It hasn't-yet. **But the doomsday scenario is not far-fetched. \"It's not if it will happen,\" says University of New Orleans geologist Shea Penland. \"It's when.\" ** ** New Orleans is Sinking (Hurricane predicted on 9/11!!!)

We explored the thresholds of change we're in, individually and as a society. There was a deep acknowledgment of the helplessness, fear, and grief many of us feel: illness, loss, death, war, violence, diminishing trust in our institutions and leaders. Feeling this together was a profound reminder that we are not alone. The thread of humanity connects us all, no matter how different we are from each other. Community building leader and founder of Common Good Collective [Peter Block](https://www.peterblock.com/) joined our process one of the days, and stunned us all with a powerful quote. **All transformation is the welcoming of the stranger**. How do we stay open to the unfamiliar: the people, events, and ideas that are different than what we know? How do we suspend our certainty and need for answers in a time where we truly don't know where we're heading as a society? This comes at a crucial time in which we're more diverse and life is more complex than ever. Alternative media platforms, political/religious beliefs and identities, and different socio-cultural movements reveal how each of us have our own version of truth and how we see the world. At this retreat, many of us had significantly different beliefs about politics and the world. It was a humbling opportunity to learn how to be in community in real ways, where disagreements didn't divide us; they simply allowed for deeper inquiry together. We listened to each other, lowered our defenses, made new connections, paused between shares, and maintained our sense of shared humanity. *Propaganda ends where simple dialogue begins.* - Jacques Ellul, French political and social scientist How can this change the quality of conversation we have across the (often vast) differences in information, media, and ideas we consume? **And instead of waiting for (or focusing on) our world leaders to practice this, how might we practice this in our lives, expanding who we include in our circles and communities? ** In fact, I now resolve to interact with more people who don't see the world the way I do, specifically those who put their faith in official narratives about controversial issues shaping our lives.

We become blinded by our own narratives, increasingly unable to perceive the world on a wider plane, not willing to understand or empathize with the plights of others. Thus, conflict, war, exclusion, and violence occur in order to convince or conquer groups that do not perceive the world as we do. *Leaders will remain stuck in dichotomous thinking, and due to their isolation, will trigger a need to force attributes of security, familiarity and sameness unto others, to create a sort of manageability to alleviate their growing insecurity, trying to find their solace in an artificially created, simplistic universe, in stereotypes and in a static, polarized world.\"* - Henry Venter, \"Self-Transcendence: Maslow's Answer to Cultural Closeness\" During the retreat, Block shared that** the opposite of love isn't hate, it's certainty and being right.** **Answers keep us apart, and questions bring us together. ** Here were some of the questions that came up during the retreat: *How can any room I'm in be an expression of the world I want to live in?* *Who/what do I trust?* *Where are my blind spots? What am I defending myself against? * *In order to help heal the world, what needs healing in me? * The question below particularly struck me. *What's the question that, if answered, would see you free?* For me, a second question emerged after asking this question. *In order to better serve as an effective translator within our polarizing media landscape, am I willing to embrace the gifts that I am? * Doing my inner work, diversifying my views, and holding onto a sense of the greater good. These are all in my control. Much of activism seems to be focused solely on having answers about what we fear, what's going wrong, and who's to blame. Fear is a part of the human condition and shows we care. Yet it may not be useful for real societal change if it cuts us off from different people or ways of thinking, or our ability to envision a world that's more free, connected, and sensible. At PEERS, we believe that succumbing to polarization and fear enables the control regime to exert more control over our lives and the world.

And as much as the world needs your cargo, you need to give it away. Everything depends on this. But the world forgets its needs, and you forget your mission, and the ancestral maps used to guide you have become faded scrawls on the parchment of dead Pharaohs. The cargo weighs you heavy the longer it is held and spoilage becomes a risk. The ship sputters from port to port and at each you ask: \"Is this the way?\" But the way cannot be found without knowing the cargo, and the cargo cannot be known without recognizing there is a way, and it is simply this: You have gifts. The world needs your gifts. You must deliver them. The world may not know it is starving, but the hungry know, and they will find you when you discover your cargo and start to give it away.

His reputation spread far and wide, instilling fear in all who crossed the Tibetan Plateau. This fierce and fearless bandit thought nothing of assailing groups of travelers and taking and raping whatever and whoever he liked. Then, one day, he came upon a caravan that included a beautiful, spiritual woman who was the consort of a revered guru. This particular guru was known for his ability to manifest to those he met in a form that would most benefit them according to their personal needs. Apparently, the woman also had this unusual, yet powerful gift. Seeing her beauty, the bandit kidnapped and raped this devoted woman several times. Yet shortly afterward, the bandit renounced his life of violence and took up the path of a wandering monk. Over the years, he became a great healer and some say even a saint. He lived in service to all he met. When the man was old and on his death bed, someone asked him what had changed him all those years ago. He grew quiet for a moment and thought back to the rape, remembering how the woman had looked at him with such tenderness and understanding. He leaned back on his bed, closed his eyes for the last time and answered, \"It was her absolute compassion that changed me.\" When I first heard of this legend many years ago, its message spoke directly to my soul. **As a war child who carried a legacy of tremendous abuse and violence, I knew the story had something to teach me about the curative power of compassion. ** The daughter of a U.S. soldier who took a Vietnamese woman as his wife, I am one of 25,000 Amerasian children born as a direct result of this country's involvement in the Vietnam War.

My mother and I immigrated to this country when I was eight months old. The year was 1974. The war was nearing an end, and my father dropped us off in Long Beach, California. Then he left to fulfill his tour of duty. My mother had no money, no family, no way of going home, and a new babe in her arms. With little more than a third-grade education, she worked seven nights a week to support us. I will never forget the excitement I felt years later when Mother announced she had hired a woman named Gloria to take care of me. As a child so often left alone to fend for myself, a babysitter sounded like a guardian angel in the flesh - a gift, pure and simple. Nothing could have prepared me for what would actually come my way. My world suddenly turned dirty and terrifying. **For the next three years - at the hands of my caretaker Gloria - I became the victim of daily sexual perversion and brutality.** I had no power over my own body, felt no feelings save anger, and endured a near-fatal wounding of my soul. My pain and ignorance made self-destruction and abuse seem normal, even intriguing at times. Gloria made it so easy - I was the center of her universe and, in truth, she was the center of mine. I wanted love, even if I had to pay the devil in secrets. My head swirled with contradictory feelings as love became entwined with feeling bad, dirty, and shameful. I learned to leave my body during those twisted nights; it was the only way to survive. **By the time I entered puberty, rape, violence, and seduction were the ordinary components of intimacy. **At fourteen, I followed the siren call of love again. I went with John, an eighteen-year-old crush, to his house and was violently raped. Why would I, a victim of long-term sexual abuse, enter such a dangerous situation? Perhaps I was destructively repeating the pattern Gloria had started. I only remember being excited to be going home with John, hoping like any naïve fourteen-year-old to hold his hand or be kissed. I had no idea that sexual terror came in the shape of men as well as women. Now that I saw good reason to be afraid of everybody, regardless of gender, I instead became afraid of no one and nothing. Disassociation had helped me get through the first traumatic abuse with Gloria, and now it worked again - ultimately", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__blessing-in-disguise.txt:1:73e3143e7bac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11196, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__blessing-in-disguise.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__blessing-in-disguise", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "remember being excited to be going home with John, hoping like any naïve fourteen-year-old to hold his hand or be kissed.

Disassociation had helped me get through the first traumatic abuse with Gloria, and now it worked again - ultimately leading me to feel nothing at all, not during the rape, and not after. Not for a long, long time. I handled major traumas like sexual abuse, being chased by a gang member with a gun, or watching my neighborhood go up in flames when the Rodney King verdict sparked the L.A. riots with surprising ease. No one could hurt me; I could walk away from any person or situation and feel nothing. In fact, I became the hunter. I was attractive and men were everywhere.** If a man had money, respect, and an impressive pedigree - all of which I lacked and believed would keep me safe - he became my prey.** A few times, I felt something I thought of as love, but not for long. Sex, money, alcohol, and lies always tied me up into a suicidal knot of loneliness and despair. No matter who or how much I got, I was never satisfied. During those years of numbness, I saw my life in terms of absolutes: situations were always either good or bad. I now understand that life isn't really that way. Most moments generally contain a little of both. Even when I look back at some of my worst experiences, I can see beauty, love - even innocence. The universe had been blessing me all along. Some blessings were obvious, like summers spent with my sister Diana and her family, or Mother bringing home our first puppy. Even my brother Tim brought an unexpected gift when he led me to believe that meditation could give me the power to levitate. In a funny way, he turned out to be right. **I started to meditate, and slowly my spirit began to lift. I did not see flashing lights, but I did feel moments of pure joy, a flicker of hope that life could be different. I had a new secret, only this was a good one. Little by little, the heavy rock of shame I carried inside me began to dissolve. ** Then, at the age of nineteen, I met a wise and gentle woman. We talked for hours about my life and my suffering. She told me of a Tibetan prophecy that predicted a dark age of chaos, suffering, and ignorance. The prophecy stated that out of this darkness, an equal amount of light would come into the world in the form of healers. \"Such", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__blessing-in-disguise.txt:2:8b8be0c46106", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11197, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__blessing-in-disguise.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__blessing-in-disguise", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "Little by little, the heavy rock of shame I carried inside me began to dissolve. ** Then, at the age of nineteen, I met a wise and gentle woman. We talked for hours about my life and my suffering. She told me of a Tibetan prophecy that predicted a dark age of chaos, suffering, and ignorance. The prophecy stated that out of this darkness, an equal amount of light would come into the world in the form of healers. \"Such a healer is a Bodhisattva,\" she said, \"one who lives for the benefit of all other beings.\" Her words were like a lightning strike to my soul. Could this painful journey of mine have been a part of my spiritual path all along? Could my suffering be somehow linked with the spiritual development of all sentient beings? Did my sufferings contribute in some way to the evolution of the planet? I couldn't decide what to believe, but her words offered me a new way of seeing my life.** I opened to the possibility that my suffering could actually be a gift, that the harshness of the journey was proportional to the learning I could gain, and that my greatest tormentors were also my greatest teachers. **And in this I found forgiveness - both for them and for my own transgressions. Not only did this perspective help me accept and understand my past, it opened a path to an unforeseen future. Like the bandit on the plains of Tibet, my life took a deep banking turn toward a life of healing and service. My first lesson was to realize that my tendency to be judgmental, impatient, and angry only perpetuated my suffering and sent a ripple effect of suffering into the lives of those around me. Understanding this, I made my personal healing a top priority, eventually gifting myself and others who were thus freed from the burden of my unhappiness. Healing came full circle when I realized this essential truth: *suffering does not belong to me alone, and any healing forged in me is a healing for the whole*. Mindfulness practice has been a great resource in my healing. When the mind and senses become still, our body-being has a chance to come into harmony with nature as the essential self emerges. The embodiment of this quality can clearly be seen in the beautiful woman who met the bandit's savagery with compassion. Her behavior suggests a full realization of Buddhism's basic teaching: suffering exists when we attempt to secure our relationship with the \"world out there\" instead of with the \"world inside here.\" According to this teaching, **when we relinquish attachment to body, mind, and emotions, we lose the fear of death and thus transcend the primary cause of suffering and pain.** Mindfulness practice reveals the essential emptiness beneath emotions, and the impermanence of mental constructs and concepts.

Freedom from misery follows, as our higher nature - blooming with compassion for the human condition - begins to flower. Healing is, in a very real sense, a second birth, an awakening in which we engage *consciously *by going after the truth that sets us free. When I began to see my early traumas as the path of a healer in the making, a second life began. **When we re-conceive suffering as the potent contractions of the soul giving birth to a spiritual path and higher purpose, pain becomes a guide - a signal alerting us to what needs attention.** If we don't listen to pain for what it's telling us, we run the risk of going numb and distracting ourselves in any of the myriad ways readily available. In *The Power of Now, *Eckhart Tolle writes, \"...it is easier to wake up from a nightmare than an ordinary dream.\" In other words, extreme suffering provides an alarm that can awaken us from the nightmarish state in which we are separate from God. What we awaken to is a deep reservoir of wholeness that stretches far beyond what we normally see as ourselves. To realize that fullness, we need to let go of many notions and convictions, to literally die to our old concept of who we are. The fire of our suffering can actually help us to burn through to this deeper discovery. Likewise, the fire of desire and the deep pleasure of sex can draw us closer to the present moment where old wounds can be released. **Years of mindfulness practice taught me how to stay present and breathe through whatever arose on the meditation pillow - be it excruciating knee pain, extreme boredom, or angry frustration. In time, I brought this same mindfulness to lovemaking. Sex became a meditation. ** In so many ways, this practice is what finally brought me home to my body and to a healed sexual life, closing the gap in self-connection that disassociative processes had carved. I no longer had to abandon my own pleasure to an old reactive pattern. Breathing my way through it all, I discovered that awareness heals. I had always paid a price for my disconnection. Or as I see it now, I did not really pay any price but was repeatedly and lovingly reminded that **I could not be free of sexual suffering, of any suffering, by trying to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__blessing-in-disguise.txt:4:459b8ea5f6ce", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11199, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__blessing-in-disguise.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__blessing-in-disguise", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "sexual life, closing the gap in self-connection that disassociative processes had carved.

I would need to accept and integrate my sexual self in full, all of it - the pain, the learning, the Gloria, and the glory. ** For more than a decade I struggled with health complications all centered in my sexual and reproductive organs. As I moved toward greater compassion and gratitude for *all* my lovers, even the Glorias, I found my medical symptoms disappearing as if by magic. One after another I let go of my painful experiences, of the anger and guilt, of proclaiming myself Victim or Perpetrator. When I stopped coupling alcohol, even one glass of wine, with sex, I stopped getting the yeast infections that had plagued my relationships. Since then my single purpose in sexual relationship has been to unite spirit with body, to find pleasure in consciousness and consciousness in pleasure. I no longer have to abandon my sexual response or my sexual health to the old reactive patterns of seduction, fear, power, and control, of juggling who would be hunter and who hunted. Breathing my way through it all, I could love and be loved in safety, feeling ecstasy and ultimate surrender with my eyes wide open. Over the years, sexual suffering has come to me in many forms. I've been sexually attacked by women and men, humans and microorganisms, family, strangers, myself, and my own body. I now see that each of these has been a spiritual signpost saying, \"turn here; look here; walk here.\" **Suffering powerfully points us toward God by challenging us to open and stay open - to override the impulse to shut down.** Vital to the healing process is an attitude of acceptance and surrender. Indeed, suffering itself is often a clear signal that we have shut down with blame, self-condemnation, and guilt - popular detours thoroughly modeled on daytime television. When we understand this signal and trust enough to let go and open to the experience of the moment again, then we can truly begin to face the *actual *in-the-moment pain. This is when we begin to heal. This, then, is the great gift that suffering offers us: a challenge to dig deeply, to find within us an untouchable state of well-being, a place of wholeness and joy that exists independent of changing circumstances and the actions of others.

This is what I call using suffering to know God. Suffering has a way of pointing us *Home* and inviting us to let go and discover the grace and wholeness underlying it all. Seeing this again and again builds faith, a deeply lived faith that embraces fully the process of life. Rather than shutting down and disassociating in situations that are difficult, I now subtly move toward the mystical abyss of surrender and letting go. And with that movement, I feel ever more connected to God and to Truth. As Rumi said,** \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.\" **Even the most painful experience can be transformed into understanding with the eyes of compassion. Once we learn to see through the disguise of our suffering, we delight in the realization that only angels surround us. ** Note:** The above is an edited excerpt from a compilation of essays in the enlightening book *[The Marriage of Sex & Spirit](http://www.amazon.com/Marriage-Sex-Spirit-Relationships-Conscious/dp/0971088861/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-8477226-4271649?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1190483754&sr=8-1)*, edited by Geralyn Gendreau.

Stratman** From his book [*We Can Change the World*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0962856606/qid=1070134447/sr=12-1/103-2792244-8591047?tag=wanttinfo-20&v=glance&s=books) It was December 25, 1914, only 5 months into World War I. German, British, and French soldiers, already sick and tired of the senseless killing, disobeyed their superiors and fraternized with \"the enemy\" along two-thirds of the Western Front (a crime punishable by death in times of war). German troops held Christmas trees up out of the trenches with signs, \"Merry Christmas.\" \"You no shoot, we no shoot.\" Thousands of troops streamed across a no-man's land strewn with rotting corpses. They sang Christmas carols, exchanged photographs of loved ones back home, shared rations, played football, even roasted some pigs. **Soldiers embraced men they had been trying to kill a few short hours before. They agreed to warn each other if the top brass forced them to fire their weapons, and to aim high.** A shudder ran through the high command on either side. Here was disaster in the making: soldiers declaring their brotherhood with each other and refusing to fight. Generals on both sides declared this spontaneous peacemaking to be treasonous and subject to court martial. By March 1915 the fraternization movement had been eradicated and the killing machine put back in full operation. By the time of the armistice in 1918, fifteen million would be slaughtered. Not many people have heard the story of the Christmas Truce. On Christmas Day, 1988, a story in the *Boston Globe* mentioned that a local FM radio host played \"Christmas in the Trenches,\" a ballad about the Christmas Truce, several times and was startled by the effect. **The song became the most requested recording during the holidays in Boston on several FM stations.** \"Even more startling than the number of requests I get is the reaction to the ballad afterward by callers who hadn't heard it before,\" said the radio host. \"They telephone me deeply moved, sometimes in tears, asking, 'What the hell did I just hear?' \" You can probably guess why the callers were in tears. The Christmas Truce story goes against most of what we have been taught about people. It gives us a glimpse of the world as we wish it could be and says, \"This really happened once.\" It reminds us of those thoughts we keep hidden away, out of range of the TV and newspaper stories that tell us how trivial and mean human life is. It is like hearing that our deepest wishes really are true: the world really could be different. **Christmas in The Trenches - Song ** **To listen to this inspirational Christmas story in song: [click here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/audio/christmas_truce_in_the_trenches)** Words & Music by [John McCutcheon](https://www.folkmusic.com/store.html) c. 1984 **This song is based on a [true story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce) from the front lines of World War I that I've heard many times.

Only George V spared him from that fate. -- John McCutcheon** My name is Francis Toliver, I come from Liverpool. Two years ago the war was waiting for me after school. To Belgium and to Flanders, to Germany to here, I fought for King and country I love dear. 'Twas Christmas in the trenches, where the frost so bitter hung. The frozen fields of France were still, no Christmas song was sung. Our families back in England were toasting us that day, Their brave and glorious lads so far away. I was lying with my messmate on the cold and rocky ground, When across the lines of battle came a most peculiar sound. Says I, \"Now listen up, me boys!\" each soldier strained to hear, As one young German voice sang out so clear. \"He's singing bloody well, you know!\" my partner says to me. Soon, one by one, each German voice joined in harmony. The cannons rested silent, the gas clouds rolled no more, As Christmas brought us respite from the war. As soon as they were finished and a reverent pause was spent, \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\" struck up some lads from Kent. The next they sang was \"Stille Nacht,\" \"'Tis 'Silent Night,'\" says I, And in two tongues one song filled up that sky. \"There's someone coming towards us!\" the front line sentry cried. All sights were fixed on one lone figure trudging from their side. His truce flag, like a Christmas star, shone on that plain so bright, As he bravely strode unarmed into the night. Then one by one on either side walked into No Man's Land, With neither gun nor bayonet we met there hand to hand. We shared some secret brandy and wished each other well, And in a flare lit soccer game we gave 'em hell. We traded chocolates, cigarettes, and photographs from home. These sons and fathers far away from families of their own. Young Sanders played his squeezebox and they had a violin, This curious and unlikely band of men.

It was originally published in the December 14, 1982 issue of *Woman's Day* magazine. This moving story inspired the creation of [The White Envelope Project](http://www.WhiteEnvelopeProject.org), a caring nonprofit organization dedicated to developing the next generation of givers, civic leaders, and philanthropists. May this inspirational story remind us all of the true meaning of Christmas and giving during the holidays and throughout the year. **Christmas Story: For the Man Who Hated Christmas By Nancy W. Gavin** It's just a small, white envelope stuck among the branches of our Christmas tree. No name, no identification, no inscription. It has peeked through the branches of our tree for the past ten years. It all began because my husband Mike hated Christmas. Oh, not the true meaning of Christmas, but the commercial aspects of it - overspending and the frantic running around at the last minute to get a tie for Uncle Harry and the dusting powder for Grandma - the gifts given in desperation because you couldn't think of anything else. Knowing he felt this way, I decided one year to bypass the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so forth. I reached for something special just for Mike. The inspiration came in an unusual way. Our son Kevin, who was 12 that year, was on the wrestling team at the school he attended. Shortly before Christmas, there was a non-league match against a team sponsored by an inner-city church. These youngsters, dressed in sneakers so ragged that shoestrings seemed to be the only thing holding them together, presented a sharp contrast to our boys in their spiffy blue and gold uniforms and sparkling new wrestling shoes. As the match began, I was alarmed to see that the other team was wrestling without headgear, a kind of light helmet designed to protect a wrestler's ears. It was a luxury the ragtag team obviously could not afford. Well, we ended up walloping them. We took every weight class. Mike, seated beside me, shook his head sadly, \"I wish just one of them could have won,\" he said. \"They have a lot of potential, but losing like this could take the heart right out of them.\" Mike loved kids - all kids. He so enjoyed coaching little league football, baseball and lacrosse. That's when the idea for his present came. That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought an assortment of wrestling headgear and shoes, and sent them anonymously to the inner-city church. On Christmas Eve, I placed a small, white envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Mike what I had done, and that this was his gift from me. Mike's smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year. And that same", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__christmas-stories__meaning-of-christmas.txt:0:f72172a7b801", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11207, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__christmas-stories__meaning-of-christmas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__christmas-stories__meaning-of-christmas", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "baseball and lacrosse.

Mike's smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year. And that same bright smile lit up succeeding years. For each Christmas, I followed the tradition - one year sending a group of mentally handicapped youngsters to a hockey game, another year a check to a pair of elderly brothers whose home had burned to the ground the week before Christmas, and on and on. The white envelope became the highlight of our Christmas. It was always the last thing opened on Christmas morning, and our children - ignoring their new toys - would stand with wide-eyed anticipation as their dad lifted the envelope from the tree to reveal its contents. As the children grew, the toys gave way to more practical presents, but the small, white envelope never lost its allure. The story doesn't end there. You see, we lost Mike last year due to dreaded cancer. When Christmas rolled around, I was still so wrapped in grief that I barely got the tree up. But Christmas Eve found me placing an envelope on the tree. And the next morning, I found it was magically joined by three more. Unbeknownst to the others, each of our three children had for the first time placed a white envelope on the tree for their dad. The tradition has grown and someday will expand even further with our grandchildren standing to take down that special envelope. Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit will always be with us. **Note:** To see the inspiring organization that was born out of this moving Christmas story, [click here](http://www.WhiteEnvelopeProject.org). **For several other short, inspiring stories revealing the meaning of Christmas, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/i/christmas-stories/christmas_stories). ** [http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/i/christmas-stories/meaning-of-christmas&title=](http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/i/christmas-stories/meaning-of-christmas&title=) **For more inspiration: ** See our awesome collection of inspiring resources in our [Inspiration Center](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspirational).

The lack of ability to feel compassion for others and to express compassion in our communication leads to huge amounts of conflict on both personal and global levels. **Compassionate Communication, also known as Nonviolent Communication, can help break through the barriers we create with each other.** It is a practice based on [a few simple principles](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/stories/nvc.nonviolent_communication) giving us effective communication skills to foster greater harmony and joy in our lives and world. The founder of Compassionate Communication, Marshall Rosenberg, discusses in a 10-minute interview how he transformed two incredibly tense situations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with these simple communication skills.

The below summary of Compassionate Communication provides a brief, yet valuable background to help understand how you can use this simple, yet wonderful tool for transformation. With very best wishes for a transformed world, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus) **Compassionate Communication** ** By Marshall Rosenberg** Human beings the world over say they want to contribute to the well-being of others, to connect and communicate with others in loving, compassionate ways. Why then, is there so much disharmony and conflict? Setting out to find answers, I discovered that the language many of us were taught interferes with our desire to live in harmony with one another. **At an early age, most of us were taught to speak and think jackal. This is a moralistic classification idiom that labels people;** it has a splendid vocabulary for analyzing and criticizing. Jackal is good for telling people what's wrong with them: \"Obviously, you're emotionally disturbed (rude, lazy, selfish).\" The jackal moves close to the ground. It is so preoccupied with getting its immediate needs met that it cannot see into the future. Similarly, Jackal-thinking individuals believe that in quickly classifying or analyzing people, they understand them. Unhappy about what's going on, a Jackal will label the people involved, saying, \"He's an idiot\" or \"She's bad\" or \"They're culturally deprived.\" This language is from the head. It is a way of mentally classifying people into varying shades of good and bad, right and wrong. Ultimately, it provokes defensiveness, resistance, and counterattack. I also came upon a language of the heart, a form of interacting that promotes the well-being of ourselves and other people. I call this means of communicating Giraffe. **The giraffe has the largest heart of any land animal, is tall enough to look into the future, and lives its life with gentility and strength. Like-wise, Giraffe bids us to speak from the heart, to talk about what is going on for us - without judging others. In this idiom, you give people an opportunity to say yes, although you respect no for an answer.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__compassionate-communication-skills.txt:0:b28737c2a317", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11210, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__compassionate-communication-skills.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__compassionate-communication-skills", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "the well-being of ourselves and other people.

Like-wise, Giraffe bids us to speak from the heart, to talk about what is going on for us - without judging others. In this idiom, you give people an opportunity to say yes, although you respect no for an answer. Giraffe is a language of requests; Jackal is a language of demands.** By the time I identified these two languages, I had thoroughly learned Jackal. So I set out to teach myself Giraffe. What would I say, I wondered, if someone were doing something I found unpleasant and I wanted to influence him to change his behavior? Giraffes, I realized, are aware that they cannot change others. They are not even interested in changing people; rather, they are interested (italics) \"in providing opportunities for them to be willing to change.\" One way of providing such an opportunity, I decided, would be to approach the other person with a message such as: \"Please do this, but only if you can do it willingly - in a total absence of fear, guilt, or shame. If you are motivated by fear, guilt, or shame, I lose.\" **As Giraffes, we make requests in terms of what we want people to do, not what we want them to feel. All the while, we steer clear of mandates. Nothing creates more resistance than telling people they \"should\" or \"have to\" or \"must\" or \"ought to\" do something.** These terms eliminate choice. Without the freedom to choose, life becomes slave like. \"I had to do it, superior's orders\" is the response of people robbed of their free will. Prompted by directives and injunctions, people do not take responsibility for their actions. As time passed, I learned much more about Giraffes. For one thing, they do not make requests in the past. They do not say, or even think, \"How nice it would have been if you had cleaned the living room last night.\" Instead, Giraffes state clearly what they want in the present. And they take responsibility for their feelings, aware that their feelings are caused by their wants. If a mother is upset because her son's toys are strewn about the living room, she will identify her feeling: anger. She will then get in touch with the underlying want that is causing this feeling: her desire for a neat and orderly living room. She will own the anger, saying, \"I feel angry because I want the living room to be clean and instead it's a mess.\" Finally, she will ask for a different outcome: \"I'd feel so much better if you'd just put these toys away.\" **Whereas Jackals say, \"I feel angry because you... ,\" Giraffes", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__compassionate-communication-skills.txt:1:4291de6644fe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11211, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__compassionate-communication-skills.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__compassionate-communication-skills", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "her feeling: anger.

We become angry because of the thoughts we are having, not because of anything another person has done to us. Jackals, on the other hand, view others as the source of their anger. In fact, violence, whether verbal or physical, is the result of assuming that our feelings are caused not by what is going on inside us but rather by what is going on \"out there.\" In response, we say things designed to hurt, punish, or blame the person whom we imagine has hurt our feelings. Aware of this tendency, a Giraffe will conclude, \"I'm angry because my expectations have not been met.\" As Giraffes we take responsibility for our feelings. At the same time, we attempt to give others an opportunity to act in a way that will help us feel better. For example, a boy may want more respect from his father. After getting in touch with his anger over the decisions his father has been making for him, he might say: \"Please ask me if I want a haircut before making a barbershop appointment for me.\" Giraffes say what they do want; rather than what they don't want. \"Stop that,\" \"Cut it out,\" or \"Quit that\" do not inspire changed behaviors. People don't like to do a \"don't.\" Giraffes ultimately seek a connection in which each person feels a sense of well-being and no one feels forced into action by blame, guilt, or punishment: As such, Giraffe thinking creates harmony. **Stating a Request Clearly** Stating a request in simple Giraffe is a four-part process rooted in honesty: **Describe your observation ** **Identify your feeling ** **Explain the reason for your feeling in terms of your needs ** **State your request ** In describing the situation, do so without criticizing or judging. If you have come home from a busy day and your partner seems preoccupied with the newspaper, simply describe the situation: \"When I walked in the door after an especially trying day, you seemed busy reading.\" Identify your feeling: \"I feel hurt.\" State the reason for your feeling: \"I feel hurt because I would like to feel close to you right now and instead I'm feeling disconnected from you.\" Then state your request in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__compassionate-communication-skills.txt:2:8d4443b3da5b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11212, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__compassionate-communication-skills.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__compassionate-communication-skills", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "do so without criticizing or judging. If you have come home from a busy day and your partner seems preoccupied with the newspaper, simply describe the situation: \"When I walked in the door after an especially trying day, you seemed busy reading.\" Identify your feeling: \"I feel hurt.\" State the reason for your feeling: \"I feel hurt because I would like to feel close to you right now and instead I'm feeling disconnected from you.\" Then state your request in do-able terms: \"Are you willing to take time out for a hug and a few moments of sharing?\" The same process applies if your teenager has been talking on the phone for hours and you are expecting a call. Describe the situation: \"When you have the phone tied up for so long, other calls can't come through.\" Express your feeling and the reason for it: \"I'm feeling frustrated because I've been expecting to hear from someone.\" Then state your request: \"I'd like you to bring your conversation to a close.\" In a Jackal culture, feelings and wants are severely punished. People are expected to be docile, subservient to authority, slave like in their reactions, and alienated from their feelings and needs. **In a Giraffe culture, we learn to express our feelings, needs, and requests without passing judgment or attacking. We request, rather than demand.** And we are aware of the fine line of distinction between these two types of statements. In Jackal, we expect other people to prove their love for us by doing what we want. As Giraffes, we may persist in trying to persuade others, but we are not influenced by guilt. We acknowledge that we have no control over the other person's response. And we stay in Giraffe no matter what the other person says. If she or he seems upset or tense, we switch into listening, which allows us to hear the person's feelings, needs, and wishes (italics) without hearing any criticism of ourselves. Nor does a Giraffe simply say no; as Giraffes we state the need that prevents us from fulfilling the request. **Responding to a \"No\"** Responding to a refusal is a four-part process rooted in empathy: **Describe the situation ** **Guess the other person's feeling ** **Guess the reason for the feeling, together with the unmet need; then let the person verify whether you have correctly understood ** **Clarify the unmet need ** When people say no in a nasty way, what they invariably want is to protect their autonomy. They have heard a request as a demand and are saying, in effect, \"I want to do it when I choose to do it, and not because I am forced to do it.\" Sighing, sulking, or screaming can likewise reflect a desire to protect one's freedom of choice, one's need to act from a position of willingness. **If people scream at us, we", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__compassionate-communication-skills.txt:3:f594dab7d93a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11213, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__compassionate-communication-skills.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__compassionate-communication-skills", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "When people say no in a nasty way, what they invariably want is to protect their autonomy.

We listen beneath the words and hear what they are really saying - that they have a need and want to get their need met.** If a mother has asked her daughter to please do her chores and she has refused, the Giraffe dance may go something like this: **Parent:** Are you feeling annoyed right now because you want to do your chores at your own pace rather than being forced to do them? **Child:** Yeah, I'm sick and tired of being a slave. [Note the defensive mode, indicating a need to be listened to.] **Parent:** So, you really want to do things when it feels good to do them, and you're not just avoiding them altogether? **Child:** You order me around! [The child still needs to be listened to. The parent must keep guessing what the child is saying about feelings and wants.] **Parent:** So, it's frustrating when I seem to be ordering you around and you have no choice about when to do your chores? **Child:** I don't want to do chores! They're stupid. If you want them done, you do them. **Parent:** You really hate doing chores and you would like me to do all of them? **Child:** Yeah... no... I don't know. I just don't feel like being bossed around. (The child is becoming vulnerable and starting to open up because she's feeling heard without judgment.) If we have been Jackalish and demanding in the past, the people close to us may need a lot of empathy at first. So we listen and listen, reflecting back with guesses about what they are feeling and wanting, until they feel heard and shift out of being defensive. **We don't take anything personally, for we know that upset, attacking, defensive statements are tragic expressions of unmet needs. **At some point, the person's voice and body language will indicate that a shift has occurred. At a meeting I attended at a mosque in a refugee camp near Jerusalem, a man suddenly stood up and cried, \"Murderer!\" As a Giraffe, all I heard was \"Please!\" - that is, I heard the pain, the need that wasn't being met. That is where I focused my attention. After about 40 minutes of speaking, he did what most of us do when we sense we have been accurately heard and listened to: he changed.

The situation was immediately defused of all tension. He later invited me to dinner. **In international disputes, as well as in relationship, business, classroom, and parent-child conflicts, we can learn to hear the human being behind the message, regardless of how the message is framed. We can learn to hear the other person's unmet needs and requests. Ultimately, listening empathically does not imply doing what the person wants; rather, it implies showing respectful acknowledgment of the individual's inner world. As we do that, we move from the coercive language we have been taught to the language of the heart.** Speaking from the heart is a gesture of love; giving other people an opportunity to contribute to our well-being and to exercise generosity. Empathically receiving what is going on in others is a reciprocal gesture. Giraffes experience love as openness and sensitivity, with no demands, criticism, or requirements to fulfill requests at either end of a dispute. And the outcome of any dialogue ruled by love is harmony. In the end, Jackals are simply illiterate Giraffes. Once you've learned to hear the heart behind any message, you discover that there's nothing to fear in anything another person says. With that discovery, you are well on your way to compassionate communication. This form of dialogue, although offering no guarantees of agreement between disputing parties, sets the stage for negotiation, compromise, and most importantly, mutual understanding and respect. **Note: **For another excellent, inspiring essay which lays out the principles of Compassionate Communication, also known as Nonviolent Communication, [click here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/stories/nvc.nonviolent_communication).

Even fewer know that Damanhur's visionary founder Falco, who founded the community in the late 1970s, transitioned after a three-month journey with cancer on June 23, 2013. **I personally spent a total three memorable weeks over the course of two visits to this amazing community in the summers of 2016 and 2017. I was deeply impressed not only with the astounding beauty of these inspiring underground temples, but also with the dedication and vibrance of the many community members I met.** Their philosophy based on continual transformation of both the individual and all of humanity towards ever greater love and interconnectedness deeply resonated with me. This is the most impressive of the many groups I've learned about working to create an entirely new way of living in our world. I hope to return again to spend more time interacting with these great people. **Scroll down to see the incredible beauty and vibrance of these underground Temples of Humankind and read about their secret history and construction,** as reported in the UK's popular *Daily Mail*.

Peppered with medieval villages, the hillside scenery is certainly picturesque. But it is deep underground, buried into the ancient rock, that the region's greatest wonders are concealed. Hall of the Earth: An amazing room built on the 'supernatural' visions of its creator Falco Here, 100ft down and hidden from public view, lies an astonishing secret - one that has drawn comparisons with the fabled city of Atlantis and has been dubbed 'the Eighth Wonder of the World' by the Italian government. For weaving their way underneath the hillside are nine ornate temples, on five levels, whose scale and opulence take the breath away. Constructed like a three-dimensional book, narrating the history of humanity, they are linked by hundreds of metres of richly decorated tunnels and occupy almost 300,000 cubic feet - Big Ben is 15,000 cubic feet.

Light fantastic: The giant glass dome of the Hall of Mirrors Play time: Children look happy in the amazing surroundings **Few have been granted permission to see these marvels. Indeed, the Italian government was not even aware of their existence until a few years ago.** But the 'Temples of Damanhur' are not the great legacy of some long-lost civilisation, they are the work of a 57-year-old former insurance broker from northern Italy who, inspired by a childhood vision, began digging into the rock. It all began in the early Sixties when Oberto Airaudi was aged ten. From an early age, he claims to have experienced visions of what he believed to be a past life, in which there were amazing temples. Around these he dreamed there lived a highly evolved community who enjoyed an idyllic existence in which all the people worked for the common good. More bizarrely still, Oberto appeared to have had a supernatural ability: the gift of \"[remote viewing](https://www.WantToKnow.info/remoteviewing/remote-viewing)\" - the ability to travel in his mind's eye to describe in detail the contents of any building. \"My goal was to recreate the temples from my visions,\" he says. Oberto - who prefers to use the name 'Falco' - began by digging a trial hole under his parent's home to more fully understand the principals of excavation. Breathtaking: The miles of tunnels enable air to circulate House of secrets Below this house is the Damanhurian temple which is one of the largest temple complexes in the world But it was only as he began a successful career as an insurance broker that he began to search for his perfect site. In 1977, he selected a remote hillside where he felt the hard rock would sustain the structures he had in mind. A house was built on the hillside and Falco moved in with several friends who shared his vision. Using hammers and picks, they began their dig to create the temples of Damanhur - named after the ancient subterranean Egyptian temple meaning City of Light - in August 1978. As no planning permission had been granted, they decided to share their scheme only with like-minded people. **Volunteers, who flocked from around the world, worked in four-hour shifts for the next 16 years with no formal plans other than Falco's sketches and visions, funding their scheme by setting up small businesses to serve the local community.** By 1991, several of the nine chambers were almost complete with stunning murals, mosaics, statues, secret", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__damanhur-temples-of-humankind.txt:1:5427543fead3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11218, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__damanhur-temples-of-humankind.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__damanhur-temples-of-humankind", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "meaning City of Light - in August 1978.

But time was running out on the secret. Hall of Spheres: Creator Oberto Airaudi based his creation on wonderful visions Bright window: The window decorations have a church-stained window theme The first time the police came it was over alleged tax evasion and still the temples lay undiscovered. But a year later the police swooped on the community demanding: \"Show us these temples or we will dynamite the entire hillside.\" Falco and his colleagues duly complied and opened the secret door to reveal what lay beneath. **Three policemen and the public prosecutor hesitantly entered, but as they stooped down to enter the first temple - named the Hall of the Earth (see [first photo](https://www.WantToKnow.info/i/damanhur-images/damanhur-hallmirrors800x364.jpg) above) - their jaws dropped.** Inside was a circular chamber measuring 8m in diameter. A [central sculpted column](https://www.WantToKnow.info/i/damanhur-images/damanhur-hallmirrors3-228x448.jpg), depicting a three dimensional man and woman, supported a ceiling of intricately painted glass. Hall of mirrors: The hall has a classical Greek feel Egyptian wall paintings: Damanhurian art is greatly influenced by both Egyptian and Celtic styles The astonished group walked on to find sculpted columns covered with gold leaf, more than 8m high. Stunned by what they had found, the authorities decided to seize the temples on behalf of the government. \"By the time they had seen all of the chambers, we were told to continue with the artwork, but to cease further building, as we had not been granted planning permission,\" says Esperide Ananas, who has written a new book called [*Damanhur, Temples Of Humankind*](http://www.amazon.com/Damanhur-Temples-Humankind-Silvia-Buffagni/dp/1556435770/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1372457091&sr=8-1&keywords=Damanhur%3A+Temples+of+Humankind). Retrospective permission was eventually granted and today the 'Damanhurians' even have their own university, schools, organic supermarkets, vineyards, farms, bakeries and award-winning eco homes. They do not worship a spiritual leader, though their temples have become the focus for group meditation. **\"They are to remind people that we are all capable of much more than we realise and that hidden treasures can be found within every one of us once you know how to access them,\" says Falco.** **More on Damanhur:** Explore [the website](http://www.damanhur.org/) of the Federation of Damanhur.

Despite what appears to being going on in the world around you, how loving and harmonious are your personal relationships? Remember that the world is your mirror. It casts back at you the reflection of that which you have projected into it.** How many arguments do you find yourself engaging in? Is there bitterness and acrimony within the ranks? Do you look at others and think about how you would like to change them? Or do you love them and accept them as they are? Loving and accepting someone for who they are is known as unconditional love. **Loving and accepting someone as they are does not mean accepting abusive behavior. But it does mean loving and accepting the person (soul), not the person's behavior. The behavior is not who they really are. The soul within is who they are.** The quality of your relationships is an excellent mirror from which to gauge the quality of your output, or in other words, that which you are creating. Do you look at a person and concentrate, to a greater or lesser extent, upon the things that you dislike about them and wish would change, or the qualities that you like and admire in them? Remember that all thought, word, and deed is creative. You get back what you send out. So when you send out the thought \"Why is she so hard to live with?\" or \"Why is he always behaving like this?\", ask yourself, what exactly are you doing? Now focus here, as this is so obvious you could miss it. And in fact, most do. Take away the question from your sentence and essentially you are saying: \"She is so hard to live with\" and \"He is always behaving like this\". Do you see what you are doing? You have just created the very behaviour in that person that you wish to change simply because you do not understand the law of radiation and attraction.** Remember,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__external-reflects-internal.txt:0:de2e0475e47d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11221, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__external-reflects-internal.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__external-reflects-internal", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "you doing?

You have just created the very behaviour in that person that you wish to change simply because you do not understand the law of radiation and attraction.** Remember, all thought is creative.** Now try an experiment: Take someone in your life that you love, but sometimes have trouble getting along with. Think about the thoughts you have projected about that person - the negative thoughts. Ask yourself, does the behavior that you do not like in that person in any way correspond to the thoughts you've been having about them? If you're honest with yourself, it's a strong bet that it does. Sure, they must have behaved that way in the first place to make you notice that you didn't like it, but we all have off days sometimes. The more you focus on that behavior, the more you are going to see of it. It's just life doing what it does and conforming to your expectations about the way it will be for you. Now having recognized this, what will you do about it? **Simply notice your negative thoughts as they arise. Literally \"catch yourself\" as you are having them. And then change your perspective.** Focus instead on the things you like about this person: how you love their smile, the sound of their happy laughter; the way they do such and such nice thing, how helpful and loving they can be. Keep putting those positive thoughts out. Persevere, as you may have a bit of negative work to undo first, but just keep catching yourself and focusing on the positive. Then prepare yourself for an almost magical transformation of your circumstances. **Always monitor your thoughts and pay attention to their quality, because what you think about is directly related to what you will see around you, and what life will show you. That is the difference between conscious and subconscious creation. ** ** Note:** The above is an excerpt from the highly intriguing [Hidden Hand material](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_bloodlines#external). **Gratitude ** This life principle is based on the understanding that the universe represents a collective intelligence that can be personalized as a single universal soul - a composite expression of the Divine. Thus, in this perspective, there are only two souls in the entire cosmos: the individual soul and the universal soul. Inasmuch as the individual is impressionable and constantly changing to adapt to new information, so is the universal soul, which is a dynamic, living template of potential energies and experiences that are coherent and as knowable as a friend's personality and behavior.

Inasmuch as the individual is impressionable and constantly changing to adapt to new information, so is the universal soul, which is a dynamic, living template of potential energies and experiences that are coherent and as knowable as a friend's personality and behavior. The universal soul is responsive to the individual soul and its beliefs and perceptions. It is like a composite omni-personality that is imbued with divine intelligence and responds to the perceptions and belief systems of the individual like a pool of water mirrors the image that overshadows it. **Everyone is indeed, at their innermost core, a sovereign soul that can transform themselves into an instrument of divine essence.** However, this transformation is dependent on whether the individual chooses to project an image of divine essence upon the \"mirror\" of the universal soul, or to project a lesser image that is a distortion of its essential state of being. The principle of gratitude is primarily concerned with consciously designing your self-image through an appreciation of the universal soul's supportive mirror. In other words, the universal soul is a partner in shaping reality's expression in your life. If you choose to project a transformed image upon the mirror of the universal soul, reality gradually becomes an internal process of creation that is increasingly free of external controls and conditions. This process involves an interchange of supportive energy between the individual and the universal soul. This energy is best applied through an appreciation of how perfect and exacting this interchange occurs in every moment of life. If you are aware - or at least interested in having the awareness - of how perfectly the Divine, as expressed in the form of the universal soul, supports your sovereign reality, there is a powerful and natural sense of gratitude that flows from you to the Divine. **It is this wellspring of gratitude that opens wide the channel of support from the Divine to the individual and establishes a collaboration of purpose to transform the individual soul into a pure expression of divine essence. ** It is principally gratitude - which arises naturally through appreciation of how the relationship between the individual and the universal soul operates - that opens you to connection with your divine essence, and to your eventual transformation into the state of perception and expression of divine essence. The relationship of the individual with the universal soul is essential to cultivate and nurture, because this relationship, more than anything else, determines how accepting each individual is of life's myriad forms and manifestations. When you accept changes in your sovereign reality as the shifting persona of the universal soul, you live in greater harmony with life itself.

When you accept changes in your sovereign reality as the shifting persona of the universal soul, you live in greater harmony with life itself. Life becomes an exchange of energy between you and the universal soul that is allowed to play out without judgment, and is experienced without fear. **This is the underlying meaning of unconditional love: to experience life in all its manifestations as a single, unified intelligence that responds perfectly to the projected image of each soul. ** It is for this reason that when you project gratitude, regardless of circumstance or condition, life becomes increasingly supportive in opening you to further awakening your sacred intentions. This feeling of gratitude coupled with the mental concept of appreciation is expressed like an invisible message in all directions and at all times. In this particular context, gratitude is the overarching motive behind all forms of expression to which humanity aspires. Every breath, every word, every touch, every thought is centered on expressing this sense of gratitude; a gratitude that you are sovereign and supported by a universal soul that expresses itself through all forms and manifestations of life with the sole objective of creating the ideal reality to fully awaken your sacred intentions and to transform your entire being into divine essence. It is this specific form of gratitude that accelerates the awakening of your sacred intentions and their inherent ability to integrate your body, mind, heart, and soul, and to transform your ability to perceive and express from the place of [divine essence](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers). Time is the primary factor that distorts the otherwise clear connection between the individual and the Divine. Time establishes separation of experience. This creates doubt in the Divine's system of fairness and overarching purpose. This doubt, in turn, creates fear that the universe is not a mirror but rather a chaotic, whimsical energy. Time intervenes to create pockets of despair, hopelessness, and abandonment. However, it is these very \"pockets\" that often motivate awakening the sacred intentions of your soul, as they cause you to seek a more intimate and harmonious relationship with the Divine. When you choose to align with divine essence and to live from this perspective as part of an ever-unfolding reality, you attract a natural state of harmony. This does not necessarily mean that your life is without problems or discomforts; rather it signifies a perception that there is an integral purpose in what life reveals. In other words, **life experience is meaningful to the extent that you choose to live in natural harmony with the multidimensional aspects", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__external-reflects-internal.txt:3:821b5136d66d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11224, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__external-reflects-internal.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__external-reflects-internal", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "with the Divine.

I'm particularly excited to share two real game-changers here, one about telepathy among autistic non-speakers and another with astounding information on remote viewing and disclosure of mind-boggling information about UFOs and ETs. **The Telepathy Tapes** I have been incredibly inspired over the last two weeks listening to all 10 one-hour episodes of The Telepathy Tapes. The host Ky Dickens describes how she embarked on a heart and mind-bending journey into the mysterious world of telepathy in non-speaking individuals with autism. She features personal stories and expert interviews, uncovering a phenomenon she never thought possible. Through a mix of personal anecdotes, scientific exploration, and interviews with experts like Dr. Diane Hennessy Powell, a Johns Hopkins-trained neuropsychiatrist, she unpacks the mysterious connection between parents and their non-speaking children who seemingly can read minds. The first episode takes you on a journey across the globe, meeting families who have experienced this phenomenon firsthand. These interviews bring listeners into a world where telepathy may not just be possible, but commonplace. This opens up a conversation about the potential of the human mind that mainstream science has largely ignored, inviting us to reconsider everything we thought we knew about communication and consciousness. So inspiring!!! And as word of this spreads rapidly, this has the potential to be a profoundly inspiring game-changer. I can't recommend these interviews highly enough. You can find the first episode at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxLpiSuvOJk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxLpiSuvOJk) All 10 episodes can be found at [https://www.youtube.com/@TheTelepathyTapes](https://www.youtube.com/@TheTelepathyTapes) **Joe Rogan interviews Hal Putoff, co-founder of Stanford Research Institute's Project Stargate** Back in June of 2001, I was stunned, shocked, and very excited for the first time to learn about what to me was undeniable evidence that UFOs were real, that ETs have visited and are visiting our world, and that ET craft have crashed and been recovered in extremely highly classified secret government programs. I compiled and posted on the Internet the best of this evidence in a [10-page document](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufocover-up10pg) with links provided for verification. Since then, that webpage has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times and shared around 50,000 times. Yet at the time, most of my friends honestly thought I was going crazy. Only a very few were willing to seriously look at the evidence I had compiled. Well times have really changed, especially after a 2017 [front page article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/unidentified-flying-object-navy.html) in the *New York Times* featured an undeniable US Navy sighting and a secret Pentagon project on the topic. Since then, high level military and intelligence officials like David Grusch (who was charged with giving the president daily briefs) have given [many hours of testimony](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/27/1190390376/ufo-hearing-non-human-biologics-uaps) to the US Congress about downed UFO craft, recovered", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__game-changers-two.txt:0:75dae23c96a3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11226, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__game-changers-two.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__game-changers-two", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "a very few were willing to seriously look at the evidence I had compiled.

You can now find an abundance of easily verifiable information about this on the Internet. The real game-changer for me is the May 1st Joe Rogan interview I just watched with renowned physicist Hal Putoff, who co-founded the [remote viewing project](https://www.wanttoknow.info/remoteviewing/remote-viewing) at Stanford Research Institute in 1972. The existence of this project was officially denied for decades until the government finally declassified many documents on the program in 1995. As a skeptical, but not closed minded physicist, Putoff has for decades been the go-to man for many top-secret programs investigating anomalous phenomena working with top experts in the Pentagon, CIA, and more. In Rogan's interview, Putoff shares an abundance of incredible experiences that will blow your mind. As just one example, he reveals that an amendment to the National Defence Authorization Act calls for open disclosure of the UFO/UAP phenomenon and mentions non-human intelligence 22 times. You can read the amendment on the website of the US Congress at [this link](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/senate-amendment/2610/text). If you're ready to expand your view of reality, I highly recommend this fascinating, game-changing interview. It's almost three hours, yet gets deeper and more intriguing as it goes on. Enjoy!

This term refers to investments made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to generate a measurable, beneficial social or environmental impact alongside a financial return. At its core, impact investing is about an alignment of an investor's beliefs and values with the allocation of capital to address social and/or environmental issues. The return on your investment generally ranges from about 1 to 5%, but the social return is huge. I've had almost all of my funds invested this way for years, and I can tell you without doubt that though I've had an average return just above the rate of inflation, I've helped tens of thousands of families around the world to pull out of poverty. I've had my funds with Calvert Impact Capital at [https://calvertimpact.org](https://calvertimpact.org), though there are numerous others.

[ABC News reported](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=4393377&page=1) that in 2002, \"dressed only in a swimsuit, he dove under the ice at the North Pole and earned a Guinness World Record for the longest amount of time swimming under the ice: 80 meters [262 feet].\" Scientists have closely studied this unusual Dutchman and verified that he has the highly rare ability to stay submerged in ice water for over an hour without significantly lowering his core body temperature. **The tragic death of Wim Hof's wife at an young age initially sent him spiraling deep into depression. Yet as a single father of four young children, he knew he had to carry on. His experiments immersing his body in ever more challenging frigid environments eased the depression and helped him to cope with his misfortune.** Out of this incredibly adversity was born the iceman. Yet possibly the most awesome thing about Wim Hof is that he says \"What I do, anybody can do.\" Hof claims he has found and refined an untapped evolutionary potential that lies hidden inside every human body. If fact, through a combination of meditation, breathwork, and more, he has trained many dozens to do feats most people believe to be impossible.

Ten new patients were admitted and Nurse Susan spent the morning and afternoon checking them in. Her friend Sharron, an aide, prepared ten rooms for the patients and made sure they were comfortable. After they were finished she grabbed Sharron and said, \"We deserve a break. Let's go eat.\" Sitting across from each other in the noisy cafeteria, Susan noticed Sharron absently wiping the moisture off the outside of her glass with her thumbs. Her face reflected a weariness that came from more than just a busy day. \"You're pretty quiet. Are you tired, or is something wrong?\" Susan asked. Sharron hesitated. However, seeing the sincere concern in her friend's face, she confessed, \"I can't do this the rest of my life, Susan. I have to find a higher-paying job to provide for my family. We barely get by. If it weren't for my parents keeping my kids, well, we wouldn't make it.\" **Susan noticed the bruises on Sharron's wrists peeking out from under her jacket.** \"What about your husband?\" \"We can't count on him. He can't seem to hold a job. He's got . . . problems.\" \"Sharron, you're so good with patients, and you love working here. Why don't you go to school and become a nurse? There's financial help available, and I'm sure your parents would agree to keep the kids while you are in class.\" \"It's too late for me, Susan; I'm too old for school. I've always wanted to be a nurse, that's why I took this job as an aide; at least I get to care for patients.\" \"How old are you?\" Susan asked. \"Let's just say I'm thirty-something.\" **Susan pointed at the bruises on Sharron's wrists. \"I'm familiar with 'problems' like these.

Honey, it's never too late to become what you've dreamed of. Let me tell you how I know.\"** Susan began sharing a part of her life few knew about. It was something she normally didn't talk about, only when it helped someone else. \"I first married when I was thirteen years old and in the eighth grade.\" Sharron gasped. \"My husband was twenty-two. I had no idea he was violently abusive. We were married six years and I had three sons. One night my husband beat me so savagely he knocked out all my front teeth. I grabbed the boys and left. \"At the divorce settlement, the judge gave our sons to my husband because I was only nineteen and he felt I couldn't provide for them. The shock of him taking my babies left me gasping for air. To make things worse, my ex took the boys and moved, cutting all contact I had with them. \"Just like the judge predicted, I struggled to make ends meet. I found work as a waitress, working for tips only. Many days my meals consisted of milk and crackers. The most difficult thing was the emptiness in my soul. I lived in a tiny one-room apartment and the loneliness would overwhelm me. I longed to play with my babies and hear them laugh.\" **She paused. Even after four decades, the memory was still painful. Sharron's eyes filled with tears as she reached out to comfort Susan. Now it didn't matter if the bruises showed.** Susan continued, \"I soon discovered that waitresses with grim faces didn't get tips, so I hid behind a smiling mask and pressed on. I remarried and had a daughter. She became my reason for living, until she went to college. \"Then I was back where I started, not knowing what to do with myself - until the day my mother had surgery. I watched the nurses care for her and thought: I can do that. The problem was, I only had an eighth-grade education. Going back to high school seemed like a huge mountain to conquer. I decided to take small steps toward my goal. The first step was to get my GED. My daughter used to laugh at how our roles reversed. Now I was burning the midnight oil and asking her questions.\" **Susan paused and looked directly in Sharron's eyes. \"I received my diploma when I was forty-six years old.\"** Tears streamed down Sharron's cheeks.

Here was someone offering the key that might unlock the door in her dark life. \"The next step was to enroll in nursing school. For two long years I studied, cried and tried to quit. But my family wouldn't let me. I remember calling my daughter and yelling, 'Do you realize how many bones are in the human body, and I have to know them all! I can't do this, I'm forty-six years old!' But I did. Sharron, I can't tell you how wonderful it felt when I received my cap and pin.\" Sharron's lunch was cold, and the ice had melted in her tea by the time Susan finished talking. Reaching across the table and taking Sharron's hands, Susan said, \"You don't have to put up with abuse. Don't be a victim - take charge. You will be an excellent nurse. We will climb this mountain together.\" **Sharron wiped her mascara-stained face with her napkin. \"I had no idea you suffered so much pain. You seem like someone who has always had it together.\"** \"I guess I've developed an appreciation for the hardships of my life,\" Susan answered. \"If I use them to help others, then I really haven't lost a thing. Sharron, promise me that you will go to school and become a nurse. Then help others by sharing your experiences.\" Sharron promised. In a few years she became a registered nurse and worked alongside her friend until Susan retired. Sharron never forgot her colleague or the rest of her promise. Now Sharron sits across the table taking the hands of those who are bruised in body and soul, telling them, \"It's never too late. We will climb this mountain together.\" © 2002 by Linda Carol Apple This story is published in [*Chicken Soup for the Soul: Living Your Dreams*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/075730138X/qid=1117250894/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-1222077-0576601?tag=wanttinfo-20&v=glance&s=books&n=507846) **Note:** For an inspiring two-page essay on transforming from victim to creator, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/victim_or_creator_vs).

Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it now. ~ Goethe Well hidden in all the busyness and craziness of our world, an exciting paradigm shift is seeping through the cracks making itself apparent to all who have the eyes to see. **Possibly the **single **most important action you can take to help this shift to a new paradigm based on love and empowerment is to get clear on your purpose and intentions in life**, and to then live that purpose and follow those intentions to the very best of your ability. Life purpose is a single statement of deep meaning about a person's reason for being. Life intentions provide direction for moving through specific challenges which can arise in any moment. Life purpose can be extremely useful for keeping ourselves on track in life from the larger perspective, while life intentions can give us direction at key choice points with which we are presented.

Each individual on Earth is exploring in a physical body new ways of experiencing life. Through this process of discovery, each of us is developing a deeper level of understanding of life and a greater ability to express our unique essence. Profound life transformation is initiated by the realization that you are capable of connecting with All That Is, that you and all of us have direct access to the divine. This is the realization that the collective wisdom of the All That Is can be discovered deep within your own consciousness. There is a wide range of means that can facilitate self-mastery through personal transformation and disengage consciousness from external controls. Inasmuch as the means may vary, the intent behind the means is quite narrowly defined as the intent to expand into a state of integration whereby all aspects of your conscious self become increasingly aligned with your divine essence. **There are three particular principles that help to align your perspective with the perspective of divine essence and thus inspire profound life transformation. They are: 1) seeing the divine spark in all; 2) nurturance of life; and 3) gratitude.** When you apply these principles, a deeper meaning will be revealed to the seemingly random events of your life experience. **Seeing the Divine Spark in All** This is the principle that the divine is present and can be seen everywhere and in all manifestations of life. It is interwoven in all things like an intricate mosaic whose pieces adhere to the same wall, and are thus unified. However, it is not the picture that unifies the mosaic, but the underlying wall upon which its pieces adhere. Similarly, the divine paints a picture so diverse and seemingly unrelated that there appears to be no unification. Yet it is not the outward manifestations that unify. It is the inward center of divine energy upon which the pieces of diversity are layered that unifies all life. This centerpiece of divine energy is the collective storehouse of all life within the universe. It is the full expression of the divine, which invests itself in all forms through the projection of its divine intelligence into all manifestations", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__life_transformation.txt:0:5e114cd535a7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11241, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__life_transformation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__life_transformation", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "so diverse and seemingly unrelated that there appears to be no unification.

This centerpiece of divine energy is the collective storehouse of all life within the universe. It is the full expression of the divine, which invests itself in all forms through the projection of its divine intelligence into all manifestations of life. Thus, divine intelligence - acting as an extension of the divine - is the unifying energy that is the \"wall\" upon which all the pieces of life's mosaic adhere. **Seeing the divine spark in all is the principle that all manifestations of life convey an expression of All That Is.** It does not matter how far the unifying energy has been distorted or corrupted; the divine can be observed. It is the action of perceiving the unification of energy even when the outward manifestations appear random, distorted, or chaotic. It is the realization that all life flows from one divine energy source that links all to One and one to All. When every manifestation of life can be genuinely perceived as a fragmentary expression of All That Is, the vibration of equality that underlies all life becomes perceptible to you. You realize that life initially emerges as an extension of the divine, and then, as an individuated energy frequency invested within a form. This individuated energy vibrates, in its pure, timeless state, precisely the same for all manifestations of life. This is the common ground that all life shares. This is the tone or vibration of equality that can be observed within all life forms that unifies all expressions of diversity to the very foundation of existence. If you are able to look upon any and all forms of life with the outlook of equality, then you are seeing the divine spark in all. **While this may seem like an abstract concept, it is actualized through the practice of looking for both the outward and inward manifestations of the divine. In a very real sense, you expect to observe the workings of divine intelligence in every facet of your experience. ** The principle of seeing the divine spark in all is the unassailable expectation that everything is in its rightful position, performing its rightful function, and serving its purpose to activate the fullest expression of its life in the present moment. It is the outlook that all life is in a state of optimal realization and experience regardless of condition or circumstance. It is the perception that life is perfect in its expression because it flows from perfection, and that no matter how divergent its manifestations are, all life is an extension of the divine.

It is the outlook that all life is in a state of optimal realization and experience regardless of condition or circumstance. It is the perception that life is perfect in its expression because it flows from perfection, and that no matter how divergent its manifestations are, all life is an extension of the divine. In light of the obvious turmoil and destruction that are apparent on Earth, this is an outlook or perception that may seem naive. How can life - in all its forms and expressions - be perceived as optimal or perfect? This is the great paradox of life, and it cannot be reconciled with your mental or emotional capabilities. It can only be understood in the context of the soul, which is deathless, timeless, limitless, and sovereign. Paradoxes exist because the human drama is too limited in scope and scale to allow a perception of wholeness to illuminate how the pieces of the puzzle are perfectly interconnected in the ever-unfolding divine cosmic dance. The human drama is circumscribed by the dimensions of time and space and the elements of energy and matter. It is played out upon the stages of survival and dysfunctional behavior because of the methods of controlling information and manipulating conditions used by those operating within the [hierarchical paradigm](https://www.weboflove.org/divinewisdomunderstanding). The soul within the human body is largely unexpressed and underutilized in this human drama, and therefore, life's apparent perversions and imperfections are seen in isolation as impediments to perfection rather than perfection itself. Life is perfect in its resolve to expand and express an intelligence that is limitless. This is the fundamental purpose of life in all its diverse manifestations. The presence of the divine expressing itself as a vibration of equality can be seen in all things. Sensory input derived from the human body is limited to frequencies in specific ranges that only convey an echo of this divine vibration. **The divine resonance of all life is understood only through deliberate and focused contemplation of the equality inherent in all things, and through the ability to penetrate beyond the image of a thing to the origin of the image. **Calling forth the divine perceptions of the soul within your own being is the ideal method to access lasting sensitivity to the divine vibration. This is how you develop the ability to see the divine spark in all. It is not only that the divine is found within you and within every individual manifestation of life; it is also in itself the wholeness of all life.

It is not only that the divine is found within you and within every individual manifestation of life; it is also in itself the wholeness of all life. Thus, this principle calls for seeing the divine spark in all its diverse forms of manifestation, as well as in the wholeness of life itself. These insights stimulate a new sensory system beyond the five senses that rule the physical world. These new senses are an outgrowth of the awakening of your sacred intentions. They are manifestations of the first stage of profound personal transformation. **With this new perceptual ability, you will be capable of sensing not only the presence of the divine, but also the timeless divine essence that exists at the core of every living being. ** **Nurturance of Life** Life, in this definition, is an individual's sovereign reality. It is subjective and impressionable. Life is the wholeness of experience flowing past the individual's field of perception in the present moment. There is never a closure to life, nor a final chapter written. It is eternal, not only in the abstract sense of never ending or beginning, but also in the real sense that life is ever expanding in order to express divine intelligence in all realities within the universe. Nurturance of life is the principle whereby an individual is in alignment with the natural expansion of intelligence inherent within all life. This alignment enhances the life energy that flows past the individual with the clear intent of gentle support.** It is the action of opening to the highest motive in all people and in all life and supporting the flow of this highest intention towards its ultimate expression. **In so doing, the action is performed without judgment, analysis, or attachment to outcome. It involves simply nurturing the highest energy that flows from all people and all beings, and thus supporting the fullest expression of their deepest essence. This is a departure from the normal perception that nurturing support can only be granted when others are in alignment with your personal will and desires. When, instead, you view everything in your life as an integrated energy flowing as an expression of ever-expanding divine intelligence, all life is honored as an extension of the divine. In this context, there is no energy that is misdirected or unworthy of support and nurturance. While this may seem contrary to the evidence of abusive energy upon the Earth, even energy that is laden with \"evil intent\" is nevertheless energy that is flowing outward in search of a higher expression. All people and all forms of life can be nurtured and supported to their highest expression. This is the fundamental purpose of this principle.

All people and all forms of life can be nurtured and supported to their highest expression. This is the fundamental purpose of this principle. It is greatly facilitated by the intention to perceive the original motive and ultimate expression of life energy as it passes through your field of awareness. **Energy is an element of life that is so subtly interwoven with form that it is one, in much the same manner as space and time are inextricably linked in union.** Energy is a motive. It is intelligent beyond the mind's ability to reason. While it is a force that can be subject to applications that deny its highest expression, energy is always imbuing life with the motive to expand and evolve. Life energy is always in a state of becoming. It is never static or regressive in its natural state. You are very capable of nurturing this natural expansion of energy to forge new channels of expression and experience. In fact, it is your primary purpose to expand the life energy that encircles your personal reality, and to transform it to new levels of expression that more clearly reflect the perspective of divine essence. There are many specific actions that can be taken to nurture life. Each soul has the innate ability to transform energy through a tremendous variety of means. Working through your body, your soul is able to collect and store energy and redirect its purpose or application. This transformation of energy can occur on both personal and universal levels of expression. That is, within an individual's field of awareness, energy can be transformed at any time to conform more to a vision of personal welfare, or aligned with a vision of universal welfare and goodwill. One of the best methods to transform energy is through exploring one's belief system. **All beliefs have energy systems that act like birthing chambers for the manifestation of your perceived reality. **Within these energy systems are currents that direct life experience. Your soul is aware of these currents either consciously or unconsciously and allows them to carry you into realms of experience that engage your core belief system. By cultivating beliefs that expand and transform energy, you are more able to explore energy systems that are nurturing to life in all its myriad forms. When your beliefs are clearly defined as intentions - as preferred states of being - your life energy engages more fully in the present moment. Your energy system becomes inseparable from your being and woven into your spirit like a thread of light. **[Clarity of intention](https://www.weboflove.org/lifepurposeintentions) is essential to engaging the energy system of your core beliefs, and to allowing the nurturance of life to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__life_transformation.txt:4:88f0f330f047", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11245, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__life_transformation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__life_transformation", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "able to explore energy systems that are nurturing to life in all its myriad forms.

Thus, as you awaken to your own creative power to transform life energy outside of yourself and enhance it with the clear intent of gentle support, you naturally experience ever-unfolding transformation within yourself as well. You become an increasingly clear beacon of the divine and the architect of a new paradigm based upon the intention to nurture all life in the universe. **Gratitude ** This principle is based on the understanding that the universe represents a collective intelligence that can be personalized as a single universal soul - a composite expression of the divine. Thus, in this perspective, there are only two souls in the entire cosmos: the individual soul and the universal soul. Inasmuch as the individual is impressionable and constantly changing to adapt to new information, so is the universal soul, which is a dynamic, living template of collective energies and experiences that are coherent and as knowable as a friend's personality and behavior. The universal soul is responsive to the individual soul and its beliefs and perceptions. It is like a composite omni-personality that is imbued with divine intelligence and responds to the perceptions and belief systems of the individual like a pool of water mirrors the image that overshadows it. **Everyone is indeed, at their innermost core, an enlightened soul that can transform themselves into an instrument of divine essence.** However, this transformation is dependent on whether the individual chooses to project an image of divine essence upon the \"mirror\" of the universal soul, or to project a lesser image that is a distortion of its essential state of being. The principle of gratitude is primarily concerned with consciously designing your self-image through an appreciation of the universal soul's supportive mirror. In other words, the universal soul is a partner in shaping reality's expression in your life. If you choose to project a transformed image upon the mirror of the universal soul, reality gradually becomes an internal process of creation that is increasingly free of external controls and conditions. This process involves an interchange of supportive energy between the individual and the universal soul. This energy is best applied through an appreciation of how perfect and exacting this interchange occurs", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__life_transformation.txt:5:0f486744c393", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11246, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__life_transformation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__life_transformation", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "mirror.

This process involves an interchange of supportive energy between the individual and the universal soul. This energy is best applied through an appreciation of how perfect and exacting this interchange occurs in every moment of life. If you are aware - or at least interested in having the awareness - of how perfectly the divine, as expressed in the form of the universal soul, supports your sovereign reality, there is a powerful and natural sense of gratitude that flows from you to the divine. **It is this wellspring of gratitude that opens wide the channel of support from the divine to the individual and establishes a collaboration of purpose to transform the individual soul into a pure expression of divine essence. ** It is principally gratitude - which arises naturally through appreciation of how the relationship between the individual and the universal soul operates - that opens you to connection with your divine essence, and to your eventual transformation into the state of perception and expression of divine essence. The relationship of the individual with the universal soul is essential to cultivate and nurture, because this relationship, more than anything else, determines how accepting each individual is of life's myriad forms and manifestations. When you accept changes in your sovereign reality as the shifting persona of the universal soul, you live in greater harmony with life itself. Life becomes an exchange of energy between you and the universal soul that is allowed to play out without judgment, and is experienced without fear. This is the underlying meaning of unconditional love: to experience life in all its manifestations as a single, unified intelligence that responds perfectly to the projected image of each soul. It is for this reason that when you project gratitude, regardless of circumstance or condition, life becomes increasingly supportive in opening you to further awakening your sacred intentions. This feeling of gratitude coupled with the mental concept of appreciation is expressed like an invisible message in all directions and at all times. In this particular context, gratitude is the overarching motive behind all forms of expression to which humanity aspires. Every breath, every word, every touch, every thought is centered on expressing this sense of gratitude; a gratitude that you are sovereign and supported by a universal soul that expresses itself through all forms and manifestations of life with the sole objective of creating the ideal reality to fully awaken your sacred intentions and to transform your entire being into divine essence.

It is this specific form of gratitude that accelerates the awakening of your sacred intentions and their inherent ability to integrate your body, mind, heart, and soul, and to transform your ability to perceive and express from the place of divine essence. Time is the primary factor that distorts the otherwise clear connection between the individual and the divine. Time establishes separation of experience. This creates doubt in the divine's system of fairness and overarching purpose. This doubt, in turn, creates fear that the universe is not a mirror but rather a chaotic, whimsical energy. Time intervenes to create pockets of despair, hopelessness, and abandonment. However, it is these very \"pockets\" that often motivate awakening the sacred intentions of your soul, as they cause you to seek a more intimate and harmonious relationship with the divine. When you are aligned with divine essence and live from this perspective as part of an ever-unfolding reality, you attract a natural state of harmony. This does not necessarily mean that your life is without problems or discomforts; rather it signifies a perception that there is an integral purpose in what life reveals. In other words, **life experience is meaningful to the extent that you choose to live in natural harmony with divine essence. When your personal reality flows in alignment with divine essence, you create lasting joy and inner peace. ** Gratitude is an essential facet of love that opens you to acknowledge the role of the universal soul and to redefine your purpose as a supportive extension of the divine, rather than the whimsical outreach of fate or the exacting reaction of a mechanical, detached universe. Establishing a relationship with the universe through the outflow of gratitude attracts life experience that is deeply transformative - experience that is richly devoted to uncovering life's deepest meaning and most formative purpose. **The Emergence of Divine Essence** Through the ongoing application of these principles of transformation, divine intelligence increasingly permeates your soul, and your soul becomes the identity of your entire being. Thus, identity is transformed, and in the wake of this transformation, divine essence unifies your entire being with your soul, and your soul with divine intelligence. It is this unification and shift of identity that is the explicit purpose of these life principles. If there is any other intention or objective, these principles will remain misunderstood and their catalytic powers will remain dormant. **It is the perspective of divine essence that all life is pure love in its fullest expression,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__life_transformation.txt:7:c636e60d7a4c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11248, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__life_transformation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__life_transformation", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "Thus, identity is transformed, and in the wake of this transformation, divine essence unifies your entire being with your soul, and your soul with divine intelligence.

If there is any other intention or objective, these principles will remain misunderstood and their catalytic powers will remain dormant. **It is the perspective of divine essence that all life is pure love in its fullest expression, and that in this single concept, all life is conceived and forever exists.** This becomes the core belief from which all other beliefs arise. And as these beliefs expand outward, this core belief system emerges with a clear intent of supporting a fundamental perspective of seeing, nurturing, and appreciating the universe as the divine cradle from which all life is created and evolves. These principles of transformation are merely symbols represented in words and served to you as a potential recipe to stir awake the embers of light that tirelessly burn within. There are no specific techniques or rituals that are required to invoke their power. They are simply perspectives. In a real sense, they are sacred intentions that attract experience that expands consciousness. They do not provide quick fixes or instant realizations. They are amplifiers of personal will and intention that clarify how one lives. Their transformative power is contained exclusively in the intent of their application. Through these principles, you can become a master of empowering your deeper self. In the past, boundaries were set, secrets were kept, and your light was subdued simply because your perception of external, hierarchical controls created in you fear of the unknown and of the mystical practices of transformed souls. Now, if you choose to apply these life principles with clear intent, you have the tools to accelerate the emergence of divine essence. You can awaken the perspective, insights, and empowered abilities of your divine essence to create new realms of possibility and shape them as learning adventures that liberate and expand your consciousness. This is the underlying purpose of these principles, and perhaps the best reason to explore them. ** This is the first of a two-part essay, for part two: [https://www.weboflove.org/consciousnessparadigms](https://www.weboflove.org/consciousnessparadigms)** **** **For a two-page summary of *Principles of Transformation*: [https://www.weboflove.org/transformation](https://www.weboflove.org/transformation) ** Thank you for taking the time to read this empowering essay by WingMakers.

It has a direct impact on emotions and our ability to handle stress and disturbing circumstances. Below are excerpts from a fascinating article describing scientific studies on health written by the Dalai Lama (Tenzin Gyatso) and published in the *New York Times*. I meditate every morning upon awakening and most nights before sleep. I find it to be very calming and to help me stay focused as I move through each day. As mentioned, meditation does not have to be related to any particular religion or belief system. It is simply time set aside to communicate with our inner spirit and with whatever spiritual guidance we are open to. May your days be filled with calmness, clarity, and purpose. With very best wishes for inner peace and optimal health, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) ** The Monk in the Lab By Tenzin Gyatso (*New York Times* Op-Ed) 1107 words ** DHARAMSALA, India - These are times when destructive emotions like anger, fear and hatred are giving rise to devastating problems throughout the world. While the daily news offers grim reminders of the destructive power of such emotions, the question we must ask is this: What can we do, person by person, to overcome them? Of course such disturbing emotions have always been part of the human condition. Some - those who tend to believe nothing will ''cure'' our impulses to hate or oppress one another - might say that this is simply the price of being human. But this view can create apathy in the face of destructive emotions, leading us to conclude that destructiveness is beyond our control. **I believe that there are practical ways for us as individuals to curb our dangerous impulses - impulses that collectively can lead to war and mass violence. As evidence I have not only my spiritual practice, but now also the work of scientists.** For the last 15 years I have engaged in a series of conversations with Western scientists. We have exchanged views on topics ranging from quantum physics and cosmology to compassion and destructive emotions. It may seem odd that a religious leader is so involved with science, but Buddhist teachings stress the importance of understanding reality, and so we should pay attention to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__meditation-benefits-health.txt:0:316790063737", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11251, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__meditation-benefits-health.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__meditation-benefits-health", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "mass violence. As evidence I have not only my spiritual practice, but now also the work of scientists.** For the last 15 years I have engaged in a series of conversations with Western scientists. We have exchanged views on topics ranging from quantum physics and cosmology to compassion and destructive emotions. It may seem odd that a religious leader is so involved with science, but Buddhist teachings stress the importance of understanding reality, and so we should pay attention to what scientists have learned about our world through experimentation and measurement. It is for this reason that I visited the neuroscience laboratory of Dr. Richard Davidson at the University of Wisconsin. Using imaging devices that show what occurs in the brain during meditation, Dr. Davidson has been able to study the effects of Buddhist practices for cultivating compassion, equanimity or mindfulness. For centuries Buddhists have believed that pursuing such practices seems to make people calmer, happier and more loving. At the same time they are less and less prone to destructive emotions. According to Dr. Davidson, there is now science to underscore this belief. Dr. Davidson tells me that the emergence of positive emotions may be due to this: **Mindfulness meditation strengthens the neurological circuits that calm a part of the brain that acts as a trigger for fear and anger. This raises the possibility that we have a way to create a kind of buffer between the brain's violent impulses and our actions. ** Experiments have already been carried out that show some practitioners can achieve a state of inner peace, even when facing extremely disturbing circumstances. Dr. Paul Ekman of the University of California at San Francisco told me that jarring noises (one as loud as a gunshot) failed to startle the Buddhist monk he was testing. Dr. Ekman said he had never seen anyone stay so calm in the presence of such a disturbance. Another monk, the abbot of one of our monasteries in India, was tested by Dr. Davidson using electroencephalographs to measure brain waves. According to Dr. Davidson, the abbot had the highest amount of activity in the brain centers associated with positive emotions that had ever been measured by his laboratory. Of course, the benefits of these practices are not just for monks who spend months at a time in meditation retreat. Dr. Davidson told me about his research with people working in highly stressful jobs. These people - non-Buddhists - were taught mindfulness, a state of alertness in which the mind does not get caught up in thoughts or sensations, but lets them come and go, much like watching a river flow by. After eight weeks, Dr. Davidson found that in these people, the parts of their brains that help to form positive emotions became increasingly active. The implications of all this are clear: the world today needs citizens and leaders who can", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__meditation-benefits-health.txt:1:4c9f38a4c1c5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11252, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__meditation-benefits-health.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__meditation-benefits-health", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "stressful jobs.

The implications of all this are clear: the world today needs citizens and leaders who can work toward ensuring stability and engage in dialogue with the ''enemy'' - no matter what kind of aggression or assault they may have endured. **It's worth noting that these methods are not just useful, but inexpensive. You don't need a drug or an injection. You don't have to become a Buddhist, or adopt any particular religious faith. Everybody has the potential to lead a peaceful, meaningful life.** We must explore as far as we can how that can be brought about. The calamity of 9/11 demonstrated that modern technology and human intelligence guided by hatred can lead to immense destruction. Such terrible acts are a violent symptom of an afflicted mental state. To respond wisely and effectively, we need to be guided by more healthy states of mind, not just to avoid feeding the flames of hatred, but to respond skillfully. We would do well to remember that the war against hatred and terror can be waged on this, the internal front, too. I try to put these methods into effect in my own life. When I hear bad news, especially the tragic stories I often hear from my fellow Tibetans, naturally my own response is sadness. However, by placing it in context, I find I can cope reasonably well. And feelings of helpless anger, which simply poison the mind and embitter the heart, seldom arise, even following the worst news. **If humanity is to survive, happiness and inner balance are crucial.

Acquafondata ** In the landmark book *[The Soul of Money](http://www.amazon.com/Soul-Money-Reclaiming-Wealth-Resources/dp/039332950X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-8477226-4271649?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189020864&sr=1-1)*, author Lynne Twist powerfully inspires each of us to learn how to speak with our money. In this book, Lynne writes about an experience she had as a fund raiser for the Hunger Project. One day she met a corporate executive in his high rise office in Chicago. All she knew about the huge food corporation for which he functioned as CEO was that it had recently suffered a major image problem due to inappropriate actions. **The corporation apparently had decided upon the idea of contributing to a cause aimed at ending world hunger as a way to \"clean up its image.\" ** She wrote: \"I was ushered into the CEO's office. There he sat at his desk, and I sat facing him on the other side. The backlighting made it so that I could barely see his face. I only had fifteen minutes of his time, so I spoke quickly about the mission and work of our organization and the challenges of ending world hunger. \"I talked about the courage of the hungry people and the partnership that we all needed to provide them in their courageous commitment to feed themselves and their children and build the conditions for a healthy and productive life. **When I was done and had made my request, he opened his desk drawer and pulled out a preprinted check for $50,000 and passed it across the desk to me.** \"It was clear that he wanted me gone as quickly", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__money-matters.txt:0:4c90aa0ef79e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11255, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__money-matters.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__money-matters", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "hunger. \"I talked about the courage of the hungry people and the partnership that we all needed to provide them in their courageous commitment to feed themselves and their children and build the conditions for a healthy and productive life. **When I was done and had made my request, he opened his desk drawer and pulled out a preprinted check for $50,000 and passed it across the desk to me.** \"It was clear that he wanted me gone as quickly as possible. The perfunctory presentation and the tone of his voice told me that he had no genuine interest in our work, in connecting with resource-poor people or in making any kind of a difference in the work to end world hunger. \"This was purely a strategic move. He wanted to off-load the guilt and shame from public mistakes the company had made. And he wanted to have the company look good in the media. \"In financial terms, it was to be a simple transaction. Handing me this check for $50,000 bought his company an opportunity to mend its reputation. But as he slid the check over to me, I felt the guilt of the company coming right across that desk with the money. He gave me the money and the company's guilt\" [[1]](#_edn1) **This was the largest check Lynne had ever received in her work as a fund raiser. Yet rather than feeling elated, it left her feeling empty and hollow. ** Immediately after that unusual meeting, Lynne flew to New York City. Here is the unexpected awakening she experienced there in her own words: \"I arrived in New York in the middle of a rainstorm and made my way to Harlem, to an old church building. I walked down the steps to the basement room where about seventy-five people had gathered for the fund-raising event. \"The surroundings couldn't have been more different from the penthouse office that I had left only a few hours before. It was raining, and there were leaks all over the room where we were meeting. Buckets were strategically placed all around the outer walls catching the dripping water. **\"I looked out at the audience, and I knew that the people sitting there did not have much money to give.** I spoke to them about The Hunger Project's commitment to Africa, as I thought it would be the most relevant to their own lives and their heritage. When it came time to ask for donations, my palms were sweating. I began to wonder if it was the right thing to do. I went ahead and made the request. \"The room fell absolutely silent. \"After what seemed like a long silent pause, a woman stood up. She was sitting on the aisle in a row near the back.

When it came time to ask for donations, my palms were sweating. I began to wonder if it was the right thing to do. I went ahead and made the request. \"The room fell absolutely silent. \"After what seemed like a long silent pause, a woman stood up. She was sitting on the aisle in a row near the back. She was in her late sixties or early seventies. She had gray hair parted down the middle and swept up into a tidy bun. When she stood up, she was tall, slender, erect, and proud. \"Girl,\" she started, \"my name is Gertrude, and I like what you've said, and I like you. Now, I ain't got no checkbook, and I ain't got no credit cards,\" she continued. \"To me, money is a lot like water. For some folks, it rushes through their life like a raging river. For me, money comes through my life like a little trickle. But I want to pass it on in a way that does the most good for the most folks. I see that as my right and as my responsibility. It's also my joy. **I have fifty dollars in my purse that I earned from doing a white woman's wash, and I want to give it to you.\"** \"She walked up the aisle and handed me her fifty dollars. It was in one-dollar, five-dollar, and ten-dollar bills. Then she gave me a big hug. As she headed back to her seat, other people, inspired by Gertrude's words, started coming up and making their own contributions in singles, five, ten, and twenty-dollar bills. I was so moved that I found myself crying. I couldn't hold all the bills in my hands, so at one point, I opened my briefcase and put it on the table to act as a kind of basket for the money. \"These moments, with people streaming up to give their money, had the feeling of a sacred ceremony. There was a deep sense of integrity and heart. **The amount of money that we received - maybe $500 at the most - was more precious to me than any gift I'd ever received before. ** \"As I packed up getting ready to leave, I realized that at the bottom of that same briefcase, underneath all these bills, was the $50,000 check I had been given earlier that same day. As I saw it, I also realized that Gertrude's fifty dollars felt more valuable to me and ultimately would do more to end hunger than the check for an amount one hundred times more. \"The money I received from Gertrude carried the energy of her commitment to make a difference - the stamp of her soul. As I accepted the money from her, I felt inspired and renewed by her sincere expression of integrity and purpose.

As I accepted the money from her, I felt inspired and renewed by her sincere expression of integrity and purpose. I felt my organization's principles and programs affirmed, not only by her fifty dollars, but also by her contributions of spirit.\" [[2]](#_edn2) This moving encounter started shifting something in Lynne's mind and heart. It gave her a newfound courage and determination. **The next day she sent a letter returning the $50,000 check to the Chicago CEO** with a note thanking him for his consideration. In this unusual note, she suggested that he choose an organization to which the company felt truly committed. Years later, Lynne had all but forgotten the returned check when she received a letter from that same executive. In this powerful letter, he shared how the single action of that returned check had made a huge difference in his life. Here's what Lynne says about it: \"Upon retiring, he had looked back on his long and fruitful career, and one thing that stood out for him was our interaction and the return of that $50,000 check, with the note explaining that we were looking for committed partners. It was for him as a seminal moment when all the rules of corporate America that he had so deeply learned - that you do anything and everything to increase profits - all those rules had been shattered by someone outside his world returning the company's money. \"Reflecting from retirement on meaningful moments, he realized that he did, in fact, want to make a difference in ending world hunger. He did want the money under his control to make a difference. And he could see now that it was possible to make a meaningful contribution to end world hunger. **So from his own pocket, and in affirmation of his own commitment, he made a contribution to The Hunger Project many times in excess of the $50,000 that had been returned.\"** [[3]](#_edn3) So, if you are going to give a $50,000 donation, do it with gusto and conviction or, you never know, the recipient might just return it. And if like me, you don't have that kind of money, give what you can with enthusiasm and conviction. Know that how you give matters. **Muhammad Yunus** Another amazing human being inspired me deeply on transforming my perceptions around money. As I learned more about this man, Muhammad Yunus, a few words stood out that sum up his philosophy. He said, \"We achieve what we want to achieve.

As I learned more about this man, Muhammad Yunus, a few words stood out that sum up his philosophy. He said, \"We achieve what we want to achieve. If we are not achieving something, my first suspicion will fall on the intensity of our desire to achieve it.\" [[4]](#_edn4) His words got me thinking. What do I want to achieve? Not in terms of personal gain, but in terms of what I would like to be a part of changing in this world. How would I like the world to be a better place? There are so many worthy goals. It's easy to get overwhelmed with choices or to get torn in so many directions that one's efforts are totally diluted. What can I get energized around to the point that I have an intensity of commitment? Then how can I use my money to further that goal or goals? How might my deeper values inform those decisions? **Bangladesh in 1974. Thousands of people died. At the time Muhammad Yunus was a young professor teaching economics at Chittagong University. At the time, Yunus wrote, \"People were dying on the street. We could see human bodies like skeletons, walking like zombies, lying on the street.\" [[5]](#_edn5) ** \"Nothing in the economic theories I taught reflected the life around me. How could I go on telling my students make believe stories in the name of economics? I needed to run away from these theories and from my textbooks and discover the real-life economics of a poor person's existence.\" [[6]](#_edn6) Yunus could no longer follow his original life plan. He stopped teaching economics and began to focus on the goal of finding an economic solution to poverty. He experimented with a variety of approaches, until in 1976 one unusual attempt succeeded. In that year, Yunus met a 21-year-old woman, Sufia Begum, who had to borrow money to buy bamboo to make stools. She earned 25 cents a day, yet after paying off the high interest on her debt from borrowing fees, she ended up taking home only two cents a day. She could barely feed herself. **Yunus' solution focused on trust and community. He trusted Sufia and took a risk by lending $27 of his own money.** He didn't lend the money just to her though, and that fact is a crucial part of his later success. He lent the money at low interest collectively to both Sufia and her neighbors, who shared her trade. He asked the group to pay it back over the course of the next year. His plan worked. He found that lending the money", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__money-matters.txt:4:6b544ff5d2aa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11259, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__money-matters.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__money-matters", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "on trust and community.

He lent the money at low interest collectively to both Sufia and her neighbors, who shared her trade. He asked the group to pay it back over the course of the next year. His plan worked. He found that lending the money and dividing it among a small group made a difference in the success. Next, he agreed to serve as a guarantor on a larger loan from a traditional bank. This worked for a while, but **before long, he got fed up with the traditional banking system. He then developed the inspiring [Grameen Bank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank). This unusual new bank was based on the principle of trust and focusing on small communities of people who share a commitment to help each other.** The system includes a willingness to take risks and a commitment to human rights. The now world-renowned Grameen Bank uses methods that are pretty much the opposite of conventional banking. For example: Conventional banking operates on the principle that the more you have, the more we will lend you. The poor are rarely given loans at all. Grameen Bank believes credit should be a human right. It lends money to those who posses nothing, but have potential to earn. Conventional banks are owned by rich people, mostly men. Poor women own Grameen Bank. Conventional banking is based on collateral. Grameen is based on trust. **Grameen does not lend to individuals, but to groups of people who are then responsible to each other.** New loans are available only after previous loans have been paid off. Conventional banks punish people who can't pay loans. Grameen bank helps borrowers with legitimate problems to reschedule loans. Conventional banks require lots of paperwork. Grameen lends money to illiterate people. Muhammad Yunus once set out to end poverty. He came up with an inspired idea and created a vast possibility where once there was none. **The Grameen Bank now has 6.6 million borrowers from around the globe who are pulling themselves out of poverty. Many can now afford to feed their families three good meals a day and pay the small government fees required to send their children to schools. ** The Nobel Committee acknowledged the pioneering efforts of Yunus for working toward world peace, because they believe that we can't have peace until we find ways to get people out of poverty. Yunus and the Grameen Bank were [awarded the Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-nobel-winner-urges-defeat-poverty) in 2006. Yunus used basic, loving human values and creativity to speak with his money. His message carried far beyond his original dreams, opening a world of possibility. He once wrote: \"Grameen has taught me two things: first our knowledge base about people", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__money-matters.txt:5:d669caa17afe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11260, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__money-matters.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__money-matters", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "efforts of Yunus for working toward world peace, because they believe that we can't have peace until we find ways to get people out of poverty.

Yunus used basic, loving human values and creativity to speak with his money. His message carried far beyond his original dreams, opening a world of possibility. He once wrote: \"Grameen has taught me two things: first our knowledge base about people and their interactions is still very inadequate; second, each individual person is very important. Each person has tremendous potential. She alone can influence the lives of others within communities [and] nations - within and beyond her own time. \"Each of us has much more hidden inside of us than what we have had a chance to explore so far. Unless we create [an] enabling environment to discover the limits of our potential, we will never know what we have inside of us. **Grameen has given me a faith, an unshakable faith in the creativity of human beings.** That leads me to believe that human beings are not born to suffer the misery of hunger and poverty. They suffer now and did in the past because we turn our mind away from the issue.\" [[7]](#_edn7) Reading this I thought, how could Yunus' approach to speaking with his money apply to us? When he said, \"We achieve what we want to achieve,\" he used a communal \"we.\" Ultimately it took a community of poor people working together to help each other. In our individualistic society we tend to ask the question, \"How can I make a difference? How would I like the world to change? What can I do?\" I suggest we look for a community perspective. The fact that you are [reading this] now indicates that you have at least a sense of the importance of community, maybe a deep commitment to it. We speak about our belief in the worth and value of every human being. We don't exclude people who we don't understand or who might seem very different from us. We stand for human rights and for peace and for the freedom to speak our conscience, even when others disagree. We celebrate many paths along the journey of life, and we learn from the diversity. We treasure the natural world, and we grapple with the responsibility of interdependence. It takes money to do this. I know that. I want to do my part. When I'm generous in my giving and my attitude, it opens my heart. **There are definitely people who struggle, but the majority of us, myself included, have plenty of money in comparison to the majority of people around the world. ** We all make choices. Sometimes we made important decisions involving money so many years ago that we've forgotten they were choices: decisions about vehicles,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__money-matters.txt:6:370faaafd421", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11261, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__money-matters.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__money-matters", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "It takes money to do this.

Sometimes we made important decisions involving money so many years ago that we've forgotten they were choices: decisions about vehicles, homes, vacations, entertainment, pets, activities for the children, computers, television and other technological life enhancements. To make sure that I am doing some good with my money, I set aside a certain percentage of my income every year to give away before I spend money on other things. For me that percentage is six. Other percentages might make sense for families in different circumstances. This method helps me to be disciplined in giving and make more generous choices. What about you? Are you up to the challenge? **How will you speak with your money in a way that transforms our world? ** **Footnotes** [[1]](#_ednref1) *The Soul of Money* by Lynne Twist, pp. 98-99 [[2]](#_ednref2) *The Soul of Money* by Lynne Twist, p. 100 [[3]](#_ednref3) *The Soul of Money* by Lynne Twist. p. 118 [[4]](#_ednref4) \"Overcoming Poverty through Entrepreneurial Empowerment\" by Muhammad Yunus, 1995 Max Schmidheiny Foundation at the University of St. Gallen.

The inspiring four-minute video below features caring mothers from around the world talking about the importance of Mother's Day and its origins. To explore the origins of Mother's Day, we travel back over 100 years in time to 1908, where we meet Anna Jarvis, a woman who strangely enough never married nor had children. In a very meaningful way, Mother's Day was her child. Ms. Jarvis created Mother's Day to celebrate her own mother, a caring, dedicated activist, and world-class mother. As stated in an [MSNBC article](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24556903/ns/us_news-life/t/mothers-day-reaches-th-anniversary/) on the 100th anniversary of Mother's Day, \"by all accounts, Jarvis' mother Ann was a community activist who worked to heal the divisions in north-central West Virginia following the Civil War, and to promote improved sanitation by creating Mothers Friendship Clubs.\" Just six years after its birth, a 1914 resolution by President Woodrow Wilson turned Mother's Day into a national institution. Yet with its rapidly growing popularity, Anna Jarvis became increasingly upset with its rapid commercialization. Later in her life, Ms. Jarvis stated that she \"wished she would have never started the day because it became so out of control.\" As stated in the MSNBC article, \"before she died in 1948, she protested at a Mother's Day celebration in New York, and was arrested for disturbing the peace.\" As you watch the beautiful video below, consider letting go of the commercialization and stepping back into the pure spirit and intention upon which Mother's Day was originally founded. What better way to honor our mothers and the founder of Mother's Day, Anna Jarvis. [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtzAwo1HU2w**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtzAwo1HU2w) Read the text of an early call for Mother's Day in the proclamation below. And as you celebrate Mother's Day this year, consider honoring both Anna Jarvis and your own mother. Notice where you might want to commercialize this special day. Then choose instead to invite back the spirit of its origin as you honor your mother or your own motherhood. And if you are a mother, I wish you a most warm and beautiful Mother's Day. Thanks so much to all mothers for bringing us into this life here and for nurturing and supporting us to shine our light in the world.

Despite the assumptions of physical force, the mother has a sacred and commanding word to say to the sons who owe their life to her suffering. That word should now be heard, and answered to as never before. Arise, then, Christian women of this day! Arise, all women who have hearts, whether your baptism be that of water or of tears! Say firmly: We will not have great questions decided by irrelevant agencies. Our husbands shall not come to us, reeking with carnage, for caresses and applause. Our sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn all that we have been able to teach them of charity, mercy and patience. We, women of one country, will be too tender of those of another country, to allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs. From the bosom of the devastated earth a voice goes up with our own. It says: Disarm, disarm! The sword of murder is not the balance of justice. Blood does not wipe out dishonor, nor violence vindicate possession. As men have often forsaken the plough and the anvil at the summons of war, let women now leave all that may be left of home for a great and earnest day of council. Let them meet first, as women, to bewail and commemorate the dead. Let them then solemnly take council with each other as to the means whereby the great human family can live in peace, man as the brother of man, each bearing after his own kind the sacred impress, not of Caesar, but of God. In the name of womanhood and of humanity, I earnestly ask that a general congress of women, without limit of nationality, may be appointed and held at some place deemed most convenient, and at the earliest period consistent with its objects, to promote the alliance of the different nationalities, the amicable settlement of international questions, the great and general interests of peace. **Note: **Read a [powerful essay](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warisaracket) by a top US general who realized how he was being", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__mothers-day-origins.txt:1:122e1aecac80", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11264, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__mothers-day-origins.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__mothers-day-origins", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "of God.

September 1992. Age 34.* In the middle of the most intense break-up I have ever experienced, the emotional pain is so great I just can't take it any more. **After living together largely in joy and bliss with my awesome girlfriend for a year and a half, I now find myself suddenly an absolute emotional wreck as her love has fled to another man. **I have to do something. So I put on my running shorts and head out to the beach. Pushing myself to run harder than ever with the soothing ocean as my companion, I welcome the physical pain surging in my body as it somehow makes the intense emotional pain more tolerable. Yet even in the midst of this crushing pain and anguish, I somehow know I will one day be grateful. Even in the depths of this despair and having no idea how it might manifest, the eternal optimist in me deeply trusts that some day I will look back and appreciate this heart-rending loss. *San Francisco Bay Area. September 1995. Age 37.* I am delightfully surprised and in awe to have no doubt that the break up just three years ago was a huge gift in my life. I have fully healed and moved on. Yet I am so thankful now to have grown a profound empathy I've never before known, empathy for my friends who experience intense emotional turmoil in their love life. With the wisdom I've gained, I can now hold them gently in their pain in a way I could never have done before. **My name is Fred Burks, and though I'm one of the most optimistic people you could ever meet, in my work world, I am known as one who courageously shines a loving light into the darkest shadows.** As the founder of the website [www.WantToKnow.info](http://www.WantToKnow.info), which has now received over 24 million visits, I use highly reliable sources to expose little-known cover-ups and corruption of a huge magnitude in our world. Yet I'm very optimistic we can turn this all around. A key reason my work has become popular is that everything I do is colored by my deep sense of hope and optimism. I know that the more we open our eyes to all that is being hidden from us and are then inspired to make a difference, the more our world will change for the better. The byline of WantToKnow.info is \"reliable, verifiable information on major cover-ups and a call to work together for the good of all.\" **Knowing of my boundless optimism, many have asked, \"But what about the way we are destroying our planet?\" I'm actually very hopeful that because many like me are taking decisive action, we will see ever more wonderful changes in our world.** And my eternal optimist", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__optimist-eternal.txt:0:fb39562be0c5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11266, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__optimist-eternal.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__optimist-eternal", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "to make a difference, the more our world will change for the better.

Is that really such a bad thing? Remember, too, that the major media which so saturates our world is largely focused on the sensational. Blood and guts sell. If it bleeds, it leads. Is it any wonder so many feel we are doomed? I believe this is but a reflection of the current human condition which is more obsessed with tragedy than with hope. As ever more of us shift our focus from the sensational to the many incredibly hopeful and inspiring happenings around the world, the media will naturally follow this positive trend in order to keep the profits flowing. As one who is well known in certain corners of the Internet both for shining a light into the shadows and for spreading hope and inspiration, I regularly receive awesome information on how our world is already transforming in ways that few know about. I can tell you that **there are so many great reasons for optimism that I could write pages and pages about it. **I actually have compiled an inspiring essay on this titled \"[10 Reasons for Hope and Optimism](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspiration/hope_optimism_reasons).\" In addition to the 10 reasons there, here are a few more that are particularly exciting to me: The colorful music festivals and dances blossoming all over the planet as a manifestation of our collective desire to come together to celebrate in love and harmony. The growing recognition of the healing and transformative [power of breath](https://www.weboflove.org/#breathing) and [breathwork](https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/breathwork). The safe use of [sacred medicines](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mindalteringdrugsnewsarticles) now becoming legal as a potent door both to transformational healing of past traumas and to expanded consciousness. The increasing awareness that [sexuality can be sacred](https://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/19a_sacred_sexuality) without losing the amazing pleasure available. Thriving intentional communities already living a beautiful new paradigm like the little-known Italian spiritual community of [Damanhur](https://www.wanttoknow.info/i/damanhur-temples-of-humankind) and vibrant Portuguese community of [Tamera](https://www.tamera.org/). The growing number of awesome inspirational and motivational speakers and workshops blossoming around the world.

The growing number of awesome inspirational and motivational speakers and workshops blossoming around the world. Why was I given this gift of eternal optimism when so many in our world are haunted by despair and hopelessness? Is it because of my genes? Was my spirit just oriented that way when I was born? Could it be because growing up I knew that my mother loved me from the bottom of her heart? Might it be because I understood from a young age that being grateful and focusing on the bright side was key to enjoying life? These all may have played a role, but I honestly don't know why I was given this gift while so many in our world to varying degrees live in anxiety and despair. It's not fair. What I do know is that life is not always fair. Why did I get such a loving mother while others suffered terribly at the hands of their parents? Why do I and many of my friends get to enjoy life so much while so many around the world suffer in so many ways? It really isn't fair. **I feel for those who suffer and so wish I could somehow wave a magic wand and share the gifts I've been given to help relieve their pain.** My words here are a small effort in that direction. What I know is that my gift of unwavering optimism has given me the strength and courage to look into the deepest, darkest shadows both inside of myself and out in the world. In my early 40s, I first learned about [secret government mind control projects](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mindcontrol) and [major child trafficking rings](https://www.wanttoknow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence) who rape and torture children, raking in huge profits as they feed the twisted desires of pedophiles around the world. I found my stomach churning with discomfort as I learned how even some [prominent people](https://www.wanttoknow.info/jeffrey-epsteinnewsarticles) at the highest levels of business and government are involved. Yet even on absorbing this gut wrenching information that literally made me feel sick, I knew somehow there must be a greater reason for it all. And **I knew that the reason I was gifted with such optimism was to give me the strength to carry out my mission to stop these horrendous acts, and in so doing make my contribution to a better world for us all.** Out of this was born my work with WantToKnow.info, which I know without a doubt has had a [significant positive impact](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspiringmessages) in our world. What I also know is that there is some kind of energetic feedback loop where those who live with a heartfelt sense of hope and optimism are much more likely to find countless blessings in their lives, while those who dwell in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__optimist-eternal.txt:2:c86c96b34b83", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11268, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__optimist-eternal.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__optimist-eternal", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "and in so doing make my contribution to a better world for us all.** Out of this was born my work with WantToKnow.info, which I know without a doubt has had a [significant positive impact](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspiringmessages) in our world. What I also know is that there is some kind of energetic feedback loop where those who live with a heartfelt sense of hope and optimism are much more likely to find countless blessings in their lives, while those who dwell in hopelessness and despair are more likely to experience doom and gloom in many aspects of their lives. I see this unfold again and again even among my personal friends. I so wish there were some magic key I could give to help those who feel hopeless find their way to hopefulness. Yet these attitudes are often so deeply entrenched that many go to their graves without changing. That said, I know of a good number of people who have made the change. Some have had to first hit rock bottom - a place of such deep despair that they could no longer take it - before finally making a clear choice to change. Others have been transformed by a profound unexpected event, like a [near-death experience](https://www.weboflove.org/nde/near-death-experiences-nde), which forever changed them. Yet there are also those who have simply made a soul-felt commitment to change and have had the courage and tenacity to make it happen. **For those desiring more optimism, I invite you to consider in your heart of hearts if you really are ready for a change. If you are, send a call or a prayer out to your higher guidance for help. And then take action.** Particularly if you are besieged by hopelessness, consider checking out great teachers like [Joe Dispenza](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Supernatural-Common-People-Uncommon/dp/1401953115/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1549342929&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=joe+dispenza+becoming+supernatural&psc=1) and inspirational speakers like [W Mitchell](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/what_matters_w_mitchell) who can spark a change.

Open to all of the many [transformational resources](https://www.peerservice.org/inspiration-center) available. I share all of this with the great desire that we might all find more hope and optimism in our lives. Even though I was blessed to be born an eternal optimist, I invite you to consider the possibility that hope and optimism are a choice that every one of us can make at every moment in our lives. *Life is filled with cycles.

At the time, I worked part time both as an Indonesian language interpreter with the U.S. Department of State and as a hospital nurse on a locked psychiatric ward for troubled teenagers. This unforgettable dream left no doubt for me of the power of shifting from fear and paranoia to uninhibited love.

I'm close to the side entrance of the hospital near the street. Rather suddenly, a strange, unusual noise in the distance catches my attention. Turning towards the commotion, I'm startled to notice that everyone down the street aways is smiling and laughing. Some even fall to the ground, rolling in fits of laughter. This hysterical wave of laughter gradually overtakes everyone in its path as it moves up the street towards me. I faintly smell something in the air. Feeling something is very wrong, I immediately suspect this might be some sort of massive laughing gas attack against the public. I quickly slip back inside the hospital and tell a couple nurses there what is happening. Perplexed, yet moved by my sense of urgency, they open the door, step outside, and confirm that they smell something kind of sweet in the air as they hear the wild laughter rapidly approaching. Then a short moment later, they too begin smiling. I quickly move away as they then begin laughing uncontrollably. **The laughter is very warm and sweet, yet the fact that this is all caused by some chemical agent has me freaked out. I dash further into the building to escape the gas.** As I reach the sterile inner hallways of the hospital, I see strange blockades with flashing lights. At the same time, I hear uncontrolled laughter sweeping down the halls rapidly towards me, so I quickly pull a thin, young blond guy near me into a small side room and slam the door to try to shut out the gas. With a great sense of urgency, I explain to him what is happening outside.

I throw a towel down onto the floor to try to block the crevice under the door, yet I know that it is only a short matter of time before the dreaded gas will seep under the door and affect us, too. I quickly ask this guy to join me in prayer. We both pray deeply and sincerely for what's best for all in this situation. Just a moment after the prayer, the guy morphs into a chubby friend of mine and suddenly jumps on me and sucks something from my forehead. Then in rapid succession he sucks on my neck, chest, stomach, and groin. As he sucks each place, I am utterly amazed to feel any fear in that area being instantly and completely sucked out, leaving in its place nothing but a feeling of deep peace. Once he finishes sucking, I feel such a deep, profound sense of peace that I, too, surrender to a beautiful smile surging forth from deep within. I realize that whatever this gas is, it is amazingly powerful and transformative. By instantly removing all fear, the gas somehow allows me and everyone it touches to see who they really are with absolutely no judgment. **With all judgment and fear gone, everyone can't help but laugh as they realize how silly it has been to play all the entangling games of fear that we have been living our entire lives.** Each affected person suddenly knows that they have all along been avoiding some scary unknown deep inside of them, when in actuality, this gas reveals without a doubt that what they have long feared was based in pure illusion and avoidance of their own deep, pure love and divine essence. The veils of illusion are instantly dropped, revealing how we have all simply been fooling ourselves to play the silly fear games we created in our lives. As I feel this smile and love glow and spread through my entire being, I move into a deep state of awe. Whoever sent this gas is clearly here to help us and to help humankind to make a huge jump forward in our spiritual evolution. A belly full of hearty laughter erupts from deep within as I realize I am now completely free to do the profound love and healing work which I so love to do in this world. *What an amazing and vivid dream!

That starts with healing the damage we have done.\"** Dear friends, This thought-provoking essay by Charles Eisenstein - a great man with a big heart and a beautiful mind - powerfully reminds us of what matters most in life. At a time when there are so many distractions and concerns, it is both wise and healthy to remind ourselves that there is something much greater going on here. With very best wishes for a transformed world, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for the [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) empowerment websites ** A Heartful New Conception of Progress By Charles Eisenstein March 18, 2022** **Here's what a new story and new conception of progress might look like:** Real security comes not through control, but from relationship and belonging. Nature has a fundamental tendency toward complexity and wholeness. Our destiny is to participate in the coming alive of the cosmos, to be part of the unfolding of complexity and beauty into new domains. Now is the time to turn the technologies of control toward a new purpose: to serve life and beauty on earth. That starts with healing the damage we have done. No technology is inevitable. We have the power to collectively choose how we will develop. We can choose technologies that conform to our emerging values of beauty and life. More is not necessarily better, because reality will always escape the primal cognitive technologies of control called labeling and measuring. In the future, we learn the limits of quantitative reasoning, and turn our main energies toward qualitative enrichment. Life and earth are sacred. When we reduce them to a finite value, we commit sacrilege. All resources of the earth are therefore meant for sacred use. When we use them, we always ask whether this will contribute to more beauty, more love, more wonder, and more life. Labor is also sacred; meaningful labor is necessary for human well-being. Therefore, technology should seek not to replace it, but extend its creative powers. Because we humans are not the sole possessors of intelligence, order, and purpose, we can achieve much more by allying ourselves with an intelligence larger than ourselves, than we can relying on our own power to control the world through force.

Coming into attentive relationship to forests, oceans, rivers, wetlands, and other ecosystems, we participate in their healing too. Exploring the relationship between matter and consciousness, we develop material technologies of energy, travel, construction, and more that were inconceivable in the paradigm of force. Progress means progress in peace, beauty, life, connection, and wisdom. In the built environment, we replace the modern landscape of cheapness with the kind of architectural wonders still remaining from before the 20th century. We replace industrial farms with a mosaic of gardens, food forests, and small ecological farms. We open the floodgates of alternative medicine, vitalizing what has been long suppressed and returning medicine to the people. In governance, progress means moving toward transparency and decentralization. In economics progress takes us toward local, community-oriented, zero-waste economies in which money plays a much smaller role. We retool society with the goal of healing on every level, so that progress is to end the cycles of trauma and abuse that have kept humanity miserable. We develop all the forgotten sciences: of geometry, vibration, light, mind, energy, and ceremony, learning how powerful we are in cooperation with, not opposition to, the intelligence of nature. To tell such a story is one thing; to hold it and act from it quite another. The waning program of control rests on a story of Separation (me from you, human from nature, matter from spirit), but it is not only a story. It is also a state of consciousness, and it is a phase of species evolution. Why is techno-utopia so appealing to some? Control is a substitute for what the soul really longs for: to restore its connections, to belong, to be whole. The techno-scientific ambition for perfect knowledge and control is like trying to reach the horizon by running. It is like trying to build a tower all the way to the sky. No matter how fast and far you run, the horizon is no closer. No matter how high you build, the sky is no nearer. So now we slow the run to marvel at the wonders we ignored as we raced with eyes fixed on the horizon.

He actually felt human for the first time in his life.\"** Dear friends, One beautiful morning this August at a personal growth seminar I was attending, I fell into conversation with a wonderful woman I'll call Sheila (she asked me not to share any real names) after a profound breathwork session she led. Seeing my interest in talking about things that really mattered, she asked if I might be interested in hearing a disturbing, yet remarkable story of transformation. I was a big yes to this intriguing offer. **She then proceeded to tell me about an incredible event - or maybe better described as a miracle - that touched me to the core.** Sheila told me that a man we'll call Peter is in a maximum security prison for life. A true psychopath, Peter murdered 27 people before he was caught. You may not know that mass murderers can get a therapist while in prison. This story was related to Sheila by a man we'll call David, who was the therapist for Peter and other mass murderers in this prison. David and Sheila are good friends. He related this highly unusual occurrence in confidence to Sheila. David first explained to Sheila that mass murderers like Peter are kept in solitude in their own cells. They are not allowed to be in contact with other inmates, as many of them would have no hesitation in attacking and killing other prisoners even for petty reasons. Psychopaths are known for not experiencing any real emotions, though they can be quite good at faking them. David informed Sheila that this man we're calling Peter had been living a solitary life in prison for years when, at one of his therapy sessions, David made him an unusual offer. **The mother of a young woman Peter had killed had contacted the prison to say she wanted to meet the man who murdered her daughter. **Though he was sure Peter would not be interested, David felt obligated to relate this to Peter, and so asked if he might be interested in meeting her. To his great surprise, Peter said he would. Apparently his eternally boring existence in solitary confinement made him interested in this as a break in his monotonous routine. As Peter experienced practically no emotions, facing an angry mother was at least more interesting than staring at prison walls all day long. So David arranged for the mother, who we'll call Julia, to meet with Peter in a small room in the prison designed specially for visits like this with thick, bullet-proof glass windows protecting Julia from this cold-blooded murderer. **At his first therapy session after Peter came back", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__psychopath-healer.txt:0:21834110d4ca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11277, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__psychopath-healer.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__psychopath-healer", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "interested in this as a break in his monotonous routine.

He was showing genuine emotion and his entire demeanor had changed for the first time since David had known him. Astounded, David asked what had happened. ** Peter related to David how on the arranged date, he was escorted into the small room where Julia was waiting. Julia looked him straight in the eyes and began angrily spilling her guts, telling Peter how he had robbed her of the precious life of her only child. She raged on about the many ways she had suffered since her daughter's murder. A day didn't pass when she felt a deep sadness at this tragic loss. None of this bothered Peter in the least. He had confided to David in previous sessions how as a result of the severe, repeated physical and sexual abuse he went through as a child, he had learned early how to completely shut off all emotion. By the time he was a teenager, he felt like a zombie moving through all the motions of life without feeling anything. He had also confided that the first time he killed a person, Peter was surprised and thrilled to actually feel the excitement of an adrenaline rush he had never experienced before. This feeling was so intoxicating that he soon decided to kill again just to get that amazing high he felt after killing. Soon, addicted to this new high, he killed again and again until he was finally caught and thrown in prison on death row. His only regret had been that now in prison, he could no longer feed his addiction to get that high by murdering people. So when this woman poured her anger out to him, Peter was not in the least disturbed, though he was content to at least see something other than the drab walls of his prison cell. \"So what happened with Julia to change this?\" David asked. After exhausting all of her anger at him in that little room, Peter continued, Julia slumped back and sat quiet for a couple moments. She then took a deep breath, sat up straight, and looked him deep in the eyes. With tears welling up in her eyes, she said with a soft and even caring tone, \"And Peter, I want you to know that I forgive", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__psychopath-healer.txt:1:becb96a0297c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11278, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__psychopath-healer.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__psychopath-healer", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "of his prison cell. \"So what happened with Julia to change this?\" David asked.

With tears welling up in her eyes, she said with a soft and even caring tone, \"And Peter, I want you to know that I forgive you.\" In the pregnant silence after these totally unexpected words, Peter was shocked. As these words reverberated throughout his being, he was amazed to feel something stirring inside. A mixture of joy and sadness welled up within him for this first time in his entire adult life. As these emotions swirled through his body, something in him opened. He lips trembled and he found his eyes tearing up for the first time ever. Something deep inside of him was touched and moved to the core. **As Peter was escorted back to his solitary prison cell, he could hardly believe that he no longer felt like a zombie. He actually felt human for the first time in his life. Julia's heartfelt expression of forgiveness had created a miracle. ** The story does not end there. Peter had been so moved that after relating what happened with Julia, he leaned forward and whispered to David that he had been thinking long and hard, and he had an important request. He knew that the parents and families of other mass murderers in his prison occasionally requested to meet with the murderer of their loved one. The killers almost always denied the request, not interested in facing the anger and hatred which would come their way. **Peter told David that from then on he wanted to stand in for any of the murderers in his prison to meet with these relatives. He wanted to hear and experience their anger. And he wanted to apologize for what they had done, and for what he had done.** Julia's heartfelt forgiveness had made David human again, and as an expression of his profound gratitude, he wanted to help heal the deep wounds both in himself and in those who had suffered the loss of loved ones as a result of cold-blooded murder. **This one act of forgiveness had not only caused Peter to become human again, it inspired him to the almost superhuman act of offering to fully bear the anger of those who so needed to express it. ** Wow!!!

Even a hardened psychopath mass murderer can have a change of heart when the power of forgiveness is gifted to him. Just to be clear, I certainly would never expect family members of those murdered to be able to find forgiveness like this, but if nothing else, this story inspired me to ever more fully embrace the incredible power of forgiveness to change lives. Thank you, Julia, and thank you Peter for being a shining example of what's possible in our world.

He would wake up clutching his chest, telling his mother Cyndi that he couldn't breathe and that his heart had exploded in Hollywood. But they didn't live in Los Angeles; Hammons's family resided in Oklahoma. **A few months prior, in early 2009, Ryan had started talking about going home to Hollywood and pleaded with Cyndi to take him to see his other family. He would yell, \"Action!\" and pretend to direct films when he played with friends; he knew scenes from a cowboy movie he had never watched**; and said a cafe reminded him of Paris, where he had never been. He talked about his child, worldly travels, and his job at an agency where people changed their names. Cyndi didn't think much of it until the nightmares set in and Ryan started describing death. Hoping to figure out what he was talking about, Cyndi went to the public library and checked out a few books about Hollywood. She was flipping through one of them when Ryan got excited at a photo from the 1932 movie *Night After Night*. **\"Hey Mama, that's George. We did a picture together,\" he told her. \"And Mama, that guy's me. I found me.\"** George, Cyndi discovered, was George Raft, an actor and dancer who specialized in gangster films in the 1930s and 1940s. She couldn't track down the name of the man Ryan had identified as himself. Cyndi had never encountered anything like this before. She was a county clerk deputy who'd been raised in the Baptist church. Her husband, Kevin, was a Muskagee police officer and the son of a Church of Christ minister. She considered them to be fairly ordinary people, but she was starting to wonder if Ryan wasn't so ordinary. **Cyndi contemplated the possibility that this could", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__reincarnation-past-lives-science.txt:0:6ddcba0ecf77", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11281, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__reincarnation-past-lives-science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__reincarnation-past-lives-science", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "and 1940s.

She was a county clerk deputy who'd been raised in the Baptist church. Her husband, Kevin, was a Muskagee police officer and the son of a Church of Christ minister. She considered them to be fairly ordinary people, but she was starting to wonder if Ryan wasn't so ordinary. **Cyndi contemplated the possibility that this could be a case of reincarnation.** Though she could have looked to one of the religions that hold a belief in reincarnation, such as Hinduism or Buddhism, instead, Cyndi turned to science. In February 2010, she wrote a letter to the Division of Perceptual Studies in the psychiatry and neurobehavioral department at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. Within weeks, they wrote back; Ryan was far from alone in having memories of a past life. **The roots of the Division of Perceptual Studies stretch back to the 1920s, when Dr. Ian Stevenson was growing up in Canada.** A sickly child, he contracted bronchitis numerous times and spent hours in bed, devouring his mother's extensive collection of books on Eastern religions. It was in those pages that he was first exposed to reports of paranormal phenomena. He claimed to possess [an unusually good memory](https://web.archive.org/web/20060721165720/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf) and earned his medical degree at McGill University in 1943, before moving to Arizona. He briefly studied biochemistry before moving to psychosomatic medicine, in search of \"[something closer to the whole human being](https://med.virginia.edu/perceptual-studies/wp-content/uploads/sites/360/2015/11/Stevenson-s-Obit-Emily.pdf)\" than what he had found in biochemistry. From there, he trained in psychiatry and psychoanalysis. His academic career flourished in the U.S. and he was named chairman of the department of psychiatry at the University of Virginia (UVA) in 1957, while still in his 30s. Around that time, he revived his childhood interest in the paranormal. He dipped his toes into the waters of parapsychology-the study of mental abilities that seem to go against or be outside of the known laws of nature and science-by writing book reviews and articles for non-academic publications like *[Harper's magazine](https://harpers.org/archive/1959/07/the-uncomfortable-facts-about-extrasensory-perception/)*. In 1958, he won the American Society for Psychical Research's contest for the best essay on paranormal mental phenomena and their relationship to life after death. His essay, \"The Evidence for Survival from Claimed Memories of Incarnations,\" looked at 44 cases of individuals around the world who had memories of past lives. **The most convincing cases, he realized, all involved young children, generally between the ages of 2 and 5, who spoke in great detail of places they had never visited and people they had never met, or who had birthmarks corresponding to injuries incurred by other people when they faced violent, untimely deaths.** Most of those cases were in Asian countries where belief in reincarnation was already high.

Chester Carlson, a wealthy physicist who invented the photocopying process that led to the Xerox Corporation's founding, read Stevenson's winning essay. Having become interested in parapsychology through his wife Dorris, Carlson contacted Stevenson with an offer of funding; Stevenson declined. But Stevenson fell deeper into his new research, taking his first fieldwork trip to interview children with past-life memories in India and Sri Lanka in 1961 and publishing his first book on the topic, *Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation*, in 1966. He reconsidered Carlson's offer; the following year, the funding allowed him to step down as chair of the psychiatry department to focus full-time on his reincarnation research-a move that pleased the dean of UVA's medical school, who was not thrilled with the direction that Stevenson's work was taking. But when Stevenson stepped down, the dean agreed to let him form a small research division in which to do his curious new research within UVA that still exists today. **Carlson died unexpectedly the next year and left UVA $1 million to support Stevenson's research. Over the following decades, Stevenson traversed the globe tracking down instances of children with past-life memories, logging an average of 55,000 miles a year and identifying over 2,000 cases. Along the way, he authored more than [300](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.2001.89.1.142) [publications](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-16249-003), [including](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Twenty_Cases_Suggestive_of_Reincarnation/vIDES6VWl1MC) [fourteen](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Children_Who_Remember_Previous_Lives/HodyPRa7n0wC) [books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/European_Cases_of_the_Reincarnation_Type/NRKBCgAAQBAJ).** The new research division at UVA was called the Division of Parapsychology-a name forced onto Stevenson, according to Dr. Jim. B. Tucker, the division's current director. Stevenson changed the name to the Division of Personality Studies, concerned that parapsychology was isolating itself from the rest of academia. The vagueness of \"personality studies\" suited Stevenson, as he continued working to gain the respect of mainstream science. That mission permeated his studies: **He ceaselessly quantified his data-coding 200 variables in his database of cases, calculating the probabilities of one or two birthmarks corresponding to one or two wounds on another person's body, and painstakingly examining every possible normal, as opposed to paranormal, explanation-in a bid to be taken seriously.** Now, the research unit is called the Division of Perceptual Studies, or DOPS, and remains up and running despite Stevenson's death in 2007. There, Cyndi Hammons's letter about Ryan's Hollywood memories* *found Tucker. Ryan recognized actor George Raft in old Hollywood photographs when he was a child.

(John Springer /CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) Tucker traveled to Oklahoma to meet the Hammons family in April 2010. With help from a TV crew that was following Ryan's case,** they identified the man in the photo from *Night After Night* as Marty Martyn, who died in 1964. **Tucker showed Ryan photos of people Martyn had known in sets of four, asking if anyone looked familiar. He later realized this wording was too vague, especially for a 6 year old, but Ryan did pick out Martyn's wife, saying that she looked familiar, but that he wasn't sure how he knew her. Together, they flew to Los Angeles and met Martyn's daughter, who'd been 8 years old when her father had died. Ryan was confused to find she had grown. **Tucker fact-checked some of Ryan's memories with Martyn's daughter. A lot of the details proved accurate; a lot of them did not. Some couldn't be verified.** Martyn had acted as an extra in movies before becoming a talent agent. He and his wife had traveled the globe. Ryan had talked about dancing on Broadway, which Tucker thought unlikely for someone who'd been an extra with no lines, but Martyn's daughter verified those memories. He had mentioned two sisters and a mother with curly brown hair-also true. He recalled his address having Rock or Mount in its name, and Martyn's last address was 825 N. Roxbury. **But his heart had not exploded. Martyn had leukemia and died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1964. Ryan had also said that his father had raised corn and died when he was still a child, which didn't prove accurate. Still, the case presented \"strong evidence for reincarnation,\" Tucker wrote in his 2013 book, *Return to Life*, in which he documented this story, but it was certainly not definitive.** \"What this offered was an opportunity to look at the big picture, this question of there being more of us than just the physical.\" When Tucker first heard about Stevenson's research on reincarnation, he was a child psychiatrist in private practice in Charlottesville, Virginia, where UVA is located.

After reading one of Stevenson's books, he heard that DOPS was doing a project on near-death experiences-another field of research within parapsychology-and reached out.

That was really quite appealing-and not just the question but also the approach to the question, that these were rational, serious-minded people that were doing this work,\" he told VICE News. Ten years prior to meeting the Hammons family, Tucker gave up his private practice to join DOPS full-time. For nine years, he also served as medical director of UVA's Child and Family Psychiatry Clinic alongside pursuing his parapsychological research through DOPS. **Most of Stevenson's work focused on reincarnation in Asia, but as Tucker plunged into researching past-life memories, he realized that if he were to get Americans to consider his work seriously, he needed to search for cases among those in the U.S. that didn't believe in reincarnation.** Tucker has now published [two books](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=jim+tucker+reincarnation&i=stripbooks&crid=2MCU9YYEOXB6C) documenting cases of children with past-life memories-a term he prefers over the flashier \"reincarnation.\" He writes in a decidedly more approachable voice than Stevenson did, aiming for a mainstream audience instead of an academic one. \"Ian's primary goal was to get the scientific world, the scientific establishment, to seriously consider this possibility [of reincarnation]. And that's a pretty tough audience,\" he said. \"But beyond that, if you just write for that audience for decades, at some point you have to decide that the rest of the world needs to hear about it too.\" Even in Europe, where parapsychological research is more common in universities like the University of Edinburgh and the University of Northampton, the broader psychology community remains skeptical of this work. **In spite of Stevenson's attempts to turn reincarnation studies into a hard science, parapsychology is still a stigmatized niche within academia, where it is not viewed as a very respectable field.** It's one of the reasons that Tucker, as well as many other parapsychologists, keeps one foot in mainstream psychiatry or psychology while pursuing their parapsychological research. Even in Europe, where parapsychological research is more common in universities like the University of Edinburgh and the University of Northampton, the broader psychology community remains skeptical of this work.

It's an academic interest and these are experiences that human beings have reported across different times and across cultures, and we really need to try and understand all aspects of human experience,\" said Christine Simmonds-Moore, a parapsychologist and associate professor of psychology at the University of West Georgia. Simmonds-Moore gravitated towards the paranormal as a child in the UK, but it wasn't until she was far into her psychology degree that she realized she could actually study paranormal phenomena seriously. After getting her PhD in England, she moved to the US to research at the Rhine Center, an independent parapsychology research center in North Carolina that was once affiliated with Duke University. It was while working there that she first encountered the researchers at UVA. She never met Stevenson, but she distinctly remembers her first visit to DOPS.** \"It does send shivers down your spine when you go into the room and you see all the filing cabinets containing all of the cases of the past lives that were investigated by Stevenson,\" she told me. **\"You see all of his work and you see all of the things that he collected from his travels whilst he was doing the investigations. So there are lots of artifacts on the walls there. It's quite a beautiful experience just to see the room with these filing cabinets.\" Not everyone is so moved by Stevenson and Tucker's work. Christopher French, a professor of psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London, considers himself a skeptic when it comes to paranormal phenomena, despite conducting some of his own research on past-life memories. He began his career studying mainstream neuroscience before embracing anomalistic psychology, the study of human behavior associated with the paranormal but based on the assumption that nothing paranormal is involved. French's new direction was, he described, \"tolerated\" by his department, and he had to keep up his more mainstream psychological research in parallel with the anomalistic work that interested him far more. \"I think they are false memories that have arisen as a result of a kind of interesting social psychological interaction between the child and those around them.\" He thinks the most plausible explanation for the majority of cases is that the children are experiencing false memories, though he maintains respect for Stevenson's meticulous research. \"I think they are false", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__reincarnation-past-lives-science.txt:5:22d59e85fe5e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11286, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__reincarnation-past-lives-science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__reincarnation-past-lives-science", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "he had to keep up his more mainstream psychological research in parallel with the anomalistic work that interested him far more. \"I think they are false memories that have arisen as a result of a kind of interesting social psychological interaction between the child and those around them.\" He thinks the most plausible explanation for the majority of cases is that the children are experiencing false memories, though he maintains respect for Stevenson's meticulous research. \"I think they are false memories that have arisen as a result of a kind of interesting social psychological interaction between the child and those around them,\" he argued. \"You do wonder to what end the researchers are kind of just finding the things that match what's gone on.\" He thinks that young children will often say things that don't make sense to their parents when they first start to speak and the parents will then inadvertently feed them information as they begin to wonder whose life the child could be describing-perhaps showing them photographs and asking if they remember the people in the picture and \"having this interaction that ultimately will produce a situation where they've unintentionally implanted false memories,\" as French put it. Stevenson's work informed French's own forays into investigating children with past-life memories. Many years ago, the two men met when seated next to each other at a conference dinner. \"He came across as a very intelligent, reasonable person,\" French recalled. \"I think his work is very good as far as it goes, but I don't think it's the whole story.\" He doesn't, however, question the necessity of the research itself. \"There could only be two possibilities. One is that there is something genuinely paranormal happening, and if that is true, that would be amazing,\" he told me. \"Or, alternatively-which is more the line that I do favor-it tells us something very interesting about human psychology. So either way, it's worth taking seriously.\" Dr. Anita H. Clayton, chair of UVA's psychiatry and neurobehavioral department, which houses DOPS, echoed that sentiment: \"My question is, Where should DOPS be if it's not in the department of psychiatry? And where should it be if it's not in academics? Because I think what scientists do is dispassionately investigate phenomena that we don't yet understand.\" **And yet, mainstream science still largely relegates parapsychology to its own community, with researchers struggling to get their work published in major journals.** Instead, they often publish in parapsychology journals, which, all the parapsychologists I spoke with agreed, is a bit ineffective-they are preaching to the choir when they would rather be reaching the skeptics. **On April 30, 2011, the TV show that had followed Ryan Hammon's case, *The UneXplained: A Life in the Movies*, aired on the Biography Channel.** As a young child, Ryan had always been shy about sharing his Hollywood memories out of fear that people would think", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__reincarnation-past-lives-science.txt:6:2489b5443abf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11287, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__reincarnation-past-lives-science.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__reincarnation-past-lives-science", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "major journals.** Instead, they often publish in parapsychology journals, which, all the parapsychologists I spoke with agreed, is a bit ineffective-they are preaching to the choir when they would rather be reaching the skeptics. **On April 30, 2011, the TV show that had followed Ryan Hammon's case, *The UneXplained: A Life in the Movies*, aired on the Biography Channel.** As a young child, Ryan had always been shy about sharing his Hollywood memories out of fear that people would think he was crazy; his parents, too, had been nervous about what people in their small town would think of them. But just over a year after Cyndi sent that first letter to DOPS, her family's story appeared on national television. In the end, the family thought the producers did a great job. Soon after the episode aired, Ryan stopped talking about Marty Martyn. Within six months, Ryan had taken down his Martyn-themed bedroom decorations-an iron Eiffel Tower, pictures of New York-and told his mom it was time to be a regular kid. **After more than two decades of researching children with past-life memories, Tucker is still getting letters about children like Ryan and he is still seeking out new cases. At his last count, there were about 2,200 cases coded in his database. **He describes himself as \"spiritual but not religious,\" and his goal remains unique from Stevenson's, who was open about his unfulfilled quest for mainstream science to value his life's work. \"A lot of it, to be perfectly honest, is trying to figure out the answers for myself,\" Tucker told me. \"Hopefully my work or my writings have had a positive impact on some people, but they're still trying to answer the question of, What is the level of evidence that, in fact, there is this part of us that survives after the body dies?\" **Note:** This article is taken from [this webpage](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqygg/hard-science-of-reincarnation-past-lives) on the *Vice* website.

What can we do to help each other in this work? First, we can create safe houses to shelter everyone who's devoted to the slow-motion awakening of humanity. These sanctuaries might take the form of temporary autonomous zones like festivals and parties and workshops, where we can ritually explore and potentiate the evolving mysteries of pronoia (the antidote to paranoia). Or they might be more enduring autonomous zones like homes and cafes and businesses where we can get regular practice in freeing ourselves from the slavery of hatred in all of its many guises. What else can we do to help each other? We can conspire together to carry out the agenda that futurist Barbara Marx Hubbard names: to hospice what's dying and midwife what's being born. We need the trigger of each other's rebel glee as we kill off every reflex within us that resonates in harmony with the putrefaction. We need each other's dauntless cunning as we goad and foment the blooming life forces within us. Here's a third way we can collaborate: **We can inspire each other to perpetrate healing mischief, friendly shocks, compassionate tricks, irreverent devotion, holy pranks, playful experiments, and crazy wisdom.** Huh? What do tricks and mischief and jokes have to do with our quest? Isn't America in a permanent state of war? Isn't it the most militarized empire in the history of the world?

Hasn't the paranoia about terrorism decimated our civil liberties? Isn't it our duty to grow more serious and weighty than ever before? On the contrary: I say this is the perfect moment to take everything less seriously and less personally and less literally. Permanent war and the loss of civil liberties are immediate dangers. But they are only symptoms of an even larger, long-term threat to the fate of the earth: the genocide of the imagination. Elsewhere, on pages 184-186 of my book, I have identified pop-nihilist storytellers as the vanguard perpetrators of this genocide of the imagination. But there is another culprit as well: fundamentalism. **The fundamentalist takes everything way too seriously and way too personally and way too literally. He divides the world into two camps, those who agree with him and those who don't. There is only one right way to interpret the world, and a million wrong ways. Correct belief is the only virtue.** To the fundamentalist, the liberated imagination is a sinful taboo. He not only enslaves his own imagination to his ideology, but wants to enslave our imaginations, too. And who are the fundamentalists? Let's not remain under the delusion that they are only the usual suspects -- the religious fanatics of Islam and Christianity and Judaism and Hinduism. There are many other kinds of fundamentalists, and some of them have gotten away with practicing their tragic magic in a stealth mode. Among the most successful are those who believe in what Robert Anton Wilson calls fundamentalist materialism. This is the faith-based dogma that swears physical matter is the only reality and that nothing exists unless it can be detected by our five senses or by technologies that humans have made. Life has no transcendent meaning or purpose, the fundamentalist materialists proclaim. There is no such thing as a divine intelligence. The universe is a dumb accidental machine that grinds on endlessly out of blind necessity. I see spread out before me in every direction a staggeringly sublime miracle lovingly crafted by a supernal consciousness that oversees the evolution of 500 billion galaxies, yet is also available as an intimate companion and daily advisor to every one of us. But to the fundamentalist materialists, my perceptions are indisputably wrong and idiotic. Many other varieties of fundamentalism thrive and propagate. Every ideology, even some of the ones I like, has its share of true believers -- fanatics who judge all other ideologies as inferior, flawed, and foolish.

I know progressive activists who sincerely believe that every single Republican is either stupid or evil or both. I know college administrators who would excommunicate any psychology professor who dared to discuss the teachings of Carl Jung, who was in my opinion one of the greatest minds of the 20th century. I know pagans who refuse to consider any other version of Jesus Christ beyond the sick parody the Christian right has fabricated. None of the true believers like to hear that there are at least three sides to every story. They don't want to consider the hypothesis that everyone has a piece of the truth. **And here's the really bad news: We all have our own share of the fundamentalist virus. Each of us is fanatical, rigid, and intolerant about products of the imagination that we don't like. We wish that certain people would not imagine the things they do, and we allow ourselves to beam hateful, war-like thoughts in their direction.** We even wage war against our own imaginations, commanding ourselves, sometimes half-consciously, to ignore possibilities that don't fit into our neatly constructed theories. Each of us sets aside certain precious beliefs and symbols that we give ourselves permission to take very seriously and personally and literally. Our fundamentalism, yours and mine, may not be as dangerous to the collective welfare as, say, the fundamentalism of Islamic terrorists and right-wing Christian politicians. It may not be as destructive as that of the CEOs who worship financial profit as the supreme measure of value, and the scientists who ignore and deny every mystery that can't be measured, and the journalists, filmmakers, novelists, musicians, and pundits who relentlessly generate rotten visions of the human condition. But still: We are all infected, you and I. We are fueling the war against the imagination. What's your version of the virus? Try to remember.

Sex abuse, which is much more common than many would like to admit, is a sad, but all-to-common manifestation of sexual desire gone berserk. Harnessing the intense sexual drive can be quite challenging, yet the rewards of doing so can be incredible depth and intimacy with our partners, and yes, better sex, too. A gorgeous woman I met a few years back came from a childhood of intense sexual and emotional abuse. I'll use the name Rachelle for her. Rachelle had a pattern of jumping into sex quickly, only to then soon regret and feel shame about it. The first time she and I really connected, Rachelle had recently decided for the first time to be celibate for several months to break her pattern and learn to really love herself. Shortly after we met, both Rachelle and I acknowledged an intense sexual attraction between us, yet I told her I wanted to support and honor her in this beautiful intention to love herself by holding off on being sexual. She was clear she would not be able to hold back, so I told her I would take responsibility for holding our boundaries. **When I eventually did hold the boundary of not being sexual for several months - even when at times she badly wanted to go there - Rachelle was moved to tears.** She told me she had never been treated with such love and respect. And when months later we finally did surrender to the amazing bliss of full-on sex, it was incredibly ecstatic for both of us. She even found out for the first time that she was multi-orgasmic! Though we were only together a couple years, Rachelle emailed after we parted to thank me for this \"most amazing, deep, healing relationship.\" **Sexual Desire is Natural and Beautiful** The drive towards sexual connection between two", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__sexual-desire.txt:0:0b0e6f184b31", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11294, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__sexual-desire.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__sexual-desire", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "had never been treated with such love and respect.

Though we were only together a couple years, Rachelle emailed after we parted to thank me for this \"most amazing, deep, healing relationship.\" **Sexual Desire is Natural and Beautiful** The drive towards sexual connection between two people who are strongly attracted to each other is a natural and beautiful part of our biology and of being human. The urge to merge is what keeps the human race going. It is where we all came from when our parents surrendered to it. Sexual desire is a divine gift which inspires us to seek out deep connection. Yet the carnal power behind this intense drive all too often causes some to go unconscious and to do things they later regret, like when Rachelle jumped into bed too quickly with many men, only to later feel shame about it. And for some men, once sexual desire kicks in fully, trying to stop or control it can feel like not scratching an intense itch or trying to stop a sneeze about to happen. They feel powerless to control it. For both sexes, this powerful drive can shut down the conscious, thinking mind and the sensitive, loving heart. It can and sadly has led to acts as intense as rape and even murder around the world. Herein lies the root of much psychological and emotional wounding on both individual and collective levels. Yet it doesn't have to be this way. **By holding a strong intention to be ever more conscious and by studying practices like **[**tantra and sacred sexuality**](http://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/19a_sacred_sexuality)**, which give ideas on this, my life and relationships have changed in awesome ways.** I'm most fortunate to have learned to keep my heart open and stay conscious and considerate even when powerful sexual urges arise. I'm thrilled to have learned to dance with and channel this powerful energy in ways that are honoring and supportive not just to me and the person with whom I'm feeling attraction, but to all in my life. **The ability to stay conscious even in the midst of intense sexual connection has left me feeling more free and alive than ever.** I trust myself now that I won't do something I will later regret. I trust myself to honor both my partner and myself even when the hormones are raging in my veins. After years now on this path, I have no doubt that by surfing the rich waves of desire while also keeping my mind and heart present, I can experience the full richness of the powerful sexual connection.

This conscious practice has brought a deep peace, joy, and excitement about life that I doubt I could have experienced otherwise without spending years in an ashram or meditating in a cave. My transformation of this primal drive has made a huge difference even in how I approach women. When I find myself attracted to a woman now, I enjoy letting her know that I feel attracted to her. If she seems open to it, I'll even show fiery passion in my eyes as I express this. Yet even as I show my attraction, I don't at all push it on her. I simply express the attraction and wait for a response. I make clear that though I am attracted, I have no need to do anything about it. She then feels that I'm not pressuring her or trying to get in her pants. How cool that most women immediately relax and open when I'm so clear and honest with them. Staying conscious doesn't mean denying the powerful urges which arise during sexual contact. I love consciously surrendering to the incredibly rich sensations and primal desires when they arise. When we are both feeling that delicious animal intensity and desire, the sex can be absolutely awesome!!! Yet I only go there when the contact is fully consensual and welcomed by my partner. When two people are both in full and clear consent, inviting these deep animal urges and passions to come out in all their primal beauty and power can not only be incredibly rich and ecstatic, it can even heal old wounds around sexuality, as happened in my rich connection with Rachelle. Once a man is sexually aroused, the powerful drive towards ejaculation for many is overwhelming. Some men feel frustrated and even angry if they are not able to release the sexual tension they feel so strongly inside of them. Yet having learned to welcome and play with this dynamic tension without the need to act on it, I can tell you that it can be incredibly rewarding and even ecstatic once you learn to let that tension just be when it is there. Ride that wave like you would a bucking bronco. **As I've gotten ever more comfortable playing with this dynamic tension, I actually feel more excited and alive.** I so love being able to play with the exquisite sexual energies and even use them for higher purposes without a need to go anywhere with them.

I often do this while fully clothed. Now that's safe sex! And the women seem to love this, too. I have had several women break down in tears of gratitude in my arms when I was sexually attracted to them, yet did not try to get into their pants. **Taming the Bad Boy and Bad Girl** Almost every one of us has a part within that is the bad boy or bad girl, that takes pleasure in breaking the rules and doing what we're not supposed to do. Most of us were to some extent in our childhood controlled in ways that felt very oppressive. I know I was. Even though I am very clear now my parents were doing their best, I hated the way they sent me to my room and wouldn't let me go on wild adventures. As a result, breaking the rules and doing what we're not supposed to do can at times feel quite exhilarating. Yet for different people, this desire to be bad can show up in very different ways. Some go so far as to become criminals. For others this desire is easily controlled. The key question is how conscious can we remain when that bad boy or girl part of us comes out. If it's a situation where all involved are in agreement and no one will get hurt physically or emotionally, it can be fun sometimes to let the bad boy out and break the rules or do what we're not supposed to, like joining the \"mile high club\" by making love in an airplane bathroom. Yet if there is any risk of harm, I will not go there. When this bad boy or girl shows up in sexual connecting and it is dealt with in a conscious way that is consensually agreed upon, it can bring a whole lot of fun, pleasure, and ecstasy. Role playing naughty scenes can be a lot of fun! Yet when it expresses in an unconscious way, it can and has led to intense sexual wounding and even deep regrets from those involved. Sadly, this still happens every day all over the world. Yet thanks to people like you and me who are choosing to do what it takes, times are changing.

At the same time, diverse sexual preferences are becoming more accepted and even welcomed. As a species, we are gradually becoming more loving and tolerant of each other. And we are slowly but surely coming to more embrace conscious sexuality as a positive force in our world. **What I've found is that in life in general, and particularly in sexuality, it's all about honoring my natural desires and urges while at the same time committing to stay conscious and fully consensual with everything I do.** Rather than dampening the excitement, I've been thrilled to find that the more conscious I am, the greater the possibility of rich passion and deeper connection. Can I hear a big YES! for staying as conscious and consensual as possible in our sexual connections? This is how we transform our world and bring more joy and passion into our lives.

Pay attention to when you start to go unconscious and make a choice not to go there. Dont deny what you are feeling or thinking, yet also dont act on it unless you are making a clear, conscious choice. As you learn to accept and control your sexual desire, explore sharing about it with others. Lets take sex out of the closet and talk about what works and what doesnt. Consider taking a course in tantra to learn more about controlling and channeling sexual desire in ways that honor all involved.

This awareness also fueled my years of research since on common challenges that can be healed more efficiently in a cultural rather than strictly personal context. * The discovery of a sexual-spiritual split came during a weekend spirituality retreat that I presented in 1984 at Veritas Villa in New York's Catskill Mountains. On Friday evening, I polled the group of forty women and men to determine what areas of recovery they would like to focus on. **A young man in the back of the room sheepishly yelled out, \"Let's talk about sex!\"** Since this was scheduled to be a workshop on \"spirituality in recovery\" everyone found the suggestion amusing. A raucous conversation took place in the room, after which the group implored me to address sex. Always up for a good challenge, I agreed to schedule a Saturday afternoon workshop to investigate sexuality in recovery. In 1984, this was more challenging than it is today. Since the weekend had been created to explore spirituality issues, I felt challenged to integrate the two. There was another aspect of challenge that tested me in the fifteen hours I would have to prepare for the Saturday afternoon workshop. My co-facilitator was a Catholic nun named Sister Greta! A significantly painful aspect of my own internalized sexual-spiritual split was planted by a nun when I was about seven. I had never totally healed from that trauma - talk about synchronicity! Although I knew Sister Greta to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__sexuality_spirituality.txt:0:bddd83ed53d7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11300, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__sexuality_spirituality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__sexuality_spirituality", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "explore spirituality issues, I felt challenged to integrate the two.

A significantly painful aspect of my own internalized sexual-spiritual split was planted by a nun when I was about seven. I had never totally healed from that trauma - talk about synchronicity! Although I knew Sister Greta to be a highly compassionate addictions counselor, I could feel a critical mass building inside. The universe was going to heal me whether I liked it or not. Friday evening, before I went to sleep, I felt deep within that this situation offered a serendipitous occasion for healing. At that point I still didn't know what to do to create interactive participation around this theme of sexuality within the framework of a spiritual retreat. **With all the symbolic transference that Sister Greta elicited, the lingering awareness that she would be observing and participating, embarrassed and unsettled me.** It triggered all my unconscious fears surrounding my own split. It was hell! In the few spare moments I had between facilitating other aspects of the retreat, I observed my experience with sex as it relates to my concept of spirituality in addictions recovery. I decided that I would share my personal experiences with the group as a stimulus for discussion. As the afternoon approached, I could feel both a fear and a mysterious power building inside of me. At lunch I told Sister Greta how nervous I was discussing sex with her in the room. Of course, I see in retrospect that this was highlighting my own sexual-spiritual split even before I had named it. She fortuitously replied, \"Oh, go ahead, go for it Michael! You aren't going to say anything I haven't already heard; and if you do, I look forward to hearing it.\" As the session started, I stood in front of the room nervously holding a piece of chalk. Sister Greta was sitting on a piano bench in the back corner. I looked back at her and we both began to laugh, and at that moment it came to me. I would share with the group my most recent discovery - how I have been separating the concepts of intimacy, sensuality, and sex in my own mind, and how helpful that realization has been to my own sexuality breakthroughs. **I darted to the blackboard and put those three words, intimacy, sensuality, and sex, in that order, from left to right at the top of the board, and started discussing the words. ** Initially, the group was enlivened though chaotic. They tended to want to lump the words together. I could actually see participants' faces twisted in confusion as they attempted to define these words as independent concepts. When the confusion", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__sexuality_spirituality.txt:1:2ade2e2df3de", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11301, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__sexuality_spirituality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__sexuality_spirituality", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "that realization has been to my own sexuality breakthroughs. **I darted to the blackboard and put those three words, intimacy, sensuality, and sex, in that order, from left to right at the top of the board, and started discussing the words. ** Initially, the group was enlivened though chaotic. They tended to want to lump the words together. I could actually see participants' faces twisted in confusion as they attempted to define these words as independent concepts. When the confusion was well established, I suggested that group members call out words they associated with the word \"intimacy.\" As they did so, I wrote the following words under the intimacy column on the board: \"warmth,\" \"communication,\" \"honesty,\" \"caring,\" \"smile,\" \"knowing,\" \"trust,\" \"openness,\" and so on. Then we moved to the center column headed by the word \"sensuality.\" As people got silly and awkward they began calling out these words: \"touching,\" \"candlelight,\" \"smell,\" \"lick,\" \"biting,\" \"tickling,\" \"music,\" \"whispering,\" \"massage.\" The list went on and on. Last, I called for words associated with sex, requesting that we not repeat words already used even though they may have sexual associations. People were obviously embarrassed, as I observed them slyly looking at each other. The presence of Sister Greta was ominous. One woman in front of the room whispered \"penis,\" and everyone in the room giggled as I put it on the board. **Then Sister Greta shouted out \"orgasm,\" and the room went into a roar.** I listed it on the board, too. Then the words just started coming: \"vagina,\" \"cum\" (everyone was curious as to where that spelling originated), \"fuck,\" \"suck,\" \"fantasy,\" \"cunnilingus,\" and a few others. Sister Greta laughed and laughed with a magical healing energy. Without needing to overtly acknowledge or define it, everyone knew that a very special healing was touching us all. This laugher fueled another insight in me. I was reminded of my own recent thoughts on how difficult it had been to merge my sexuality with an on-going, loving relationship. My fear of self-disclosure relaxed, and I saw how I might bring the group to a second tier of discovery by sharing my own polarizations in these areas for the group to identify with. For a few more minutes we lingered with our creation on the board. There were still some confused expressions in the room and some quasi-enlightened remarks. Sam, a 22-year-old former marijuana addict shared, \"I have never thought of separating those ideas before. To me they are all the same thing. Looking at them separately sort of twists my brain. I don't know what to do with it, but it looks like an important discovery. What should I do with it?\" Allowing this question to provide a transition into the next level of the exercise, I asked Sam if he would join me in the front of the room to help demonstrate an answer to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__sexuality_spirituality.txt:2:095b55faaa3d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11302, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__sexuality_spirituality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__sexuality_spirituality", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "have never thought of separating those ideas before.

He agreed. Sam and I stood facing the blackboard. I suggested that he was representing the entire group in this exercise. I already knew that Sam was not married, he did not have a significant other, and he wasn't dating at the time. I asked him, **\"Sam, if you met someone that you were attracted to, what would you aim toward first, intimacy or sex?\"** While doing this I paced back and forth in front of the board pointing at the three headings, first in one direction, then the other. As I \"walked the board,\" I demonstrated the \"journey\" from each side, first starting with sex (a very common starting point when one has an addictions history), through sensuality and finally to intimacy. Reversing myself, I started at intimacy, moved through sensuality, and then to sex. I then asked Sam and the group to tune into their bodies and feelings and imagine that they were entering a dating situation from both sides, and note their feelings and sensations. Sam blurted out, \"I can't do it. I can't go either way. I can start OK, I can do that from either side, although the intimacy would be new to me. But I don't think I can have both. When I was using pot, it was easy to just have sex. Now that I'm clean, it doesn't work that way. My sponsor says I should date and get to know someone first, but I get terrified and just shut down.\" As I continued walking the board, I asked all the participants to raise their hands as soon as I got to a place where they felt they got stuck or paralyzed. In one walk across, every hand in the room, including Sister Greta's, went up. Everyone looked around in surprise - no one more surprised than me. **Every one of the forty participants experienced the same paralysis that I had thought was my unique struggle.** Everyone in the room acknowledged that they had all thought it was their unique struggle. We were all suffering from a sexual-spiritual split. I shared some of the other damaging sexual messages that I received early on: that God was synonymous with love, warmth, family, goodness and wholesomeness, and that sex was shameful, disgusting, sinful (mortally so), ungodly and spoken of only in whispers, dirty jokes and sneers. I also told the group that I", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__sexuality_spirituality.txt:3:b2194f96b8dd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11303, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__sexuality_spirituality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__sexuality_spirituality", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "thought was my unique struggle.** Everyone in the room acknowledged that they had all thought it was their unique struggle.

I also told the group that I had uncovered this internalized unconscious split in myself only recently, and that this discovery was finally allowing me to merge these two dynamic, energetic birthrights. We all have our own version of this internalization. With such a deeply embedded, dualistic concept, how can one possibly bond in love and bring shame-based sex into relationship? The unconscious sends up powerful, though often deceptive, barriers that prevent a fulfilling merger. A good example of this comes from my own childhood. When I was about seven, I attended catechism class, which was a requirement for all good Catholics. The class was taught by a nun in full habit: an imposing authority figure to a little boy! The class had about thirty students; in fact, I can remember sitting in the middle of a row on the left. The nun was explaining the difference between venial and mortal sin (venial being the lesser one, while mortal seemed to mean that you would be doomed to eternal hell). **With these definitions on the blackboard, she pointed at them and strongly proclaimed, \"To touch your private parts, or someone else's, is a MORTAL sin! MORTAL, mind you, not venial.\"** I was in shock: I was already doomed. Not only had I touched my private parts, but I had explored the private parts of friends during our games of \"doctor.\" It was devastating to me: not even eight years old, and I was going to hell. I spent many years thereafter trying to repent to God, making deals to not do it again, only to fail in humiliation and sinfulness. I regretfully share that I was 31 years old before I was able to uproot this demon and quiet the internalized havoc that it brought to my intimate relationships. Patrick Carnes touched on the subject of the sexual-spiritual split in his book on sex addiction, *[Don't Call It Love](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Call-Love-Recovery-Addiction/dp/0553351389/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212513542&sr=1-1)*. He writes, \"Much damage has been done to sexuality in the name of religion. The result inhibits progress on both planes.

Usually within three to six months, bonding begins as you share struggles and joys. At this point the unconscious polarity begins to haunt the relationship. Since you are not necessarily aware of your past damages or repressed traumas, you may begin to amplify your partner's imperfections in an unconscious attempt to sabotage the relationship. Or you might stay in the relationship and feel inadequate because sex is more work than fulfillment. You may even avoid sex altogether. **Simply stated, once bonding occurs, either love or sex must be abandoned. Until we heal this sexual-spiritual split, they cannot seem to live in the same house. ** People began to ask, \"How can we do it?\" In the uncanny, magical flow of that afternoon, I suggested that we move on to the final piece of the exercise and asked for another volunteer. A man in his mid-40s named Gary stood up. His wife Carol, who was sitting beside him, was aghast, laughing and turning red with embarrassment. Someone else roared out, \"You can't do it, you're married.\" Gary cut through the lighthearted bantering and replied, \"Yes I can. I've been married 14 years and sober for 16, and this damn split has haunted every minute of every day of my marriage. I love Carol, but you would never know it by the way I act sexually and intimately. I'd really like to work on this.\" So we did. During a break that preceded this part of the exercise, we had moved the chairs from the center and I procured some large 16\" x 20\" sheets of paper and some felt-tipped marker to make signs. I asked Gary to stand in the center of the room. I thanked Gary for his honesty and courage to take part in this psychodrama, and then asked him to take a deep breath and relax, look around the room, and notice all the friendly faces. He did so, beginning to smile and relax.** I asked him to go deep into his memory and share with us an early message that he received about sex, and to just look within and say whatever comes up without censoring himself. Gary related, \"You'll go blind if you play with yourself.\"** I thanked him and wrote that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__sexuality_spirituality.txt:5:15e886a2417c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11305, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__sexuality_spirituality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__sexuality_spirituality", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "psychodrama, and then asked him to take a deep breath and relax, look around the room, and notice all the friendly faces.

Gary related, \"You'll go blind if you play with yourself.\"** I thanked him and wrote that message with a felt-tip marker on a placard. Then I asked Gary to pick another participant to represent whoever gave him that message, and he selected an older women named Martha. I asked Martha to hold up the placard six feet in front of Gary and face him. Then I asked Gary for another message that he had received while growing up. He responded, \"Women are sluts.\" I put it on a placard and Gary picked another workshop participant to represent the person who had given him this message. This time he picked a big, strapping man in his late thirties named Mike. I invited Mike to hold the placard in front of Gary next to Martha, and begin to form a circle. This continued with messages like \"Sex is sinful,\" \"Vaginas are ugly,\" \"You are a pervert,\" \"Women should be virgins,\" and so on until we had eight people circling Gary and holding placards toward him. **The last message he shared was, \"You will do it if you love me.\" As I wrote the placard, I asked him what it meant. He answered, almost crying, \"That's what my uncle would say to me when he molested me.\" ** As Gary took some deep breaths to regain his composure he said, \"I've never told anyone, not even Carol, about this before. I can't believe I said it.\" The visual image was quite profound: Gary in the center of the room being encircled by these early messages. As Gary tried to compose himself further, I encouraged him to stay present and avoid zipping up his defenses. To enhance the experiential component of the vignette, I asked the \"message bearers\" to turn the placards toward themselves and loudly read the messages to Gary one by one. I instructed them to keep going around and reading them louder and faster until I asked them to stop. This continued for about two minutes, bringing everyone in the room (especially Gary) to a fevered pitch of discomfort. After stopping the action, I checked in with Gary and asked how he was doing. He replied, \"I can't believe I carry all that with me all the time, especially to bed.\" I then asked Carol if she would participate, to help us complete the exercise. She said yes, and I asked her to stand about six feet outside the circle facing Gary.

She said yes, and I asked her to stand about six feet outside the circle facing Gary. I instructed the message bearers to go around reading the messages one more time. Then I asked Carol if all of this made her feel close or distant from Gary. I said, \"Does it make you want to move closer or further away?\" She replied, \"I want to stay right here, I feel like there is a wall between us.\" I then invited the group to share. **Everyone was enlightened by the realization of how these deep inner messages make sexual intimacy impossible.** They could see it and they could feel it; it was crystal clear. I suggested that we move on to a symbolic exercise that would release these unwelcome, uninvited demons. I directed Gary to slowly, one by one, tell the message bearers, \"Take back your lousy message. I don't want it. It isn't mine and it never was.\" I suggested that as he addressed each one, to tear up the placard and then either throw it on the floor or give it back to the bearer and dismiss them from their role. After Gary \"gave back\" the first two messages, I checked in with Carol. I asked her if she was feeling any different. She reported that she felt a little closer to Gary, that he seemed more open and available as he discharged the symbolic carriers of these messages. I suggested that she move closer as she intuitively felt his availability. When all the messages were confronted, Gary just stood there facing Carol and began to gently weep. As all the walls and barriers melted, Carol gracefully moved towards him. As she did, **Gary fell to his knees sobbing, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know. I didn't mean to push you away like that. I have been bringing all of these ghosts into bed with us all these years.\"** Carol joined him in a kneeling position. They embraced in a manner that included all of us in their intimate connection. The wall of shame was gone. The room glowed with a healing spirit. We all spontaneously became more open, affectionate, and tactile. I stood in warm embrace with Sister Greta.

Welcome to the state of the Universe - which is of course, everchanging, same as always. Here we are once again in the here and now, just like last year at this time. So ... are you finally ready to live in the now? Good. We have been waiting for you. What took you so long? With time rapidly becoming a thing of the past (the calendar's days are numbered, you know) people are living in the now like never before. Listen, I know. I was a futurist in a past life. But now, I have no time for time. I am living all the time in the Timeless Now. I think they call that All-Timers. Meanwhile, here on Earth - or as it is known throughout the galaxies, the Comedy Channel - a critical mass of the heretofore uncritical masses are awakening to a serious truth. There's something funny going on. Take politics - please. America's two political parties spent $4 billion on the last election and it worked - the American people were soundly defeated. Once again the Golden Rule was overruled by the rule of gold, and the Constitution overrun by the prostitution. The result is government in greedlock and rule by a one-party system where we the people haven't been invited to the party. We don't exactly have a name for this new system, although I think Futilism describes it pretty well. Thanks to government for hire, voting has devolved into an act of futility. Whether we vote Democratic or Republican, we seem to end up with Dempublicrats running things. Now some mystics - pessimystics they are called - would look at this shituation and see a glass 95% empty. As an optimystic I take the exact opposite position. I see a glass 5% full. Yes, there is good news. An evolutionary upwising is afoot, and left and right are coming front-and-center around a new common sense consensus In Colorado and now two other states, this has meant legalizing cannabis. So what does this mean, other than in the Mile High State you can now legally get a mile higher? For one thing it means a blooming economy selling transcendental medication. Science is now finding that humans", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__state-of-the-universe-swami.txt:0:898eb46fa620", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11309, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__state-of-the-universe-swami.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__state-of-the-universe-swami", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "opposite position. I see a glass 5% full. Yes, there is good news. An evolutionary upwising is afoot, and left and right are coming front-and-center around a new common sense consensus In Colorado and now two other states, this has meant legalizing cannabis. So what does this mean, other than in the Mile High State you can now legally get a mile higher? For one thing it means a blooming economy selling transcendental medication. Science is now finding that humans have THC receptors in the part of the brain called the \"hippiecampus\". When this area is stimulated, people see farce fields and laugh at invisible jokes. There's an old saying - and I know it because I myself made it up many lifetimes ago - the truth shall upset you free. Once again in 2014, inconvenient truths exposed convenient lies. For example, now everyone knows our government is spying on us, and Public Enemy Number One appears to be none other than - the public. Maybe the NSA needs to be balanced out by another three-letter organization, the ICU - Independent Citizens United, where citizens who intensively care about the rule of law can say, \"I see you\" and begin to oversee what we have until now chosen to overlook. **From Monotheism to Stereotheism, and a REAL Conspiracy** There was another sign of the upwising in 2014. Pope Francis took a stand for social justice, making the Catholic Church more non-dominational. And boy, are those purebred dogma breeders upset! It just goes to show that maybe you CAN teach an old dogma, new tricks. Maybe monotheism is evolving into stereotheism, where the same truth comes from multiple speakers, in many different languages, and some with no language at all. After all, there is no harm in harmony, and no sin in synergy. And in the end, every dogma must answer to the same Master. Maybe if religions evolve in this way, John Lennon could imagine \"no religion too\" becoming \"all religions true.\" And for those of us who want peace in the Middle East? Let us first try peace in the Middle West. A first step is to quiet our own barking dogmas, and listen to the silence. Instead of just following the herd, follow the unheard ... right into your own heart. Imagine, Americans from all tribes coming into the same space of silence, and breathing together. Now that would be a REAL conspiracy, and could expose and help us overgrow the con's piracy we have now. The evolutionary upwising calls on people everywhere to rise above the identity issues that each side serves up as dogma chow, and instead focus on the identical issues we face now - like being passengers and crew on Spaceship Earth, citizens and denizens of Gaia. So, come on you Gaians! Time to show your species' pride. And time to evolve from children", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__state-of-the-universe-swami.txt:1:d33eee27af2e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11310, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__state-of-the-universe-swami.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__state-of-the-universe-swami", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "would be a REAL conspiracy, and could expose and help us overgrow the con's piracy we have now.

So, come on you Gaians! Time to show your species' pride. And time to evolve from children of God to adults of Good. Yes, I know. We are collectively in this awkward tween phase called addled-essence. Our essence has been addled by obsolete myth-conceptions. **A Three-Step Plan to Launch the Upwising** So, how do we un-addle our essence? How do we launch this upwising to turn the funk into function, and leave the junk at the junction? I'm glad I asked that question. I have created a three-step program that is mathematically proven to work four times faster than 12-step. If we want to have an upwising, we must wake up ... wise up ... and show up. We must wake up to the awful truth and the awesome opportunity. Yes the world is in serious condition, largely due to our conditioning to be serious. Seriously. And if the problem is serious, then the solution has to be humorous, right? So we wake up laughing as we recognize that we've been running around in circles, chasing our tales. These tales usually tell us that happiness is somewhere \"out there\". It's a sure sign of the upwising when those who've been in hot pursuit of happiness get struck by enlightening and realize, \"Gee, I must have run right past it.\" And in this moment of fool-realization, we fully realize our foolishness and laugh in our own face. This is called self-facing laughter, and it helps us illuminate our world from the inside out. People ask me all the time, \"How can I uplift humanity?\" I take one look at their doomy and gloomy expressions and I say, \"You can begin by uplifting the corners of your mouth in a smile.\" When you feel the levitational pull giving you a natural face-lift, you are literally overcoming gravity. Hearty laughter brings us from the static of the head to the ecstatic of the heart, and we take the second step to upwising - we wise up loving. It has been said that the more we expand our hearts the less we will need to shrink our heads. Beliefs lie in our head, love lives in our heart. So ... are you going to believe those lies? Or live that love? When you [sacrifice being happy for being right](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/stories/hendricks.chemistryofblame1), you know what they call it? Smartyrdom. With laughter and love helping us wise to the occasion, we take the third step. We show up, living and giving.

With laughter and love helping us wise to the occasion, we take the third step. We show up, living and giving. Each of us has been given a special gift, just for entering. So you are already a winner. We are all here to let our light fully shine - the enlightened ones call this full-filament. It is true that the unexamined life is not worth living, and equally true that the unlived life is not worth examining. To \"show up\" means to live life fully, and foolly, laughing all the way. Make a bucket list of all the undertakings you wish to undertake before being overtaken by the undertaker. Express your unique love in the world, and make your life a work of heart. Bring your gift to the party, and show up for the greatest show on earth - REALITY! You know, reality. That's reality TV without the TV. What a movie we're in! A cast of 7 billion, and all of humanity is in the hero's role. And the whole world is on the edge of its seat. Will we achieve critical mass before we reach critical massacre? Will there be an awakening, or a wake? As the great baseball player / philosopher Willie Mays once said, \"That's what we're going to play the game to find out.\" I end this 2015 State of the Universe with good news. When it comes to transformation, we have all the time in the world. And that time is now. May we wake up laughing and leave laughter in our wake. © Copyright 2015 Steve Bhaerman.

After learning in the [last lesson](https://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/02a_media_deception) how the media at times manipulates public perception in disempowering ways, it is easy to blame those in the media for many of the problems in our world. **Yet in order to be the change we want to see in the world, taking responsibility for our own lives is an essential quality.** As a first step to exploring this key topic, the below two-page article discusses the roles of victim and creator, and how when the going gets tough, we have choice as to which role we play.

In spite of tremendous adversity in his life, W Mitchell chooses again and again not to be a victim, but rather to be a powerful creative force in life, and an inspiration to all who know him. **[https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/what_matters_w_mitchell](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/what_matters_w_mitchell)** **It's not what happens to you that matters, it's what you do with it!** After watching this inspiring video clip, think of all the ways you may have blamed yourself or others for shortcomings in yourself or your life. Does it really serve you to blame anyone or anything? What if we choose to accept our circumstances, to accept our lives, and to accept our world just as they are?

Are you willing to change those relationships? Do you know that you have choice and that you alone can change and invite deeper connection into all your relationships? We invite you to consider how you can let go of blame and open to deeper, more meaningful connections in all relationships in your life. Miracles happen when we set our will in motion and hold firm to the intention to support all around us. Taking this further, what might happen if a person chose to take responsibility not only for everything in their personal life, but even for everything in other people's lives? This may sound strange, yet the below article shows how miracles blossomed when one caring individual had the courage to take responsibility to a greatly expanded level.

[**https://www.WantToKnow.info/070701imsorryiloveyou...**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/070701imsorryiloveyoujoevitale)** - Ho'oponopono** Dr. Len states that everything in our lives is our responsibility and that the world is our creation. Though this may seem a bit difficult to swallow, think about it for a minute. Don't each one of us have some influence on what happens around us? Doesn't our individual perception of what is happening in the world around us in some way determine our experience of the world? Remember that if you are willing to consider taking responsibility for everything that happens, this includes not only all of the craziness happening in the world, but also all of the amazingly inspiring and profound things happening everywhere.

Remember that if you are willing to consider taking responsibility for everything that happens, this includes not only all of the craziness happening in the world, but also all of the amazingly inspiring and profound things happening everywhere. Consider what it might be like to take responsibility for all of this together. We invite you to spend some time pondering this one. What if simply changing our deepest held beliefs and perceptions about ourselves and our world literally changes the world? Let it be so, and let it begin with me! **Consider in your life who you are blaming or holding in judgment. Draw up a list of anyone who falls in this category. For some people, the heaviest blame and judgment goes towards themselves. If you fall into this category, make a list of aspects of yourself towards which you harbor these feelings.** Whether the issue is with yourself, others, or both, think about what steps you might take in order to shift towards acceptance and love. Before moving on to the next lesson, consider taking at least one step or developing one intention to let go of blame and judgment and move towards personal responsibility, love, and deeper connection. Even with all of the tools presented in this lesson, it often takes a long-term, continued commitment to make meaningful changes. These issues are rooted quite deep in almost all people's lives. Yet you can choose to take the first step on this journey now. Start with whatever step feels right and best for you. Transforming blame and judgment is often like peeling away the layers of an onion. When you first start, the onion may be huge. Yet after you whittle away enough layers one step at a time, it can eventually become relatively easy to deal with and transform these challenges as they arise in your life. As you release each layer, you shift ever more fully from the role of victim into that of a powerful creator with infinite potential. Take some time to let the wisdom of this lesson integrate into your being in whatever way is most empowering for you. **Taking personal responsibility without the need for blame is a key to integrating everything presented in the Insight Course.** To close this lesson, please watch the short, inspiring video below.

Yet when we open to profound changes, life does not necessarily always become easier right away. Sometimes things get more difficult before we make a significant breakthrough. Along with the new realizations we embrace, challenges sometimes arise which invite us to take what we learn even further. Don't be surprised during your journey through the course if unusual things or strange \"coincidences\" start happening in your life, both challenging and inspirational. If challenges arise, look for the lesson wanting to be learned and open to guidance and support as you remember the unlimited potential inside you. If magical serendipity enters your life, celebrate and enjoy it! Most people experience some of both, with lots more on the inspirational side. **Take Action: **Suggested Activities to Be the Change Explore and write up a list of those you are blaming for problems in your life.

She didn't want to spend a lot of money, so I suggested we go to the local monthly horse auction to see if we might rescue one of the horses from a potential death sentence. **For those of you who are unfamiliar with horse auctions, many times the meat buyers end up taking the unwanted animals at low prices. There are always horses there who have plenty of life left and just need someone to show up and recognize their value, see their heart, and offer them a space where they can just be a loved horse.** We found a few older horses who seemed to be dumped at the auction but still had life left and love to give. My friend decided to bid on two of them. As the auction proceeded, the horses she liked both went to good homes at good prices. In fact, on that day most of the horses went to good homes! It was refreshing, actually. Toward the end, the wranglers herded two young bay Arab/Arab-cross stud colts into the ring. It was clear they hadn't been handled and were not in good shape. I didn't see them out in the paddocks before the auction - I think they were brought in at the last second to avoid the scrutiny of potential buyers. **They ran around the auction pen, scared and defensive. Nobody raised their arm to place a bid before they were run back out of the auction house. Too small to interest the meat buyers. I believe they had been in the Mexican rodeo.** The following month my friend and I went back to the auction yard with high hopes. Again, she saw one or two horses that peaked her interest, so we found our seats and waited for the bidding to begin. The auction went by much like the previous month. The horses she liked went for prices higher than she wanted to pay", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__taming-wild-horse.txt:0:3000a890af3c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11320, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__taming-wild-horse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__taming-wild-horse", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "the auction house.

The horses she liked went for prices higher than she wanted to pay and found good homes. And again, just like the previous month, at the very end of the auction, the wranglers herded in one young bay Arab/Arab-cross who was too small to interest the meat buyers. I immediately recognized him as the smaller of the two we saw at the end of last month's auction. **He was frantic, traumatized, terrified and was clearly in pain.** The auctioneer launched the bidding at $500. I heard people chuckle under their breath as if to say, \"Yeah...not for THAT thing...\" The price came down, and down as buyers watched this lonely horse search for some escape. $300...$200...$100... I felt a mixture of disgust and anger that these people were so incapable of seeing the beauty and will to live in this horse. I saw it, I knew I could help him, but I wasn't there to buy a horse. **Finally, the auctioneer slowed down and said, \"Okay folks, who will take this guy home for fifty bucks?\"** **...ME, apparently! I felt my arm shoot up into the air, declaring to the entire crowd that my heart is the softest.** BANG! The gavel came down, and I now owned a 2 year old Arab-cross who had just been gelded, had no training and a terrible start in life. It's a good thing my friend brought her horse trailer! Like I said, I did not go to the auction looking to buy a horse. At that point in my life I didn't know if I would have a home for the next month, and my marriage was going poorly at best. But in this particular moment, nothing was more important than helping set this horse on a new path in life. I paid my $50 in the auction office, plus tax, and bought a $7 plastic halter. **The clerks in the office looked at me a little funny and said, \"Oh, YOU'RE the one who bought that colt. You'd better be careful. He's out to kill someone.\"** I wasn't worried. Out in the paddock yard people collected their horses, either the ones they bought or the ones they didn't sell. **I saw my new horse alone in a large paddock. I walked over to the gate and stood there for a while. I just stood there, watching him, letting him watch me, smell me, feel me.** **One of the cowboys walking by, swinging his rope.

You let me know, and I'll come rope him for you when you're ready.\"** \"Okay. Thank you.\" I replied, and he walked away, confident of my failure. I stayed quiet at the gate and started looking at what kind of condition this boy was really in. He had patches of bare skin where he had fallen or his hair had been whipped away. He had scars where his mouth had been tied shut with a wire. His legs were covered with cuts and sores, and I was surprised when I noticed that he had one white sock - it was hard to see through the caked dirt and dried blood from a wound slightly higher on his leg. All of these wounds were evidence to me that he had been at the Mexican rodeo where horses are whipped into a frenzy so they'll run blindly. The men display their skill by roping the frantic horse's front legs, bringing them crashing to the ground. His eyes were still strong and bright, though. He was very aware and alive. His spirit was so strong, totally committed to resisting any attempt to force him into servitude. I was in love with him already! My sense is that this colt refused to run. My sense is that he chose to stand and be whipped rather than play along with the tripping, and it landed him back at the auction. He had been through so much, seen so much confusion and pain, and he still emanated the will to not only live, but live free of domination and servitude. **I didn't want to own this horse, I didn't want to train him. I wanted to be his friend.** We stood quietly together on opposite sides of the fence for about 15 minutes. I watched him as he discreetly watched me. Keeping my own mind clear, I opened my heart to give him the best chance to assess for himself who I truly am, what I'm about and whether I was here to fight him or to help him. I opened the gate and stepped into the paddock as if I belonged there.

I opened the gate and stepped into the paddock as if I belonged there. His body faced away from me, and I stayed at least 20 feet away from him. His left ear followed me until I stopped moving my feet. When I did, he turned his head to get a square look at me. **With the plastic halter hanging from my shoulder, I said \"Hello\" silently. I did not approach him. I did not reach out to him with my hand. I stood still, breathing, sharing with him my sense of relief that he had truly found escape from that life of torture.** He let out a big breath and refocused on me, scanning me more deeply. As he did, I took a half step back, letting him know that I understand, that I intend no threat. After another five minutes of silent stillness, I turned away and left the paddock. **The auction yard wranglers were watching from behind the fences and around the corners. They KNEW I was crazy.

She backed her four horse stock trailer up to a wide chute area, and the guys planted themselves up on the fences to watch the show. \"You're gonna need a rope!\" they assured me. \"Okay...thanks.\" was all I said. I was quite happy for their attention, honestly. Call it pride or my own sense of competition, but I wanted them to see what kindness, communication and acceptance can accomplish. I went back to the paddock and walked directly in. I stepped within about ten feet of him and showed him the halter. He turned his head again to watch me, his feet stock-still. **Silently, I communicated to him, \"I'd like you to wear this halter and follow me up through this barn to a large trailer where there is hay and soft bedding. I want to take you where you can eat grass and rest with no whips and no ropes.\"** He felt my offer, contemplated it for a moment and let out a deep sigh.

He exhaled and licked his lips. I turned myself toward the gate as if he and I had already done this walk hundreds of times together. With the slightest pressure on the halter, I asked him to come with me. The gentle release when he responded communicated to him that trapping him was not my intent. He followed me directly, out the gate and up the breezeway of the auction lot holding pens.** And the wranglers watched in silence. This young horse, my new hero, felt a bit claustrophobic as we walked past the holding pens, surrounded by gates and fences, shadows and metallic sounds, but he chose to trust me and walk with me. When we made it to the other end of the paddock area, where the trailer was waiting, we had an audience. But this horse and I were focused on each other. I was focused on bringing him safely, gently into the trailer, he was focused on not being beaten. **We walked into the wide chute area toward the trailer, and I kept walking, again as if he and I had done this together a thousand times. I held thoughts and pictures and sensations in my mind of a young, spirited bay horse traveling safely and comfortably to a place with a large grass pasture and the company of a young quarter horse mare. I saw the picture of him walking gently into the trailer. I felt, even before we stepped into the trailer, the rocking of the trailer floor, the sounds of hooves on the trailer floor, and the rattles you hear when it's holding the weight of a horse. All of these pictures and senses I held with an open heart and offered to him in preparation of the next step in our journey. I felt how this particular trailer, on this particular day was destined to deliver a special horse to freedom.** **Beyond any hope or expectation I could have had, he followed me straight into the trailer with no hesitation.

I called this giant horse in a small body Dufresne (pronounced doo-FRANE) after the main character in one of the most satisfying stories I know, The Shawshank Redemption. Andy Dufresne, in the story, was wrongfully imprisoned for over twenty years, endured unspeakable abuse, and finally, quietly, revealed the injustices of his jailers and escaped through sewer pipes to spend the rest of his days on a Pacific coast beach. Dufresne settled into his new pasture home immediately. His wounds healed faster than wounds are supposed to heal, his hair grew back and he gained weight overnight. **He was immeasurably happy to give his attention, to learn about saddling, hoof care, and the other more pleasant parts of how humans and horses share their lives. Like a kid walking into a candy store for the first time, he'd walk around the pasture with long grass hanging out of his mouth, his whole body engaged in a smile, born again into a completely different world.** *** *The photo is Dufresne the day we brought him home* *[Kerri Lake](http://www.KerriLake.com)has always been known for being \"good with animals.\" Since age 11 she has been studying the differences, and similarities, between humans and the animal kingdom.

Sometimes I wake up with only hints and fragments of powerful experiences and lessons learned, while occasionally I remember quite a bit of detail from my dream school sessions. One time period a few years ago was particularly rich. On several mornings over a period of about 10 days I remembered profound lessons I'd had during night school. On the final morning, I even awoke and continued a powerful dream in a half-awake state for quite a while, communicating with an intriguing force which called itself \"the singularity.\" The first dream school lesson in this series came after exploring at bedtime the infinite question, \"Why am I here?\" In the dream, I was sitting with a number of wonderful friends opening to a deeper ways of being together. On awakening, I attempted to capture in the paragraph below the words and expressions that came to me: \"**As this 'I that is me' self surrenders and opens to the expanded presence of a greater 'I that is we' Self, an energy greater than me is invited in.** As those around me join in opening to this expansive 'I that is we' energy, a place of deep acceptance and honoring of the 'I that is me' within each of us expands into the sacred collective presence of the 'I that is we.'

This expansive, vibrant state naturally envelopes all who join in opening to this divine presence. It illuminates the [divine essence](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#seeing) in each of us and in all of us. Together, our collective expression of this expanded essence transforms our experience of both our internal and external worlds.\" Just a few days later during my nightly dream school session, I found myself slowing down into a state of deep meditation. Once I slowed my consciousness down to a certain point, I found myself flowing in a limitless sea of energy. In this state, I could see that this vast sea in which my awareness now swam was made up of the combined core essence of all beings. Any negative judgments I might have had about anything simple faded away in this infinite, flowing interconnectedness of all beings. I saw clearly that whenever I'm feeling disconnected, I can shift this by simply going inside and slowing down enough to allow myself to open once again to this state of pure beingness in this grand sea of collective awareness. The entry from my daily diary below describes how the process continued a few days later. This entry describes the first day of a three-day fast and silent retreat that year. **August 30:** \"Day 1 of 3 days of silence. Upon awakening this morning, I decided to keep my eyes closed and move into slow, deep breathing where I held my breath at the top of every breath. I did this for a couple hours and found myself in some delicious, inspiring places. Afterwards, I took a number of naps throughout the day with very rich dreams in which I connected with many significant people from my past. One realization was: 'When others look into my eyes, may they see their own infinite magnificence reflected back to them.' I also realized that every major cover-up is somehow a global reflection of our interpersonal struggles.\" **How much have we chosen to abandon each other, and even more importantly, to abandon ourselves through focusing on our differences? Even when we work against the old paradigm, we are choosing more polarization and judgment. When instead we work to support [what's best for all](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#whatsbest) of us, we create transformation which transcends duality.** A culmination of this period of rich dream training came on the morning of Sept. 2nd, just after completing my three days of silence. I awoke that morning from a dream where I was having a connection with the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__the-singularity-dream-school.txt:1:1544f9879593", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11328, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__the-singularity-dream-school.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__the-singularity-dream-school", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "to abandon ourselves through focusing on our differences?

I awoke that morning from a dream where I was having a connection with the force I mentioned which called itself the \"singularity.\" For those who aren't familiar with the scientific concept of [the singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity), it is a postulated point of rapid change in the near future when computer intelligence surpasses human intelligence. Some fear that computers will rapidly take over our world at this time. Though the singularity with which I had this conversation might have a vague resemblance to this scientific description, it was also something qualitatively quite different - some type of greater collective consciousness. As I awoke from this powerful dream, I was amazingly able to continue in a partially awakened state the energetic conversation with this \"singularity.\" I was informed that it works against no individual, yet disintegrates rigidly structured groups. It is a force of creative chaos. It uses chaos to disorder the old ways and form a deeper, more flexible order based in the individual's direct relationship with the All. It only threatens rigidly structured groups which attempt to control the individual. The singularity is in some ways the antithesis of the old scientific paradigm which wants to order, categorize, and control everything. The singularity opposes rigid control and works on an individual level. The parts of each individual which are attached to control and rigid structure cannot help but crumble in the face of this potent force. The singularity provides the fire which heats the cauldron into which all individuals are eventually drawn. All individual attachments to rigid and controlling behavior must dissolve in this transformative cauldron to open to a new interconnected crystallization based in creative chaos. **The singularity is a force of both disintegration and integration. As it opposes strict rules which create control over the individual, the singularity is a force of destruction and disintegration for rigid ritual practices. Yet this disintegration leads to an integration into ever greater awareness and more profound connections. The singularity is a force of creative inspiration for fluid ceremony which welcomes chaos and the change it brings.** While I continued in this half-awake state, the singularity showed me how it is devouring the old hierarchical structure even now. The old static forms are being transformed into more malleable concepts [based in intention](https://www.WantToKnow.info/lifepurposeintentions) and [fluid intelligence](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fluidintelligence). Those who need security in the midst of chaos will increasingly find it only in clarity of intention.

Those who need security in the midst of chaos will increasingly find it only in clarity of intention. Those who have moved beyond the need for security will soar on the wings of fluid intention and creativity. Pay attention to the intention and let go of the need for form and structure. **Creative chaos heals us and our world by disintegrating rigid structures which no longer serve the awakened individual, thus creating the space for a greater reintegration. ** For many centuries, society has most highly praised those who sacrificed themselves to serve others. Yet the singularity represents the highest essence of both service to others and service to self. In its deepest essence, service to self clearly serves the All because the deepest desire of the self is to feel loved, appreciated, and connected. Selfish and greedy behavior create only temporary states of happiness which in the long run do not serve the Self's deeper needs and desires, and thus are not service to self in its deepest essence. In the same way, when service to others sacrifices the self and leaves it drained or damaged to the point where it is much less effective, it does not in the long run serve others. It is time now to find a creative balance between service to self and service to others. **When we fully serve either ourselves or others in the deepest, purest sense, we cannot help but serve the good of all of us. It is time to let go of the focus on only serving others or only serving the self so that we can move into the joy of being in service to All, which includes both self and others.** The singularity is not the All That Is, but rather a force of balance within the All. It welcomes pure desire as passion, yet beware of desires which arise from the need for control and security. These in the end cannot help but create more separation and disconnection. **When, however, passion arises from a place of [clear intention](https://www.weboflove.org/lifepurposeintentions), the arrow of consciousness soars powerfully into the infinite potential of the creative unknown. Intention is a clear point of willful consciousness which gives both direction and purpose to life without any attachment to future outcome.** As a result of this intriguing conversation with the singularity that morning, I saw that I am a bridge through which creative chaos can flow. I fully open myself to being a bridge to expanded consciousness, and invite all around me to join me in this.

I fully open myself to being a bridge to expanded consciousness, and invite all around me to join me in this. Those who develop the clearest intentions naturally cause those around them to explore and clarify their own intentions. My purpose is to facilitate the clearest intentions of all of us, even as we welcome the mystery of creative chaos. I wouldn't be here if I weren't called here for this purpose by all of us, which is to say by All That Is. What powerful connections and realizations during this period! I saw clearly how the old paradigm places the group above the individual and establishes a [top-down hierarchy](https://www.WantToKnow.info/divinewisdomunderstanding) to enforce this. I saw how the group mind of this paradigm creates a consensus reality to which individuals conform. In the new paradigm, however, each individual involved embraces their role as a co-equal creator of any group to which they belong, and as co-equal creators of their own reality who take [personal responsibility](https://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/03a_personal_responsibility) for their creation. Thus, the new communities we are creating will not have rules, but rather guidelines based on clear, flexible intentions. **We are shifting to a place where each one of us is involved in a continual process of co-creating our reality together, with a much deeper awareness of the divinity inherent within every one of us.** The singularity is upon us now, assisting us through the process of creative chaos to clear the way for both individuals and communities to fully embrace this exciting new paradigm. I and many others are excited to be a part of this powerful shift to support all individuals in rising to their true divine glory together. **Side note:** Particularly as a means to balance my at times overwhelming feelings of busyness, I love the morning times of inspirational reading I've set aside for myself. Many great, inspiring books have come my way that I get to enjoy during this time. Consciousness researcher Stanislav Grof's autobiography *[When the Impossible Happens](http://www.amazon.com/When-Impossible-Happens-Adventures-Non-Ordinary/dp/159179420X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1383888178&sr=1-1&keywords=when+the+impossible+happens+adventures+in+non-ordinary+realities)* was particularly rich and enlightening with it's colorful and amazing adventures into alternate realities.

I could not have dealt with a family issue without the knowledge I gained from this course.** It all feels a bit unreal, but I think my previous life was the unreal one. My life now is based on knowing more, feeling more, contributing more, doing more, sharing more. I can no longer remain hidden away. I need to get myself out there and make a contribution.

In this journey that has lasted ten months, I have been challenged and inspired to explore every niche of darkness and polarity, both internally and externally; not to cast them out, but to form a deeper acceptance and understanding of all that is part of me. I took my time with each lesson, taking special note where I wanted to quickly gloss over a topic or avoid facing it for weeks. **The course has gently guided me to transform from trapped victim to interconnected creator, while deeply honouring my personal struggles and beliefs. **Thank you so much for putting this course together and crafting it so carefully and lovingly! ~ Trish R. The Transformation Course is excellent. It helped me to know that there are others who are trying to find the balance between uncovering the darker side and honoring the light and love that we each are. I give the course an A+. ~ Tom Hansen, Ph.D. The transformation work has helped me to get grounded when people, information and energies around me are going wacko. ~ Mary A. **I am forever indebted to you for being instrumental in changing my attitude towards my parents, which in the past was one filled with deeply rooted bitterness and anger. You have convinced me that I solely am responsible for my own circumstances, and that in order to change them, I am the one who has to change. My new attitude is already starting to pay huge dividends, and I am eternally grateful. ~ David J.** The most empowering, thought-provoking, shit-disturbing message that you repeat over and over is the acceptance of what is and the power of love as a transformational tool. I thank you for that. I am doing the sacred breath work more often and with a wider variety of others - friends, enemies, family, the transformation team. I find myself humming almost non-stop and definitely am smiling more! ~ Cathy M. **To understand why those who wrote these appreciation messages have so much gratitude for the free Transformation Course, [click here](https://www.transformationteam.net).** This course is amazing and has definitely changed my life.

I feel your love and send sacred love to you all. ~ Julie W. My recent journey of discovery began a few years ago with a personal investigation into 9/11. After much research, I had come to the conclusion that what was happening was completely out of my control, and that there was little to no hope for a species gone this over-the-top insane. So my projected outlook was dismal to say the least. Then I was sent a fortuitous email which led to my decision to take this course. The course's vision of mixing sober dark information with valid inspirational information is just what the doctor ordered in my case. A year later my outlook is soberly revised toward the opposite end of spectrum. Those 21 lessons were the perfect catalyst that led me on a journey of discovery that I could have never possibly imagined. Thanks to all involved for being a true light in the \"apparent\" darkness when I so sorely needed exactly that! ~ Chris B. **No doubt about it, my life has changed drastically since I began this course.** I am learning how to eliminate fear of the unknown. I feel liberated and so energized ... WAY beyond anything like the illusion that was my life when I was addicted to meth. People are starting to notice and to wonder what I am doing differently. :) And I am surprised in a pleasant way that when I introduce these ideas, folks I share these ideas with are eager to learn. Thank you all for being here. ~ Roxi I'm an entirely different person now from when I began. My consciousness is expanding in many ways. Working out my intentions has brought me tools that are helping me to create a new experience of the hologram. I wouldn't change a thing about the course.

I think you literally saved my life.** A couple years ago I started poking my nose into worldly affairs on the web. The more I poked, the more peace and serenity left me. Fear is not a comfortable chair. My friends and family got really tired of listening to me. Next step was they'd run if they saw me. It would have been a tight race to see which would be my demise - fear or friend with gun. A week before finding the course, I said a prayer asking for a solution to the havoc caused by my search for knowledge. Not sure how I spied it, but it shined its light and I knew this was for me. Prayer answered, Thank you, God! ~ Kate Q. I want to tell you how much I appreciate the positive impact you have made in my life. Since beginning the transformation team lessons, I have an entirely new outlook on life. I had a tendency to blame other people in my life for my problems and at times was battling with feelings of bitterness. When I found out about 9/11, I eventually fell into a pattern of seeing everything in terms of right vs. wrong and us vs. them. Now my attitude has been transformed. I don't like what happened on 9/11, but I have accepted it. The anger and hatred is gone, and I am at peace with myself. I still want to wake up the world, but I no longer feel the desire to arouse hatred. I have learned to accept all that is, and I have learned to accept myself as I am. I do love myself and I do love the world, and I want to make it a better place. But I can only change it if I have love in my heart. Love conquers all. ~ David J. **The truly remarkable synchronicities and coincidences between things on the site and things in my life seem to happen so much with the Transformation Team materials!** It feels as though there are constant epiphanies going off in my mind/spirit.

I have cried while sending you this email. These are tears of love and gratitude to the magnificent experience of being human and in service to the divine plan of overcoming the shadows of humanity, as we ascend into the light beings we were truly meant to be ... co-creators of a new earth ... a new heaven, here and now. ~ Teri G.

I know I will be returning to many of these lessons over and over till they become a regular part of my life. ~ Randy R. Each day I find more peace of mind and am experiencing so much growth. I am feeling so centered and peaceful. I am finding the course wonderful, and am excited everyday that I can spend the two hours or so for each lesson. ~ Jennifer I am blessed and privileged to be a part of such a wonderful team of vibrant souls. To see the manifestation of this course in so many areas of my life is extremely reassuring. **I have come a long way from being someone who was always tough on himself and self persecuting.

I've been scouring your site, breathing and being grateful for all that occurs in my life (past, present and future). I find that I'm much more hopeful and excited - and much more interactive once again with people. So, it follows that breakthroughs are beginning to occur - my health is restored, my daughter found a house, and I'm back to the gym. ~ Cathie B. I have been questioning the value of taking a close look at the dark underbelly of the collective shadow. I don't see anyone around me doing that except my husband. Some spiritual friends say, \"Why not just focus on the light?\" I had an experience with lesson four which has moved this inquiry forward. After reading the story of the Christmas Truce, I found myself spontaneously breaking down sobbing. It was after reading the last line of the song: \"That the ones who call the shots won't be among the dead and lame, and on each end of the rifle we're the same.\" I was crying out of a deep sense of responsibility for being a part of that which caused this. I had a sense (which my mind doesn't yet understand) that I am not separate from \"the ones who call the shots\" who I have had so much disdain for. For once, I had a sense of not being separate from \"them.\" I have so far held myself as \"not a part of that\" and \"better than\" them. I got a glimpse of how much of the same vicious insanity is in me, and has been in me. I am willing to wake up out of that insanity, but that does not make me different or better. And I am not separate. Thank you for putting this course together.

Thank you sooo much! ~ Esther V. **This course has most definitely altered the course of my life. A new found sense of peace is dawning on me.** The past few weeks have been a little odd for me, to say the least. I am excited about getting out of bed in the morning. I've been much more productive and cooperative at work. I noticed one coworker who rarely would talk to me before now offers me wisdom out of nowhere. As for my love life, my girlfriend actually told me, \"I don't know how you did it, but it's like you created a world where love can thrive.\" Our relationship has taken off. It's fascinating how my life has been altering before my eyes. I have healed a great deal since I started this course. I have been enjoying foods that I previously believed I couldn't eat due to allergies. I have been enjoying new exercise routines and activities with friends. I even started liking my job. I am reconnected with the love inside myself and it's touching every area of my life. Even my girlfriend started believing in things she never thought about before. I believe all this is because many of my old barriers have been removed, as I learn new ways to love myself, love others, forgive, be responsible for my health, and heed the advice of others. **So I would say that this course is fantastic.

This will take time for me to transform, but I can see how important it is that I stop making people wrong for their lacks and imperfections. Before the transformation course, I blamed the power elite for everything I hated about the world. I can see now that everything that has happened was for a reason, part of the evolutionary process of my species, and I'm lucky to be alive for the mass spiritual awakening that has yet to fully unfold.** To be honest, rapid transformation has it's tough spots, and sometimes I still long for the old me... the rebellious, arrogant, know-it-all kid from which I got a feeling of superiority and security. But then I think about what I have gained: I'm healthier, closer with loved ones, have some semblance of self-discipline, and I actually feel like I understand what's going on in the world around me. I finally know where I stand. It brings me tremendous peace, and I can't wait to connect with the community that this course work has helped to build. ~ Daniel G. **To begin your journey with the profound Transformation Course, [click here](https://www.transformationteam.net).** **Final Note: If you don't have time for the entire course, most participants have found [lesson 3](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/ttcourse03a) and [lesson 20](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/trfc20a) to be the most profound.** **For more inspiration: ** See our awesome collection of a variety of inspiring resources [available here](https://www.momentoflove.org/inspiringresources).

So I was thrilled when a progressive friend and supporter committed to moving beyond polarization sent me the below results of her experiment of stepping into the shoes of the opposition. Whether you are a Trump hater or a Trump lover, I invite you to read this inspiring story and then consider what it might be like to try to step into the shoes of those you oppose.

What if the holy grail of building a brighter future for ourselves and our world takes the form of moving beyond polarization and doing our best to respect and understand our differences?

July 2020** As a bit of background, I have nearly always considered myself a liberal. I aligned with Bernie Sanders on policy when he ran in 2016. I've voted Democrat in all presidential races, and probably most senatorial races for the last 30 years. While I knew a fair amount with regard to what I'd call hidden knowledge, and believed both parties were corrupt and \"two sides of the same coin,\" I held out hope that my party of choice was somehow a little better. Then came the 2016 Sanders campaign and the WikiLeaks documents, when I came to understand that the Democrat primary was mostly just for show. I saw that there was no chance for Bernie to win. It crushed me in a way. In another way, it provided me the opportunity to look at things differently than my friends. **As I grew up in New York, the Trump name has been around for as long as I can remember. I didn't have a favorable opinion of him. But I also didn't think of him as a monster.** I couldn't understand why my friends would give him that much hate. It wasn't the same distaste and distrust that was given to George H.W. Bush - it was extreme, even before he took office. It didn't seem to match who he was. Again, I didn't like Trump and was disappointed that he won. I worried about the direction of the country,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__trump-moving-beyond-polarization.txt:0:c5d10d37ca63", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11343, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__trump-moving-beyond-polarization.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__trump-moving-beyond-polarization", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "I didn't have a favorable opinion of him.

I worried about the direction of the country, but I also felt like people were reacting in a way that didn't make sense to me. True hatred. I saw it again and again in the media that I would, up until then, turn to regularly. They were breathless to see him fail. My parents brought me up to respect the office of president. My spiritual beliefs taught me that you give energy to the things you believe deeply.** On the day after the election, I posted to Facebook that I prayed for Trump's success, as his success was our success. I was attacked and \"unfriended\" by many people I called friends. I just wasn't willing to see him as a monster, as I didn't want a monster to be our leader. **I was willing for him to succeed. Actually, I was even willing for him to be one of the best presidents this country ever had. Funny, I couldn't say that out loud. I started asking myself why there was almost a religious fervor around hating him so much. When we went into mid-March this year and the pandemic task force was on TV every day, I saw my friends saying things like, \"I refuse to watch him.\" But then they would criticize what he said when they didn't actually see him say it. **As an experiment, I decided that I would just watch Trump every day for 30 days. Not only that, but that I would watch him as though he were someone I liked and wished well. ** It was such an interesting experience. Initially, it was difficult to listen to him. He would go off on tangents or repeat himself. He clearly didn't like certain people in the press corps and would be contentious with them. I had to continually remind myself that this was someone I wished well. I imagined he was my favorite teacher at school, or maybe a student of mine, or brother or uncle - whatever worked. As I gradually got better at seeing him in a positive light, I found myself wanting to yell at the TV when he would fall for the questions purposely set to trap him so as to create an unfavorable sound bite for the press corps. I knew, as he was saying it, the very things that would make the headlines the next day.

I would shake my head when my friends would post on social media about drinking Clorox, or whatever the sound bite of the day was. Yet I know that isn't what he said. That is clearly not what he meant. When you care for someone, you can look beyond the words to the intent. **I started to feel what it must be like to deal every day with people who want to trip you up, twist your words, and make you look foolish to the world. **Here was this person in a position of dealing with something no president in our lifetime ever had to deal with, yet it seemed like the majority of the people in the country were actively wishing that he would fail. Can you imagine what it would be like if you are doing your job and people and the media around the world are criticizing you and hoping you fail? How well would you perform? Wouldn't you have a better chance of succeeding if everyone wished the best for you? In summary, this little experiment taught me a few things. With regard to Trump himself, I think he's doing his best to move the country forward. I think he honestly loves the country. I think he also is rightfully tired of battling his haters. I still have major issues with some of his policy. I have a particularly difficult time with his environmental policy (or lack thereof), and his inability to do anything significant for everyday people with regard to healthcare. And I continue to have a huge disconnect with Trump's personal interactions. He's so loud and self-centered, and often not the most genteel of statesmen. On the other hand, he's structured real prison reform. He's gone after pedophiles, child pornographers, and drug cartels in a way that I've never seen. I see major arrests happening all over the country. These people are being brought to justice and children are being saved. That alone is reason enough for me to tolerate the rough personality. I've become a realist with regard to him. **He is a flawed human - not a monster. That fact grounds me when the corporate owned media spins out of control with outrage over his most recent tweet.** Overall with this experiment, I learned the importance of looking to first hand knowledge.

I also won't fall for the mob that tells me how to think or what is \"safe to say.\" This is one of the most dangerous things that has come out of this time.

The below essay explores the veil between the worlds which serves to keep our awareness separated from the divine realms and focused on life in this physical world with all of the incredible drama it presents us. I wrote this essay a number of years ago after two profoundly mind-altering experiences I was blessed to have as a result of doing intense yoga in extreme heat. **By becoming ever more aware of this veil and what is beyond it over the years, my life has been greatly enriched.** I invite you to open to the possibility that their is much, much more to this world than what we perceive with our five senses. Please take what works for you and leave the rest. With very best wishes for a transformed world, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for the [PEERS empowerment websites](https://www.peerservice.org) **The Veil Between the Worlds** The consciousness of each one of us is a unique, yet integral part of an infinite field of interconnected vibration. Each of us is playing a distinct and vital role in the exploration of all that is possible as part of this universal field of vibration in this forever unfolding moment of now. Though we may at times feel separate from all that is around us, the more we open to our connection with this mystical field of limitless possibility, the more we can embrace our infinite potential as unique, magnificent, and creative expressions of the universe. The collective intelligence of the universe appears to have created a veil which serves to greatly limit the awareness of our individuated consciousness on incarnating into this time-space world. On passing through the veil and taking on a human body, we forget who we are. We lose awareness that on the most expanded levels we are always connected with everything around us. We forget the limitless potential that is always available both within and outside of ourselves. **Yet even though we may have forgotten our magnificence, our incarnation into this physical reality and the accompanying loss of awareness of our divine heritage serves a greater purpose. By becoming unconscious of our greater role and our interconnectedness with All That Is, we are able to explore realms which might not otherwise be accessible. ** This deeper purpose can be quite difficult to comprehend while our consciousness is housed here in limited physical bodies which focus our awareness largely on only three dimensions and five senses out of the limitless possibilities available. Due to this veiling process, our thinking and experience of life on Earth tends to be consumed with the more limited realities immediately surrounding", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__veil-between-the-worlds.txt:0:09f91a0da4c7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11350, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__veil-between-the-worlds.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__veil-between-the-worlds", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "our interconnectedness with All That Is, we are able to explore realms which might not otherwise be accessible. ** This deeper purpose can be quite difficult to comprehend while our consciousness is housed here in limited physical bodies which focus our awareness largely on only three dimensions and five senses out of the limitless possibilities available. Due to this veiling process, our thinking and experience of life on Earth tends to be consumed with the more limited realities immediately surrounding us. Yet when we die and our consciousness is released from the body and this physical plane, we pass back to the other side of the veil where it is possible to view the Earthly lives we just lived from a [highly expanded vantage point](https://www.WantToKnow.info/neardeathexperience). With the veil removed, our awareness expands far beyond the confines of this time-space world and suddenly everything in the lives we just lived makes sense. This side of the veil seems to function in such a way that the external is a reflection of the internal. There is an ever-unfolding perfect balance between the two. That said, it appears there may be a time lag between a shift in internal awareness and its reflection on the outside likely due to the linear quality of time here. **The more conscious we choose to become of [the mirroring](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#gratitude) of the internal and external worlds, the more easily we are able to surrender to the deeper meaning and realities of life and from that place do our part in [bringing heaven down here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/consciousnessparadigms#descent). ** **More on the Veil** This veil causes us humans to forget our shared divine heritage for the purpose of exploring what it's like to feel separate and disconnected, and to play the games that arise from this. The veil creates the illusion that because physically we are separate, spiritually we are disconnected as well. Yet as individuated fragments of the Divine, we can all assist the Divine in having a richer and ever more expanded experience of itself and all existence. Life on Earth can actually be a great game for exploring consciousness for those who see the veil for what it is and understand that even as we are physically separate here, spiritually we are all intimately interconnected in this divine cosmic dance. The veil obscures our consciousness from awareness of the absolute sacredness and divinity of all life, so that we often doubt that we are divine at our core or that the universe is a divine and loving presence. This doubt can engender intense emotions and great drama which provide the stage upon which we explore life with all of its intense richness here. Most souls on Earth are deeply mired in the shadow aspects of the veil, so much so that they have great difficulty seeing or even believing that there is a veil or that there might exist", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__veil-between-the-worlds.txt:1:b8d5653f23e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11351, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__veil-between-the-worlds.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__veil-between-the-worlds", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "often doubt that we are divine at our core or that the universe is a divine and loving presence. This doubt can engender intense emotions and great drama which provide the stage upon which we explore life with all of its intense richness here. Most souls on Earth are deeply mired in the shadow aspects of the veil, so much so that they have great difficulty seeing or even believing that there is a veil or that there might exist expanded dimensions beyond this veil. They are steeped in the drama of life on Earth. And they tend to believe that this three-dimensional, five-sensory world is all we've got. **Yet a small, ever growing number of souls here now are awakening to and exploring the veil and what lies beyond it. These souls are increasingly connecting with each other so that they can shine their individual and collective light ever more brightly as they invite any who are open and interested to join in their dance towards ever greater love and harmony. ** Conscious, deep breathing and accessing our feelings more fully are keys to connecting ever more fully beyond the veil. Deep breathing seems to open the energetic channels, allowing us to pierce the veil and embrace the absolute divinity that we are. When I focus on nothing but deep, slow, full breaths for even 10 minutes, I am amazed at how much my mind quiets down and my consciousness opens to expanded dimensions. [More intense breathwork](https://www.weboflove.org/loveideasexercises#charging) sometimes even takes me beyond the veil. **Thoughts and Feelings Matter** **Every thought and emotion that arises within us radiates both inward and outward as a distinct energy form.** In other words, every thought and every feeling we have emanates out to the world and into ourselves as an energetic vibration. These energy forms then interact with those around us and with the entire field of collective consciousness. On some level, we are also picking up on the combined thought and feeling forms or vibrations of everyone and all that is around us. Yet [we always have choice](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/ttcourse03a) in how we respond to what enters our energetic space and awareness. When an energetic form from outside of us enters our space, if there is no resonance with anything in our energetic field, it simply passes through us. We don't notice it and go on unchanged from the state of consciousness we were in before it passed through. When, however, there is some resonance (or resistance) in our energetic field, this form then affects us. The amount we are affected depends on the strength of the form and how much our energetic field is in resonance or in resistance to this energetic form. Most people are constantly affected by thought and emotion forms from outside of themselves. When someone walking down the street gives us a dirty look, an energy form is created", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__veil-between-the-worlds.txt:2:6f46a012a6a5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11352, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__veil-between-the-worlds.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__veil-between-the-worlds", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "in before it passed through.

Most people are constantly affected by thought and emotion forms from outside of themselves. When someone walking down the street gives us a dirty look, an energy form is created and enters our awareness. When we perceive this, if we are super busy or feeling very confident of ourselves, we might hardly notice it. Yet someone who has deep inferiority issues might take that same energy form in and interpret it as further proof that they are inferior. **[How we interpret](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/victim_or_creator_vs) and respond to the energy forms that enter our space makes all the difference in our experience of life.** **The Process of Physical Manifestation** On this side of the veil, physical objects around us appear very solid and real. Yet on an energetic level they are manifestations of collective thought forms. Take a car for example. Any car you see once started as a creative thought form in someone's mind. This thought form was shared with others. A team of people then added their thoughts to further refine the original thought form. This collective design process eventually refined that original thought form of the car until it manifested as a blueprint on paper. The blueprint was then sent to a factory where this inscribed collective thought form was actually produced to become the physical form that you see out on the street. And for every car out there, the person who bought it felt an internal resonance with both the style and price of the car which caused them to eventually buy it. This is an example of how every car is the physical manifestation of a collective of thought forms. **Could it be that in the same way, thought forms create everything in physical reality on this side of the veil? **Consider that the Earth itself may be an expression or creation of the combined thought forms of humanity and all beings involved with the planet. And each of us may on an energetic level be a co-creation resulting from the thought forms of all around us interacting with our unique consciousness. **Could it be that through this energetic process of manifestation, we all co-create each other through our projections and interpretations of ourselves and each other?** I suspect that the more conscious we become of this divine co-creative process, the more easy it is to surrender to the divine mystery of life, and from that place of surrender to powerfully create into the unknown. **My Journey Into the Mystery** I love opening to the fluid state of energetic interconnectedness I feel beneath this three-dimensional physical reality.

On opening to the flowing sacred vibrations which connect all of us in that state, I feel rejuvenated. It's like allowing the vast ocean of all consciousness to lovingly embrace this unique drop of consciousness that is me. I very much enjoy using breathwork, dancing, yoga, sacred medicines, sacred sexuality, dreams, eye gazing, and more to get to this beautiful state of greater awareness. As an example, the inspiration and ideas for this particular essay came to me during two Bikram yoga sessions, one on Feb. 19th and the other March 6th of 2013, in which I was able to fully access this deeper state. There are times when I am able to focus my awareness and open to this state even in my day-to-day life. When this happens, I can see your individuated, physical body on the outside while at the same time I feel beneath the physical form our interconnectedness with each other and with all of existence. In that place, I experience no physical separation between us. **The veil creates apparent separation on the outside, yet as I explore these mysteries from this side of the veil, I'm finding I am increasingly able to come back to that place deep inside where I know without doubt that we are all always connected. This very much helps to keep everything in a greater perspective in my life.** For my entire adult life, I've had an unwavering commitment to [what's best for all beings](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#whatsbest). I've also had a strong [desire to know](https://www.WantToKnow.info/) how life works on all levels. I feel that it is thanks to both of these that I've been privileged to see and experience some of the incredible mysteries of the deepest levels of the universe, and to explore how individuated consciousness interacts with collective consciousness and the infinite fields of energy which make up our universe. For this, I am incredibly grateful. And I'm more than happy to share what I've discovered with any who are interested, and to learn from you and others about your explorations into life and the universe. I so enjoy learning, growing, and co-creating with you and with all of us in this grand divine mystery. **Co-creating a Map of Transformation Beyond the Veil** When I'm fully experiencing the other side of the veil, my interconnectedness with the universe is very clear and unquestioned.

Yet on my journeys there, I have also seen other souls from this planet consciously exploring these realms. They, too, were finding ways to pierce the veil and enter a state of multidimensional interconnectedness. And we saw each other there and were excited to feel our conscious connection beyond the veil. I have no doubt that an ever increasing number of us exploring those realms are consciously co-creating a [web of love](https://www.weboflove.org) and interconnection which we can use even when our consciousness returns to the normal veiled existence on Earth. The more of us who join in doing this, the more that beautiful web crystallizes. And the more it crystallizes, the more it's brilliance and allure can reach those mired in the veil back home. It's as if we're weaving this web together to create a map of transformation that anyone can use to find their way to these expanded states of bliss. Ever more souls are choosing to reach beyond the veil and experience interconnectedness on a soul level. We are gradually discovering that our true home can be right here and right now. And we are creating and crystallizing a growing network of individuals who are present in this three-dimensional world, yet fully conscious of our interdependence and interconnectedness. We are laying down paths that anyone can follow to journey beyond the veil and connect up with this awesome network of expanded consciousness. **This is the map of transformation that we are co-creating. The paths are there, and all are invited. It's up to each one of us whether or not we accept the invitation, and how far down this path we want to travel. I invite you to come play with us in this beautiful and expanded state, where we fully know and experience our divine interconnectedness, and then to bring that state back into our normal lives.

Quantum entities exist in a multiplicity of simultaneous potential states (called a superposition), hovering in an abstract realm between existence and nonexistence prior to being observed. There is no independent quantum entity separate from its properties. Its properties are a function of our observation. This is to say that these quantum entities aren't real in the way we ordinarily think of something as being real. The act of observation is the very act which turns the potentiality of the quantum world into the actuality of the seemingly ordinary world. Our act of observation not only changes the present state of the universe, it reaches backwards in time and changes what we can say about the past. This turns our conception of linear time and causality on its head. The questions we ask make a difference. The universe is a seamless, undivided and instantaneously interconnected whole. This is to say that each part of the universe is interrelated with every other part in an immediate and unmediated way. An expression of this wholeness is the universe's nonlocality, in which every part of the universe is related to and in communication with every other part. Our universe doesn't play by the typical rules of third-dimensional space and time.

Our universe doesn't play by the typical rules of third-dimensional space and time. Quantum entities can jump from one place to another without traversing the path in-between. The laws of physics are not written in stone, but are mutable. The quantum universe is not separate from consciousness; rather, it is an expression of consciousness. Mind and matter are no longer seen as separate. Our ordinary, day-to-day universe is quantum through and through. Quantum physics literally changes and transforms our mind, as it introduces a new way of thinking. It also helps us see the world differently, which helps the world to manifest differently. Quantum physics is showing us how we ourselves are moment by moment playing a key role in the creation of our experience, as well as in the genesis of the cosmos, in this very moment. Significantly altering Descartes' famous principle, \"I think therefore I am,\" quantum physics would instead say, \"I choose therefore I am.\" Quantum physics is a revelation in living form: it is showing us the dreamlike nature of our universe. **1. INTRODUCTION** For the last few months, all I've wanted to do is to read about quantum physics. [[1]](#1) I've been studying quantum physics off and on for decades, but have never gone as far down the rabbit hole as I have this time. It feels like I've gone through the looking glass to the point of no return. The more I contemplate what quantum physics is telling us, the more my mind gets blown into phantasmal traces of nonexistent subatomic particles. Studying quantum theory is like ingesting a mind-altering, time-release psychedelic. Taking in what quantum physics is revealing to us about the universe we inhabit is \"psycho-activating\" beyond belief, in that it activates the psyche, inspires the imagination and synchronistically dissolves the boundary between mind and matter. To say that quantum physics is the greatest scientific discovery of all time is not an exaggeration; its profound revelations and implications cannot be overstated. In discovering the quantum, physics has indisputably encountered consciousness - there is simply no avoiding this fact. Quantum theory demands a radical re-visioning of the role that consciousness plays in the unfolding of reality. **Quantum physics is pointing out, in unequivocal terms, that the study of the universe and the study of consciousness are inseparably linked, and that ultimate progress in the one will be impossible without progress in the other.** A unique development in human history, the discovery of the quantum nature of our universe is a seismic, tectonic shift in the very foundation of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:1:8a1c642c4be1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11358, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "fact. Quantum theory demands a radical re-visioning of the role that consciousness plays in the unfolding of reality. **Quantum physics is pointing out, in unequivocal terms, that the study of the universe and the study of consciousness are inseparably linked, and that ultimate progress in the one will be impossible without progress in the other.** A unique development in human history, the discovery of the quantum nature of our universe is a seismic, tectonic shift in the very foundation of physics and the roots of our scientific worldview, a change so momentous that it can literally transform the course of human history. This great change is already underway and yet there remains a long way to go for the full transformational impact of the discoveries of quantum physics to be assimilated by humanity. What quantum physics is revealing to us is so radical, with implications so far reaching, that to call it merely revolutionary would not do it justice. The conceptual revolution of quantum theory has literally turned physics on its head; what it is revealing about our universe is turning right side up what had been inverted and upside down. Quantum physics is introducing us to a radical new way of seeing and understanding which profoundly impacts human thinking, feeling, sensing, knowing and being. As if the universe itself is giving us a cosmic physics lesson, what quantum physics is revealing to us requires a completely new way of thinking about the universe, our place in it as well as ourselves. **Quantum theory is teaching us that implicit in our very thinking are certain flaws and misperceptions that, unseen and taken for granted, unnecessarily limit our ability to apprehend the nature of nature, including our own. The founders of quantum physics, people such as Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrodinger famously argued that quantum physics is first and foremost a new way of thinking. Indeed, the most far-reaching impact of quantum physics will be within the human mind.** The discoveries of quantum physics are truly a game-changer that requires a novel response in us which, when more fully understood and integrated, will irrevocably change us both on the individual level and as a species in the very core of our being. Regarding the implications of quantum physics, John Bell, one of the most important physicists of the latter half of the twentieth century, is of the opinion that \"the new way of seeing things will involve an imaginative leap that will astonish us.\" It is hard to imagine something truly astonishing that we wouldn't tend to initially rule out as preposterous. This new way of seeing things, this imaginative leap is truly an evolutionary upleveling, a real quantum jump in consciousness that quantum physics is inviting each of us to partake in. **Quantum physics is the most subversive of all the sciences, having created a \"reality crisis\" in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:2:bc02a6008bc5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11359, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "\"the new way of seeing things will involve an imaginative leap that will astonish us.\" It is hard to imagine something truly astonishing that we wouldn't tend to initially rule out as preposterous.

The very \"reality\" that pre-quantum physics had been studying has been demonstrated by quantum physics to not even exist!** The greatest experts of quantum physics, if it's even possible to speak of \"experts\" in a field that, according to Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, \"no one understands,\" literally do not know \"what\" they are talking about. [[2]](#2) **Physicists who study their own theory have, in their attempts at grasping its implications, lost their grip on reality, finding nothing, absolutely nothing to hold onto. Quantum physics has pulled the rug out from under us only to reveal no floor below, no place on which to take a stand, as the notion of a seemingly solid, objectively existing world evaporates like dewdrops in the morning sunlight.** Quantum theory is not just one of many theories in physics; it is the one theory that has profoundly affected nearly every other branch of physics. There is hardly an aspect of contemporary society or of our own individual lives that has not already been fundamentally transformed by the ideas and applications of quantum physics. **One third of our economy involves products based on quantum mechanics - things such as computers and the Internet, lasers, MRI's, TV's, DVD's, CD's, microwaves, electron microscopes, mobile phones, transistors, silicon chips, semiconductors, quartz and digital watches, superconductors and nuclear energy. And yet, even with the huge impact quantum physics has had on all of our lives, this effect is infinitesimally small compared with what it will be when more of us recognize and internalize the implications of what it is revealing to us about the nature of reality as well as of ourselves.** The discoveries of quantum physics, practically speaking, have given us the capacity to both increase the quality of our lives and/or to potentially ravage the environment on an unprecedented scale, even to obliterate our species altogether. To quote theoretical physicist Henry Stapp, \"Yet along with this fatal power it [science] has provided a further offering which, though subtle in character and still hardly felt in the minds of men, may ultimately be its most valuable contribution to human civilization, and the key to human survival.\" [[3]](#3) **Do we use the discoveries of quantum physics for the betterment of our species, or to destroy", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:3:7fb950f00dfc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11360, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "ravage the environment on an unprecedented scale, even to obliterate our species altogether.

Quantum theory reflects back to us that the choice is truly ours.** Quantum physics works like a charm. It is like a higher-dimensional talisman, a physics of possibilities. The precise accuracy of its mathematical formalism and methodology is beyond debate; none of its predictions have ever been shown to be wrong. It is literally the most successful scientific theory of all time. It is as if physics has discovered a wonderful magic wand that works every time, but the amazing thing is that no one knows why. I have never in all of my life come across a field where all of the supposed \"experts\" disagree with each other about the meaning of their own theory. **This is the deep philosophical question that begs to be answered - what does quantum physics mean? When the alleged experts can't agree, we can feel free to choose our preferred expert - or explore and speculate on our own.** I am certainly not a physicist; rather, I am someone who, the more I contemplate the deeper philosophical underpinnings of quantum physics, can't help but wonder what nature itself is revealing to us through her new physics. As such, I am writing as an \"outsider\" regarding the field of physics. I have absolutely no authority to comment on the nuts and bolts physics of things, which I literally know nothing about. On the contrary, I am simply giving voice from my perspective as a curious person who is trying to make sense of what it means when physics tells us that the world we live in is quantum through and through. As a citizen in the recently recognized quantum world, I am writing as an \"innocent bystander,\" except that quantum physics unavoidably implicates me as participating in what I'm writing about. Most of us have no idea, have been ill-informed and left out in the dark regarding these over-the-top discoveries that have everything to do with the ultimate nature of the reality in which we live our everyday lives. Speaking about the public's ignorance regarding the earth-shaking discoveries in the new physics, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Isaac Rabi simply says, \"It's a great pity.\" With reference to quantum physics, what we don't know *can* hurt us. In our modern age, scientific literacy has become a political and moral necessity. In our inquiry, we should prepare to be astonished. **2.

In our modern age, scientific literacy has become a political and moral necessity. In our inquiry, we should prepare to be astonished. **2. PARTICIPATORY UNIVERSE** **Renowned theoretical physicist John Archibald Wheeler, a colleague of both Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr, is considered to be one of the towering intellects and greatest physicists of the twentieth century. **A professor emeritus at Princeton, Wheeler has been called a \"sage of modern physics,\" as well as, after Einstein and Bohr, \"the last of the greats.\" Drawn to explore the very limits of science, and unafraid to face the big issues of his field, his list of accomplishments in physics is staggering; the whole universe - both big and small - was the playground for his poetic imagination. Wheeler was a pied piper among physicists. Due to his fondness for speculating on what directions future science might take, he was considered to be the Delphic oracle of physics. A mentor to Richard Feynman, he was an inspiring teacher for many of the greatest and most innovative physicists of our current day. His goal was to plant ideas deep in the minds of his students which, like time-release capsules, might find some way to flower five, ten or fifty years later. To say he was an out-of-the-box, creative thinker would be an understatement; for Wheeler the box that he was \"out of\" was a higher-dimensional hyper-cube which existed in the realm of the imagination. Typically gracious to a fault, he was considered a \"gentleman's gentleman.\" Wheeler was a rigorous, hard-core scientist as well as a visionary whose musings went far beyond the orthodox, often astounding the narrow specialist. A speculative dreamer with the soul of a surrealist poet, he has been described as someone who \"dreams with open eyes,\" and \"a twentieth century Leonardo da Vinci.\" Many of his fellow scientists are convinced that his insights into the foundation of modern-day physics will spur a revolution in our perception of the universe. Truly a legend in the physics community, Wheeler's impact on the field of modern day physics is hard to overstate. As Wheeler has pointed out, the majority of developments in science have come out of asking the right questions. **To quote Heisenberg, \"What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.\" [[4]](#4) The questions we ask are determined by our way of thinking. **What we think about and how we perceive the world seems as if it subtly affects reality at a very deep and basic quantum level, thereby informing and modifying the underlying fabric", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:5:038978a0fce5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11362, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "Wheeler has pointed out, the majority of developments in science have come out of asking the right questions. **To quote Heisenberg, \"What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.\" [[4]](#4) The questions we ask are determined by our way of thinking. **What we think about and how we perceive the world seems as if it subtly affects reality at a very deep and basic quantum level, thereby informing and modifying the underlying fabric out of which third-dimensional reality emerges. What we wonder about alters the way in which reality presents itself to us. We ourselves create the reality of human experience with the questions we ask and the procedures that we undertake to find the answers to them. It is easy to assume that when we ask questions of nature, of the world seemingly outside of ourselves, that there is an actual reality existing independently of what can be said about it. The universe is an on-going, continually unfolding revelation, speaking to and from something within ourselves. We can \"divinize\" the universe by learning to recognize its oracular nature. Parsifal-like, we have to ask the right question. **To quote Wheeler, \"The question is what is the question?\" **The issue of how to ask the question and when it is asked plays an important role in what answer we get. What is the universe revealing to us? Wheeler comments, \"No question? No answer!\" Classical physics, the physics that existed before the discovery of quantum physics, was about uncovering what were thought to be the pre-existent laws of a separately existing universe that objectively existed independent of observation. Quantum physics obliterated the classical notion of an independently existing world forever. To quote Wheeler, \"Nothing is more important about quantum physics than this: it has destroyed the concept of the world as 'sitting out there.' The universe will never afterwards be the same.\" **Quantum physics forever shattered the idea of there being an objectively existing world - it has proven that there is no such thing! It is ironic that physics, long considered the most \"objective\" of all the sciences, in pursuing its dedicated quest to understand the deep nature of the material universe, has dispelled the very notion of an objective universe.** According to quantum theory, the idea of a world independent of our observation has conventional meaning, but ultimately speaking, is incorrect. Our perception of the universe is a part of the universe happening through us that has an instantaneous effect on the universe we are observing. It makes no sense to think of ourselves as a self-enclosed, encapsulated, independent agent existing separate from the universe. **Quantum theory has opened up the door to a profoundly new vision of the cosmos, where the observer, the observed and the act of observation are inseparably united.** [[5]](#5) Quantum physics has shown that the idea of safely", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:6:806ae5802a0b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11363, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "of the universe is a part of the universe happening through us that has an instantaneous effect on the universe we are observing. It makes no sense to think of ourselves as a self-enclosed, encapsulated, independent agent existing separate from the universe. **Quantum theory has opened up the door to a profoundly new vision of the cosmos, where the observer, the observed and the act of observation are inseparably united.** [[5]](#5) Quantum physics has shown that the idea of safely standing behind a slab of plate glass while passively observing the universe is impossible, as our observation of even something as miniscule as an electron necessitates the shattering of the glass and reaching into, so to speak, the electron's subatomic world, which changes both the electron and ourselves. It is impossible to gain information without changing the state of the system being measured, as we invariably bring about a different world by the very act of trying to determine the state of the world. **In quantum physics, we are no longer passive witnesses of the universe, but rather, we unavoidably find ourselves in the new role of active participants who in-form, give shape to and in some mysterious sense \"create\" the very universe we are interacting with.** Making this point, Wheeler says, \"Useful as it is under everyday circumstances to say that the world exists 'out there' independent of us, that view can no longer be upheld. There is a strange sense in which this is a 'participatory universe.'\" [[6]](#6) **In essence, consciousness has entered into the physics laboratory, and physicists are not quite sure what to make of this turn of events.** Who can blame them? The encountering of consciousness in their experiments what has been called physics' \"skeleton in the closet\" is, simply put, out of their league. **Coming to terms and facing up to consciousness's intrusion into their hallowed halls is forcing physics to come to terms with questions of meta-physics, which for most physicists is not what they signed up for. Quantum physics is itself the greatest threat to the underlying metaphysical assumptions of \"scientific materialism,\" a perspective which assumes that there is an independently existing, objective material world that is separate from the observer.** It can easily seem as if the whole consciousness problem has been forced upon physics against its will by some outside agency. But nothing could be further from the truth. The appearance of consciousness in the domain of physics is totally natural, which is to say it is nature revealing one of her most intimate mysteries. To quote Nobel prize winning physicist Eugene Wigner, \"through the creation of quantum mechanics, the concept of consciousness came to the fore again. It was not possible to formulate the laws of quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to consciousness.\" [[7]](#7) Most physicists think that something as ethereal as consciousness - what", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:7:ca450f4be592", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11364, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "appearance of consciousness in the domain of physics is totally natural, which is to say it is nature revealing one of her most intimate mysteries.

The prevailing mainstream view is that consciousness, or \"philosophy,\" is not supposed to be studied in a physics department. Anything that isn't testable and can't be measured is of no concern to most physicists. To the overwhelming majority of physicists, the role that consciousness plays in their experiments seems to be against the spirit of science - which in their view is always supposed to be impersonal and objective. And yet, like an uninvited, unwelcome guest at dinner, consciousness refuses to go away. **3. OBJECTIVE REALITY HANGOVER** Science, which, in Wheeler's words \"is an intensely human activity,\" has a great effect on human beliefs. Oftentimes, the transition from one age to the next is triggered by a seemingly minute change in a single idea. Some of the most important science-generated beliefs that pervade our world are outdated and mistaken ideas that arose in science during the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. One such antiquated belief is the unquestioned assumption of an external, independent, objective universe with its concurrent shallow, limited and impoverished conception of how humankind fits into such an apparently objective world. Ironically, from the scientific point of view, it is irrational and against the very spirit of science to cling to such a false and obsolete idea of the world we live in. Relating to an after-image as if it still exists, many physicists are doing quantum physics - and successfully solving their equations - and yet, deep in their unconscious, are still subtly entranced in a classical mindset that sees the world as independently existing. To quote physicist F. David Peat, \"A revolution had occurred in physics, but at a deeper level the same order prevailed. The new wine of quantum theory had merely been put in the old bottles of Cartesian order.\" [[8]](#8) Clinging to the idea of an objectively existing world is like holding on to the mistaken belief in a flat earth, all evidence to the contrary. Heisenberg writes, \"The hope that new experiments will lead us back to objective events in space and time is about as well founded as the hope of discovering the end of the world in the unexplored regions of the Antarctic.\" Like the old \"flat-earthers,\" \"objective-worlders\" are holding onto to an inculcated unconscious belief, reinforced by several centuries of habit, that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:8:24daf445e0a0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11365, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "objectively existing world is like holding on to the mistaken belief in a flat earth, all evidence to the contrary.

Wheeler openly wonders whether, in an interesting choice of words, we are \"sleep-walking\" if we think that we aren't influencing the results of our experiments. Not just the physics community, but the vast majority of our species is suffering from a similar \"holding on\" to what Stapp refers to as \"a known-to-be-false\" idea of the world if we think it inherently exists separate from ourselves. The objective world model which still has such a pervasive hold upon much of our species is a construct, literally a projection of a particular stage of human psycho-spiritual development. **The quantum revolution has revealed that the classical worldview was something that existed entirely within the minds of a certain strain of European humanity that became reified into an orthodox creed and held the mind of modern humanity in a prison of its own making, as if humanity had become spellbound. ** Providing a way out of this self-imposed prison, quantum physics heralds the advent of an altogether new stage of human psycho-spiritual evolution. What seems to be an independent universe is in actuality a play of appearances, a persistent and persuasive false imagination, an unexamined and clearly mistaken metaphysical assumption. As Wheeler wonders, \"is IT all just a Magic Show?\" [[9]](#9) Our situation is similar to seeing a mirage of water in the desert, and either thinking that the apparition of water exists as actual water or seeing through the illusion and realizing it is a magical display of our mind. **It is as if physicists themselves haven't fully comprehended and don't quite know what to make of the great truth that they have unwittingly stumbled upon. They have been forced to wrestle, not just intellectually but emotionally, existentially and spiritually with their own discoveries in the quantum realm. Quantum theory has pushed its adherents to the very edge of the unknown, both out in the world and within themselves. ** In the classic book *Quantum Theory and Measurement* that Wheeler co-wrote with Wojciech Zurek, the authors write regarding the quantum, \"What else is it but an unfamiliar animal, confined to an animal house?

This confined, unfamiliar quantum animal is like a dream figure that exists within ourselves. Physicists who are still entranced by the notion of an objective universe, with its concurrent exclusion of the observer, are simply unwittingly recreating the greatest failure of classical physics - its inability to find a place to accommodate us, its creators. Human beings are not likely to thrive or endure in a society ruled by a conception of ourselves that denies the very creative essence of our being. Our understanding of the world we live in determines the ethics we live by; living a life based on a worldview that is an illusion can easily lead to living the wrong life. **In re-visioning our idea of the world we live in, we change our perception of the possibilities available in our world, thus opening up previously unimagined pathways of creative and effective action.** **\"Objective reality\" is an unexamined implicit assumption, merely an idea in our mind. What most of us call objective reality is simply an interpretation of data whose meaning is agreed upon by the majority, what can be called a \"consensus reality.\" **An inherently existing, objective world - something that has its \"own nature\" separate from something else - is a form existing only in the imagination. **Upsetting the applecart of consensus reality, quantum physics points out that objective reality does not actually exist. **Becoming a phenomenologist for a moment, instead of referring to the world \"out there,\" Wheeler highlights the subjective nature of the experience that is taking place inside of us when he more accurately uses the phrase \"the image of something 'out there.'\" The apparent world \"out there\" has its roots in a field of sentience that is inextricably interwoven with the physical world while at the same time being shaped by the world of innumerable observers. The notion of an independent, objective reality that exists separate from an observer is a very deep-seated assumption, a habit of mind, which like one of Kant's categories of perception, resides at a core level of the human psyche. This assumed viewpoint practically becomes hard-wired into the brain, causing us to filter our perceptions so as to reflect back our core assumptions.

This assumed viewpoint practically becomes hard-wired into the brain, causing us to filter our perceptions so as to reflect back our core assumptions. Regardless of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, there still exists an underlying unconscious mode of language and type of thinking embedded in physics which conceives of the world as having a type of objective existence that it simply doesn't have. Albert Einstein was deeply disturbed by quantum physics' implication that there is no independently existing objective universe, and was not able to let go of his strong belief that there exists an external, objective world independent of the perceiving subject. To quote Einstein, \"The belief in an external world independent of the perceiving subject is the basis of all natural science.\" Einstein was troubled by quantum theory's implication of the apparent role that the observer played in creating reality, feeling that it seemed incompatible with any reasonable idea of reality. In response, Bohr famously reflected back to Einstein that his \"concept of reality is too limited.\" [[11]](#11) We should question what it is in the way we think about the world that causes quantum behavior to be so troubling. Our being troubled is a result of the disparity between the way reality operates and actually manifests itself and our ideas of what reality should be. **Wheeler confesses that he is not troubled \"at all\" by what quantum theory is revealing; on the contrary, he feels that it is \"a perfectly marvelous feature of nature,\" and that \"it is just the way the world works.\"** Thinking that there's an objective reality is a residue of the old materialistic perspective that lingers as an ingrained way of viewing reality, as if many physicists - and the majority of our species - are suffering from an \"objective reality hangover.\" One of the things that distinguishes Wheeler from many other physicists is his refusal to try to save pre-quantum viewpoints, particularly, to quote physicist Anton Zeilinger, \"the obviously wrong notion of a reality independent of us.\" For many people the idea that there is no independent reality is \"unthinkable,\" an idea so off their map of reality that they can't even imagine it. The projection of an inherently existing world outside of ourselves is a deeply ingrained, seemingly innate and habitual mode of perception. Old intellectual habits die hard; it can be difficult to let go of familiar, comfortable - and \"tranquilizing\" - ideas about the way the world works.

Heisenberg emphasizes, \"The idea of an objective real world whose smallest parts exist objectively in the same sense as stones or trees exist, independently of whether or not we observe them ... is impossible.\" **According to our subjective experience the world certainly seems real enough, apparently contradicting what quantum physics is telling us about the world's lack of inherent, objective reality. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the world behaves \"as if\" it has an independent reality, which furthers our visceral belief in objective reality in what becomes a self-perpetuating and mind-created feedback loop. In other words, because of the quantum, dreamlike (i.e., consciousness-based) nature of reality, once we view the universe \"as if\" it independently, objectively exists, it will manifest in a way which simply confirms our viewpoint** (please see my article [\"As Viewed, So Appears\"](http://www.awakeninthedream.com/wordpress/as-viewed-so-appears/)). Nature seems to respond in accordance with the theory and beliefs by which it is approached. The choices we make about what we observe make a difference in what we find. Wheeler wants to replace the idea of an objectively existing world, or as he puts it, a \"hardware located out there,\" with a \"meaning software\" located who knows where. **4. REALITY** To quote Einstein, \"Reality [which elsewhere he says 'is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one'] is the real business of physics.\" At the end of the day science is empirical, and its theories must be grounded somehow, \"in reality,\" but where and, furthermore, what exactly is that reality? Another of the founders of quantum theory, Wolfgang Pauli comments, \"I think the important and extremely difficult task of our time is to try to build up a fresh idea of reality.\" [[12]](#12) But where is the ontological ground upon which our impression of a really-existing universe - our idea of reality - rests? **Speaking about reality, quantum theory brings the question to the fore: Are we discovering reality, or creating it? And if we are, at least in part, creating what we call reality, what are we creating it out of?** Wheeler writes, \"What we call reality consists of a few iron posts of observation between which we fill in by an elaborate papier-mache construction of imagination and theory.\" [[13]](#13) We \"connect the dots\" between a \"few iron posts of observation\" so as to create a seemingly coherent picture of our world, which we then easily imagine is reality itself. **\"Reality\" is just a word in our language.

What we \"call\" reality is simply a theory and internalized mental model which is at bottom a way of looking at the world, rather than a form of absolutely true knowledge of how the world \"really\" is. It is important not to conflate reality with our theories, not to confuse the map with the territory. Our best models are no more than aids to our imagination, by no means are they complete reflections of the nature of reality.** There is a fine line between imagination, reality, and illusion. Wheeler writes, \"Recent decades have taught us that physics is a magic window. It shows us the illusion that lies behind reality - and the reality that lies behind illusion.... Today we demand of physics some understanding of existence itself.\" [[14]](#14) It is as if there is a fissure in what we thought was reality, and quantum physics is the thread that is increasingly protruding through the crack that can potentially unravel our ideas about everything. Wheeler comments, \"I continue to say that the quantum is the crack in the armor that covers the secret of existence.\" [[15]](#15) The Scientific Revolution was a deepening of our powers of reason, a flowering of human creativity and a breakthrough for humanity, helping us to explore our world in ever-more profound and ingenious ways. From another point of view which also contains an important truth, the Scientific Revolution that is now commonly associated with Isaac Newton's [[16]](#16) (\"Newtonian\") physics was also the onset of a particular form of madness. It started as a new worldview that was revolutionary in its power; yet it contained a subtle error that solidified into a widespread delusion which has over time profoundly enabled the collective psychosis [[17]](#17) that our species finds itself in. **An essential feature of this madness is the severing between the subject and object, the observer and the observed, as if the scientific imagination thought that in its intellectual examination of the world it wasn't part of, participating in and thereby affecting that which it was investigating. This was done in pursuit of the ideal of objectivity, which was gradually elevated to the level of an absolute truth about the nature of reality. This approach worked remarkably well when it came to dealing with the macroscopic world, enabling unprecedented levels of control to be exerted over the physical world, but in this process of obtaining mastery over the physical plane an unseen cost was", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:13:a5cbf60eeecc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11370, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "wasn't part of, participating in and thereby affecting that which it was investigating.

This approach worked remarkably well when it came to dealing with the macroscopic world, enabling unprecedented levels of control to be exerted over the physical world, but in this process of obtaining mastery over the physical plane an unseen cost was being incurred by the human spirit. ** This mechanistic, deterministic and reductionist attitude unfortunately became identified with science itself, thus introducing a number of tacit taboos and limiting assumptions into the otherwise open-ended process of exploration known as the scientific method. The modern scientific attitude which sees the world as objectively existing outside of itself - \"scientific materialism\" - is actually a deluded view expressing an epistemological blind spot in the very center of the predominating scientific vision of the world, a blindness of which modern society seems mostly unaware. **Seeing the world as separate from ourselves has become the prevailing and institutionalized worldview of \"the academy,\" a viewpoint that takes the heart, soul and \"magic\" out of the world, reducing it to a dead, inanimate, insensate domain. Scientific materialism disenchants the world while simultaneously bewitching and casting a materialistic spell over its inhabitants. Increasingly enthralled by science's ever-growing achievements and technological wizardry, few have questioned whether these very advances might at the same time be leading humanity astray from essential aspects of the true nature of our being, slowly dehumanizing our species in the process.** The conceptual tension that arises between conflicting ideas can potentially become the source of creative insight. Wheeler comments, \"Progress in science owes more to the clash of ideas than the steady accumulation of facts.\" [[18]](#18) In our current day we are at a transition point, as two contradictory worldviews - the classical and the quantum - are encountering each other, not just in physics, but also deep within the human psyche, as it is ultimately the psyche from which all our physics is derived. It is the leaving behind of commonly agreed-upon truths that have been \"outgrown\" and shown to be wrong that helps to propel science and human civilization forward. In Wheeler's opinion, \"the most revolutionary discovery in science is yet to come! And come, not by questioning the quantum, but by uncovering that utterly simple idea that demands the quantum.\" [[19]](#19) According to Wheeler, the universe could not even have come into being without the quantum. It is Wheeler's opinion that until we arrive at this basic idea underlying the quantum, we have not understood the essence of the quantum principle.

What is this \"utterly simple idea\" that Wheeler is positing that demands a quantum world? Could it have to do with the dreamlike nature of reality, a perspective which embraces the role of consciousness in creating our world? Wheeler says, \"There are some ideas out there that are waiting to be discovered.\" It is as if some ideas are \"in the air,\" pervading the underlying field of the collective unconscious, just waiting to be tuned into and \"received.\" Etymologically, the word \"idea\" has to do with a way of seeing, a perspective through which we view the world. Wheeler writes, \"Surely someday, we can believe, we will grasp the central idea of it all as so simple, so beautiful, so compelling that we will all say to each other, 'Oh, how could it have been otherwise! How could we all have been so blind so long?'\" [[20]](#20) Is there a subtle form of teleology embedded in the observer's role in the quantum world; in other words, are we being shown something, **are we being led to a new way of seeing our world which will change the way our world manifests to us?** **Quantum theory implies that immaterial factors having more of the nature of images and ideas are the blue-print for our universe, actually in-forming and shaping the evolution of the universe as a whole. ** Wheeler goes so far as to liken the universe itself to an idea. Are the insights of quantum physics providing the clue that will lead us to a previously undreamed of treasure just waiting to be discovered? Wheeler comments, \"Except it be that observership brings the universe into being what other way is there to understand that clue?\" [[21]](#21) **It is as if the universe itself is conspiring with us to help us awaken to its, and our nature, and quantum physics is the theoretical and experimental \"instrument\" for this deeper insight to reveal itself. To quote Wheeler, \"Somewhere something incredible is waiting to happen.\"** If we view the physics community as an individual and view quantum physics as their dream, it is as if physicists have \"dreamed up\" quantum theory in all its glory as a compensation for all of our intellectual one-sidedness, as a way of showing us our blind-spot, reflecting back to us our unfounded unconscious assumptions.

Wheeler refers to the old mechanistic viewpoint of the universe as a machine that goes its own inexorable way as a \"cracked paradigm.\" Commenting on the gifts that are embedded in the quantum realm, he says, \"... not machinery but magic may be the better description of the treasure that is waiting.\" Because of its results being a function of the experimental set-up, quantum measurements resemble good stage magic more than a clumsy meter reading. **Seen as a symbol crystallizing out of the dreamlike nature of reality, quantum physics is revealing to us that we don't live in the mechanistic, Cartesian world of classical physics, but rather, inhabit an enchanted world not separate from our mind's creative imagination.** **5. THE LAWS OF PHYSICS** Physics has always thought of itself as being in search of the fundamental laws of the universe. Wheeler comments, \"The beauty in the laws of physics is the fantastic simplicity that they have.\" [[22]](#22) **Quantum physics has raised the question, is the ever-evolving universe like a work of art in progress, making up its laws as it goes along? **Wheeler writes, \"The more one learns about the laws of physics, the more one learns how little one has learned.\" [[23]](#23) Are the laws of physics an emergent property of the cosmos, which itself is emergent? Commenting on what quantum physics tells us about the laws of physics, Wheeler famously opined, \"There is no law except the law that there is no law.\" [[24]](#24) This is to say that the laws of physics are mutable, mutating in tune with the universe they support, in the same way that living organisms mutate. How can we believe that the laws of physics are eternal if the universe itself is not going to be around forever? To quote Wheeler, \"Law cannot stand engraved on a tablet of stone for all eternity... all is mutable.\" [[25]](#25) This is a malleable, plastic universe. The laws and the physical universe they describe can only exist together, reciprocally co-arising and in-forming each other. It's meaningless to talk about the laws of physics before the existence of a material reality in which these laws are enacted. **The idea that the laws which inform the functioning of reality spring into manifestation out of nothingness fully formed is a nonsensical, preposterous idea. ** **Wheeler comments, \"The laws of physics were not installed in advance by a Swiss watchmaker, nor can", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:16:76aa9a0ba4f6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11373, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "and the physical universe they describe can only exist together, reciprocally co-arising and in-forming each other.

They must have come into being.** They could not always have been accurate. They are derivative and superficial, not primary and revelatory.\" [[26]](#26) The \"flexi-laws\" advocated by Wheeler evolve and focus in on precisely the forms needed to give rise to the living organisms that eventually observe them. Is observership the ultimate underpinning of the laws of physics, and therefore of the laws of space and time themselves? Quantum theory implies that observer-participants create both the physical laws and the appearance of the material world in which the laws apply. In our questioning about the nature of the universe and its laws, to quote Wheeler, \"Could it be that the quantum is trying to tell us the answer?\" [[27]](#27) In Einstein's opinion, \"Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe.\" In trying to find some deeper structure that underlies the laws of physics, quantum physics is reflecting back to us that it is a mistake to think that as we penetrate to the universe's deeper levels it will terminate at some *nth* level, or that it goes on ad infinitum. Rather, our inquiry leads back full-circle to the observer with which it began, as if the ethereal act of observership is the link that closes the circuit of interdependence between us and our world. **The central and all-encompassing role of the observer [[28]](#28) in quantum mechanics, what Wheeler refers to as the \"magic ingredient,\" is the most important clue we have regarding the construction of the universe.** Wheeler asks, \"Is the architecture of existence such that only through 'observership' does the universe have a way to come into being?\" [[29]](#29) According to Wheeler, the universe is a self-referential \"strange loop\" in which physics gives rise to observers, who then give rise to information, which in turn gives rise to physics.** The universe gives rise to meaning-establishing observer-participants, who, in developing the ideas of quantum mechanics, grant a meaningful existence to the universe. The construction of the universe is such that the observer is as essential to the creation of the universe as the universe is essential to the creation of the observer.** It becomes extraordinarily difficult to state sharply and clearly where the community of observer-participants begins and where it ends; the boundary between the two is continually shifting.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:17:693546675df4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11374, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "physics.** The universe gives rise to meaning-establishing observer-participants, who, in developing the ideas of quantum mechanics, grant a meaningful existence to the universe.

The idea of observer-participancy implies that the universe has built into it from the very beginning the potentiality for giving birth to and housing observers. **Without observers there is no existence;** in Wheeler's words, \"there would be nothing rather than something.\" The universe creates the conditions and paves the way for the emergence of the very observers that bestow upon it a certain reality, completing the transaction that allows the stars to shine, so to speak. **In a world without a built-in purpose, quantum theory \"promotes\" the observer to the definer of reality and generator of meaning, which is essentially a creator of distinctions, a primordially creative role.** **However we view it, we can't get around the fact that we are participating in creating our experience of the universe. [[30]](#30) Wheeler says, \"We are inescapably involved in bringing about that which appears to be happening.\" [[31]](#31) Not only are we involved in bringing about what seems to be happening, we are intimately involved in creating our experience of ourselves as well.** Being a form of insight, physics is a form of art; as such, quantum physics is reflecting back to us the part of ourselves that is a creator of experience. Are physics' insights into the participatory character of the universe, with all of its yet to be realized implications, just the tip of the iceberg? To quote from the wonderful book [*Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness*](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Enigma-Physics-Encounters-Consciousness/dp/0199753814/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391890279&sr=8-1&keywords=Quantum+Enigma%3A+Physics+Encounters+Consciousness) by physicists Bruce Rosenblum and Fred Kuttner, \"If our observation creates *everything*, including ourselves, we are dealing with a concept that is logically self-referential - and mind-boggling.\" [[32]](#32) Quantum physics simultaneously boggles, blows and melts our mind, which is to say that as we take in and digest what quantum physics is showing us about the universe and our place in it, it psycho-energetically \"changes,\" expands and refreshes our mind. Becoming \"quantum-physicized,\" we learn to think directly and naturally in quantum mechanical language and logic. **Quantum physics is riddled with paradox to its core. Thinking \"quantum-logically,\" we are able to hold paradox in a new way; instead of needing one or the other viewpoint to be true, in a higher form of logic, [[33]](#33) we can hold seemingly contradictory statements together as both being true simultaneously.

This gives new insight into how what may appear to be contradictions at one level can be part of a deeper consistency and completeness from a higher, more inclusive level. ** **Wheeler stressed that as we develop more of a capacity to consciously hold paradox, new insights will often emerge. Each new generation will take into itself, learn and integrate quantum physics' worldview more easily, as each person's initiation into this new way of thinking and seeing the world [nonlocally](http://www.awakeninthedream.com/wordpress/glossary-of-terms/#nonlocality) affects the whole, transforming the collective unconscious of humanity itself.** Once we catch up with and integrate what science has discovered about our place in the universe, quantum physics will become the lens through which we view our experience, as its simplicity and obviousness will seem utterly natural. We will wonder how we could have been so blind for so long. Or so I imagine.... **6. SELF-EXCITED CIRCUIT** Wheeler's vision of the universe is like a \"self-excited circuit,\" to use a metaphor from electronics. To say the universe is \"self\"-excited is to say it is not \"other\"-excited, which is to say that rather than depending upon an external agent, god or deity, the universe is self-creating and self-referential--i.e., able to refer to, reflect and act upon itself, and hence, endlessly re-create itself anew. [[34]](#34) Seen as a self-excited and self-actualizing circuit, the physical universe bootstraps itself into existence, laws and all. **As a self-excited circuit, the universe gives rise to observers who, in completing the circuit, potentially give meaningful reality to the universe. Wheeler says, \"The universe is to be compared to a circuit self-excited in this sense, that the universe gives birth to consciousness, and consciousness gives meaning to the universe.\"** The emergence of consciousness in the universe is as epic and epochal an event in cosmic history as the first big blast of its materialization in the supposed big bang. The self-excitation is caused by the innate fundamental tendency for self-perception built into the very ground of being. **In this process of self-cognition, the universe is able to turn back upon itself so as to explore its nature via its various life forms as it endlessly creates and recreates itself through innumerable acts of observer-participation.** The universe generates an interactive feedback loop of cosmic intelligence within itself that becomes the internal guidance system and source of its own continually unfolding genesis. Contrary to the mechanistic worldview of classical physics, the universe as a self-excited circuit implies a participatory universe that endlessly creates itself through innumerable acts of participatory self-perception. To quote Wheeler, \"Directly opposite to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:19:df5a3b95c73b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11376, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "explore its nature via its various life forms as it endlessly creates and recreates itself through innumerable acts of observer-participation.** The universe generates an interactive feedback loop of cosmic intelligence within itself that becomes the internal guidance system and source of its own continually unfolding genesis. Contrary to the mechanistic worldview of classical physics, the universe as a self-excited circuit implies a participatory universe that endlessly creates itself through innumerable acts of participatory self-perception. To quote Wheeler, \"Directly opposite to the concept of universe as machine built on law is the vision of *a world self-synthesized*. On this view, the notes struck out on a piano by the observer participants of all times and all places, bits though they are in and by themselves, constitute the great wide world of space and time and things.\" [[35]](#35) **In such a self-referential cosmology whose nature is a self-generating feedback loop of pure creativity, we are dreaming up the universe, while at the same time the universe is reciprocally dreaming us up, as the seemingly subjective and objective realities interblend and co-create each other. Un-countable small acts of observer-participancy have over eons built up the tangible appearance of the material world.** Self-excitatory, to quote Wheeler, \"the universe is a grand synthesis, putting itself together all the time as a whole. Its history is not a history as we usually conceive history. It is not one thing happening after another after another. It is a totality in which what happens 'now' gives reality to what happens 'then,' perhaps even determines what happened then.\" [[36]](#36) **Talking about one of the most startling features of a thought experiment that he dreamed up called the \"delayed choice experiment\" (which has since been empirically verified), the act of observation, to quote Wheeler, \"reaches back into the past in apparent opposition to the normal order of time.\"** In his thought experiment, which is a creative use of the imagination to tease out a little more information from nature, Wheeler discovered that \"a choice made in the here-and-now has irretrievable consequences for what one has the right to say about what has *already* happened in the very earliest days of the universe, long before there was any life on Earth.\" [[37]](#37) This is to say that acts of observer-participancy in this moment give tangible \"reality\" to the universe not only now but back to its beginning. This is not far-out science fiction, but hard-core science that is actually stranger than fiction. Wheeler elaborates, \"It is wrong to think of that past as 'already existing' in all detail. The 'past' is theory. The past has no existence except as it is recorded in the present.

The quantum universe is polyhistoric; the past involves a wide range of possible pasts all co-existing in a state of unmanifested potential. **The act of observation collapses what is called the wavefunction (a mathematical construct that describes all of the system's possible states) in such a way so as to evoke a particular universe in the present moment while simultaneously reaching backwards in time to create a history appropriate with our present moment experience.** There is no way to say unambiguously what the past was really like until we know its future; as in a work of art, each part of the universe acquires its full meaning only in its relation to the whole. **To quote physicists Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow, co-authors of *The Grand Design*, \"Quantum physics tells us that no matter how thorough our observation of the present, the (unobserved) past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities.... The universe, according to quantum physics, has no single past, or history.... The fact that the past takes no definite form means that observations you make on a system in the present affect its past.\" [[39]](#39)** In any case, in quantum physics it certainly seems \"as if\" an observation made in the present moment reaches back and influences the past. Through our observations in this moment, Wheeler writes, \"we decide what the photon *shall have done* after it has *already* done it.\" [[40]](#40)** The connection between the observer and the observed not only cannot be separated in space, but has no distinction in time as well. This perspective turns our conception of linear time and causality on its head.** To quote author Graham Smetham, \"The entire universe appears to be a kind of collective delayed choice experiment in which inhabiting sentient beings somehow determine the manifested nature of the universe even backwards in time!\" [[41]](#41) This introduces a self-referential circularity in which the laws of quantum physics can allow for their own self-modification backwards in time.

The implication is that **as observers we are participants in the genesis of the universe, a process that Wheeler calls \"genesis by observership.\" The moment of the world's creation lies in the present, in the eternal now, with us somehow playing a \"starring\" role.** **7. COSMOGENESIS** Without an observer it is as if this is a dead universe, one that wouldn't evolve over time, for **without observers, there is no existence.** Quantum theory reflects back to us, to again quote Wheeler, \"that the universe would be nothing without observership as surely as a motor would be dead without electricity.\" [[42]](#42) In the act of observation, the physical reality of the world becomes actualized, and in a self-generating circular feedback loop that is self-referential in nature, it is the same physical world that generates observers who are responsible for bestowing seemingly tangible reality to its existence. **The observer-participant is both a result of an evolutionary process and, in some sense, the cause of its own emergence.** Wheeler wonders, \"Is observership the 'electricity' that powers genesis?\" [[43]](#43) In other words, mind-boggling as it is to contemplate, are we, as \"observer-participants\" playing a role in the genesis of the cosmos in this very moment? According to Wheeler, \"It is incontrovertible that the observer is participator in genesis... it is difficult to see any other line that lends itself to exploration. What other way of genesis is there?\" [[44]](#44) Wheeler is reflecting that we play a role in the creation of the universe that has been normally reserved for the \"gods.\" I can only imagine what it must have been like for the founders of quantum physics to stumble upon the quantum realm; they must have felt like explorers from a faraway land coming across something completely unknown and mysterious. Wheeler uses the example of someone seeing an automobile for the first time. Conjecturing on what it is like to encounter this mysterious phenomenon, Wheeler writes that thoughts arise such as, \"It is obviously meant for use, and an important use, but what use?\" [[45]](#45) In his example, the automobile is the quantum: One opens the door, cranks the window up and down, flashes the lights on and off, perhaps even turns over the starter, all the while without knowing what it's really for.

All are great advances that we are using to our advantage, but are we missing the main idea? Wheeler asks, \"Could it be that all the time we have been missing the central point, the use of the quantum phenomenon in the construction of the universe itself? We have turned over the starter. We haven't got the engine going.\" [[46]](#46) Is, in Wheeler's words, the \"eruption after eruption\" into physics of \"the quantum\" - the \"fiery creative force of modern physics\" - the doorway into deepening our understanding of the very architecture and engineering of the creation of the universe itself? Wheeler refers to quantum phenomena as untouchable, indivisible \"elementary acts of creation\" [[47]](#47) which reach into the present from billions of years in the past, and he views them as the building material of all that is. He openly wonders, \"Are billions upon billions of acts of observer-participancy the foundation of everything?\" [[48]](#48) In other words, are \"billions upon billions of acts of observer-participancy\" by innumerable beings over countless eons the very quantum process which has created our world, literally dreaming our world into materialization? Wheeler ponders whether the very term \"big bang\" is merely a shorthand way to describe the cumulative effects of these billions upon billions of acts of observer-participancy. [[49]](#49) Regarding how the universe came into being, Wheeler asks, \"is the mechanism that came into play one which all the time shows itself?\" [[50]](#50) Is enfolded within our present-moment experience the primordial creative act which reflects the genesis of the entire cosmos? **Does the mystery of the world's on-going creation lie in the present moment, in the eternal now? **Wheeler continues, \"For a process of creation that can and does operate anywhere, that reveals itself and yet hides itself, what could one have dreamed up out of pure imagination more magic - and fitting - than this?\" [[51]](#51) What more \"fitting\" physics could we have, in Wheeler's words, \"dreamed up\" out of pure imagination to reflect back to us the \"magic\" of our dreamlike world? A process which itself is an expression of the dreamlike nature, we have \"dreamed up\" quantum physics to reflect the dreamlike nature of the universe back to us. **In trying to understand nature, as if by magic, physics is helping us discover our nature.** **We live in a universe that is capable not only of harboring life, but of cultivating life which is intelligent enough to wonder and ask about its origins.

In our observing and reflecting upon our universe we are actually changing the universe's idea of itself. Through us, the universe questions itself and tries out various answers on itself in an effort - parallel to our own - to decipher its own being. Wheeler comments, \"and then at last an inspiration: a feeling that we who felt ourselves so small amidst it all are, in the end, the carriers of the central jewel, the flashing purpose that lights up the whole dark universe.\" [[52]](#52)** **8. STRANGER THAN FICTION** It has been said that the universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine. Wheeler writes in his autobiography, \"The strangeness of the quantum world, from which Einstein incessantly sought escape and from which Bohr saw no escape, is real.\" [[53]](#53) The quantum realm - the world of the really small [[54]](#54) - is composed of objects that are unlike any other objects we have ever imagined. **Subatomic objects don't exist as things, but rather, as events, as happenings, as dynamic ever-changing interactive psycho-physical processes.** **What these elementary entities \"are\" and what they \"do\" are inseparably intertwined. The mystery of what they are can only be inferred from what they do. The aspects of nature represented by quantum theory are converted from elements of \"being\" to elements of \"doing,\" which basically replaces the world of material substances with a world populated by actions, events and processes. Not located in time or space but in an abstract realm, the elementary quantum phenomenon, to quote Wheeler, \"is the strangest thing in this strange world.\"** The strangeness of these subatomic entities is highlighted by our inability to even conceive of them separate from our participating in their genesis. As compared with Einstein's theory of relativity, which the more deeply we think about, the less strange it seems, the more deeply we think about quantum physics, the stranger it seems. The universe's mind-bending strangeness is part of its charm, however. To quote Wheeler, \"We will first understand how simple the universe is when we recognize how strange it is.\" [[55]](#55) In science, oftentimes the greatest insights are won from nature's strangest features. And yet, at a certain point the universe's, and quantum physics' strangeness will seem utterly natural, or so I imagine. Wheeler is fond of quoting Gertrude Stein's view of modern art, \"It looks strange and it looks strange and it looks very strange,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:24:230bfabc6ebc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11381, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "part of its charm, however.

Wheeler is fond of quoting Gertrude Stein's view of modern art, \"It looks strange and it looks strange and it looks very strange, and then suddenly it doesn't look strange at all and you can't understand what made it look strange in the first place.\" [[56]](#56) **Quantum physics has discovered that there are no elementary particles, no fundamental \"building blocks\" of reality** - referred to as \"solid, massy, hard, impenetrable moveable particles\" by Newton, at least ones that can be said to exist and are real. In a quote often attributed to Bohr, \"There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract quantum description. It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about nature.\" [[57]](#57) Quantum entities aren't real in the way we usually think of as being real - having no independent, intrinsic existence, they don't exist \"on their own,\" and cannot be said to exist separate from their being observed. Heisenberg famously said, \"The concept of the objective reality of the elementary particles has thus evaporated.\" [[58]](#58) Having no well-defined boundaries, elementary particles exist in a state of open-ended potentiality, \"inhabiting\" (if we can even talk about location for a nonexistent object) at the same time every possible universe they could potentially manifest in. To quote Heisenberg, \"**The atoms or elementary particles themselves are not real, they form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than one of things or facts.**\" Elementary particles don't \"exist\" in the common sense meaning of the word - not as a thing \"out there,\" existing in its own right - but if physicists treat them \"as if\"' they exist, then they manifest \"as if\" they really exist and the physicists then get the right results in their equations. Everyone is happy, as long as no one asks what it all means. Elementary, subatomic particles are simply a construct, a convenient way of talking about what is nothing but a set of mathematical relations concerning different observations. Because an atom does not have an independent, pre-existing reality, it is meaningless to ask, for example, what an atom really is. Atoms are only concepts physicists use to describe the behavior of their measuring instruments and the outcomes of their experiments. An idea such as an atom emerges from the interaction between the observer and the observed, mediated through the particular measuring devices used to make any specific observation.

The properties of microscopic objects are inferred from the behavior of the physicist's measuring apparatus, and are then treated \"as if\" they are real physical things. It is easy to mistake their model for reality, and think of the subatomic particles as actually being real things. In quantum physics the wavefunction is not a wave of material things, but rather a probability wave; the wave that it is describing is, in a sense, not of this world. According to Heisenberg, \"It introduced something standing in the middle between the idea of an event and the actual event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality.\" [[59]](#59) The wavefunction is essentially passive, in that it cannot stimulate action from within itself. It requires an agent to make a choice among its probabilities for the three-dimensional world to be formed. The wavefunction is just an abstract idea, which is to say that both the wavefunction and the atom are essentially ideas, and outside of these ideas, both the wavefunction and the atom are not there. Only idea-like stuff could be fashioned out of ideas. **To quote Stapp, \"We live in an *idea-like* world, not a matter-like world.\" [[60]](#60) The primal stuff of the quantum realm is dreamlike in character, idea-like rather than matter-like. Stapp continues, \"the actual events in quantum theory are likewise idea-like.\"** [[61]](#61) **In the quantum world, there is no \"place\" for matter, in the same way that in the classical world there is no \"place\" for mind. Classical physics' theory of a world of matter is converted by quantum physics into a theory of the relationship between matter and mind. Unveiling a great mystery, quantum physics is pointing out that the ultimate nature of the universe is more mind-like than matter-like. The \"matter\" of this world seems more akin to the phenomena of dreams rather than that of a solid, independent reality.** As quantum physics has lifted the veil to our understanding the connection between mind and matter, and hence of consciousness, it can't help but to at the same time deepen our insight into the nature and operations of our own being. **9. VOODOO FORCES** Quantum entities exist relationally with other interdependent quantum objects that themselves don't exist as separate things, but rather in relation to other inter-related quantum objects ad infinitum; which is to say that there is no independent objectively existing quantum object that has a reality in and of itself; there is", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:26:b35b21eadbd7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11383, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 27, "text": "and matter, and hence of consciousness, it can't help but to at the same time deepen our insight into the nature and operations of our own being. **9.

[[62]](#62) That quantum entities exist not in isolation from each other, but only in relation to each other is a reflection of our own nature - in a sense, we are quantum entities who don't exist as separate objects, but rather, are interdependently interconnected with each other as well as the whole universe. **The quantum field exists in relation to and not separate from the whole universe, including consciousness itself. When two quantum entities interact, they become intermingled in such a way as to remain forever linked together. [[63]](#63) Exhibiting a form of contagious magic, each seemingly telepathically \"knows\" what the other is doing. Once connected, their wavefunctions become phase-entangled with each other, such that there are no longer two independent wavefunctions but one which encompasses both quantum entities forevermore. It is as if after their interaction each one leaves part of themselves with the other. At that point they are no longer separate in the way that they once seemed to be, but rather, even when separated by vast amounts of space and time, behave in concert, as if they are one entity. Moreover, quantum entities do not exist in isolation, but are always coupled with an environment (the measuring apparatus, the mind of the physicist, as well as the rest of the world). The act of measurement is not a private affair, but a public event in which the whole universe participates. What if the quantum system under investigation is the whole universe, in which case there is nothing outside of itself to interact with? If, as quantum physics tells us, the whole universe is quantum to its core, this suggests that the universe is inseparably phase entangled with itself, as ultimately speaking, there is no part of itself that the universe is not nonlocally connected with. **In a quantum universe such as ours, the universe is a unity, one big entangled state composed of and not separate from any of its interdependent constituent parts. ** Thinking of these parts as separate has nothing to do with the actual reality of things, but is purely a mind-game that does not correspond to the actuality of the world.

These seemingly separate parts are connected in such a way as to nonlocally, over inconceivably vast distances of space and time, influence and provide instantaneous feedback for each other, \"as if\" communicating with each other faster than the speed of light. Imagine, in baseball terminology, a throw from deep centerfield to home plate, only the outfielder is on the other side of the universe, and the ball takes zero seconds to arrive. This is another aspect of quantum reality that greatly troubled Einstein - what he referred to as \"spooky action at a distance.\" The superluminal (greater than the speed of light) interaction involved in a nonlocal universe is not any form of interaction we are familiar with, as it doesn't involve any expenditure of energy or exchange of information in the conventional manner. And yet, experiments in physics have shown that what Einstein derided as \"voodoo forces\" do indeed exist, at least as much as we do. There is truly nothing like our universe; having no frame of reference outside of itself, there is nothing to compare it with. **Our nonlocal universe's spooky action-at-a-distance is an expression of the fundamental, indivisible wholeness of the universe, which is radically different from classical physics' previous conception of the universe as composed of separate parts. At the quantum level, there is the radically new notion of intrinsic unbroken wholeness, a seamless interconnectedness among all of the universe's seemingly separate parts; at the quantum level, the universe is \"one\" with itself. ** In a quantum universe, everything is related to everything else. At the moment of observation, the observer and the observed compose a single, unified whole. **The quantum universe, as Bohr could not emphasize enough, can be properly conceived of only as an intricately interconnected dynamic whole. **An expression of this undivided wholeness, which is the fundamental reality, is that consciousness is no longer separated from matter but somehow is essential to it. **Our universe is an emergent universe in which the whole is greater than the sum of any of its parts can even imagine.** Playing off the famous saying \"Less is more,\" Wheeler has as a fondness for the expression \"More is different.\" A substance made up of a great number of molecules, for example, has properties that no one molecule possesses; its difference is qualitative rather than quantitative.

Wheeler comments, \"The rich complexity of the universe as a whole does not in any way preclude an extremely simple element such as a bit of information from being what the universe is made of. When enough simple elements are stirred together, there is no limit to what can result.\" [[64]](#64) The behavior of the whole ecosystem cannot be described in terms of the language [[65]](#65) or qualities that apply to any of its parts. Moreover, **an emergent global property can feed back to influence the individuals who produced it in an interlocking, creativity-generating, self-sustaining and life-supporting feedback loop. Thus individuals and groups can begin to consciously tap into the energy that makes up the quantum realm - the zero point energy of creation itself - in a way which changes everything.** An observing consciousness does not \"cause\" the collapse of the wavefunction in the way we normally think of one thing linearly, mechanistically causing something else. At the quantum level the \"material\" world has melted away into an apparently immaterial field of quantum potentiality which is somehow synchronously and synergistically entangled with the minds of observers. [[66]](#66) What we call matter is, at the quantum level, not separable from some aspect of the observer's mind, as if the quantum entities are embedded in the observing consciousness itself. Once these atomic events are registered in consciousness they are transformed into meaningful \"information\" (which itself is a meaningless idea without some sentient being who relates to and thereby \"knows\" the information), which somehow nonlocally loops back into and in-forms the atomic realm in what Wheeler refers to as a \"meaning circuit.\" In essence, the physical state of the universe acts to alter the mental state, which then instantaneously feeds back into and changes the physical universe. Once a bit of information is added to what we know about the world, at the same moment in time, that bit of information determines the structure of one small part of the world. Wheeler speculates, \"Information may not be just what we *learn* about the world. It may be what *makes* the world.\" [[67]](#67) **10. A PHYSICS OF POSSIBILITIES** **Quantum entities exist in a realm of potentiality, in what is called a state of \"superposition,\" which is to say they hover in a ghostly state between existence and nonexistence, existing in all possible states up until the moment they are observed.

Not existing in space-time, their appearance in space-time at the moment of observation is a quantum event in which an atemporal process manifests in time.** **Wheeler expresses the central point of quantum theory in a single, simple sentence when he says, \"*No elementary phenomenon is a (real) phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon.*\"** [[68]](#68) The necessity for this demarcation is the most mysterious feature of the quantum, for it holds the clue to the central principle of the construction of everything out of nothing. This tenet changes our traditional view that something has happened before we observe it; as Heisenberg writes, \"The term 'happens' is restricted to the observation.\" [[69]](#69) At the moment of being observed, the wavefunction collapses in no time at all into a particular manifestation, while all of the other potentialities vaporize as if they had never existed. [[70]](#70) **From the quantum point of view, everything that might have happened influences what actually does happen. In a quantum universe such as ours, everything ultimately exists in a state of open-ended potential, what Heisenberg calls \"transcendent potentia.\" Quantum theory implies that the whole universe - including ourselves - is recreated and recreating itself anew every nano-second based on how we are dreaming it up.** Wheeler comments in his own inimitable style, \"We may someday have to enlarge the scope of what we mean by a 'who.'\" [[71]](#71) Observation is the very act through which the quantum realm \"discloses\" itself. In quantum theory the moment of observation is where the rubber meets the road, which is to say, where abstract theory and empirical data meet and a specific actuality is realized and manifested out of a vast array of possibilities. It is important to note that we are always \"at\" the moment of observation, which is to say that we're there right now! There is no other moment but the one eternal moment of observation. The tendency to think that the moment of observation is just one single discrete moment in a linear sequence of other moments is due to the long ingrained habit of thinking in terms of linear sequential time, i.e., a \"linear time hangover.\" **In our role as observer-participants, it is as if we are on the cutting edge of the big bang itself, on the forefront of the moment of creation that is always taking place in this very moment, in the here and now.** Quantum theory is revealing to us the creative nature of our moment-to-moment experience.

It should get our highest attention that observing these quantum objects is the very act that brings them into existence. When we observe an atom to be someplace, quantum physics tells us that it is our looking that caused it to be there. Just like a rainbow can't be said to exist until the moment that it is observed (as it is made up of light, moisture, and an eye), quantum entities can't be said to exist until the moment of observation; the act of observation is truly creative. Quantum theory reveals that there is nothing inherently real about the properties of an object that we measure; it is as if we ourselves are intimately involved in producing the results of our own measurements. Our discovery of a quantum entity in a very real sense \"causes\" it to be there, which implies that there is no physically real world independent of our observation of it. Before these entities are observed they don't really exist, there is nothing we can say about them; they are \"unspeakable.\" Wheeler sometimes used a baseball analogy to illustrate this situation. Talking about how they call balls and strikes, [[72]](#72) some umpires say \"I call them the way I see 'em,\" which is an expression of the subjective, projective nature of our perception. A second umpire might say \"I call them the way they are,\" which is an expression of there being an objectively existing reality not dependent on observation, which was Einstein's point of view. Wheeler then quotes a quantum umpire who would say \"They ain't nothing till I call 'em,\" which is an expression of a quantum baseball game in which nothing exists until it is observed. The properties of quantum objects aren't inherent to the object, but instead emerge from and are created by interactions with their environment as well as their relationship to observers and their inescapably creative acts of observation. We can use light as an example: it is well known that light displays either wave-like or particle-like qualities depending upon the experimental set-up and how it is observed. To be more accurate, the wave-like or particle-like behavior that we observe in light is not a property of light per se, it is a property of our *interaction *with light. If, as quantum physics attests, there is no independent, external objective reality, then light, be it in its wave-like or particle-like aspect, cannot be said to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:31:3391e2c00030", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11388, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 32, "text": "example: it is well known that light displays either wave-like or particle-like qualities depending upon the experimental set-up and how it is observed.

If, as quantum physics attests, there is no independent, external objective reality, then light, be it in its wave-like or particle-like aspect, cannot be said to exist separate from our interaction with it. In other words, light has no properties independent of us. What we are saying about light is true of everything; **what we experience is not external reality, but our interaction with what our minds construe to be an external reality.** Wheeler likens how we create \"reality\" out of nothing but our interactions to a slightly skewed, surprise version of the party game \"twenty questions.\" In the regular version of the game, someone leaves the room, and everyone decides on a word. The person is allowed to ask a series of yes or no questions until they feel that they have enough information to guess the word. Wheeler tells the story that he was the one sent out of the room, and when he came back and began asking his yes or no questions, his friends were taking longer and longer to answer. The tension was building in the room, until he finally guessed the word to be \"cloud,\" at which point the whole room bursts out into hysterical laughter. His friends explained to him that they had decided to not decide on a predetermined word, and were play-acting \"as if\" they had decided on a particular word based on nothing but the answers they were giving, the only rule being that every answer had to be consistent with all previous answers. There was no word that existed until the very moment of Wheeler's guess. Wheeler's questions and interactions with his friends helped create, or to say it differently - \"magically conjured\" - the word in the same way that physicists' and their measuring apparatuses' interactions with the subatomic realm actually create the elementary particles they are measuring. To talk about the word \"cloud\" existing \"in the room\" - i.e., in the \"minds\" of Wheeler's friends - before Wheeler's guess is not accurate, in the same way that the elementary particle wasn't \"in the universe\" before the experiment, having no existence prior to being measured. Similarly, in our inquiries into the nature of the universe it is easy to imagine that the final answer already exists, which we will one day uncover, without realizing that the very questions we ask and the actions we take condition and help to create the answers we get back.

If Wheeler had asked different questions or the same questions in a different order, he would have ended up with a different word. The idea that the word \"cloud\" was sitting there, waiting to be discovered, is in Wheeler's words \"pure delusion and fantasy.\" In discussing the surprise version of the game of twenty questions as illustrative of how physicists participate in producing the results of their experiments, Wheeler painstakingly makes the point that the power he had to bring about the word \"cloud\" was only partial. Similarly, the experimenter has some substantial influence on what will happen to the electron by the choice of experiments he will perform, i.e., \"the questions he will put to nature;\" but there is always a certain unpredictability about what any given one of his measurements will disclose, i.e., \"what answers nature will give.\" This unpredictability is because the rest of the universe is always inescapably involved in any observation that we make.** Quantum reality is not subjective - a mere figment of the imagination - just as it is not objective. The quantum dimension is the bridge, the intermediate realm between the subjective mental realm \"in here\" and the seemingly objective world \"out there,\" somehow coupling the two.** Quantum entities don't \"have\" or \"possess\" intrinsic properties. The fact that the properties of these quantum objects is a function of our observation and that there is no substance, no separately existing intrinsic quantum object separate from its properties, is an expression of these quantum objects having no independently existing objective reality. They are not real in the way we commonly think of something being real. And yet, we ourselves, as well as the experimental instruments physicists are using to measure these not-real quantum objects, are made of the same quantum stuff that itself isn't real in the ordinary sense. This brings up a related question: how does the mass-less, intangible photon, which has zero weight, give rise to even a single particle that has mass, not to mention the massive weight of the whole universe? [[73]](#73) Simply put, there aren't any nuts and bolts at the quantum level. We can't visualize the quantum world, not because we know too little, but because we know too much.

It is as if objective reality has slipped beyond our grasp, beyond concepts, beyond even the concept of existence and nonexistence. To quote one of the most important astrophysicists of the first part of the twentieth century, Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington, \"We have found a strange footprint on the shores of the unknown. We have devised profound theories, one after another, to account for its origins. At last, we have succeeded in reconstructing the creature that made the footprint. And lo! It is our own.\" [[74]](#74) **Exploring the farthest reaches of the outside micro-world brings us right back to our inner selves.** We can never speak about nature without, at the same time, speaking about ourselves. Poetically expressing the same realization, Wheeler asks, \"What is Out There? 'Tis Ourselves?\" [[75]](#75) **11. MERLIN** Quantum theory points out that the \"real world\" is not classical, but quantum mechanical. **Rather than the quantum realm being illusory, quantum physics points out that the appearance of the macroscopic, conventional world can be likened to a holographic optical illusion produced by the interaction of our sense faculties with quantum reality. **Quantum theory insists that our everyday world is embedded in quantum reality, that our day-to-day world is quantum through and through, which is to say that the quantum realm is not separate from the world of ordinary objects. The world of the very small is co-extensive with the world at large. **Quantum theory applies to big things as well as small; we can't get to first base without quantum theory in dealing with such large-scale objects as stars, for example. And yet, our everyday world, with its chairs, trees and people, seems, at least to all appearances, not to be quantum at all, but quite real, and solid, very much in alignment with classical physics' version of reality, with its one-at-a-time sequence of definite actualities. ** When we throw a baseball, for example, it has a continuous trajectory that can be measured.

And yet, quantum theory tells us that baseballs are quantum objects, too - they have a cloud of probability which collapses from uncertainty to certainty, but their quantum fluctuations are so microscopically small that they are entirely below the threshold of observation. The elementary particle and the baseball differ only in scale, not in principle. To quote physicist Hideo Mabuchi, it is as if \"the universe were ruled by atoms' aversion to the public embarrassment of quantum behavior writ large.\" [[76]](#76) In the transition from the random uncertainty of the quantum realm, where particles ceaselessly spring into and out of existence, to the seeming solidity and orderly certainty of our everyday world, **the question naturally arises, where is this boundary between the quantum world, where things don't actually exist in a real way but in a state of potentiality, and our everyday world, where things at least appear to exist in a solid-seeming way?** Wheeler asks the question, \"If the world 'out there' is writhing like a barrel of eels, why do we detect a barrel of concrete when we look?\" [[77]](#77) How do the classical and quantum worlds join together? **The quantum reality of the microworld is inextricably entangled with the classical reality of the macroworld, as the part has no meaning except in relation to the whole.** And if the ordinary-seeming classical realm manifests out of the underlying quantum domain, where did the \"weirdness\" of the quantum realm go? [[78]](#78) The moment of observation appears to be the link between the uncertainty of the quantum world and the apparent certainty of the classical world, for observation is the point at which what might happen (or, in a quantum physics sense, all the things that the quantum realm is doing simultaneously while \"nothing is happening\") crystallizes into what does happen. As Heisenberg writes, \"... the transition from the 'possible' to the 'actual' takes place during the act of observation.\" [[79]](#79) This brings up the question: *How* does the act of observation, of gaining mere information (i.e., knowledge or \"software\"), modify the state of macroscopic things (\"hardware\")? According to quantum theory, the whole universe is in a quantum state, which is to say that, at least in principle, there ultimately is no boundary between the microscopic/quantum realm and the macroscopic/classical realm.

Though some physicists still cling to the idea that these two realms are separate, others consider it delusional to conceive of there being a distinction between the two. In any case, it certainly seems as if the boundary between the quantum world and the everyday, classical world is an extremely interesting place, the exploring of which could bring about great insights. **Paradoxically, in quantum physics the macroworld determines, through the act of macroscopic observer-participancy, the microscopic reality that it itself is made of.** Wheeler calls the quantum principle the \"Merlin principle\" because of the way the ever-elusive quantum shape-shifts and, Mercury-like, changes form to continually escape our too-limited and limiting conceptions of it. Wheeler recounts, \"You remember Merlin the magician; you chased him and he changed into a fox; you chased the fox and it changed to a rabbit; you chased the rabbit and it became a bird fluttering on your shoulder.\" [[80]](#80) Just like trying to grasp a rainbow or chase after a projection, the quantum always eludes our grasp. **If someone says that quantum theory is \"completely clear\" to them, it is Bohr's opinion that \"he has not really understood the subject.\" There is always an element of uncertainty [[81]](#81) in describing quantum entities; they can never be known in their totality. We can never know both their position and momentum at the same time, which makes it impossible to pin these quantum objects down.** It is not a question of building better technology to one day know both of these properties; it is \"as if\" these quantum entities don't possess both of these qualities at the same moment. **If we know where these quantum entities are, it is as if we pay a price, for then we don't know where they're going. Similarly, if we know where they're going, we don't know where they are.** We reach a certain point at which one part or another of our picture of nature becomes blurred, and there is no way to refocus that part without blurring another part of the picture. Nature is so constructed that we can study one aspect of nature or another, without any possibility of studying both aspects simultaneously. Not only is the \"path\" of quantum objects unknowable, but they can't even be conceived of having a path in the normal sense of the word; the very notion of having a path comes into question.

These quantum objects can be at point A in one moment and - in what is called a \"quantum jump\" - instantaneously be at point B without having traversed a path between these different locations. Quantum physics has shown that not only is the full description of these quantum particles unknown, but, because they do not exist prior to being measured, they are ultimately unknowable. **It is not that the deeper reality is veiled and we can't know it; rather, there is no deeper, independent reality based on our ordinary conceptions of what this means.** Whereas in the mythical land of \"Oz,\" reality stems from the wizard's conjuring trick, in the quantum realm, Bohr argued, there is no wizard. There is \"nothing\" behind the curtain; all we see is the formless archetypal play of phenomena itself, a display which is empty of inherent existence and inextricably linked to our consciousness and its various operations. This is both a display \"to\" our consciousness and an expression \"of\" our consciousness at the same time, as the distinction between subjective and objective reality dissolves. As physicists have chased the quantum/Merlin principle, to quote Wheeler, \"... in each ten years of its history, it's somehow taken on a different color, each time growing more magnificent in plumage, more penetrating in meaning, and more comprehensive in power.\" [[82]](#82) **The further we descend down the quantum physics rabbit hole, the more magnificent the plumage of this very strange quantum bird. The more we appreciate the quantum realm, the more it appreciates, and the more there is to appreciate, as if it's the gift that never stops giving, a wish-fulfilling jewel beyond belief. **As Wheeler reminds us, the quantum, the smallest stuff in the universe, is the crack in the armor that covers the secret of existence. Big stuff indeed! It is Wheeler's opinion that in exploring this opening, \"we are at the beginning, not the end.\" **12. DREAM STUFF** Etymologically, the word \"science\" comes from the Latin word \"scire,\" which means \"to know.\" What the founders of quantum physics realized is that the proper subject matter of science is not what is \"out there,\" but rather, what we can \"know\" about our world, which clearly includes us. At the quantum level science becomes inseparable from epistemology.

This \"failure of thing-ness\" is one of the fundamental features of the quantum world. **In the quantum realm we never end up with things, but always with interactive relationships. **Our \"thing-king\" mind can't grasp or relate to the simplicity, elegance - and ungraspability - of the quantum realm.

To say something is epiontic is to suggest something whose existence is intrinsically intertwined with the knowledge we have of it. To be epiontic is to imply that the act of knowing creates its being, which is to say that, just as within a dream, the act of perception creates the existence of whatever is perceived. **At the quantum level, being and knowing, perception and reality, epistemology and ontology are inextricably entangled.** [[84]](#84) The world that appears to be an independent material world is constructed from \"quantum epiontic dream stuff\" which is of the nature of mind, or consciousness. This quantum epiontic \"dream stuff\" is capable of producing the seeming solidity of the material world from out of the process of perception.

If we buy into the perspective that the world objectively exists in and by itself, we have then fallen under a self-created and self-perpetuating spell, evoking evidence that simply confirms our original unexamined assumption. This is a process in which our mind's own genius for co-creating reality is unwittingly turned against us in a way that can severely limit us, stifling the awareness of our options and thus crippling our greater potentials. We can become imprisoned by our belief in the objective truth of our perceptions in such a way that we hypnotize ourselves and literally become blind to our imprisonment, remaining convinced that we are simply \"in touch with reality.\" [[87]](#87) The persistent appearance of the classical world is generated by innumerable sentient beings through a continuous web of rapidly repeated, habitual perceptions over vast stretches of time, which amounts to a collective inter-subjective feedback loop. Once the appearance of an apparently stable material world gains enough momentum it develops a self-sustaining pattern which confers a seeming immutability upon our world, a perception which literally becomes reinforced, inscribed and embedded into the very quantum ground of being. Solidifying the fluid dreamlike nature of our world, we then create a collective dream that seems by all appearances to be solid and fully classical. Referring to the outside world, Zurek writes that in whatever way it manifests it acts \"... as a communication channel.... It is like a big advertising billboard, which floats multiple copies of the information about our universe all over the place.\" [[88]](#88) The more often a perception of an independent, objective world is made, the more potent becomes the classical world's advertising billboard campaign, increasing its broadcasting power as it further proliferates its meme into ever-more brains. **The viewpoint that is emerging from the cutting edge of quantum physics is that, instead of being an epiphenomenon of matter, consciousness is the ontological ground and driving force of the process of reality itself.

We couldn't imagine or \"dream up\" a more dreamlike physics than quantum physics if we tried. Quantum physics is the physics of the universal dream, in the sense that quantum physics is simultaneously pointing to the dreamlike nature of reality while being an expression of the very dreamlike nature at which it is pointing. Wheeler \"confesses\" that, in apparent moments of lucidity, \"sometimes I do take 100 percent seriously the idea that the world is a figment of the imagination.\" [[91]](#91) **The discovery of the quantum observership-based nature of reality represents the first rupture in the armor of the classical chrysalis that has long encased the human mind and fettered the human spirit, tightly holding it in a state of slumber dreaming of a deterministic, clockwork cosmos. Irreversibly awakening out of its somnambulistic trance, humanity is going through an evolutionary metamorphosis in which it is unfurling its iridescent wings of creative imagination as it flies into the open-ended space of previously undreamt possibilities, releasing itself into the luminous imaginal sky of freedom.** **13. KEY POINTS** There is no objective reality independent of an observer. We live in a participatory universe. The observer affects what is observed by the mere act of observing. Quantum entities exist in a multiplicity of simultaneous potential states (called a superposition), hovering in an abstract realm between existence and nonexistence prior to being observed. There is no independent quantum entity separate from its properties. Its properties are a function of our observation.

Our act of observation not only changes the present state of the universe, it reaches backwards in time and changes what we can say about the past. This turns our conception of linear time and causality on its head. The questions we ask make a difference. The universe is a seamless, undivided and instantaneously interconnected whole. This is to say that each part of the universe is interrelated with every other part in an immediate and unmediated way. An expression of this wholeness is the universe's nonlocality, in which every part of the universe is related to and in communication with every other part. Our universe doesn't play by the typical rules of third-dimensional space and time. Quantum entities can jump from one place to another without traversing the path in-between. The laws of physics are not written in stone, but are mutable. The quantum universe is not separate from consciousness; rather, it is an expression of consciousness. Mind and matter are no longer seen as separate. Our ordinary, day-to-day universe is quantum through and through. Quantum physics literally changes and transforms our mind, as it introduces a new way of thinking. It also helps us see the world differently, which helps the world to manifest differently. Quantum physics is showing us how we ourselves are moment by moment playing a key role in the creation of our experience, as well as in the genesis of the cosmos, in this very moment. Significantly altering Descartes' famous principle, \"I think therefore I am,\" quantum physics would instead say, \"I choose therefore I am.\" Quantum physics is a revelation in living form: it is showing us the dreamlike nature of our universe. **Note: **The above essay has been edited for brevity.

This is one of the central and most burning philosophical questions in quantum physics. In addition to humans, what about a cat, or a mouse, a cockroach, an amoeba, a piece of mica? Where does consciousness first enter in the elaborate hierarchy of terrestrial life? Where does the capacity to collapse a wavefunction derive from? - from the presence of consciousness or from some other condition? It's as if observership and its ability to translate unmanifest possibilities into definite actualities is a pervasive feature which is widely distributed throughout the web of life. From this perspective all life forms are dreaming together, collectively collapsing the universal wavefunction of this universe to manifest the way it is moment by moment. [29] Wheeler, *At Home in the Universe*, p. 26. [30] In my recent book *Dispelling Wetiko: Breaking the Curse of Evil*, I point out that our unawareness of our participation in creating our experience is actually at the root of a psycho-spiritual dis-ease (which I call \"malignant egophrenia\" or \"wetiko\"), a malady which is causing great destruction, both within ourselves and out in the world at large. What I call \"Aparticipatory Delusional Syndrome\" (ADS for short) is based on the deluded assumption that we are separate from and not participating in calling forth the very situation in the outside world to which we are reacting. ADS is the primary, underlying psychological \"dynamic\" or \"engine\" that fuels the \"malignant\" aspect of malignant egophrenia/wetiko. The extent to which we feel ourselves the victim of circumstances and don't realize our complicity in what is playing out in our lives is the extent to which we have fallen prey to ADS.

The extent to which we feel ourselves the victim of circumstances and don't realize our complicity in what is playing out in our lives is the extent to which we have fallen prey to ADS. ADS effectively immobilizes and renders inoperative our ability to self-reflect, as it relates to the world through the fixed and non-negotiable lens of assumptions that the world \"object\"-ively exists, independent of ourselves. When we are stricken with ADS, we react to our perceptions and interpretations as if they exist inherently and independently in the objects of the world, rather than realizing that they are automatic reflexions of the way we are looking and are thus always revealing the subject (ourselves). When we have fallen under the spell of ADS, we always see the cause of our problems as being outside of ourselves. In an unconscious \"reflex,\" we then try to \"attack\" the problem from the wrong point of view, externally, instead of approaching its source, which is within ourselves. ADS is a \"semantic syndrome\" in which we are misinterpreting the nature of our experience, subtly but significantly altering the way our mind gives meaning to and contextualizes our experience of the universe as well as ourselves. A simple example: I am withdrawing from my girlfriend due to my own wound. She senses this, which triggers her insecurities around being rejected. In her reaction, she acts out her wound, which gives me all the seemingly \"objective\" evidence that I need to further justify my withdrawal. I don't realize, however, my complicity in invoking the very wound in her to which I am reacting. [31] Wheeler, *At Home in the Universe*, p. 120.

[34] Note how Wheeler's description of the universe as a self-excited circuit is similar to what in alchemy is called the \"prima materia,\" which is the \"famous secret\" and the basis of the entire alchemical opus. It is the raw material out of which the lapis, the philosophers' stone (the highest value) is made. The prima materia is called *radix ipsius *(root of itself). It is an *increatum, *an uncreated, autonomous, self-generating, spirit-like entity which is rooted in itself, is dependent on nothing, and has everything that it needs. Without beginning or end, and in need of \"no second,\" it can by definition only be something of a divine nature. The prima materia is related to the God-image of the alchemists, Mercurius, who interestingly enough, begets himself.

[62] Note the similarity to the Buddhist idea of \"dependent co-arising\" (also called interdependent co-origination), which is considered to be the very condition of and process by which empirical reality is constituted. This view is not a final affirmation about reality, as it doesn't seek to define a reality external to the observer, but rather, is a way of seeing that focuses on how our experience of the world and ourselves arises. Similar to quantum physics, dependent co-arising is considered to be a milestone in human thought; its ever-deepening realization is one of the greatest and furthest reaching cognitive revolutions of our time. [63] Forty years ago, during my freshman year in college, I was visiting my best friend, who was a first-year physics student at Princeton. I accompanied him to his introductory physics class, and right before the class started, he leaned over, and in a very impressed voice whispered in my ear \"John Wheeler is sitting right", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality-full.txt:45:50964198ab7e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11402, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality-full.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality-full", "chunk_index": 46, "text": "considered to be a milestone in human thought; its ever-deepening realization is one of the greatest and furthest reaching cognitive revolutions of our time.

I accompanied him to his introductory physics class, and right before the class started, he leaned over, and in a very impressed voice whispered in my ear \"John Wheeler is sitting right behind you.\" He was close enough that I could have reached out and touched him. Unfortunately, the fact that John Wheeler was sitting behind me meant absolutely nothing to me at the time, for I literally had no idea who John Wheeler was. I now joke with my friends that Wheeler and my wavefunctions became phase-entangled at that moment. [64] Wheeler, *Geons, Black Holes and Quantum Foam*, p. 341. [65] In light of the new worldview emerging from quantum physics, we have to develop a new form of language to describe heretofore un-navigated realms. We cannot speak about atoms, for example, in ordinary language. To quote Wheeler, \"The kind of physics that goes on does not adjust itself to the available terminology: the terminology has to adjust in accordance with the kind of physics that goes on.\" *Science and Ultimate Reality: Quantum Theory, Cosmology and Complexity*, p. 177. Based on the process-oriented nature of the quantum realm, our new language should be based more on verbs than nouns, and more on action, events and movements than on static things. To again quote Wheeler, \"How can we hope to move forward with no solid ground at all under our feet? Then we remember that Einstein had to perform the same miracle. He had to re-express all of physics in a new language.\" Wheeler, *At Home in the Universe*, p. 294. Human language is a remarkable form of information processing, capable of expressing, well, anything that can be put into words. [66] Note how this is similar, and obviously related to Jung's inquiries into synchronistic phenomena, in which the boundary between mind and matter dissolves. [67] Wheeler, *Geons,* *Black Holes and Quantum Foam*, p. 341. [68] Wheeler, *Frontiers of Time*, p. 4. Wheeler has been quoted saying this numerous times, sometimes with the word \"real,\" at other times without. [69] Heisenberg, *Physics and Philosophy*, p. 52. [70] There is another interpretation, however, known as the \"Many-Worlds Interpretation,\" that says that all of the other potentialities actually do occur but each in its own parallel universe. [71] Wheeler, *At Home in the Universe*, p. 307. [72] Over the course of this article, I have used numerous baseball analogies to elucidate quantum reality.

[78] It should be noted that as we stop solidifying the fluid, dreamlike nature of our universe and recognize its dreamlike quality, the more dreamlike and synchronistic (and hence, \"weirdly\") it will manifest. Once we stop superimposing our own fixed and limited ideas upon its dreamlike fabric, we allow it to reveal its dreamlike magic. Once we let go our grasp, the universe will exhibit more synchronistic phenomena, which literally reveal the underlying quantum. We can use our imagination to deepen our understanding of this - when we are in a night dream, if we recognize that we are dreaming (instead of thinking the universe we are inhabiting is objectively real and separate from us), we allow the dream to reveal even more its dreamlike nature. For being like a dream, the universe is not separate from the consciousness that's observing it, a realization which it continually reflects back to itself through us.

Published and edited with Paul's permission. **QUANTUM PHYSICS: THE PHYSICS OF DREAMING**** By Paul Levy, [http://www.awakeninthedream.com](http://www.awakeninthedream.com)** In discovering the quantum, physics has indisputably encountered consciousness. Quantum physics is pointing out, in unequivocal terms, that the study of the universe and the study of consciousness are inseparably linked, and that ultimate progress in the one will be impossible without progress in the other. The discovery of the quantum nature of our universe is a seismic, tectonic shift in the very foundation of physics and the roots of our scientific worldview, a change so momentous that it can literally transform the course of human history. The founders of quantum physics, people such as Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrodinger famously argued that quantum physics is first and foremost a new way of thinking. **Quantum theory is teaching us that implicit in our very thinking are certain flaws and misperceptions that, unseen and taken for granted, unnecessarily limit our ability to apprehend the nature of nature, including our own**. **Quantum physics is the most subversive of all the sciences, having created a \"reality crisis\" in the field of physics such that the very idea of \"reality\" itself has been undermined.** Physicists have, in their attempts at grasping its implications, lost their grip on reality, finding nothing to hold onto.

And yet, even with the huge impact quantum physics has had on all of our lives, this effect is infinitesimally small compared with what it will be when more of us recognize and internalize the implications of what it is revealing to us about the nature of reality as well as of ourselves. This is the deep philosophical question that begs to be answered - what does quantum physics mean? And do we use the discoveries of quantum physics for the betterment of our species, or to destroy ourselves? Quantum theory reflects back to us that the choice is truly ours. ** PARTICIPATORY UNIVERSE** **Quantum physics forever shattered the idea of there being an objectively existing world.** It is ironic that physics, long considered the most \"objective\" of all the sciences, in pursuing its dedicated quest to understand the deep nature of the material universe, has dispelled the very notion of an objective universe. Quantum theory has opened up the door to a profoundly new vision of the cosmos, where the observer, the observed and the act of observation are inseparably united. In quantum physics, we are no longer passive witnesses of the universe, but rather, we unavoidably find ourselves in the new role of active participants who in-form, give shape to and in some mysterious sense \"create\" the very universe we are interacting with. In essence, consciousness has entered into the physics laboratory, and physicists are not quite sure what to make of this. Coming to terms and facing up to the intrusion of consciousness into their hallowed halls is forcing physics to come to terms with questions of meta-physics, which for most physicists is not what they signed up for. **Quantum physics is itself the greatest threat to the underlying metaphysical assumptions of \"scientific materialism,\" a perspective which assumes that there is an independently existing, objective material world that is separate from the observer.** **The quantum revolution has revealed that the classical worldview was something that existed entirely within the minds of a certain strain of European humanity that became reified into an orthodox creed and held the mind of modern humanity in a prison of its own making, as if humanity had become spellbound. ** Physicists themselves haven't fully comprehended and don't quite know what to make of what they have unwittingly stumbled upon. They have been forced to wrestle, not just intellectually but emotionally, existentially and spiritually with their own discoveries in the quantum realm.

They have been forced to wrestle, not just intellectually but emotionally, existentially and spiritually with their own discoveries in the quantum realm. Quantum theory has pushed its adherents to the very edge of the unknown, both out in the world and within themselves. In trying to understand nature, physics is helping us discover our own nature. In re-visioning our idea of the world we live in, we change our perception of the possibilities available in our world, thus opening up previously unimagined pathways of creative and effective action. \"Objective reality\" is now an unexamined implicit assumption, an idea in our mind. What most of us call objective reality is simply an interpretation of data whose meaning is agreed upon by the majority, what can be called a \"consensus reality.\" **REALITY** Quantum theory brings the question to the fore: Are we discovering reality, or creating it? And if we are, at least in part, creating what we call reality, what are we creating it out of? According to our subjective experience the world certainly seems real enough, apparently contradicting what quantum physics is telling us about the world's lack of inherent, objective reality. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the world behaves \"as if\" it has an independent reality, which furthers our visceral belief in objective reality. Yet objectivity itself is a recent human phenomenon. The Scientific Revolution was a deepening of our powers of reason, a flowering of human creativity and a breakthrough for humanity, helping us to explore our world in ever-more profound and ingenious ways. From another point of view, the Scientific Revolution was also the onset of a particular form of madness. It started as a new worldview that was revolutionary in its power; yet it contained a subtle error that solidified into a widespread delusion which has over time profoundly enabled the collective psychosis that our species finds itself in. **An essential feature of this madness is the severing between the subject and object, the observer and the observed, as if the scientific imagination thought that in its intellectual examination of the world, it wasn't part of, participating in, and thereby affecting that which it was investigating.** Seeing the world as separate from ourselves has become the prevailing and institutionalized worldview of \"the academy,\" a viewpoint that takes the heart, soul and \"magic\" out of the world, reducing it to a dead, inanimate, insensate domain. This was done in pursuit of the ideal of objectivity, which was gradually elevated to the level of an absolute truth about the nature of reality. This approach worked remarkably well when it came to dealing with the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality.txt:2:962c05344cc1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11408, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "which it was investigating.** Seeing the world as separate from ourselves has become the prevailing and institutionalized worldview of \"the academy,\" a viewpoint that takes the heart, soul and \"magic\" out of the world, reducing it to a dead, inanimate, insensate domain. This was done in pursuit of the ideal of objectivity, which was gradually elevated to the level of an absolute truth about the nature of reality. This approach worked remarkably well when it came to dealing with the macroscopic world, enabling unprecedented levels of control to be exerted over the physical world. But an unseen cost was being incurred by the human spirit. Increasingly enthralled by science's ever-growing achievements and technological wizardry, few questioned whether these very advances might at the same time be leading humanity astray from essential aspects of the true nature of our being, slowly dehumanizing our species in the process. In contrast, quantum theory implies that immaterial factors having more of the nature of images and ideas are the blue-print for our universe, actually in-forming and shaping the evolution of the universe as a whole. It is as if the universe itself is conspiring with us to help us awaken to its, and our nature, and quantum physics is the theoretical and experimental \"instrument\" for this deeper insight to reveal itself. Seen as a symbol crystallizing out of the dreamlike nature of reality, quantum physics is revealing to us that we don't live in the mechanistic, Cartesian world of classical physics, but rather, inhabit an enchanted world not separate from our mind's creative imagination. **What we call reality is simply a theory and internalized mental model which is at bottom a way of looking at the world, rather than a form of absolutely true knowledge of how the world \"really\" is.** It is important not to conflate reality with our theories, not to confuse the map with the territory. Our best models are no more than aids to our imagination, by no means are they complete reflections of the nature of reality. ** THE LAWS OF PHYSICS** Quantum physics has raised the question, is the ever-evolving universe like a work of art in progress, making up its laws as it goes along? **The idea that the laws which inform the functioning of reality spring into manifestation out of nothingness fully formed is a nonsensical, preposterous idea. **As one quantum physicist comments, \"The laws of physics were not installed in advance by a Swiss watchmaker.\" They must have somehow come into being. The central and all-encompassing role of the observer in quantum mechanics, what has been referred to as the \"magic ingredient,\" is the most important clue we have regarding the construction of the universe. The universe gives rise to meaning-establishing observer-participants, who, in developing the ideas of quantum mechanics, grant a meaningful existence to the universe. **The construction of the universe is such that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality.txt:3:05c5e0f93e17", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11409, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "physics were not installed in advance by a Swiss watchmaker.\" They must have somehow come into being. The central and all-encompassing role of the observer in quantum mechanics, what has been referred to as the \"magic ingredient,\" is the most important clue we have regarding the construction of the universe. The universe gives rise to meaning-establishing observer-participants, who, in developing the ideas of quantum mechanics, grant a meaningful existence to the universe. **The construction of the universe is such that the observer is as essential to the creation of the universe as the universe is essential to the creation of the observer. ** In a world without a built-in purpose, quantum theory \"promotes\" the observer to the definer of reality and generator of meaning, which is essentially a creator of distinctions, a primordially creative role. **However we view it, we can't get around the fact that we are participating in creating our experience of the universe. ** Quantum physics is riddled with paradox to its core. Thinking \"quantum-logically,\" we are able to hold paradox in a new way; instead of needing one or the other viewpoint to be true, in a higher form of logic, we can hold seemingly contradictory statements together as both being true simultaneously. This gives new insight into how what may appear to be contradictions at one level can be part of a deeper consistency and completeness from a higher, more inclusive level. As renowned quantum physicist John Archibald Wheeler once said, \"The universe gives birth to consciousness, and consciousness gives meaning to the universe.\" The emergence of consciousness in the universe is as epic and epochal an event in cosmic history as the first big blast of its materialization in the supposed big bang. In this process of self-cognition, the universe is able to turn back upon itself so as to explore its nature via its various life forms. In such a self-referential cosmology whose nature is a self-generating feedback loop of pure creativity, we are dreaming up the universe, while at the same time the universe is reciprocally dreaming us up. The seemingly subjective and objective realities interblend and co-create each other. **As observers, we are participants in the genesis of the universe. ** **COSMOGENESIS** **Without observers, there is no existence.** The observer is both a result of an evolutionary process and, in some sense, the cause of its own emergence. In other words, mind-boggling as it is to contemplate, we may be \"observer-participants\" playing a role in the genesis of the cosmos in this very moment. We live in a universe that is capable not only of harboring life, but of cultivating life which is intelligent enough to ask about its origins. In our observing and reflecting upon our universe we are actually changing the universe's idea of itself.

In our observing and reflecting upon our universe we are actually changing the universe's idea of itself. Through us, the universe questions itself and tries out various answers on itself in an effort - parallel to our own - to decipher its own being. **Quantum physics has discovered that there are no elementary particles, no fundamental \"building blocks\" of reality. \"The atoms or elementary particles themselves form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than one of things or facts.\" **They are not located in time or space but in an abstract realm. Subatomic objects don't exist as things, but rather, as events, as happenings, as dynamic ever-changing interactive psycho-physical processes. **What these elementary entities \"are\" and what they \"do\" are inseparably intertwined. **The aspects of nature represented by quantum theory are converted from elements of \"being\" to elements of \"doing,\" which basically replaces the world of material substances with a world populated by actions, events and processes. **In the quantum world, there is no \"place\" for matter, in the same way that in the classical world there is no \"place\" for mind. Classical physics' theory of a world of matter is converted by quantum physics into a theory of the relationship between matter and mind. Unveiling a great mystery, quantum physics is pointing out that the ultimate nature of the universe is more mind-like than matter-like. ** The quantum universe can be properly conceived of only as an intricately interconnected dynamic whole. Our universe is an emergent universe in which the whole is greater than the sum of any of its parts can even imagine. An emergent global property can feed back to influence the individuals who produced it in an interlocking, creativity-generating, self-sustaining and life-supporting feedback loop. Thus individuals and groups can begin to consciously tap into the energy that makes up the quantum realm - the zero point energy of creation itself - in a way which changes everything. Our nonlocal universe's spooky action-at-a-distance is an expression of the fundamental, indivisible wholeness of the universe, which is radically different from classical physics' previous conception of the universe as composed of separate parts.** At the quantum level, there is the radically new notion of intrinsic unbroken wholeness, a seamless interconnectedness among all of the universe's seemingly separate parts. At the quantum level, the universe is \"one\" with itself. ** ** A PHYSICS OF POSSIBILITIES** Quantum entities exist in a realm of potentiality, in what is called a state of \"superposition,\" which is to say they hover in a ghostly state between existence and nonexistence, existing in all possible states", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality.txt:5:6c364dd46770", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11411, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "composed of separate parts.** At the quantum level, there is the radically new notion of intrinsic unbroken wholeness, a seamless interconnectedness among all of the universe's seemingly separate parts.

Not existing in space-time, their appearance in space-time at the moment of observation is a quantum event in which an atemporal process manifests in time. Everything ultimately exists in a state of open-ended potential. In the transition from the random uncertainty of the quantum realm, where particles ceaselessly spring into and out of existence, to the seeming solidity and orderly certainty of our everyday world, the question naturally arises, where is this boundary between the quantum world, where things don't actually exist in a real way but in a state of potentiality, and our everyday world, where things at least appear to exist in a solid-seeming way? **Quantum theory implies that the whole universe - including ourselves - is recreated and recreating itself anew every nano-second based on how we are dreaming it up. ****What we experience is not external reality, but our interaction with what our minds construe to be an external reality. Quantum reality is not subjective, just as it is not objective. The quantum dimension is the bridge, the intermediate realm between the subjective mental realm \"in here\" and the seemingly objective world \"out there,\" somehow coupling the two.** **Rather than the quantum realm being illusory, quantum physics points out that the appearance of the macroscopic, conventional world can be likened to a [holographic optical illusion](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/stories/talbot.universe_hologram) produced by the interaction of our sense faculties with quantum reality. Behind the apparent solidity of everyday objects lies a world of open-ended potentiality.** It is not that the deeper reality is veiled and we can't know it; rather, there is no deeper, independent reality based on our ordinary conceptions of what this means. The further we descend down the quantum physics rabbit hole, the more magnificent the plumage of this very strange quantum bird. **In the quantum realm we never end up with things, but always with interactive relationships. At the quantum level, being and knowing, perception and reality, epistemology and ontology are inextricably entangled.** The viewpoint that is emerging from the cutting edge of quantum physics is that, instead of being an epiphenomenon of matter, consciousness is the ontological ground and driving force of the process of reality itself. Max Planck, the first person to propose the quantum nature of light and one of the first architects of quantum theory, commenting on what the new physics was revealing to humanity, famously said,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__what-is-reality.txt:6:1078b84a85cd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 11412, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "i__what-is-reality.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "i__what-is-reality", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "being and knowing, perception and reality, epistemology and ontology are inextricably entangled.** The viewpoint that is emerging from the cutting edge of quantum physics is that, instead of being an epiphenomenon of matter, consciousness is the ontological ground and driving force of the process of reality itself. Max Planck, the first person to propose the quantum nature of light and one of the first architects of quantum theory, commenting on what the new physics was revealing to humanity, famously said, \"Mind is the matrix of all matter.\" Consciousness is in some mysterious fashion creating the \"stuff\" of the material world. **The discovery of the quantum observership-based nature of reality represents the first rupture in the armor of the classical chrysalis that has long encased the human mind and fettered the human spirit, tightly holding it in a state of slumber dreaming of a deterministic, clockwork cosmos. Irreversibly awakening out of its somnambulistic trance, humanity is going through an evolutionary metamorphosis in which it is unfurling its iridescent wings of creative imagination as it flies into the open-ended space of previously undreamt possibilities, releasing itself into the luminous imaginal sky of freedom.** **KEY POINTS** There is no objective reality independent of an observer. The observer affects what is observed by the mere act of observing. Quantum entities exist in a multiplicity of simultaneous potential states (called a superposition). There is no independent quantum entity separate from its properties. Its properties are a function of our observation. The act of observation is the very act which turns the potentiality of the quantum world into the actuality of the seemingly ordinary world. The universe is a seamless, undivided and instantaneously interconnected whole. Each part of the universe is interrelated with every other part. An expression of this wholeness is the universe's nonlocality, in which every part of the universe is related to and in communication with every other part. The laws of physics are not written in stone, but are mutable. The quantum universe is not separate from consciousness; rather, it is an expression of consciousness. Mind and matter are no longer seen as separate. Quantum physics literally changes and transforms our mind, as it introduces a new way of thinking. It helps us see the world differently. Quantum physics shows us how we are playing a key role in the creation of our experience, as well as in the genesis of the cosmos, in this very moment.

During a two-day silent retreat in late 2010, I had some incredibly deep and fertile explorations which led to this essay and its title, \"Who created God? And where does consciousness come from?\" So who created God? In times of inquisition like that of [800 years ago in Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition#Medieval_Inquisition),** this question alone could easily have gotten me killed or at least sent to the torture chambers by the powers that be of the time - the Catholic Church. **Yet for me today, it is both a legitimate and a profound question.

Largely because of this ambiguity, I prefer either the words Spirit, the Divine, or - what I feel is the best descriptor of what these words are trying to convey - \"All That Is.\" So to reframe the question in my own words: Who created All That Is? Now if a person's answer to this is God, then I again ask: Who created God? **Even if one doesn't believe in God or any kind of divine being, the question remains: why does anything exist? Why not just nothingness?** And where does consciousness come from? To me, these are the ultimate existential questions.

Yet I have found that fear is invitation to growth, if I choose to let it be. Only by facing my own fears have I been able to dive so deep into [all that I explore](https://www.WantToKnow.info). By looking into even the possibility of ultimate nothingness and meaninglessness, I am choosing to face some of my own deepest fears. And as I explore these potent questions, I ask for and fully trust that I receive guidance. I apologize if my writing in any way offends your religious or spiritual beliefs. I have no desire to convince anyone of anything here. I am only sharing my own personal musings on the subject. If what I write doesn't work for you or offends you in any way, please just stop reading and know that I support whatever path you have chosen for yourself. And if my thoughts stimulate curiosity and new ponderings in you, how cool is that? My current answer to these deep questions - who created God (or All That Is) and where does consciousness come from - is simply I don't know. In fact I have not the faintest idea or speculation on these most core questions of existence. **To me this is the ultimate mystery, the deepest part of the divine mystery.** I suspect I will never be able to find an answer in this lifetime, and it may ultimately be a question that is unanswerable by anyone in this physical reality. So now that I have created the ultimate blasphemy by questioning even God's origin, where do I continue this line of inquiry? The next natural step for me is to acknowledge that my consciousness exists, and so does yours (or you wouldn't be reading this) and that of every conscious being in the universe. Somehow - though I don't know how - you, me, and all conscious beings who share this universe came to exist. Yet how did the universe come to be populated by all these conscious beings? I've heard some speculate that we all started as one unitary consciousness which eventually split itself into a vast myriad of consciousnesses to explore itself. This is certainly a reasonable speculation, though it does not answer the who created God question. Where did that one unitary consciousness come from? And what existed before that? How could one unitary consciousness even divide itself?

This is certainly a reasonable speculation, though it does not answer the who created God question. Where did that one unitary consciousness come from? And what existed before that? How could one unitary consciousness even divide itself? By the way, if any of you have reasonable answers to these questions, I would love to hear and consider them. I have no answer and just take it as a given that I exist and we all exist here, otherwise how could I be typing this message and you be reading it? Even if it is, as some say, all an illusion, well then the illusion is all I have to work with. **I do suspect that even though I have no idea where it came from, there is and always has been some form of greater consciousness, some integrated collective consciousness of All That Is - call it God if you like.** I suspect that somehow this source consciousness may have fragmented in order to explore itself, possibly because being the only thing that existed unto itself was in some way boring. And some or all of these fragments then further fragmented themselves into other conscious entities. Thus were eventually born all of the consciousnesses in the universe. I am not at all sure of this, but at least this is something I can wrap my mind around. Taking this a step further, if there was a source unitary consciousness which fragmented itself, I suspect that since that original fragmentation, there has always been a more expanded collective awareness of all of the fragments, a kind of divine collective consciousness of all beings. And along these lines, I find the [holographic model](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/trfc20b) resonates with me. This model or framework proposes that within each of the fragments the whole is contained. So from this viewpoint, there is a greater collective consciousness or intelligence, and within each of our individuated consciousnesses, we have access to this expanded collective awareness. **One of the things that complicates all of this is that I have no doubt that there are dimensions of existence in which time does not exist in any sort of linear sense.** So maybe trying to explore all of this using a time-based model of cause and effect is simply the futile effort of a very limited consciousness (me) trying to comprehend things in other realms that are simply incomprehensible from the limited viewpoint of a human being. Again, I don't know, but that doesn't stop me from exploring the possibilities.

Again, I don't know, but that doesn't stop me from exploring the possibilities. One possibility is that the posited source unitary consciousness might have first split itself into two (yin and yang), then into four, eight, 16, 32, etc., creating some kind of sacred geometry based in what we understand as mathematics. Or it might have been much more random (like chaos theory). Or maybe it was some kind of spiritual \"big bang,\" where the One suddenly exploded into a myriad of fragmented beings. I suspect if there ever was only one unitary consciousness, it likely fragmented through some combination of all of these processes - divine geometry, random divisions, and occasional explosive fragmentation. Diving into the first possibility - that the original source consciousness started with a split from one unitary consciousness into two individuated ones - this could have manifested a primal opposition; a source polarization whose ramifications can still be seen in our world today. The light/shadow, masculine/feminine, yin/yang split which can be seen in many aspects of existence are clear examples. **Among humans, some people focus a lot of attention on the polarities they see in life (good vs evil, right vs wrong, etc.), which could have originated in this original split. Yet clearly this world is not based in dualities alone. **There are countless examples of rainbow spectrums where the ends are only the most extreme poles of an entire rich spectrum. Between black and white are an infinite variety of colors. And each of us has at least some qualities of both masculine and feminine within us. It's interesting to note that in the many and vast spectrums of existence, the extremes seem to almost always be shadow images of each other. Black and white are more like each other than all of the other intermediate colors. They are [inverse shadows](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/g/way_of_the_wise_02) of each other, one representing complete emptiness, the other complete fullness. The choice to focus on polarized extremes shows up in our reality as black and white thinking, which plays an important role in our world. It may even play a key role in expanded realities going back to the posited original split, though I acknowledge all of this is highly speculative. Whether this is true or not, the fact is that many in this world tend to see things in polarized terms of black and white, good and bad. It makes it easier for them to maneuver through an already very complex and sometimes overwhelming life. Generally these people tend to be afraid of their own shadow. They do their best to welcome the light and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:i__who-created-god.txt:3:629a08946b82", "wtk_id": NaN}]
