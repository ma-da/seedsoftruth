Afghanistan has centuries of business on the old silk road.” Also, I had really come to appreciate the freedom and lifestyle I felt the people of the Atlas Mountains in Morroco enjoyed. While Ted was in the Peace Corps in India, Bill had worked for VISTA, the domestic Peace Corps (code for helping folks in the African-American part of town.) At the same time, I taught the poorest of the poor white kids in the Head Start program in rural white-bread America, where I encountered “dollar-anhour dads,” housing with “outdoor plumbing” and families accruing deep debt at the company store. Our ladies had other things in common besides falling in love with “adventurous sorts of guys,” as they would say. All had attended a year of “finishing school” before going to college. Exposure to art, literature and dance and emotional maturity could be the reason they wanted men who were into action, not accounting, and would rather boil well water and keep a cooking fire going instead of living in bland suburbia. This was the broad, new horizon extolled by the women’s liberation movement. Rebecca came from an open-minded, Jewish-Presbyterian family. Cathy, Patty and Rebecca had been exposed to museums, Shakespeare, the great books, charitable works and church. Her mother and four aunts were all college graduates and avid readers who wrote lengthy, intelligent letters. Rebecca had to answer so many it was almost like a daily diary; the travel stories from the books they read were, in a sense, brought into reality through her. Now all three had experienced a totalitarian, repressive, brutal action by the police. This was what they had been taught that life was like in a dark, repressive society or dictatorial banana republic, not their beloved America! They openly professed, to any and all during these emotionally distraught episodes, that their men were idealists who wanted racial and religious harmony, hope for the less fortunate and an end to the endless war. The women wanted the same thing, too, and that was the beauty of it all; that, and a lot of loving. Their men were not criminals or dangerous, even in their thoughts. These men, like themselves, were clinging to the hope that love would rule the world. All war was wrong. The “Living Right and Being Free” axiom was one of America’s best. At the suggestion of Mark Susnow, the other lawyer who had been busted, Joe Eszterhas contacted us for an interview about the infamous police action.

She posed Mark Susnow holding her telephone and actively gesturing. She then snapped another of Pat Ryan looking “lawyerly tough.” Terence Hallinan refused to be photographed. She had to grab a snap on the fly of Tony Serra walking through City Hall. Her magnificently staged portrait of Patrick Hallinan, in front of a mural of Pancho Villa, gave the public an early hint of her great artistic talent. Ted is quoted in the Eszterhas “Nark” article that hangs in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: “People identified themselves as police and crashed through the door. At gunpoint, they herded us down to a lower bedroom. The attorney Pat Herron, co-host of the party, asked if they had a warrant and they told him to shut up. Fifty-two people herded into a bedroom. Big Red Ted is quoted one more time in the “Nark” article and, to us, this quote summed it all up: “Hey man, it’s bad karma.” The attempt at an Orwellian “Animal Farm” political takeover in the Nixon era of Agent Orange, the napalm bombings, the policy of destroying villages in order to save them, COINTELPRO, and the “We don’t need no stinkin’ badges” mentality, all condensed into that one quote. Joe Eszterhas wrote it, “Rolling Stone” published it and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame preserved it.

He has told several different versions of his involvement: a story about a boy and a wolf comes to mind. So, we cannot know for certain, but we can use what Hunt tell us to explore and hopefully understand those ingrained events of November 22, 1963. The occasion of our first meeting was Howard’s coming on board as an employee at the Robert Mullen & Company upon his “retiring” from the CIA. The Mullen Company was a public relations firm with its headquarters in Washington, D.C. and with offices scattered around the globe. General Foods Corporation was a Mullen Company account. I had gone to work for General Foods in White Plains, New York, not long after graduating in 1966 from the New York University Law School. In 1969 General Foods assigned me to work out of the Mullen Company in conjunction with my job representing General Foods’ interests in the nation’s capital. Howard and I quickly became friends once we learned that we had another friend in common: William F. Buckley, Jr., publisher of National Review magazine. I had worked closely with Buckley in the founding of the modern conservative movement in the late 1950s and early 1960s. I had served as the first National Director of Young Americans for Freedom, a nationwide youth organization, which had been founded in September 1960 at a gathering of young conservative activists at the Buckley family compound in Sharon, Connecticut. A few months after our initial meeting, Robert Mullen called us into his office and surprised us by saying that he desired to retire and wanted to sell the Mullen Company. He then asked if we would be interested in purchasing it. He proposed that the sale would be financed over the ensuing years by payments to him of profits from the company’s public relations accounts, which included General Foods, the Mormon Church, a lucrative federal government contract with the Department of Health and Human Services and several others. Both Howard and I were stunned by Mullen’s proposal and told him that we needed time to consider it. Mullen agreed and during the next two months we had additional meetings with him about the purchase.

However, at these subsequent meetings Mullen seemed to forget key details that we had discussed previously about the purchase, causing Howard several times to query me about whether I thought Mullen was suffering from the onset of dementia. Then one day Mullen announced out of the blue that he had decided to sell his company to Robert Bennett, a Mormon who was the son of the senior U.S. Senator from Utah. What I came to learn years later was that Mullen, Bennett and Hunt knew something that had been kept from me, namely that the Mullen Company had been incorporated by the CIA in 1959 and served as a front for the intelligence agency. The Mullen Company offices around the world were in fact operations of the CIA, and General Foods was aware of this and a participant in the overall intelligence scheme. Although Hunt was a protégé of CIA Director Richard Helms and had been placed by Helms inside the Mullen Company, a decision had been made by the CIA that one of its other key operatives, Robert In mid-1971 Howard informed me that he was under consideration to work in the White House while still an employee of the Mullen Company. His sponsor for the position was Charles Colson, one of President Nixon’s closest aides and an alumnus, like Howard, of Brown University. Howard asked if I would write a letter of recommendation for his appointment, which I promptly did. Once Howard began working for the White House, we saw each other only intermittently. However, on several occasions he invited me to join him and his colleague, Gordon Liddy, for lunch at the Federal City Club. Both men were circumspect in their discussion in my presence, but from what I gathered they were involved in hush-hush, sensitive work on behalf of the White House. In February 1972, John Killcullen, one of the partners of the law firm that employed me, informed me that I was being assigned to do volunteer work for the Lawyers Committee for the Re-Election of the President. I soon met with John Dean, Counsel to the President, in his White House office and he in turn, after explaining the campaign legal work I would be doing, assigned me to work with one of his assistants, another lawyer.

At the meeting the two men sounded me out as to whether I would be interested in going to work for the CIA. If I were agreeable, my assignment would be to move to Nicaragua and there build and manage a luxurious seaside hotel that would lure the Sandinista leaders. This would allow the CIA to learn more about them. I told Howard and Huston I would think about it, but for certain reasons decided immediately I would not accept their job offer. “Carrying three heavy attaché cases, I entered the Pennsylvania Avenue door, showed my blue-and-white White House pass to the uniformed guards, and took the elevator to the third floor. I unlocked the door of 338 and went in. I opened my two-drawer safe, took out my operational handbook, found a telephone number and dialed it. “The time was 3:13 in the morning of June 17, 1972, and five of my companions had been arrested and taken to the maximum-security block of the District of Columbia jail. I had recruited four of them and it was my responsibility to get them out. That was the sole focus of my thoughts as I began talking on the telephone. “From the safe I took a small money box and removed the $10, 000 Liddy had given me for emergency use. I put $1, 500 in my wallet and the remaining $8, 500 in my coat pocket. The black attaché case containing McCord’s electronic equipment I placed in a safe drawer that held my operational notebook. Then I closed and locked the safe, turning the dial several times. The other two cases I left beside the safe, turned out the light and left my office, locking the door.” The prosecutors asked me hundred of questions over the next two weeks and subpoenaed my personal bank records. Ultimately I refused to answer 38 questions that I and the five attorneys representing me believed were protected by the attorney-client privilege. For example, one question was: “At what time did you receive a telephone call in the early morning hours of June 17, 1972?” By answering this question, I could ultimately be forced to identify Hunt and thus incriminate him.

At a hearing on July 12, 1972 – less than a month after the case broke – Sirica rejected outright my attorneys’ argument that the attorney-client privilege was being egregiously violated by the 38 questions. Declared Sirica to a courtroom packed with lawyers, the press and spectators: “You see, to put the matter perfectly bluntly, if the government is trying to get enough evidence to indict Mr. Caddy as one of the principals in this case even though he might not have been present at the time of the alleged entry in this place, I don’t know what the evidence is except what has been disclosed here. If the government is trying to get an indictment against Mr. Caddy and he feels that way and you feel it and the rest of you attorneys feel it, all he has to say is ‘I refuse to answer on the grounds what I say would tend to incriminate me.’ That ends it. I can’t compel him to say he knows Mr. Hunt under the circumstances. He doesn’t do that, understand? He takes the other road. He says there is a confidential communication. Who is he to be the sole judge of what is confidential or not? That is what I am here for.” “If Your Honor please, there is nothing malicious in this refusal. It is done in good faith, good conscience, it is done because we believe it is the proper course. I would respectfully suggest this is very harsh treatment – not the finding of contempt, I don’t say that. I disagree that he should be found in contempt, but I think it is very harsh treatment that your honor would commit him when it is perfectly clear that these positions are being put forth in the utmost good faith and utmost of sincerity. This is a young man, I just think it would be as harsh as it could be to commit him at this time.” On July 18, 1972 the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed Sirica’s contempt citation of me. It did so in by employing gratuitously insulting language, declaring, “Even if such a relationship does exist, certain communications, such as in furtherance of a crime, are not within the [attorney-client] privilege.” The actions of Sirica and the Court of Appeals did not go unnoticed by the White House.

In an Oval Office tape of July 19, 1972, an incredulous President Nixon asked John Ehrlichman, “Do you mean the circuit court ordered an attorney to testify?” to which Ehrlichman responded, “It [unintelligible] to me, except that this damn circuit we’ve got here with [Judge David] Bazelon and so on, it surprises me every time they do something.” What Nixon and Ehrlichman did not realize was that I and my attorneys firmly believed that we had created a strong legal record that the constitutional rights of the defendants and me as their attorney had been egregiously violated. If Hunt, Liddy and the five arrested defendants were found guilty, their convictions could then be overturned as a result of the abusive actions of the prosecutors, Judge Sirica and the Court of Appeals. However, Sirica’s vitriolic courtroom antics, aided and abetted by a biased Court of Appeals, had the effect of encouraging the defendants to embark on a “hush money” cover-up after they realized early on that the courts were not going to give them a fair trial. Hunt later wrote that “If Sirica was treating Caddy – an Officer of the Court – so summarily, and Caddy was completely uninvolved in Watergate – then those of us who were involved could expect neither fairness nor understanding from him. As events unfolded, this conclusion became tragically accurate.” Bear in mind all the above described courtroom events occurred in the first 33 days of the case. The dye has been cast by the prosecutors and the judges to deny the seven defendants a fair trial. William Bittman, a former Justice Department prosecutor who succeeded me in representing Hunt, advised me that because the prosecutors had gone too far in their persecution of me, they had jeopardized their case and were worried about that fact. No evidence had been uncovered over the months since the case broke that I had engaged in any criminal activity. One of the prosecutors even disclosed that an examination of my personal bank records, obtained by subpoena, revealed that I was “scrupulously honest.” Bittman then instructed me that when I reviewed my grand jury transcripts I should diligently determine if any alterations had been made in them. His fear was that the prosecutors had rewritten my testimony so as to weaken the attorney-client privilege. He said that if I found any of my transcripts had been altered, he planned to call Silbert to the witness stand at the trial to question him about the alteration.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:4:8be9e5884515", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4815, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "by subpoena, revealed that I was “scrupulously honest.” Bittman then instructed me that when I reviewed my grand jury transcripts I should diligently determine if any alterations had been made in them.

He said that if I found any of my transcripts had been altered, he planned to call Silbert to the witness stand at the trial to question him about the alteration. He declared, “Hunt deserves a fair trial and I am going to see that he gets one.” When I did review the grand jury transcripts, I determined that a key alteration had been made by the prosecutors. This alteration dealt with my attempt to tell the grand jury on July 19, 1972, that I had been approached in early July to act as conduit for “hush money” to be distributed to the defendants. “Mr. Kalmbach: Again, as I have tried to reconstruct this, Mr. Dash, the first instruction that I received, which I passed to Mr. Ulasewicz was to have Mr. Ulasewicz give $25, 000 to Mr. Caddy. I don’t know too much of Mr. Caddy, I understand that he is an attorney here in Washington. And, as I recall it, this was probably from approximately July 1 through July 6 or 7. There were a number of calls. I would either talk to Mr. Dean or Mr. LaRue. I would then call Mr. Ulasewicz who, in turn, would call Mr. Caddy. He would have some response from Mr. Caddy, and I would call back up either Mr. Dean or Mr. LaRue. At the first Watergate trial, Hunt and the four Cuban-Americans pleaded guilty at its beginning. This came about because about a month previously Dorothy Hunt had died in a mysterious plane crash in Chicago. For Hunt, a trial following on the heels of his wife’s tragic death was more than he could bear. The four Cuban-Americans, loyal to a fault to Hunt, followed his lead. Liddy and McCord stood trial and were found guilty. Liddy appealed his conviction. The same Court of Appeals that had forced me to testify before the grand jury in its gratuitously insulting decision opined as to the defendant Liddy being denied Sixth Amendment counsel because of what the courts had done to me as his attorney: “The evidence against appellant … was so overwhelming that even if there were constitutional error in the comment of the prosecutor and the instruction of the judge, there is no reasonable possibility it contributed to the conviction.” Of course, neither Judge Sirica, whom Time magazine later named “Man Of The Year,” nor the U.S. Court of Appeals ever acknowledged that their abusive actions and decisions in the first month of the case relating to me and the attorney-client privilege were a principal cause of the cover-up that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:5:7cfe6dcdc320", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4816, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "overwhelming that even if there were constitutional error in the comment of the prosecutor and the instruction of the judge, there is no reasonable possibility it contributed to the conviction.” Of course, neither Judge Sirica, whom Time magazine later named “Man Of The Year,” nor the U.S. Court of Appeals ever acknowledged that their abusive actions and decisions in the first month of the case relating to me and the attorney-client privilege were a principal cause of the cover-up that ensued. Sirica later wrote a book about Watergate, fatuously titled To Set the Record Straight, for which he pocketed one million dollars, which would be almost four million of today’s dollars. James Jackson Kilpatrick, a nationally syndicated columnist, wrote at the time: “It would be pleasant if someone would set the record straight about this tin pot tyrant. Sirica is a vainglorious pooh-bah.… When the Watergate criminal trials were assigned to him in the fall of 1972, he set out to enjoin the whole countryside with an encompassing gag order that perfectly reflected his lust for power. The order was patently absurd – it embraced even ‘potential witnesses’ and ‘alleged victims’ and had to be watered down.” believe the media has painted an erroneous portrait of who I Howard actually was. A fuller picture of the man is shown in the 2012 book Watergate: The Hidden History by Lamar Waldron, which contains numerous references to Howard and his career. Waldron writes, “Some writers depict Hunt as a minor figure, bumbling his way from one small White House operation to the next. However, a review of all the evidence shows that Hunt was consistently working on important tasks for the White House, on matters that interested the President. Hunt also kept expanding (or wanting to expand) his operations, which often overlapped with other projects that he sought out or pushed. The more Nixon operations Hunt became involved in, the higher his status in the White House and the better for his future. It was also good for his mentor, Richard Helms, since it gave him access to the White House (and FBI) information and operations. The President’s White House staff was expanding its illegal operations on his behalf so rapidly that Hunt had no problem finding Nixon aides who wanted Hunt’s services, to help them achieve the illicit goals the President wanted. That symbiotic relationship would soon grow so rapidly that it would start to spiral out of control, with disastrous results for all concerned.” As I look back I have come to the conclusion that the CIA had a goal of placing Howard in the White House in 1971, and that he thought of himself more as a CIA agent than as a trusted member of the White House staff. Thus, after the Watergate “hush” money scheme was exposed, Howard was quoted in People magazine of May 20, 1974: “I", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:6:9725b2339150", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4817, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "it would start to spiral out of control, with disastrous results for all concerned.” As I look back I have come to the conclusion that the CIA had a goal of placing Howard in the White House in 1971, and that he thought of himself more as a CIA agent than as a trusted member of the White House staff. Thus, after the Watergate “hush” money scheme was exposed, Howard was quoted in People magazine of May 20, 1974: “I had always assumed, working for the CIA for so many years, that anything the White House wanted done was the law of the land. I viewed this like any other mission. It just happened to take place inside this country.” Howard’s longtime friend and former CIA colleague William F. Buckley, Jr. accurately assessed him as follows: “Hunt had lived outside the law in the service of his country, subsequently of President Nixon … Hunt, the dramatist, didn’t understand the political realities at the highest level transcend the working realities of spy life.” While Howard revealed a lack of political awareness during Watergate, on another important political topic he was right on target. As the New York Post reported on January 14, 2007, he originally wrote in his memoir, American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond, published in 2007, that “Having Kennedy liquidated, thus elevating himself to the presidency without having to work for it himself, could have been a very tempting and logical move on [Lyndon] Johnson’s part. “LBJ had the money and the connections to manipulate the scenario in Dallas and is on record as having convinced JFK to make the appearance in the first place. He further tried unsuccessfully to engineer the passengers in each vehicle, trying to get his good buddy, Governor [John] Connally, to ride with him instead of JFK’s car – where … he would have been out of danger” Just prior the memoir’s publication, passages that dealt with advance knowledge possessed by Howard of JFK’s assassination were removed at the insistence of Howard’s then lawyer. However, Howard, ever the consummate intelligence officer, clandestinely arranged that his views on Kennedy’s murder would ultimately be publicly made known by giving his son, St. John, an audio tape to be released after his death in which he described the planning of the assassination. This is why St. John Hunt’s book is an important contribution to history. ’ve always thought of myself as being of sound moral character.

Everyone likes to think they’re honest and true, but there are always others who have a different agenda or whose story comes into conflict with your own. Having said that, and realizing full well that at least the members of my family may object to the story I’m about to relate, I will recount events in my life that have had a profound effect on me. After wrestling with many of the issues that arise out of this story, I’ve reached a simple ideology: you can’t make everybody happy all the time. Another factor that has weighed heavily on my mind is the concept of truth, one of those lofty principles that most of us try to keep in our embrace. However, we all know that when truth hurts, it’s easier to turn away. But what if avoiding truth creates a deeper hurt? I guess you’d have to consider whom you’re hurting, and what the stakes are in telling that truth. People say, “There’s only one truth.” I find that a questionable supposition. Certainly, if you tell a lie, you aren’t telling the truth. But consider truth as a three-dimensional value. Truth would then be subject to point of view. What I see and therefore “know,” might be different from what the person on the other side of this three-dimensional value sees, and therefore knows. This variance, then, brings into play moral and ethical issues. People “see” things in a way that supports the agenda that they have. The agenda I have in writing this story is to recount, to the best of my recollection, only those events of which I have direct knowledge and involvement. Lisa, the eldest, was the classic dark and brooding teen drama queen. She was the first to experiment with drugs, sex and rock ’n’ roll. For a time, in the fashion of “girl interrupted,” she was held in a hospital in Maryland. To add that she has led a productive and meaningful life, raising three wonderful children, would only be fair. I felt her struggles in our youth deeply, as her closest ally and friend. Kevan was the classic goody two shoes. She was everything a daughter (or son) should be. She was highly motivated, academically superior; never a stain would she bring to her family. She strove desperately to do all the right things that would gain my father’s approval and praise, while at the same time despising him for the very things that made", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:8:27083ccc34aa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4819, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "children, would only be fair.

She strove desperately to do all the right things that would gain my father’s approval and praise, while at the same time despising him for the very things that made his opinion so important. I was the physically challenged one. Born with a club-foot, suffering from petit mal epilepsy and dyslexia, and stuttering so badly I could barely speak, I was nothing for my father to be proud of. As the first-born male in the family, my father had high hopes for me. I was an utter disappointment. A poor student, unable to keep still, an inferior athlete, I was thin and not competitive. I had double vision, due to a lazy eye, so I wore glasses. I needed constant tutoring and was at best a D student. It didn’t help that English was the fourth language I was exposed to, and that by the time I was nine, I had already been raised in many conflicting cultures, namely Japanese, French, and Latin American. I became the dreamer, lost in my own world, turning inward to find what I couldn’t on the outside. I embraced my mother’s Native American heritage, learning David, nine years younger than I, was afforded only the leftover scraps of attention. He was perhaps the most needy, and the youngest to feel the devastation brought by Watergate and the death of our mother. At the tender age of 9, he lost everything that he hadn’t yet realized he had. Shipped off to live in Miami with his Godfather, the ex-Bay of Pigs leader Manuel Artime, he quickly found solace and purpose in the glamorous life of rich Miami cocaine dealers. After years of family separation, he soon lost all memory of the mother that had cradled him in her arms and sang to him softly. Whereas I and the other children have memories of our mother crystallized in The fact that my father chose to share details of his knowledge of historical events to no one but me may seem ironic and far-fetched to some. But in 1972, when Watergate exploded, my father had already trusted me in helping him with sensitive and illegal tasks: like destruction of evidence, and hiding large sums of unreported cash from the White House. For me, and a trusting nation, Watergate was the portal that led to doors that had been locked and buried, unknown to a naïve public for decades.

For me, and a trusting nation, Watergate was the portal that led to doors that had been locked and buried, unknown to a naïve public for decades. The proverbial Pandora’s Box was opened and the ghosts of the covert past were unleashed. Watergate led to all things conspiratorial. By its very nature Watergate was part of a much larger conspiracy, already in place, running smoothly, and functioning as if it were standard procedure. The cast of players, already wallowing in the murky world of black-bag jobs, plausible deniability, money laundering, and assassination plots, were there to be assembled. Fueled by paranoia, driven by greed, sustained by fear, those that were in a position to uphold our nation’s values ultimately destroyed the almost blind trust that a nation’s people had bestowed upon its government. Watergate was the critical event that showed the emperor had no clothes. From the coup in Guatemala, through the Bay of Pigs invasion, the assassination plots against Cuban president Castro, the militant Cuban exile groups and Mafia lords, through the Kennedy assassination and into Watergate, one thread that ran through all these events was a man, my father, E. Howard Hunt. Certainly he was one of a cast of hundreds, perhaps thousands, going about their jobs on a need-to-know basis. Sometimes, the left hand doesn’t need to know what the right hand is doing. In a business where information is power, nobody has all the keys, all the answers, and the truth that they know is, again, a matter of perspective. Presidents Bush and Reagan both used deniability in their defense. “I was kept out of the loop.” President Nixon was much less successful in that argument. He paved the way for those that followed him into that office not to repeat the same mistakes. This of course doesn’t mean not to commit crimes, but rather to cover your ass more effectively. My father’s importance in these events can best be underscored by reading the Nixon Presidential transcripts of June 23, 1972. On that tape, Nixon said “Hunt will uncover a lot of things. You open that scab, there’s a hell of a lot of things … This involves those Cubans, Hunt, and a lot of hanky panky that we have nothing to do with ourselves … this will open up that whole Bay of Pigs thing.… It’s going to make the CIA look bad, it’s going to make Hunt look bad, and is likely to blow the whole Bay of Pigs thing.” H.R.

It’s hard now, in retrospect, to think how I felt about the events that were unfolding with dramatic and merciless ferocity back in 1972, like a freight train out of control, unstoppable, smashing everything in its path. I think I must have been in shock, unable to contemplate or verbalize the meaning of what was happening both to my family and to the country. That my father had been in the American intelligence services for 27 years was something I had learned in 1970 when I was 16. At the time, the term CIA really didn’t have much meaning to me, so when he told me he was retiring I didn’t think much of it (later, he admitted to me that he was in fact still working with “the Company”). My parents told me that his new job was as a public relations executive for the Robert My mother, I had been told, was a retired worker for the Spanish Embassy in Washington, D.C. I remember the stories she told of being on the last train leaving Shanghai, China, as the city fell to the Communist forces. I had even seen the pearl-handled .25 caliber automatic pistol she carried hidden on her body somewhere: pretty exciting for an embassy employee. She talked of having traveled to India, where she spent some time in Calcutta and Delhi, and she had worked for Averell Harriman tracking Nazi money through Europe. This sounded all too confusing to me, but I am sure my father would have had a clearer picture of what she actually did before they married. Once they tied the knot, she became a normal housewife and mother to her children … or at least that was the story. I can’t really tell the facts from the fiction, and that is the sad part of it all. Growing up in a world of half-truths and lies, where it turns out that just about everything you thought was real isn’t, and then hearing about her being in the CIA and how they were the “classic” agency couple, using their superficially normal life as a cover for more sinister deeds … all that stuff. I wish I knew what my mother really did. I suppose it doesn’t make any difference any more; she was loving, sweet, patient, compassionate, very artistic, and yet unhappy, tortured, and chronically in pain (she broke her back twice). She had first married an alcoholic French count of some kind; he", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:11:9523bf7a91db", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4822, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "her being in the CIA and how they were the “classic” agency couple, using their superficially normal life as a cover for more sinister deeds … all that stuff.

She had first married an alcoholic French count of some kind; he was later killed in an automobile crash (maybe, who knows; certainly not I). Somehow, between growing up on a farm near Dayton, Ohio, and joining the “foreign service,” she transformed herself into a world-class jet-setting beauty. She was exotic looking; dark thick hair with a widow’s peak, strong high cheekbones, and a well-developed full-busted figure. She was German and Sioux, and her Native American heritage In the waning months of 1970, my father had many new friends at our rambling 14-acre estate in Potomac, Md. Set back from the road, the only visible sign was one that read “Witches Island.” Follow that up a dark, unlit one-lane gravel road, and our one-story brick house would eventually appear. We had a front and rear paddock, horse stables, four beautiful horses, a large “pigeon coop” the size of a single-wide trailer, a rabbit hutch, and no home would be complete without a bomb shelter. My father’s new friends would come and go for “meetings” and dinners. Some of these men I would later recognize as Watergate conspirators Bernard Barker, G. Gordon Liddy, and Manuel Artime. Later, during the Senate Watergate Hearings, I was called to testify about certain things, and was counseled by my father’s attorney to lie about having seen these and other men. One day, when my mother and I went out for a horseback ride, she told me that Papa was not actually working for a public relations company, but was really working for the Nixon White House, doing some secretive things that had her quite worried. She said that against her advice, he was going ahead with an operation that was being directed at the very highest levels of government. He was now so embedded in this mess that she could not be sure of its operational security. There were men whom she didn’t trust. He had gotten in with people that weren’t themselves aware of what was required of them, professionally speaking. “Amateurs” she said angrily. “Your father, as smart as he is, can’t see the forest for the trees.” I had heard them fighting at night and wondered what it was about. My parents rarely fought. I was curious, and one day when they were gone, I sneaked into their bedroom at the rear of the house and looked around.

I found some ID’s with my fathers’ picture on them, but the name was not E. Howard Hunt. It was Edward J. Hamilton. I also found a reddish wig. This is the famous wig that my father was reported to have worn when he interviewed Dita Beard for John Mitchell, Nixon’s infamous attorney general. In 1971, my father’s work took a different turn; one that sent him away from home and mired him deeper into the quicksand of Watergate. I didn’t really take much notice of his travels, he had spent so many of my formative years away from home, but recently his trips were short and there was tension with his departures and arrivals. Later, I learned that he had gone to Miami to recruit Watergate’s Cuban break-in crew; to Los Angeles, to break into the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist; and to Milwaukee, to break into the apartment of Arthur Bremmer, the man who tried to assassinate presidential candidate George Wallace. In retrospect, it’s a wonder that my father allowed himself to be used in such blatantly illegal schemes. I find it hard to believe that someone who held the notions of our Republic so dear, and the ideals of democracy in such high regard, would be swayed by such obvious presidential paranoia. This must have been the source of the tension and arguments that he and my mother were having. n the summer months of 1972, my mother took my sister Kevan and my little brother David for a month-long vaca-Ition and sight-seeing tour of Europe and England. Lisa was spending the majority of her time with a boyfriend, and I was dividing my time between my band and my girlfriend. My bedroom at home, which my father had built, was in the basement, and when the lights were turned off it was so dark, you couldn’t see your hand in front of your face. Being alone in the house night after night with my father didn’t bring us any closer together, and I missed my mother and brother very much. Our live-in housekeeper, an asthmatic English woman, would prepare meals and leave them for us either in the oven or the refrigerator. We rarely ate together or saw each other much, and the house felt overly large and gloomy. When I did see him, he seemed very distant and preoccupied. I could often hear my father tapping away at his old Royal typewriter in his office next door to my room.

I could often hear my father tapping away at his old Royal typewriter in his office next door to my room. He somehow managed to write and have published dozens of spy thrillers. His books were usually published under pseudonyms, and for one series he used David St. John. The only interest we really shared was music, and I remember fondly that he let me accompany him to Blues Alley, a favorite night-spot in Georgetown. Politically we were much different; he, in my mind, was a right-winger, and I, in his mind, was a left-winger. The truth, once again, is a matter of perspective. I wasn’t really a radical. My hair was longish and I didn’t support the war in Vietnam, but I wasn’t out there throwing rocks or carrying signs. When our family was invited to attend a White House function at which we would be introduced to President Nixon, I quietly declined, stating that I disapproved of his foreign policies. Needless to say, my father was very, very upset. He flicked on my light and stepped quickly to the center of the room. I sat upright and looked questioningly at my father, slowly focusing on his face. He was perspiring heavily and seemed extremely agitated. His breathing was quick and shallow as he talked in short bursts, pausing to search for the right words. At that early morning hour in the darkness of my bedroom, I had no way of knowing that this moment would forever change my life. For our family and so many others the world was about to turn upside down, and there would begin a bond of secrecy between my father and me that would last 35 years. He stood in my room, suit jacket rumpled and shirt-tail hanging out. He swiped his hand across his face and loosened his tie. “I’ll fill you in when you’re more awake … right now I need you to do exactly as I say, and not ask any questions! Do you understand me?” He was firm and direct, and I obeyed him without hesitation. I’d never felt really needed by him before, never felt very important. Now, here was this man for whose approval I had deeply longed; and he was asking for my help! What would any good son do? I didn’t have time to think that I was becoming part of a crime, a conspiracy to destroy evidence. It wouldn’t have made any difference anyway.

Starved for his attention, I happily did what he needed me to do. He turned and left the room. I hurriedly got dressed and ran upstairs. Walking back to my parents’ bedroom I knocked lightly on the door and my father opened it. He had taken his jacket and shirt off and was wiping himself with a damp towel. Wordlessly he motioned me in, and I saw that there were two suitcases on the bed. “First, I want you to get some rags from the garage, grab some of those dish-washing gloves, and some ammonia or window cleaner. Then come back here.” I followed his instructions and gathered the requested items. When I came back to his bedroom he was talking on the phone, but I couldn’t hear what he was saying. He placed the receiver back in its cradle and told me to open the suitcases up and remove all the items. What I saw was a jumble of cords, wires and electronic stuff, some walkie-talkies, cameras and a small collapsible tripod. It had obviously been thrown together in a hurry. I removed the items and placed them on the bed next to the suitcases. “Put these gloves on and start wiping everything down with the glass cleaner. When you’re finished, put it all back in the cases and wipe them down too. I’ll be back in a minute to help you.” He put on a clean shirt and left me alone in the room. I think he headed down to his office in the basement to make some more phone calls. When he returned he had a small stack of envelopes and papers in his hand. He tossed them down on the bed next to me, and I noticed some of them were written on White House stationery. He sat down on the other bed, put some dish gloves on and started spraying and wiping the remainder of the equipment. I may have been young, but I did realize that I was erasing fingerprints. That much I knew. When we were done he said, “Now we have to get rid of this stuff, we don’t have much time … it looks like it’s getting light out.” Noticing that I wasn’t wearing shoes, he said, “Get your shoes on and meet me in the garage in five minutes!” I ran down to my basement room, put my shoes on and left, turning out the light and closing my door.

I trotted through the house and out the kitchen door where my father was already placing the cases into the trunk of his Pontiac Firebird. Slamming the lid down, he motioned for me to get in. As we pulled out of our “Witches Island” he turned left onto River Road. It was still dark as we drove silently, my father lost somewhere in his thoughts. I can only imagine what was going through his mind. Was he making a mental check-list of everything he needed to take care of? Was he wondering about his safety? Would he be found out? What were his men doing? How long would they keep silent? He was going to have to get money to secure their bail. They were going to need legal counsel. A million things must have been racing through his mind and as I drove with him, I too was lost in thoughts of my own. I was scared, exhilarated and still completely in the dark about what was going on. We drove for about 45 minutes to an hour and then turned west towards the canal. This was a small waterway that served this part of Maryland a hundred years ago. Barges and small vessels plied their trade goods on its waterway, providing commerce and transportation long before there were any decent roads. Now, as dawn cleared the night from the sky, we found a good spot near the edge of the water. My father turned off the engine and waited for the silence to signal that all was clear. He got out of the car and removed the suitcases from the trunk. Walking to the edge, the water flowing lazily along, he tossed first one, then the other out into the muddy canal. Full daylight was shining around us with the temperature and humidity rising as we drove back down River Road to our house. On the way back, my father said that he had been doing some special work for the White House. Last night he had been on an assignment when things had gone sour, necessitating his quick departure from the scene and his abrupt return home. “I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I may need your help with some other things.” My mother, sister and David found out about Watergate in the papers over in England.

They called and planned to return as soon as possible. I’m not sure about the timeline here because I know it was at least several days before they returned. In the interim, I was to help my father out with a few more tasks. One involved the transfer of a large amount of cash from a safety deposit box in a Georgetown bank to a secret hiding place in the basement of our house. The plan was this: I was to wait several hours after my father left and meet him at a prearranged time in the safety deposit room of the Riggs National Bank in Georgetown. Watergate had been in the papers, and from what I later learned, the FBI was looking for my father. I don’t know if this is true or not, but supposedly he was the object of a huge search. Agents were scouring the planet. How they could have missed him hunkered down at Witches Island, I’ll never understand. I guess his home was too obvious a place. I drove through the windy hills of Potomac and into Georgetown, an affluent shopping and historical site near Washington DC. Pulling into the parking lot in my little Chevy Monza, I checked my watch: 2 : pm . Right on time. Wearing a suit jacket as instructed, I made my way to the vault area. Ringing the bell, I was allowed into the safety deposit room. My father was to meet me at 2:10, and in a few minutes he arrived. Again, I blindly did as my father wished. I left the bank and headed back to the house. I kept an eye on the rear-view mirror, and as instructed, took my time in reaching my destination. Several times when a car seemed to shadow me from behind, I turned around and doubled back. I thought I may have picked up a tail, so as I approached Potomac Village, I turned into the shopping center and parked. Watching the suspected vehicle make a turn down Falls Rd., I was confident that I had outwitted them. It was getting hot, and the envelope under my shirt was soaking up my sweat. By 4:30 I was back at Witches Island. I busied myself unscrewing the heating duct that my father had told me about. He had left a three-step ladder nearby for me to use.

He had left a three-step ladder nearby for me to use. I shoved the envelope into the space as far as I could, and replaced the sheet metal covering. My father came home a few hours later and thanked me. We had dinner together that evening, and I asked him how much money was in the envelope. “Not nearly enough,” he said quietly, “about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I know that sounds like a lot of money, but it has to be dispersed to a lot people.” I asked him about the newspaper articles that I had seen about the break-in at Democratic National Headquarters. I recognized some of the names as men who had been to our house that summer. Trying not to upset me, and perhaps believing in the power and loyalty of the men he had been working for, my father told me he was confident this was all going to be resolved soon, and everything would get back to normal. It wasn’t clear to me what “getting back to normal” meant, but I was glad to accept his views. There was one more bit of dirty business that my father would have me do for him. Late that same night, he came down to my room carrying an old Royal typewriter, like the one he used to write his novels. He set it down on the floor and banged it several times with a hammer. Producing a cloth sack, he placed the mangled typewriter inside. Handing it to me he asked me to take the sack and dump it into Griffith Pond, a small fishing pond located in the middle of a huge field directly across the road from our property. It was owned by a General Griffith and boasted a huge southern-style house at the top of a very long driveway. I had never met the General, but he allowed us to ride our horses in his fields. I remember with great fondness how my mother and I rode through the tall grass around the pond and through his woods. He must have had at least a hundred acres and our mother brought each of us children there to ride. I also spent many afternoons there, fishing with my brother David. Unlike our property, the General’s was easily seen from the road, so, on that warm, clear night I slung the sack over my back and hopped the fence.

Keeping a low profile, so as not to be caught in any car headlights that might be flashing by, I made my way to the edge of the pond. Without a second thought I hurled the sack into the middle of the pond where it obligingly disappeared into the depths. Many years later in Miami, my father and I revisited the tale of the typewriter, and it was then that I learned why he got rid of it. The machine had been used to forge bogus government cables linking the assassination of Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem to the Kennedy administration. Within a few days, my mother returned and now she became the one to help him through the maelstrom. As it turned out, this sealed her fate and led directly to her death. My mother, always thinking of us children, took three thousand dollars from the envelope and gave it to me. I gladly took the money and headed out across the country in my van, taking my girlfriend with me, and thinking that everything would blow over by the time I got back. I was in for a serious disappointment when, after a month and a half, I returned. United Airlines Flight 553 crashed on its approach to Chicago Midway International Airport at 2:28 p.m. CST, on December 8, 1972. After the crew was told to abort their first landing attempt, the aircraft struck trees and then roofs before crashing into a house. A total of 45 people were killed in the accident. returned to madness; I knew from reading the papers in California that Watergate hadn’t gone away, but I was whol-I ly unprepared for what awaited. The scandal had developed into a cottage industry. There were reporters from seemingly everywhere camped out at the foot of our driveway. It was a media circus to rival any of more recent times. We drove into the driveway and everyone jumped up, shouting questions. We drove out of the driveway and everyone jumped up, etc. In and out, up and down! We were virtual prisoners on parade. As Watergate deepened, my mother served as the unofficial spokesperson for the jailed burglars. Nixon’s personal lawyer, Herb Kalmbach, hired ex-New York City Police Dept. Intelligence Unit officer, Tony Ulasewicz to funnel “hush money” to the many men that so depended on him.

Using codes like “the writer” (my father), “the writer’s wife” (my mother), “the players” (the burglars), and “the script” (the money), more than four-hundred-thousand dollars were paid out. How much of this went through my mother, I don’t know, but she did have many spooky rendezvous at dimly lit bus terminals and airports, where locker keys were taped in secret locations. She was worried that she would be kidnapped or worse. I know this because she told me so. She felt like she was being tailed, and probably was. I can only reflect that she was an incredibly brave woman. Charles Colson called my mother a very “savvy” woman. She was frightened, under tremendous pressure, and deeply involved in some very serious business with some of the most dangerous people in the world. My father was viewed as a blackmailer, and my mother the instrument of his bidding. She was out there, by herself, making demands, playing it tough, meeting desperate people in lonely, dark places. She listened, I imagine, to every sound around her … footsteps echoing down empty streets. She watched shadows moving across vacant buildings. She noticed strangers glancing a little too long, or too quickly. She made her way through basement car garages, always checking her rearview mirror. The need for money was almost suffocating. Calls from lawyers, banks, brokers, and debts piled one on top of another … and another and another. School bills needed to be paid, the car payment was late, and the children’s school tuition was overdue. Multiply this by all the families whose fathers had been jailed for the Watergate burglary, add to that the need for repayment and good faith gestures, and you can begin to see what kind of pressure she was under. I saw in her face such utter depression, such loss of hope, such fear and anger. Oh, the resentment, and the bitterness! She suffered from severe pain due to having broken her back twice. She worried about her weight gain, and suffered from diabetes. She had spoken to me several times of divorcing my father, and just when she decided to make the break, this disaster happened. This Watergate monster was like an iron chain around her neck with the weight of the world attached, and it robbed her of her freedom. She had to stay now. She couldn’t leave her husband at a time like this. So, she endured. She not only endured, she fought tooth and nail.

She rose to the challenge and faced all the pressures and demons of the nation’s angst. Yet, throughout all of it, she tried her best to keep a smile for her children. She never lashed out, never grew impatient, never withdrew. On the contrary, she reached out even more. I don’t know if she knew the end was near, but she worked at being our friend. Each of us will always have the memory of stolen moments, of shared secrets, and deep conversations. This was a new woman to us; she opened up about herself and her dreams and losses. She had suffered through ten pregnancies; six ended in miscarriage, and four babies lived. By December 1972, time seemed to have run out. My parents had made a desperate play to gain back control of their lives and those of the loyal Cubans. The “writer and his wife” had made a final demand to the President of the United States: pay up, or we’re going to blow this whole thing right up in your face. They had the evidence to link the President to the Watergate scandal, and perhaps to deeper and darker things. Nixon, caught on his own secret tapes, wanted to pay off Hunt at all costs. He figured it might cost “… a million in cash. We could get our hands on that kind of money,” he said. On December 8, 1972, my mother boarded United Airlines flight 553 scheduled to take off from Dulles Airport, non-stop to O’Hare airport in Chicago. The purpose of her trip has generated a lot of controversy. The facts are: As the big jet closed in on its destination, the pilot received a call to divert the plane and land on the little-used and much more poorly equipped Midway airport. As it approached the outer runway marker lights, they flicked off, and, mysteriously, the pilot was not able to communicate with the tower. Missing the landing strip, the plane tore into the surrounding houses, demolishing several, and came to rest amid huge fires, with pieces of wing and metal housing strewn in a debris field which some have described as a scene of total destruction and absolute hell. Miraculously, the outer markers returned to perfect working order moments after the crash. The radio control tower also seemed to have suddenly started working again. What’s even more remarkable is that within minutes there were 50 FBI agents at the crash site.

What’s even more remarkable is that within minutes there were 50 FBI agents at the crash site. The fire department was called within a minute and a half of the crash and yet when they arrived, they were told to stand down until the FBI was finished in their search. What were they searching for? The nearest FBI field office was twelve miles away. How could there be 50 agents at the crash site in such a short amount of time. On June 13, 1973, Chairman John Reed of the NTSB told the House Government Activities Sub-Committee that he personally sent a letter to the FBI. It included the following: a) Never in its history had the FBI acted as it did in the flight 553 crash investigation. b)Under what authority did it act? (Air piracy was later cited.) b) Before the NTSB investigators could do so, the FBI conducted 26 interviews within 20 hours of the crash and an FBI agent had gone into the tower immediately after the crash and confiscated the tape recording relating to the flight. On December 9, 1972, just one day after the crash, White House Aide Egil Krogh was appointed by Nixon as Undersecretary of Transportation, supervising the NTSB and FAA, the two agencies investigating the crash. Also on Dec. 9, White House Deputy Assistant to Nixon, Alex Butterfield, was appointed the new head of the FAA. Five weeks after the crash, another of Nixon’s men, Dwight Chapin, became a top executive at United Airlines. Am I to believe that all these facts are just random coincidences? All of this, as well as testimony from eyewitnesses on the ground that said the plane seemed to explode before it hit treetop level, pretty much defies the laws of chance. I was taught that if something looks too good to be true, it usually isn’t, and if you smell smoke, there’s probably a fire. he loss brought about by my mothers’ death was almost unbearable.

The house needed to be sold to pay attorney fees and we should start packing and looking for somewhere to live. If things weren’t bad enough already, my father had some kind of stroke after being attacked in a D.C. Jail. We worried that he wouldn’t make it, and for a time he was put on suicide watch. Lisa and I packed up the house as best as we could; it was so hard to do, with so many memories of our mother and the life we had as a family that lay among the empty boxes and cartons that littered the loveless house. Lisa, fragile and waif-like, cried endlessly, and nothing I could say or do would console her. We tried to cheer each other up by talking about how we’d find a lovely small house. Lisa was adamant about living near a certain bridge in Kensington. She was vulnerable and unprotected, with nerves strung tightly by lack of sleep and too much worry. We did our best to take care of little David, only nine years old, so young and so lost. I think he must have suffered more than any of us. With so much sadness around us, we became inseparable. Then one afternoon Lisa came home after house hunting, shouting with joy; “I found it, I found it, our perfect little home!” We danced and held each other shouting, “We found a home, we found a home!” That joy was fleeting: attorneys came and took David away. The only explanation they gave was that they (my father) felt it would be a better environment for him if he moved in with his godparents in Miami. This would prove to be a huge mistake: Miami would soon be the cocaine capital of the world, and David was right smack in the middle of it. He would be raised with few good influences and no real love. Now living alone and feeling betrayed by everyone, Lisa and I stayed on in the house. We kept the lights low at night, and sat up late talking and crying, holding on to nothing but each other and the darkness that enveloped Witches Island. In 1973 we appeared together in support of our jailed father at the Senate Watergate Hearings.

We finally did find our little house and tried to put things back together, but nothing would, nothing could, be the same. The warm afterglow that was the memory of our mother stayed with us, and we felt her spirit everywhere. She rests is a small cemetery near Potomac, Maryland. The pastures and woods that she so loved to ride through have all been bulldozed and turned into shopping malls and parking lots. No one has been to see her in decades. It’s sad to me. The truth is that it’s just a stone with a name carved on it. She lives in my heart and soul and in my dreams. I see her sometimes, and I know I will see her again. My father served 33 months in federal prison, the lon-gest stretch at Danbury, Connecticut. Frank Sturgis,the Cuban freedom fighter, arch nemesis of Castro, plotter in assassination attempts, and co-conspirator in Watergate served his sentence at Danbury as well. It was after my father’s incarceration that the first accusations surfaced allegedly linking him and Sturgis to the murder of President Kennedy. I remember quite well how I first heard of this. I had moved to Oakland, California and got a job driving a delivery truck for a local bakery. I stopped by a pay phone on my route, and as I was dialing the number something caught my eye. A familiar face stared at me from a crudely printed poster on a phone pole. It was my father! His was among several on a poster that read “CIA KILLED JFK.” I dropped the phone and carefully removed the poster. Back in my delivery van, I looked at what it said. Below the large heading, it showed six photos of at least three men; my father, ImmediatelyaftertheassassinationofJFK,Dallaspolicearrestedthree“tramps” inarailroad gondolabehindagrassy knoll andpicket fence,wherenumerous witnessesswore theyheardgunshots,sawcommotionandpeoplerunning.Two ofthe“tramps,photographed bynewsmen,looked likeWatergate burglars, buddiesandCIAoperatives,E.HowardHunt(below，left)and Frank Sturgis (right).TheFBI,accordingtoRonaldReaganandNelsonRockefeller,released the“tramps”withouttakinganyarrestrecord,fingerprintsormugshots!

Frank Sturgis, and a third I didn’t recognize. Below my father’s picture was someone who looked like my father, only older and dirty. Below Sturgis’ picture was one of someone who looked a lot like Frank except older, and the third man had the same photo twice, but one from a different angle. The copy below the photos proclaimed, “E. Howard Hunt; convicted Watergate burglar and CIA assassin in 1974 and in Dealey Plaza in 1963.” The poster advertised a lecture the following day in San Francisco by Dick Gregory and was sponsored by a group calling themselves the JFK Investigating Committee or something like that. I was in shock! I could barely make it through the rest of my route. I didn’t know what to think. I felt sick to my stomach. I couldn’t believe something this bad could be happening to my family again! Hadn’t we paid enough? Hadn’t my mother died for the sins of my father? Why would these people think such a thing? Where would it all end? After I settled down, I began to think back and try to remember what happened the day Kennedy was shot. Surely this would clear up the question and perhaps I could attend the lecture and clear my father’s name, but as I thought about it, I began to feel a sickly, creeping suspicion in the pit of my stomach. I remember very well that I was nine years old and in the fifth grade at Brookmont Elementary School when they announced the news over the loudspeaker. Soon afterward, school was dismissed. I can’t remember how I got home, whether I was picked up, or took the bus, but when I arrived my mother was there and she was very upset. I tried to picture my father in the house that day, but couldn’t. Then, like a bullet exploding in my brain, I remembered my mother telling me that my father had been in Dallas!

I can’t place the exact time she told me or if she was speaking in reference to the assassination, but I clearly recall her telling me this around that time. It may have been before, but I also remembered something strangely coincidental; my father elected to have some sort of plastic surgery done to reduce the size and change the shape of his ears. In my mind these events occurred roughly at the same time. I looked at the poster, studying it over and over again. I thought of going to the lecture but chickened out. I didn’t want to know any more details or speculations. In the photos of the tramps, the one that is supposed to be my father looks amazingly like him. He has a very distinct nose and the shape of his mouth is also quite distinctive. I felt strongly that this could be him. Now, years later, we all know that the true identity of these tramps has been discovered due to the diligent research of devoted Kennedy assassination researchers. But for years, the accusations went on and on. Still, some feel that my father never told all of what he knew regarding this tragic chapter in our history. My father always maintained that he was not involved in the assassination and didn’t know anyone who was involved. He maintained that he firmly believed Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and without any involvement from any intelligence agency, with the exception of the KGB. This is laughable; anyone who’s read the CIA’s own reports knows that Oswald had connections to the CIA and the FBI. The fact that he, a U.S. Marine, defected to Russia at the height of the Cold War and then returned, with no apparent consequences, is reason enough to draw suspicion. I wrote my father a letter asking him about the poster and its accusations. He wrote back to me that, “As you well know, I was at home that day, and we watched the news broadcasting the unfortunate events until late in the evening when you children went to bed. I was in the house all day.” the day. When asked what the name of his favorite Chinese store was, he couldn’t remember.

My father testified that he had been seen at work that day by one of his co-workers, yet when that co-worker was cross-examined, he could not specifically recall seeing my father, he only thought he “might” have seen him. How could a man whose life was in the intelligence business not be able to recall, without fail, where he was and what he did on the day that the President of the United States was murdered? How is that possible? Why did he change his story so many times? If his children were his alibi, why wouldn’t his defense team call us to testify for him? This could have put the whole matter to rest once and for all. Why? Because it was a lie; I was at our home that day, and I never saw my father. That’s not saying that he murdered the president, but it does serve to underline the maze of lies and plausible deniability that was our life. I never spoke to my father about these outrageous contradictions, and he never addressed this topic … at least not until later … years later. While the rest of the world was consumed with Water-gate, I was consuming drugs. First, when my father obliterated the anguish of the loss of my mother with heavy doses of the hypnotic. I have a photograph that someone took at the house I shared in Kensington, Md. with my sister Lisa. In the photo I can be seen passed out under the coffee table in our living room. Friends I am still in touch with remember how they often picked me up off the floor and laid me out on the couch. This could only have lasted a month or two because soon my father’s stash ran out. And, as I recall, he had quite a few bottles. When I was a child, my father freely offered drugs as an answer to various needs I may have had. When I was tired, he’d offer me half of a Dexedrine tablet. If I was restless, he’d hand me some Librium or Valium. So it was a natural progression to turn to drugs. My parents weren’t boozers, aside from all the cocktail parties, otherwise I might have had a drinking problem as well. But that’s one demon I’ve never had to wrestle with. Alas, there is still time.

But that’s one demon I’ve never had to wrestle with. Alas, there is still time. I started taking LSD when I moved to Wisconsin. I read the Tao te Ching by Lao Tzu, and dropped acid with my girlfriend and band mates. We were young, and the whole world was an experiment. We found a source for the highest quality “window pane” acid and brokered a deal in Milwaukee. We traded an eighteen-wheel flatbed truck’s worth of aged barn boards for a candy jar full of the finest, purest and strongest four-way Owsley Acid in the country. We took the drug religiously and while the summer nights were warm and the sound of mosquitos whined in the air, we sat on top of a high hill overlooking our farm house and watched the scenery dissolve into liquid beauty. An average trip lasted 12 to 18 hours. I “traveled” thousands of inner miles, and I don’t think I came down for two years. I have many amazing stories about LSD ghosts and entities. Timothy Leary would have been proud of me! From Wisconsin’s natural beauty, I moved with my band and girlfriend to Oakland, California. The great acid was all gone and cocaine was the rage. Like everybody else, I started experimenting with street-grade cocaine. I found it an unproductive drug. Still, it was fashionable. It wasn’t until my brother David moved out to live with me in nearby Concord that I first tried high-grade Peruvian flake. What a difference! David had been busy at his prep school running cocaine and call girls to his schoolmates. He had limos parked outside of his dorm on a 24 hr. standby service. He wasn’t even eighteen yet! There are some incredible tales of drug excess and endless days of sex from those crazy times. David and I were a toxic and dangerous combination. We pushed each other into deeper and darker corners of abuse, neither one wanting to surface and deal with the issues that propelled us into that downward spiral. I’m sure we came as close to death as anyone can. Throughout this time, David had a series of girlfriends, and I was hooked up with some young sisters. I had met them on the streets of Berkeley and invited them out to our house. After the three of us started having sex, we hardly ever left each other’s company. We went everywhere and did everything together.

The stories we could tell would surely deserve a triple-X rating. One classic scene will have to suffice. One evening I took the girls to an exclusive Italian restaurant in Concord, a very expensive and highbrow place. We snorted coke on the table during dinner, and a number of hundred-dollar tips helped induce the waiters and other service people to stand around trying to shield the dessert from the other patrons: fellatio from one of the girls, who had crawled under the table. Many other nights, David and I could be found at another local establishment, drinking Long Island iced teas and snorting coke. Eventually, of course, the glamour of “toot” wore off, and the paranoia set in. David had moved into his own place and was doing big deals in the coke world. He had his Miami connection: Cubans and Columbians. As the world watched Scarface, David lived it. He was a big spender. He had lawyers and entertainment stars as clients. He flew coast-to-coast setting up deals and raking in the money. He carried a gun and had weapons stashed all over the place. One time as he got into my 1965 Mustang, his 9mm. went off and shot a hole clean through the drive shaft. We both kept an arsenal which included police-style sawed off shotguns with clips, semi-automatic weapons, nunchakus, shuriken throwing stars, and a variety of knives and lethal weapons. The next drug of choice for me was methamphetamine. This was like discovering dynamite after playing with firecrackers. I soon followed in David’s footsteps and built a lucrative meth business in the Bay Area. I didn’t like the image of high roller, instead favoring a much lower profile. Over the years, I dealt an average of several pounds of 90% pure product a month. At one time I was moving at least a pound a week. I had two partners who were hard-core bikers: Dirty Dan and Big Don. They rode BMW’s and were not associated with the Hell’s Angels. We did, however, buy from and sell to the Angels numerous times over the years. They never bothered us, and we respected who they were. We dealt straight and never burned anyone. We had our own lab, which eventually produced as much as 300 lbs. But, after years of successful outlaw living, I was eventually and inevitably busted.

I lived through an attempt on my life as the result of an inside betrayal. Briefly, I was set up to be robbed. The gangsters came to my home and beat me until I was almost unconscious. They dragged me into my house, tied me up, and prepared to torture me with boiling water if I didn’t reveal the location of my drug stash. Before they could get the info out of me, Big Don came to my door and let himself in. Seeing me tied and beaten, he whipped out his .45. The thieves ran out of the house as Donny fired at them. Later, after we determined who they were, Dirty Dan and Big Don sent one of them to the hospital severely beaten. The other was arrested for unrelated robbery and drug charges and went to San Quentin. I was never comfortable with the enforcement end of the drug business, so I left that part of it to my partners. I heard stories from them that would curl your toes! I was a meth addict until 2001, when I changed my whole life. I quit drugs, stopped dealing and took my family away from the Bay Area with all its reminders of that outlaw life. n the summer of 2002 I learned that, after being hospitalized for many months, my father was still very sick, weak Iand in need of a leg amputation. His prognosis was poor and he was resisting the idea of being without one of his legs. He was suffering from vascular degeneration in his left leg, and although he’d had several operations already, nothing could save his gangrenous limb. My brother David had been staying at the family house in Miami and trading shifts with Laura, my father’s second wife, at the hospital. She had practically been living there and was near exhaustion. My father had met Laura while in prison, they married in 1977, and had two boys, Austin and Hollis. David was due to fly to Las Vegas for a new job, and I decided it was time to see my father before his condition worsened. If he refused the amputation he would surely die. Embittered by the past, emotionally estranged to his eldest daughters, and not wishing to be a burden to Laura, he was tired and unable to cope with the challenge that amputation would present.

I understood this, and wouldn’t have blamed him if he chose death. He had, after all, lived a long and fruitful life, albeit notorious at times. I found a two-for-one flight on Southwest and decided to bring my four-year-old son Travis to meet his infamous grandfather. This might be the only opportunity to do so, and I hoped seeing the youngest member of our family might cheer him up enough to reconsider his situation. Upon arriving in Miami, David picked us up and we had a brief reunion of our own. The next day Laura drove us to the hospital and said that although very weak, Papa was excited about seeing me and meeting his grandson. At the hospital, Laura waited in the hallway with Travis, and I walked into the dimly lit room. I was shocked by his appearance. He was emaciated and his breathing was slow and labored. The skin on his face sagged as if he were already dead. I walked quietly over to his bedside and sat down. I was overwhelmed by his terrible condition as I fought to gain control of my emotions. “Papa,” I placed my hand in his, squeezing it gently. “Papa, its Saint John.” He opened his eyes slowly and I felt him grip my hand. I held his hand and spoke very quietly into his ear; my face pressed against his. “Papa, you are the patriarch of this family. You are deeply loved and needed by all your children. Losing you would be catastrophic for all of us and we just need you and love you so much. I know this is hard but you’ve had hard times before. You’re the rock of Gibraltar and I don’t think that Mama would want you to leave us yet. There’s so many things that we haven’t said or talked about.” I could feel the wetness of his tears against my cheek and I too began to cry. As our tears intermingled, he gripped my hand in an embrace that sought to end all the anguish that had been the focus of our life. “I love you so much Papa,” I said softly into his ear. “I love you too, son.” As his grip weakened, I sat up and said “Papa, there’s someone I want you to meet.” “Travis,” I called out. “Travis, come here and meet your grandpapa.” Laura slowly opened the door and Travis came into the room and I", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:31:23688457fcc0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4842, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 32, "text": "he gripped my hand in an embrace that sought to end all the anguish that had been the focus of our life. “I love you so much Papa,” I said softly into his ear. “I love you too, son.” As his grip weakened, I sat up and said “Papa, there’s someone I want you to meet.” “Travis,” I called out. “Travis, come here and meet your grandpapa.” Laura slowly opened the door and Travis came into the room and I lifted him up onto the bed. “Papa, this is your grandson, Travis.” Though weak and emotionally drained, he lifted his head a little and said, “You are a handsome boy.” Travis looked at me and asked if Papa was going to die and I said no, he was going to get better. I slid Travis off the bed and Laura took him out to the hallway. After they left, I sat quietly next to my father and reflected for a moment on all that had happened. He had lived a remarkable life, and if this was his choice in dying, then it was up to all of us to carry on. I thought he was sleeping but he called my name softly. “I’m here, Papa.” I said. “You know I’ve always tried to do what was … what I thought was for the best … I didn’t know what would happen … your mother knew …” His voiced trailed off, and I kissed him on the forehead. The following day I came back, but he slept mostly and we never got the chance to speak in private. I left a day or two later and when I called Laura to check on his condition, she told me that he had decided to allow the amputation. This was a brave man I thought. I don’t know if I would have made the same choice if it had been me. I respected him for it. Time passed and the operation was a success. He had two amputations: first at the knee, then farther up. His health started coming back and he seemed on his way to recovery. This was short lived, and I was to hear many times that he was back in the hospital with complications: pneumonia, or high fever. It seemed like death was stalking my father, but he just wasn’t ready to give up. When I visited my father in August of 2003, he was doing better. Although he was restricted to his bed and his wheel chair, his spirits lifted when I arrived. He was still quite fragile and tired easily. He refused to work with his prosthetic leg, saying that it was just too much effort for someone his age.

I spent time watching television with him and on really nice days, I pushed him around the neighborhood in his wheel chair. Laura worked as a teacher and both his other children had busy schedules, allowing lots of time for Papa and me to talk. It was on one of these days when the air was thick and humid that we found ourselves talking about Watergate and the help I provided him when he needed it. I was glad he recognized what I had done for him, yet I really wanted to talk about the cost to our family. This was a painful subject and one that had rarely, if ever, been discussed. My father had a selective memory when dealing with the trauma of the past, and as I prepared to transfer him from his wheelchair to his bed, I pressed the conversation. I started to explain that I had spoken several times to my sisters in an effort to reconcile some of the bitterness they felt towards him. It was no secret that Kevan and Lisa both blamed him for our mother’s death, the disintegration of our family and the emotional damage that had left them with so much anger and hostility. I had tried to explain that forgiveness was the only way to heal these wounds, but they seemed unwilling to make the first move. He sighed heavily and said he appreciated my efforts but with so little time left, he doubted that anything would change. What did he mean by, “So little time left?” “When your mother was killed, I feared for your lives … I wasn’t sure of anything, and I didn’t know what would happen to you children. Things were out of control and I couldn’t protect you. Your mother was everything to this family and as long as she was alive, I knew things would be all right. When she died, I knew that I had to keep quiet about a lot of things … things that I don’t feel good about … some things are better left alone.” The words struck me like a semi-truck. Never in all these years had my father referred to her death as anything but an unfortunate accident. My father had a near genius’s command of the art of spoken language, and he picked his words very carefully. To hear him suggest that my mother was murdered was a sign that something monstrous, something evil had happened.

The hair on my arms and neck stood on end and I felt the specter of death floating past me. I pressed him for more. “You know I’ve been unable to write anymore, and I had hoped that our lives would be better, financially speaking, than they are. I’ve never really gotten much for my novels and I’m just too old to write another book now.” I knew that he was living beyond his means and that Laura’s salary and his pension from the CIA was not enough to provide for his family the way he’d hoped. “There are some things I could write about and it’s not like people haven’t tried to get me to talk about Watergate and Kennedy.” “Well for example when Oliver Stone asked me to join him on the set of the Nixon movie, I agreed to do so, as a consultant. I flew out to California with Snyder [my father’s lawyer] and your brother. I met Anthony Hopkins and some of the other actors and writers on the set. Stone took us all out to a lavish dinner, and I found him very irritating as he persisted in grilling me over JFK’s murder. Finally I looked at him and said, ‘I’ll be willing to tell you everything you want to know about JFK’s murder if you’ll pay me five million dollars!’” “Well, I would, but no one took me seriously. I did however hear from one of Stone’s writers several times offering to write a book about my life. I think his name is Hamburg, Eric Hamburg … a nice guy really and quite modest. He’s kept in touch every so often but I’m not sure how much money he can offer.” I listened to my father letting him move the conversation wherever he wanted to. “Did you know that Kevin Costner flew down to the house here to see me?” avid Giammarco is a Canadian television personality and author of a coffee table book on the James Bond movies. My father became acquainted with him when Giammarco interviewed him on the failings of the CIA in the aftermath of 9/11. When Giammarco was working on his Bond book he asked my father to write a short introduction.

In the course of their friendship Giammarco mentioned that Kevin Costner was one of his best friends. Costner, as we know, starred in the Oliver Stone film JFK, and had since become somewhat of a conspiracy enthusiast. Giammarco prodded my father about the assassination and Papa told him the same thing he’d told Oliver Stone: If the money was right, he would tell all he knew. Later, in an incident that I was unaware of for over a year, Costner and Giammarco had flown to Miami to discuss what my father thought was a film project about his life. When they arrived at the house Laura and Austin were there, and after some small talk Costner blurted out “So, tell me Howard, did you kill the President?” They sat stunned for a moment, and my father finally said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” The meeting ended and Costner left without getting the story. There were several things wrong with his approach. First of all he should have never asked my father anything about JFK in front of Laura and Austin. Laura would have never married my father if he’d admitted to having any involvement or knowledge of the Kennedy assassination, and I think she would have divorced him if she found out he’d been lying all those years. Without Laura to care for my father, his life probably wouldn’t have lasted as long as it did. Secondly, Costner should have been prepared to discuss a ballpark dollar amount and, thirdly, he didn’t take the time to get to know my father or for my father to get to know him. Costner came across as just another opportunist looking to make a buck. He was insensitive to the fact that the events in my father’s life, including the JFK period, had destroyed his first family and he was very protective of his second family. So, I have to wonder: was $5 million the magic number that would ease family pain? Before I returned to California I got Giammarco’s address and phone number from my father’s Rolodex and decided to write him a letter. My reasoning was purely selfish; I had been working on a memoir and thought that Giammarco would be useful in helping me find a publisher. I wrote to him, and he called back saying that, from a marketing point of view, if my father were willing to go public with the information he felt sure about concerning JFK’s murder,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:35:9b34f5f9a6f5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4846, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 36, "text": "returned to California I got Giammarco’s address and phone number from my father’s Rolodex and decided to write him a letter.

I wrote to him, and he called back saying that, from a marketing point of view, if my father were willing to go public with the information he felt sure about concerning JFK’s murder, it would give my book a greater chance at success. At this point my father had only hinted to me that he had secrets. This didn’t surprise me; his whole life had revolved around secrets. To keep a secret all you have to do is keep quiet; to protect a secret you have to lie. I knew a few facts; that my father had been accused and questioned about the JFK murder; he had denied under oath any knowledge; he had lost a court case in which he was unable to satisfactorily establish that he hadn’t been in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. A witness had testified that she had seen him in Dallas handing out envelopes of cash to Frank Sturgis, and, whether my father admitted it or not, he was a key figure in just about every sinister covert operation from Guatemala, the Bay of Pigs, the assassination attempts on Castro, to Watergate. I also knew that my father had made a career using disinformation, plausible deniability, and dirty tricks. He had well-known links to the Cuban underground and shared their deep hatred for Kennedy. How could he not have inside information on the assassination of JFK? I told Giammarco I would give it some thought. As a word of encouragement I told him that if my father were going to trust someone it would be me. I composed a letter in which I implored him to reveal to me what he knew, if anything, about JFK’s murder. Aside from the monetary gain, I tried to appeal to him on a deeper, more personal, level. After devoting his life to the service of his government, he had been abandoned by those he trusted and served under. He had been imprisoned and stripped of his dignity. His name had been dragged through the mud by the media in connection with all manner of terrible things. His principles and his patriotism had been challenged. He lost his wife, and his family had been damaged beyond repair. Authors had profited by using his name to sell their conspiracy stories. He had never been appreciated for his own writing talents.

Now, in his last years of life, shouldn’t he marshal his strength and get back at everyone by finally telling the truth? Didn’t he owe it to himself, the Nation, and his family to leave a legacy of truth instead of doubt? I sent the letter off and waited for a reply. A few days passed and then Laura called me. “Saint, your father wants to talk to you.” I could hear Laura hand him the phone and then he said “Saint, in regards to your letter … this is something that I’m not averse to, however you need to understand that my time and cooperation is directly proportional to the financial prospects.” “I understand that, Papa. Papa … are you there?” The phone went dead and I hung up. Conversations with my father were often one-sided; he was so deaf toward the end he couldn’t hear me on the phone and when I talked to him in person, I had to shout. He would often nod in agreement even if he couldn’t really hear you. I called Giammarco and spoke with both him and Costner about my father’s willingness to talk to me. My plan was to fly down to Miami and evaluate what information my father knew and report back to them. I wasn’t sure at this point what he knew. Flying was not something I was fond of and even less so when I realized that my flight was on Dec. 7, 2003, one day short of 31 years since my mother’s plane crashed. Laura picked me up at the airport. “Your father’s been in the hospital for a few days … high fever and loss of appetite, but he’s home now and I know he’ll be very glad to see you, Saint.” I dropped her off at her school, drove to the house and let myself in. Austin and Hollis were both out of the country, so I knew I’d have some one-on-one time with my father. I didn’t discuss the reason for my visit with Laura because I knew she would be against dredging up all the bad old stuff. I wondered how my father would be able to cooperate with this project while keeping it a secret from Laura, but I decided to leave that up to him. “Well, that’s one of the reasons I love her so much.” he said. “Now let’s understand that what I tell you must be kept in secrecy and you’ll", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:37:9cb69882b79d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4848, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 38, "text": "didn’t discuss the reason for my visit with Laura because I knew she would be against dredging up all the bad old stuff.

Understood?” I nodded in agreement and wheeled him back to his bedroom. I made him comfortable, and this is what he told me. In 1963 my father and Frank Sturgis met with David Morales, a contract killer for the CIA, at a safe house in Miami. Morales explained that he had been picked by Bill Harvey, a rogue and unstable CIA agent with a long history of black ops, for a secret “off the board” assignment. It was Morales’ understanding that this project was coming down through a chain of command starting with vice-President Lyndon Johnson. Intrigued, my father listened on. Harvey had told Morales that he’d been brought in by Cord Myer, a CIA agent with international connections, who in turn was working with David Phillips and Antonio Veciana. Phillips was CIA station chief in Mexico City and deeply involved in the dangerous world of the Cuban underground. Veciana was the Cuban founder of the violent Alpha 66 group, bent on overthrowing Castro by any means necessary. All these men shared common ground: a hatred for Kennedy. He was dangerous to their vision of America’s political future, and had abandoned them in their time of need by refusing to bail out the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Cord Myer had his own reason to hate John Kennedy. His ex-wife Mary was one of Kennedy’s numerous mistresses, and the gossip surrounding them infuriated Cord. After the assassination, Mary Myer was mysteriously murdered and her personal diary stolen from her apartment, allegedly by James Angleton, chief spook of counterintelligence. The rumor was that Mary Myer had kept detailed notes about Kennedy and perhaps had information about his death. Of the men mentioned thus far, my father knew Cord Myer, David Phillips, Frank Sturgis and Bill Harvey. He’d never met nor heard of Morales until that night and claimed he’d never heard of Antonio Veciana. This seems unlikely. Alpha 66 was the leading anti-Castro faction in the Cuban underground. David Atlee Phillips worked with my father closely and was actually recruited into the CIA by him when Phillips was working as a journalist in Santiago, Chile. When Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly visited the Russian Consulate in Mexico City in the summer of ^(′)63 , Phillips was station chief there.

Although Phillips denied ever meeting Oswald, Antonio Veciana gave evidence that he had met with Oswald and his case officer, a man known to him only as Maurice Bishop, in Mexico City. Although unwilling to identify Phillips as Bishop, Veciana did provide a detailed description of Bishop to a sketch artist and the resulting drawing looked very much like Phillips. I sat by my father’s bedside and asked, “What happened then?” Sturgis looked at Morales and then at my father and calmly said, “Killing that son of a bitch Kennedy.” My father said he was stunned, but I don’t think he would have been that surprised; getting rid of Kennedy was a common topic of conversation among the Cuban exiles. The truth of the matter is that Kennedy was also hated by much of the military-industrial complex. He was viewed as soft on Communism, and many factions of the government, the exiles, the Mafia, and millions of racists were looking to get Kennedy out. My father then simply asked, “You guys seem to have enough people, what is it you need me for?” The next day when my father and I were alone in the house, we discussed ways that we could divulge certain information to Giammarco and Costner without giving anything away. My father came up with a good solution: put it in code. With that plan in mind, my father provided me with a hand-written diagram outlining the chain of command, a list of people who were involved, and a descriptive time line of the events that led to the “Big Event.” This was the code for JFK’s murder. The Greek alphabet provided the code for most names, such as “Nu” for LBJ, “Beta” for Cord Myer and so forth. He also wrote a few pages of background material on Sturgis, Phillips, and Cord Myer. The reason for this was that he wanted me to type out a descriptive outline in code form and fax it to Giammarco. Hopefully it would be enough to initiate a formal agreement and a good faith payment. My father wanted $150, 000 to be deposited in an account. In view of the fact that Costner and Giammarco had been dangling a multi-million dollar figure for a documentary, a book, and DVD sales and rentals, I didn’t think that $150, 000 was too much. I had to wait until Laura was out of the house to type it up and fax it off.

I had to wait until Laura was out of the house to type it up and fax it off. Before I returned to California I had one more conversation about JFK with my father. He related to me that it was his understanding that Oswald had in fact fired on the President that day, but there was also another man, a French assassin, firing from the famous grassy knoll. The man’s name sounded something like Sarte or Satre, and he may have been recruited for the job by Cord Myer, who had connections to the Corsican underworld. In his own diagram, my father outlined “French con. Man … grassy knoll.” he window of truth opened and closed so quickly that it barely created a breeze. If I hadn’t been there, no one would know. If I hadn’t heard my father’s voice with my own ears, his words would have dissipated like the early morning mist on an autumn blacktop road. Even scarier, the information regarding the “Big Event” would never have been spoken in the first place. I had conspired – we had conspired – to tell the truth. I had approached my father in a once-in-alifetime moment, when he felt that death was at his door and it was time to tell the truth. In a few brief days he laid out the “chain of command,” as he put it, laying the blame on the doorstep of LBJ. I didn’t realize that my presence was essential to the fruition of his confession. After I left for California, the “Miami Mafia,” as I call his second family, slowly chipped away at his resolve. Like a man drowning, he reached for me and I wasn’t there. How could I have known? It’s true, we had these secrets, and I thought that we would follow through. This was to be his final mission. It was supposed to be our mission. In conversations we had, he said that he realized this was going to be a significant story. He was confident that, based upon the information he had thus far provided, we could interest an agent and eventually get a sizable advance. He made it clear to me that there was more to add to the story as long as financial remuneration was forthcoming. He swore me to secrecy, and revealed that he was somehow going to have to work this out with Laura.

I knew this was going to be a problem for us, yet I was naïve enough to think that he would be able to work it out. Laura is a very sweet and politically naïve person. She comes from a very strong Southern moral background. In conversations I’ve had with her she reacted with disbelief that the CIA condones political assassination. She’s told me many times that she married my father with the strict understanding that he had no knowledge of such immoral and evil acts. My father also told me that he had sworn his innocence of CIA/JFK plots to her. The problem my father now faced was how to break the news to Laura without losing her. How could he tell her after all these years that he had been lying? How would his family react? Laura had made it very clear to me that all the money in the world would not be enough to compensate for the disgrace this would bring. She was very adamant in her threat to leave my father. In retrospect, I wonder if she would really have left such a needy old man if he had followed through with the truth. Papa had been denying any knowledge of these matters for years. After all, he had testified twice in court that he knew nothing of the assassination. I wonder, though, was Laura suspicious? She certainly became suspicious of my intentions. When my father went to court in the Mark Lane/Liberty Lobby trail, Laura was at his side. She watched helplessly as he was subjected to merciless examination by Mark Lane. She must have wondered why witnesses were testifying that Howard Hunt was in Dallas during the assassination. I think Laura must have had suspicions about the JFK thing but, like a good wife, she stood by my father, and he stood by his story. All of this weighed very heavily on my father. Once I left, the pressure was on. Not only was this worrying him, but he told me that he had caused so much pain and humiliation for his first family, that he was deeply troubled by what the fallout would bring to his second family, raised long after Watergate and the JFK assassination charges had disappeared from the headlines. Every once in a while there would be the odd Watergate anniversary interview, but Austin and Hollis basically hadn’t been affected by these events.

Every once in a while there would be the odd Watergate anniversary interview, but Austin and Hollis basically hadn’t been affected by these events. He had made sure to shield them from the adverse publicity that had destroyed his first family. He gave up his lecture tours and settled on a life of relative obscurity and safety. He wrote frequently and continued getting published at the rate of almost two books a year. I never understood how fame eluded him. Not only fame, but respect from the journalistic world. Perhaps it was the stain of Watergate. He had been publicly discredited when his memoirs came out in 1974. After initial publication, his testimony at the Watergate trials showed that he had lied in at least ten instances in the book. It was pulled from the shelves and quickly disappeared from circulation. It is interesting to note that he barely discusses the JFK assassination there. He all but leaves it out. Following my trip to Miami, I set up a meeting with Bill Snyder at a restaurant in Sausalito, California. During our lunch, Snyder was “amused” that Howard had any information at all regarding the JFK assassination. He recounted that this had been something that Howard had been approached with before. Snyder told me that, as Howard’s counsel, he would have to recommend that Howard not speak of such things. He would be jeopardizing his freedom and it was a strong possibility that he could be prosecuted. “Even if prosecution were not to happen,” Snyder said, “he would face considerable harassment and humiliation from the media and public.” Snyder insisted it was a grave mistake to go down the assassination conspiracy trail. “Look what happened to Oliver Stone,” he said. When the meeting was over, I knew Snyder was going to be a problem. As I drove back to Eureka, California, where I was then living, I realized for the first time that this project would have to overcome some serious opposition. There would be pressure on my father from Laura, Austin and Hollis as well as Snyder and possibly even Kevan to abandon this project. I was right. I just didn’t know how bad it would get. n January of 2004, I got a letter from my father expressing concerns that the project was moving too slowly: “The last II heard of our would-be sponsors they were preparing papers … it is high time a good faith transfer be made. Without that, I don’t want to talk or negotiate something intangible.

I have two stipulations: source of info must not be identified; and any and all legal fees arising from the enterprise must be paid by the sponsors. Having said that, I look forward to seeing you here. Much Love, Papa.” Later that month I received a Fed Ex package containing a cassette tape. The following is a condensed version of what was on the tape. His voice was extremely labored, and he gasped many times as he fumbled with the tape recorder or the microphone. “LBJ had designated Cord Myer to undertake a larger organization while keeping it totally secret. LBJ settled on Myer as an opportunist like himself, a man who had very little left to him in life … ever since JFK had taken Cord’s wife as his mistress.” He spoke about Sturgis and Morales and the Big Event. At the end of it he said, “Let me point out that if I had wanted to fictionalize what went on in Miami and elsewhere during the run-up to the Big Event I would have done so, but I don’t want any unreality to tinge the information … that I’ve provided to you and you alone … what’s important is that we’ve backtracked a chain of command up through Cord Myer and laying the doings at the doorstep of LBJ…I’ll be perfectly willing to expand on some of these matters in the future … I’ll only do so if there is adequate monetary motivation. Please understand that.” Once the contract from Costner came, with no mention of “adequate monetary motivation,” I knew the deal was off. At best they offered an equal partnership to be divided between Costner, Giammarco, and my father, but an equal partnership for what? Costner wanted me to fly back to Miami and bring my father out to Los Angeles to film a documentary, with Costner acting as the interviewer and my father answering his questions. I spoke with Costner one last time and told him this was an insulting offer and that my father would never reveal to the world what he knew without being paid well. I never asked for any money for myself. I wanted this for my father, and of course the prospect of writing and publishing my own story sometime in the future. Laura called and Papa asked for all the paperwork and notes as well as the cassette. So what’s the truth? As I wrote at the beginning, the same truth can be viewed from many different angles.

Laura called and Papa asked for all the paperwork and notes as well as the cassette. So what’s the truth? As I wrote at the beginning, the same truth can be viewed from many different angles. The way I see it, my father built his life around secrecy. He was in many ways a key to a mystery, a thread that links and binds the CIA, Bay of Pigs, assassination plots, JFK, Nixon, and Watergate. I had hoped that he, as one of the last men standing, would have the last word; but he kept most of his secrets. This is not your average family story … it’s the story of a man and his son; a family torn apart by scandal and lies, betrayal and murder, patriotism and treason. There is a woman who gave her life trying to secure his redemption. There is an old man dying a slow death, a family without love, and a son who will never be forgiven for telling this story. After the failed Costner project, I believed that none of this information would ever be revealed. I was disap- pointed and frustrated at how this had turned out. I know my father was disappointed, yet he was willing to drop the whole thing. His health was continuing to decline, and the thought of dredging all this up, taping interviews, and dealing with the press was more than he seemed able to deal with physically and mentally. I know he must have tortured himself over the conflicts this would have caused, and it appeared to be with some relief when he asked me to return all the memos and audio-tapes I had. He asked me to promise that I would never reveal these startling details or use this information in any way. Reluctantly, I agreed. Before I sent back the original memos, I copied them. I never returned the audio tape, hoping he would overlook it. He never mentioned it, so I assume he had forgotten that I had this critical piece of evidence. In the next few months, I put all of this behind me and resumed my normal life of school, work and family obligations. Learning more than I already knew, I chuckled when he told me that, apparently, Giammarco and David were party buddies, and Costner and Giammarco were good friends. They had offered a large sum of money through David to Papa if David would set up an interview for Costner. Costner then hired a private jet and flew down to Miami for that ill-fated interview with my father.

Costner then hired a private jet and flew down to Miami for that ill-fated interview with my father. My dad thought Costner was coming to discuss a film proposal about his life. So when Costner showed up and bluntly asked him who killed JFK, my dad was surprised, became very angry and declared the visit over. Costner left feeling he had been deceived and soon everyone blamed each other for the whole mess. David was then further sidelined from family and suffered deeper alienation. As David and I spoke on the phone, I told him for the first time that Papa had revealed details about a plot to assassinate JFK, and that I had copied hand written memos and kept a cassette recording that Papa had asked me to return. David said he knew someone named Eric Hamburg who might be willing to discuss how best to use the information that I had. Eric Hamburg, he said, had been a technical advisor on JFK. David had met him on the set of Nixon, which Hamburg had co-produced. Papa and David had been invited to watch some of the filming, and they had met Anthony Hopkins, Oliver Stone and Hamburg. Papa’s attorney, Bill Snyder, had joined them on the set and later for dinner. I don’t know why my father ever thought that Snyder was a capable attorney. He was not a trial lawyer, and it was obvious even to Laura that he was in way over his head at the Mark Lane trial. As Laura recounted to me later, Snyder was a bumbling, perspiring novice when compared to Mark Lane. She believed it was his lack of experience that had caused my father to lose the case. Still, somehow, my father felt that Snyder was competent because he had asked him to negotiate terms during the Costner project. On the phone, Giammarco, and Costner, made it very clear to me that Snyder was the single most damaging influence during negotiations. At least we were all in agreement that Bill Snyder was no asset to my father. David said he would get in touch with Eric Hamburg and get back to me. A few days later David called and gave me Hamburg’s phone number. I waited a few weeks before I called him, but when I did, he seemed very nice and was interested in hearing this new information regarding the assassination. I quickly realized that Hamburg was no ordinary Hollywood type. His mind operated like a computer on the subject of the assassination.

I quickly realized that Hamburg was no ordinary Hollywood type. His mind operated like a computer on the subject of the assassination. He was a well-respected conspiracy researcher and had been instrumental in pushing through a bill that resulted in the declassification of thousands of government documents. He had been to Cuba several times and met Fidel Castro during a symposium about the Bay of Pigs. Hamburg told me that he always felt that E. Howard Hunt knew much more about the assassination than he had ever admitted. “A man like your father,” Hamburg said, “who was involved in both overt and covert CIA/Cuban plots, was certainly in a position to have known about plots against JFK. It’s well known that your father’s trail leads from CIA through Cuba, the Bay of Pigs, plots to kill Castro, and Watergate. I’ve always felt that your dad was the thread that linked all these events, and possibly the hit on JFK.” We had a long conversation in which I revealed to him what my dad had told me. He confirmed that some of the conspirators were well known in JFK conspiracy circles and some were not. Of these, Hamburg said Cord Myer had never been offered as an actual conspirator. The LBJ connection was fascinating, he said, and noted that this was a major piece of the puzzle. “Do you think you could get your Dad to tell you more?” “Jesus” I said. “I just don’t think he’s willing to get into this all over again.” I told him about the Costner project and we ended our conversation with the understanding that I would try to find a way to approach my father. n February 2005, I wrote to my father with the idea that if I could pitch a new project, one with less emphasis on the IJFK material, we could interest a writer who would be willing to co-write my father’s true story as a lasting legacy. In this letter, I outlined that we would want to explore all the details of his fascinating life: “[They are] interested in writing about your whole life; childhood, education, family history, war service, OSS, CIA, prison, etc. … they are also interested in the fact that you turned to me in your time of need during Watergate, how we carried out several ops of our own, what happened to us after our family was destroyed.… This is far more to my liking than the Costner project.

The part of the story in which you were offered a role in the Big Event, but wisely turned it down, is just a footnote in your amazing life and although it is still a commercially strong selling point, would not be the focus of the project. Please consider coming to this project and working with me and whichever writer can offer us the best deal. It would be a cherished memory for a son to have.” During March I got a phone call from Papa approving the basic principal of the project: to co-write a truthful memoir with details regarding Watergate and JFK that had never been made public. After a month of negotiations with Eric Hamburg, it was agreed by the three of us that Hamburg and I would fly down and tape a lengthy interview with Papa to be used as material for the book. Luckily, my father’s health was fairly good at the time, and he seemed enthusiastic about the tapings. In April, Eric and I met at his hotel in Miami to discuss questions for the interview. Eric was very well prepared and had outlined each principal area to be covered. He had pages and pages of names and questions that pertained to all areas of interest: OSS, CIA, Bay of Pigs, Guatemala, the White House, the Plumbers, Watergate, and of course the JFK assassination. Austin was somewhat less enthused. I think he had his suspicions about our ideas for the book. We scheduled 2-3 hour tapings at the Holiday Inn, which included a break for lunch. Papa was amazingly clear-headed and answered all the questions with great interest. Each day when I returned to the house with him, Laura and Austin bombarded me with questions. They wanted to know what was going on behind those closed doors. We weren’t talking about JFK stuff were we? I said we hadn’t gotten that far yet, but we would be going over that ground in the next day or so. After Papa went to bed, Laura, Austin and I had a meeting. Austin wanted to make it clear that asking questions about the JFK assassination was not what they wanted me to do. I said, “I think that part of Papa’s life is very relevant and is something that I think he needs to talk about.” “Austin,” I said, “you don’t seem to realize that these events … Watergate, JFK, and my mother’s death … all happened to a part of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:47:0c09825d56e2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4858, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 48, "text": "Papa went to bed, Laura, Austin and I had a meeting.

These events had a direct effect on my life, and there are secrets that I share with Papa that he wants to reveal; and quite frankly I just wish all of you would stop pressuring my father into doing what you want him to do. You should be giving him the courage to do what he wants, not holding him back for your own selfish reasons!” “St. John, we trusted you when you said this was a different project. We now feel that you still have intentions of having your father discuss matters that could become huge problems for him and our part of the family. We think you’re the one who is selfish and narrow-minded. You’re not thinking of what might happen to us and to your father if he starts talking about all this secret stuff.” I felt like I was being attacked and I was getting really angry. “No, I don’t. I do believe he knew about some plans to get rid of Kennedy, and he’s told me so. I think it’s valuable information both historically and for the book.” Laura, who had watched quietly as Austin and I battled each other, shifted in her chair and said, “St. John, I think you really do believe that your father had something to do with JKF’s death; just like you think that your mother’s death was a murder and not an accident.” “Laura, those are two different, but possibly not unrelated, events. There are things that Papa has told me which cause me to believe that he has had his suspicions as well.” Then I said, “You guys are all living this fairly perfect little life down here, and I come down threatening to upset your perfect little world by wanting to find out the truth about my father! I’m sorry it upsets you. It has been deeply upsetting to me for over thirty years. My life was almost destroyed by the things he did, and although I’m only blaming myself for the way I lived my life in the years that followed, I just want to know the truth about who my father and mother were!” I was fighting back tears now, but I continued. “So unless you find some way to stop me, Papa and I are going to continue to tape his life story, and whatever", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:48:506ce3ac1c2e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4859, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 49, "text": "to me for over thirty years.

The Miami warmth, the moon and palm trees helped me to calm down. The next morning as I got Papa ready for the trip to Eric’s hotel room, I didn’t talk about our fight the night before. I especially didn’t want Papa to see evidence that this book project was already dividing a family that desperately needed to heal. On the way to the hotel I asked Papa how much of what he had told me last year in the memos he would be willing to talk about on camera. He turned in his seat and looked at me perplexed. “How much does Eric know?” “Well, Laura is going to be very upset and it could ruin our relationship. You know she forgave me for my infidelities several years ago, but I had to really win her back. I was younger then and I’ve been so sick … lost my leg … and she’s the only one that really takes care of me. She’s all I have and I probably wouldn’t be alive this long if it weren’t for her. Austin is embarking on a Naval career and may eventually decide to branch out into intel. I think these revelations might have an undesired effect on his chances.” “I can’t promise you honesty. I’m deeply sorry, but that’s the way it’s going to have to be. I can’t and won’t jeopardize this second family that I live with for something that has already created problems that are only going to get worse. Saint … I lost my first family and wife over some of this stuff … if I bring it all out now, I may ruin more lives. Don’t you understand that?” He reached over and held my hand firmly. I was moved to tears to see how conflicted he was about this. “I love you son, and I respect what you’ve tried to do here, but I just can’t give you what you want.” I sat quietly next to him and allowed the silence to shield the pain. It was obvious that he was making a choice – a choice I had presented him with. It was them or me and so far they were winning.

He had come all this way and although there had been no promise that my father would deliver the goods, I knew Eric was going to be disappointed. When I knocked on Eric’s door I asked him if he could excuse himself and allow my father and I to have a few minutes alone. Eric seemed a little bewildered but gave us our privacy. I wheeled my father over by the window and asked him one more time about the Big Event and Mama’s death. He just closed his eyes and shook his head in the negative. I felt very bad for Papa. I felt bad for myself, as well. Over those few days, my father gave Eric Hamburg and Iwhat was to be his final interview. Papa was always an News and drinking coffee when I greeted him in the morning. We drove most often in silence to the Holiday Inn on Miami Beach where Eric had set up an informal taping area. I was keenly aware that these were going to be long and probably difficult sessions. We started out that first morning with Papa talking about his mother and father, his early childhood and the start of his service during WWII. He was sharp, animated and had an encyclopedic memory of all things. For a man in his mid eighties, he was incredible. The mood was relaxed, and we let Papa reminisce about whatever came to his mind. The interview concluded after three hours when he grew tired and said he wanted to go home. Later that afternoon, when Laura, Austin and Hollis came home, there was much discussion and curiosity about the day’s events. Papa was in a great mood and enjoying all the attention he was getting. Austin and Hollis then invited themselves to come over and watch the next interview. This was bad news! With them present, E. Howard Hunt was never going to discuss anything he had confided to me about the JFK assassination. The next day we picked up where we had left off, and a nice flow began to develop. Papa was getting into some interesting stuff about the formation of the OSS and the early history of the CIA. Suddenly there was a knock on the door and in popped Hollis, just to see her dear old Dad!

Suddenly there was a knock on the door and in popped Hollis, just to see her dear old Dad! I was like a cat bristling at an intruder: a female canine intruder! She sat there, smiling pleasantly and holding his hand, the devoted daughter concerned for her Papa. I was nauseated. I wanted to grab her by the throat and toss her out with the laundry. Luckily, this portion of the interview wasn’t classified. I hoped this would be her only visit. Papa got tired after a few hours and we broke for lunch. After some delicious stone crabs and a few beers, he was ready to go again. I must say that his enthusiasm and energy were incredible. After taking him home, I met Eric at the hotel and we planned our strategy for the next round of questions. We realized that the critical issues would be coming up at the next session. We had already covered OSS, CIA, the coup in Guatemala, the Bay of Pigs, and many of the principals involved in those events. I wondered how we could ease my father into discussing the JFK hit. Would he even go there? Would the Miami Mafia show up and abort this most sensitive area? Eric had a huge list of questions. He had seen the handwritten memos that my father had given me and he’d heard the confession tape. I drove home that night watching the sun set over beautiful Miami Beach and wondered how the next day would unfold. This was perhaps the most important part of the interview. Once back at Papa’s home, I tip-toed around looking for some alcohol to drink. I was pretty wound up and really stressed out. I sat there blindly staring at the TV, drinking rum and cokes. I didn’t like what was happening. I didn’t like the fact that his second family was putting so much pressure on him. They viewed me as an outsider, and I felt the same way about them. This was a battle, a war really; a fight between truth and lies. I wished I could just whisk my Papa away from there. I tried to shut my eyes, but sleep eluded me. Maybe just one more rum and coke would wash away the stress. I drank heavily that night. The next morning I took Papa to a doctor’s appointment and then we met Eric for lunch.

Eric questioned him like a good attorney trying to get to the heart of the matter without losing the cooperation of his star witness. When we were just about to get to specifics regarding the JFK stuff, Austin showed up. What perfect timing! I was ready to blow a fuse. Eric was much calmer than I was. My contempt for Austin was thinly veiled. Eric swiftly changed the topic to other, less critical matters. We finished out the session and Austin took Papa home. I tried to imagine what they were talking about. When I got home later in the day, it was clear that the mood was very bad. The air was thick with tension and nobody was even making small talk with me. I felt like I should sleep outside under a bush. I stayed in my room and out of the line of fire. A few hours later I emerged, hoping to watch a little TV. Papa was back in his hospital bed and wasn’t feeling well. He was drained from the day’s events, and I wondered if he was going to be able to continue the interview tomorrow. I realized that he was the one being torn apart. I knew it must be excruciatingly difficult for him. I was feeling a lot of things: anger, sadness, resentment, and frustration. This whole project had already taken so long, and had gone through so many changes that I just wanted it to be over. I tried to talk to Laura and Austin that night, but we blew up at each other. The fear and paranoia had taken over. After a very intense argument about the JFK taboo, I’d had enough of arguing and acting out, so I got up and left. I was an unwelcome person, but it was my father’s home, and as long as he wanted me there, I was going to stay. Papa could have terminated the interviews at any time, so I knew at least a part of him wanted to do it. I spent most of that night worrying as I tossed and turned. I must have fallen asleep just before dawn because I could feel the air conditioning kick on as the morning sun sweltered outside. Sleep, I was so happy to sleep! I woke up with a sense of doom hanging over my head.

Papa’s mood hadn’t changed; he was upbeat and ready to go to the hotel for the final day of interviews. I called Eric and told him we were on our way. I prayed that we would be able to work without interruption. Once we settled into our seats, Eric began questioning Papa about some of the details of the conspiracy to kill JFK. As I suspected, this was not easy. My father denied what he had previously told me. Changing his strategy, Eric asked about Cord Meyer, Bill Harvey, David Morales, Frank Sturgis and Dave Phillips. This was masterful. He was giving my father the means to talk about the assassination without implicating himself. My father, of course, was equally as cunning in his choice of words. Without the fear of reprisals that would surely have come as the result of a more direct admission, my father freely talked about the JFK murder in a way that he had never done before. Papa fully realized that this was a video and audio testimony that was of historical importance. His testimony was slippery without being vague, and he let Eric guide him into answering questions while denying absolute firsthand knowledge. In retrospect, if this was the best we could do then we had achieved a lot. This was E. Howard Hunt on camera talking about the JFK conspiracy. He cleverly substantiated what he had revealed in his taped “death-bed” confession in January 2004. The tapes are a historically significant document and contain hours of fascinating information. After the JFK portion was finished, we all breathed a sigh of relief. After a hearty lunch, we resumed our interview and moved on to many interesting topics about Watergate, prison life, and the current state of the CIA. All in all, there are about nine hours of tape. he book, American Spy, that was published shortly after my father passed away was the direct result of everything that Eric Hamburg and I had labored hard and long to achieve. After we flew back to California, Eric went to work putting a proposal together, with an outline of chapters and content for my dad’s approval. At the same time he contacted his agent to begin finding a publisher. My father enthusiastically signed off on the first outline Eric sent him.

Based on that, Eric wrote up a further proposal and gave it to his agent for circulation among publishers. Initially, our prospects looked really good. This was to be the definitive life story of one of our nation’s most infamous intelligence operatives. Unlike his first autobiography, Undercover: Memoirs of an American Secret Agent, which was quickly taken off the shelves in 1975 for glaring untruths, this was to be the real story. The main selling point of the book was, of course, new revelations by a key insider about the conspiracy to kill JFK . Finally, after forty-plus years, someone with real firsthand knowledge was coming forward to blow the whistle; naming names and confirming that JFK had been killed as the result of a conspiracy within the American government. Eric and I had signed a contract with my father splitting any profits from the book equally three ways. It seemed to be going smoothly, until Eric started getting phone calls from my father’s attorney, Bill Snyder, and a bigger buffoon there could not be. This man had represented my father since Watergate and had even been recommended to him by William F. Buckley, Jr. Snyder was real trouble for the project, and it’s easy to speculate that he was more of a “handler” than a real attorney. A handler, in intelligence jargon, is someone who keeps a potentially embarrassing person in line. Eric and I suspected that Snyder was my father’s handler for the CIA, and would go to any lengths to derail this project. Eric started getting phone calls and e-mails from Snyder protesting the nature of the revelations in the book proposal. When Eric countered that Papa had already approved everything, Snyder blew his top and threatened legal action against Eric and the publishers. He then sent a revised (censored) proposal, which excluded any reference to JFK other than to say that Mr. Hunt had no knowledge of any plot to kill Kennedy. It might as well have been written by one of the staff at Langley. This, of course, was unacceptable to us, and the shadow play went on for months, back and forth, revision after revision until there was nothing left of any real value in the book. Snyder pressured my father into terminating our original contract for equal profits, and badgered him into signing a letter which said that I was not to discuss any part of the book with anyone, including Eric Hamburg, and my share", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:54:ca9275ab872b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4865, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 55, "text": "by one of the staff at Langley.

Snyder pressured my father into terminating our original contract for equal profits, and badgered him into signing a letter which said that I was not to discuss any part of the book with anyone, including Eric Hamburg, and my share was reduced to a mere 7% . The Miami Mafia prevented me from speaking with my father on the phone, and I found myself on the outside looking in. I couldn’t believe this was happening. Snyder had successfully driven a wedge between us. He had secured the complete support of the self-serving second family that surrounded my dad with a miasma of fear and loathing; and kept him from doing what he had said he wanted. On top of all that, they had convinced my sisters that I had brow-beaten my poor father into making wholly untrue statements regarding the JFK assassination. I wrote a final plea to my father, not for the reinstatement of our original profit agreement, only asking that he retract cruel statements he had made in the letter to me. I pleaded for a chance to prove that the charges Snyder had convinced him to make against me were completely false. Among those charges it was alleged that I had used his good name to borrow and/or steal money from his friends and associates. This was a ridiculous charge. I had never borrowed or accepted money from any person connected to my father. As a matter of fact, I never borrow money. This was clearly a campaign by Snyder and the rest to discredit me, and destroy our relationship. Why were they so afraid of me? Why did they feel so threatened? Was it really just because once these revelations came out, their precious little perfect lives would be soiled? The fact that I wasn’t allowed to speak to him and that I lived so far away caused me a great deal of agony. Still, despite the hurt and bitterness, I didn’t blame my father. They were the ones brow-beating him, and he was just too old and tired to resist them. In a final letter, the last one I ever got from Papa, he called for a truce. He said, “I’m too old and sick to fight with anyone, especially you, my first-born son. Let’s just say that there have been too many things to forgive and too many to forget.

Eric eventually backed out, saying that he could not be party to a book that was not truthful and would cast doubt on his reputation. The publishers were ready to back out of the agreement, saying, quite rightly, that there was no reason to go forward if my father was not going to disclose the JFK information. The point was also made that since Eric’s departure from the project, the book had no author. My father was way too sick to write it himself, and it had always been understood that Eric would be the main author, with my father reserving final approval of the manuscript. Eventually, they found a new writer for the project, changed the title from Final Secrets to American Spy, and published it. My father did not live to see its publication. He died in January 2007, about a month before the book came out. It received no critical acclaim, and was regarded as nothing of importance. Snyder and the family had won the battle, trivializing the book and gagging my father’s last testimony. For me the greatest sadness was that I was never able to really speak to my father again. He died, and we never regained the love, trust and camaraderie that we had shared. After everything that happened in our lives, overcoming political issues, death, family loss, prison, drugs, it was tragic that Snyder and the Miami family had come between us. I blame them and, sadly, will probably never forgive them. he last time I saw Papa was in January 2007, when I flew to Miami a week before he passed away. The tension was as thick as the humidity when I arrived at my fa ther’s home in Miami Shores. The family’s welcome was at best thin and superficial, but I didn’t let that bother me; I was there for my father. He was barely recognizable when I walked qui etly into his bedroom. The caregiver told me he hadn’t been out of bed for a month. He spent most of his time sleeping, and Laura had finally agreed to get him a caregiver/house maid while she was at work. Papa was sleeping as I pulled up a chair and sat next to his bed. His face was shrunken, especially because he wasn’t wearing his teeth. He never adjusted to having dentures and he seemed just as happy without them. My father accepted his decline with frank dignity.

He never allowed his physical problems to alter the fact that, even at his advanced age, he was a man’s man. He had lived his life the way he wanted, he had endured hardship, and no one could say that he lived with- out personal loss or sacrifice. He had been betrayed by his government and his colleagues, and in the end, after all of the humiliation in the press, all the speculations and accusations, he still carried himself with grace and pride. I spent the next four hours sitting there, reflecting on our lives. There was so much to forgive, so much to embrace; it was utterly overwhelming. “Do you know who this is? Howard,” she called, “do you know who this is?” Papa looked around the room as if in a trance and, looking me squarely in the eye, he said softly, “It’s Saint, it’s my son, Saint John.” I looked into his eyes, searching for some special sign that all was forgiven. I needed to be forgiven, even if I had to do it on his terms. Everything had always seemed to be on his terms, so why should I think it would be any different now? Papa was the center of our family universe; Mama had been the gift, the work, the binding and the sorrow. He raised his feeble hand, small as a child’s. I gripped it, and poured my heart and soul, my love and devotion into him through our grasp. He held it tightly. His grip outlasted mine. He said nothing with words but he said a lifetime with his eyes; those steely, unflinching eyes, that could pierce through all the layers of self-protection; that could uplift you or reduce you to nothing. I spent my life hating and loving those eyes. He held my hand tightly for at least 10 minutes. Laura came back in the room and felt his forehead; it was hot. “He’s got a fever,” she said. “Maybe we should call 911.” “Don’t you think he needs to die here in his home?” She ignored me and mumbled that she was calling 911. I had the fleeting thought of putting a pillow over his head and ending it all right there. I visualized myself in the act of suffocating my father, and wondered if my actions would result in a murder charge. Could they tell if I smothered my father? I didn’t know.

I visualized myself in the act of suffocating my father, and wondered if my actions would result in a murder charge. Could they tell if I smothered my father? I didn’t know. Instead of committing parricide, I got up and followed Laura out to the back porch. “Laura, I think he’s trying to die. Do you really think he’ll pull through this time?” There was nothing to do now, no arguing my point. Laura was his wife, and she had the power to do what she thought best. As I returned to my father’s bedside, I wondered why she was seemingly unable to accept that he was really dying, and what superhuman strength compelled him to hang on. I whispered to him, “You can let go, Papa. It’s going to be all right.” Soon I heard the siren and in a few moments the medics were moving my father out the front door and into the ambulance. “I’m riding with him, I’m his son,” I said. Papa seemed barely aware of what was going on around him. One ambulance trip melted into another and another and bright lights, nurses, prodding, and questions. All this, the wonders of modern medicine and free ambulance rides. A man is not only measured by his accomplishments, of which my father had so many, but also by the challenggreatest challenge was not to allow overwhelming personal and professional tragedy to force him to live in anger and regret. My father met that challenge, and won. He showed me that in an ever-changing world of shifting values, his values are still the ones that count the most. When I was born in 1954, my father was a young man of thirty-six. He had graduated from Brown University and survived World War II. He was well into his writing career, which would culminate in the publishing of his eighty-fifth novel, and third memoir next month. With one tour of duty as a naval officer under his belt, he joined the fledgling OSS. Never one to shy from hazardous duty, he made his reputation as a man who was skilled in both overt and covert duties. Papa had that rare combination of traits, which allowed him to be in the front lines of the action, and then, after changing into his Brooks Brothers suit, sit and have lunch with the Director of the CIA. He was the classic CIA man: an American James Bond. He had a sophisticated intellect, a taste for fine wine, good cigars, and international intrigue. Deeply patriotic, he felt it was his calling to protect freedom and democracy at a time when much of the world was on the brink of Communist control.

Deeply patriotic, he felt it was his calling to protect freedom and democracy at a time when much of the world was on the brink of Communist control. This did not come without a price: while trying to raise a family, the very nature of his work caused us to live like gypsies. True, we were exposed to the benefits of world travel and varied cultures, but we lacked a real sense of stability and security that only comes from growing up in the same familiar area. One of the most difficult times in my father’s life was dealing with the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs operation. My father had been instrumental in merging the various anti-Castro Cuban Revolutionary groups and was something of a legendary figure known as “Eduardo.” He viewed his Cuban brothers in arms as family, and was deeply committed to doing everything in his power to get them back to a free Havana. The fact that he had been betrayed by politicians whose only concern was their popularity was only a hint of what was to happen in later years. I won’t dwell here on the topic of Watergate except to say that for him and our family it was more than a national scandal; it was a personal tragedy and a nightmare that touched our lives with unforgiving brutality. My personal feeling is that my father’s deep sense of loyalty and patriotism for this country was exploited by men of petty concerns and vastly inferior moral fiber. I have some wonderful memories of my father: when I was just a toddler he would allow me to ride on his back as he crawled on all fours and made elephant sounds while I screamed with delight. In Japan he held me protectively while we swam, and at times, with mischievous intent, he left me standing in waist-high water while he nipped at my heels. He was a lover of jazz and was a gifted piano and trumpet player. During holidays and celebrations we would gather around while he sang and played songs on the piano, in awe of this complex man. For all his seriousness and unapproachability, he had a sweet playful side and a great sense of humor. His laugh was robust and house-shaking. Right up to the very end when he was slipping away, he displayed his humor by raising his hands into claws, just the way he did when he chased me around the floor so many years before.

Right up to the very end when he was slipping away, he displayed his humor by raising his hands into claws, just the way he did when he chased me around the floor so many years before. He introduced me to jazz and showed me that he could play Harry James’ trumpet solo in the classic Benny Goodman swing tune, “Sing, Sing, Sing.” In the early 1970’s when I was still under age he often took me to his favorite Georgetown jazz club called Blues Alley. He introduced me to Gene Krupa, Jimmy Rushing, and his close friend guitarist Steve Jordan. He shared his love of the outdoors with me, and I accompanied him on many hunting and fishing trips. Although in the years that followed we spent less time together, we never doubted the bond we had. We looked beyond our differences and loved each other unconditionally. When he moved to Guadalajara, he made me feel welcome at his home. Just because he was no longer a covert operative, didn’t mean he stopped thinking like one. Here is one story I’ll relate. Desiring nothing more than a peaceful and idyllic life, he retired every night to bed and waited for sleep to take its restful hold. This was not to be! The neighbor had acquired a prize rooster and kept it on the roof. Every morning before the crack of dawn, that rooster would crow and shriek! As time went on, my father thought he would go mad. To remedy the situation he devised a plot to rid the world of that “devil rooster.” He mixed some chicken feed and rat poison with water and froze it in an ice cube tray. After waiting for the neighbors to go to sleep, my father quietly slipped up to the roof, and using a sling shot, fired the poisoned ice cubes at the rooster. When the ice melted, the rooster fed, and, well, that was the end of that problem. He had the great fortune of falling in love, marrying, and having families with not one, but two extraordinary women: Dorothy and Laura. Without the love and devotion of these two remarkable persons, there wouldn’t have been any balance in his life. They were the glue that held us all together. They calmed him when he was angry, and soothed him when he was worried. They gave him wonderful children and filled his life with love and meaning.

I’ve never seen anyone so devoted, so loving and caring as Laura was to my Papa. had started trying several months before he died to find another way to break the incredible information my father I had given me. One of my old high school friends worked as a writer at Rolling Stone and after countless attempts to reach him, he finally returned my e-mail. To make a long story a bit shorter, I told him what I had and, after getting approval from his bosses, he flew to Eureka for three days of interviews. He examined all the documents I had, listened to the tape, and questioned me exhaustively. In the meantime the news broke that E. Howard Hunt had passed away, and it was all over the papers and the Internet. Eureka’s newspaper, the Times Standard, sent someone over to cover the story from a local perspective. During that interview I let it slip that there might be a big story coming out with Rolling Stone magazine. Immediately I got calls from members of my family. I got calls from Snyder, the lawyer, whom I had hoped and prayed would not continue to be involved in family matters. This was not to be. There was no doubt that he was going to fight me every step of the way. When the Rolling Stone article came out in April of 2007, the fecal matter really hit the fan! I got a call from the family saying they never wanted to talk to me again. As far as they were concerned I was no longer a part of the Hunt family. I had betrayed them and they considered me a lowlife. Immediately parts of the story were up all over the Net, and myriads of people had opinions and set up websites to break the news that Hunt gave a “deathbed confession” with startling revelations naming the assassins of JFK. “Death-bed confession” was not a term I ever used. The title of the Rolling Stone article was, “The Last Confession of E. Howard Hunt,” but, true to human nature, people went with the sexier “death-bed” thing, and it exploded into a media frenzy. I started getting calls from radio shows and decided to go ahead with interviews on some of the top programs. I picked “Coast to Coast” with Ian Punnett, and he became the first to broadcast the taped confession my father made and sent to me back in 2004. Shortly before the airing, my sister Kevan called Ian and said that there was no such confession tape, that it was all a lie.

He said, “I’ve heard this tape now a dozen times and I assure you that this is nothing short of astounding.” The problem my family had was that they didn’t know Papa had made the tape, let alone its contents; so when it was broadcast it completely shut them up. To me, it was a major victory. I gleefully imagined Kevan’s jaw dropping … even becoming dislocated! The rest of the doubters never said another thing to me. What could they say? How could they deny words from the man himself? I don’t know what, if any, strategy meetings the family had to contain the story and destroy my character, but there did appear a “Hunt family” website with a long letter full of character assassination against yours truly. In it they brought up my drug use and claimed I had pressured an old and sick Hunt into making up false stories. I was a liar and shouldn’t be believed. The response from the public was nearly unanimous: I was the bearer of truth. They were the liars and should be ashamed of themselves! Letters and e-mails started pouring in from all over the world thanking me for coming forward with the story. sense of the word. An inexhaustible mover and shaker, he runs around like a six-headed demon attacking fraud and political corruption from every angle. He’s a very controversial figure with a huge radio audience. My interviews on his show were a big success and we became good friends. His knowledge of the underside of political intrigue and misinformation is encyclopedic. Alex is a great supporter of mine, and I hope I am of him as well. The next media offer that came in was from Inside Edition, a Hollywood/News tabloid TV show. They wanted to put me on the air. I flew down to Los Angeles and met my friend Eric Hamburg. We had agreed to do the show together. We drove to their studios in Hollywood and waited for them to call us in for the taping. I had never done TV before and I didn’t know what was going to happen. As I waited there the thought did occur to me that I might be getting a bad deal.

My fears proved unfounded. Moret was not only a very nice man; he was an exceptional interviewer. He was smooth and direct without being abrupt. He handled me perfectly and we taped for about an hour. The final cut was much shorter of course, but it was very well received. After the show, Eric and I got a chance to hang out together. There was a lot going on in my life and I was getting tired of the radio shows. I felt like I was getting repetitive and people were asking some pretty strange questions. One caller asked if I knew where JFK’s brain was! Other people asked if Lee Harvey Oswald ever came to my house. Radio shows are very time consuming. You have to wait on the phone for long periods while the host does his advertising spots and talks to his other guests, who all have something to sell. It might be a DVD or a book, but they all have some kind of product. I decided to bring something to the sales table. I went ahead and had an interview filmed, which I offered on a website that was created for me. On the website, you could hear the entire audio of my dad’s “confession” and see a transcript of his words. There was also a link to sell my DVD. Was it wrong or unethical? It certainly was not. At best, what little money came in would barely offset the cost of manufacturing the DVD’s and setting up the website. Unfortunately, by the time my DVD was available, I had tired of the radio shows and decided that Alex’s would be the last for a while. My father had instructed me to come forward with his revelations after his death and I felt like I had done a pretty good job. I had other things going on in my life. My wife, Mona Arnold, was the woman I had waited my entire life to meet. We met at College of the Redwoods, and I knew almost immediately that I would ask her to marry me. I decided to propose to her at the big Relay for Life cancer fund-raiser. A couple of curious things happened to me just after theRolling Stone article appeared.

I didn’t see anything very sinister or conspiratorial about either incident, but some friends who know people that might know these things warned me about my safety. The break-in at the house left no traces of entry and all the usual stuff people steal was untouched. There was stereo equipment, CDs, computers, DVDs, TVs, and nothing was touched. The only evidence was that whoever did it was looking for some papers. All of the files had been gone through. What were they looking for? It could have been the documents and memos that my father gave me outlining the plot to kill Kennedy, or it could have been … I don’t know what to think. Does this kind of thing actually happen in the real world? Do spooks break into people’s homes? Was Dick Nixon tricky? Then again, wouldn’t professionals have made it look like a normal robbery by a drug fiend? Two nights later I was driving down Samoa Blvd., out by the dunes next to Humboldt Bay. It’s a dark stretch of sandy windswept two-lane blacktop with no streetlights to speak of. It was late and I was returning to my house from my girlfriend Mona’s apartment in Arcata. There was nobody else on the road when I noticed some headlights coming up fast behind me. As they got closer and closer I sped up a little, but they pulled back. They were about ten or more car lengths behind me when they sped up again. They came up so fast, right up to my bumper with their hi-beams on, that I swerved to avoid a collision. My car almost flipped on the sandy soil near the dunes. Mona and I got married on October 13, 2007, in a beautiful ceremony in Willow Creek, California.

I still get plenty of e-mails from people all over the world thanking me for coming forward with these tantalizing pieces of the puzzle. Little by little, some have come forward with enticing bits of information: like the guy who, now in his advanced years, saw my website and reached out to tell me that in 1963 he worked for the CIA stationed in Miami at the Opa Loka air base. He was a contract agent and a pilot. He knew my father and says that he flew him to Dallas in 1963. I’ve checked this guy out with Eric Hamburg and his story is credible. Other people have found their courage and come forward with other bits of the story. One such person is Douglas Caddy. Doug Caddy was my father’s first attorney during Watergate. He had also been the attorney for Billy Sol Estes. Estes is an interesting figure in the underbelly of Texas politics. He worked with Lyndon Johnson on various crooked land and water deals. He also claims that he was one of LBJ’s closest confidantes. This is undisputed. That he carried out many shady and illegal activities on behalf of Johnson there is also little dispute. He has gone on record that LBJ told him (Estes) that he had been part of the plot to kill Kennedy. Doug Caddy sent me an e-mail encouraging me to continue fighting for the truth. Caddy also sent me an interesting DVD about LBJ’s involvement in the murder of JFK. Caddy told me I was on the right track and that Estes had told him so. Along with all the public support I’ve received, there has been evidence of pressure on the media not to play up the story. 60 Minutes, the famous investigative show on CBS, called and wanted to flesh out a meeting with me in San Francisco. I phoned Eric Hamburg and we agreed to meet one of their top producers. I brought down all of the memos and tapes that I had in support of my father’s story and had several good meetings with this producer, who shall remain unnamed. He was intrigued and excited about bringing this story to a national news audience with a ten-minute segment on an upcoming broadcast. He examined all the documents and we supplied handwriting experts to verify that the handwriting on the JFK memos was in fact that of E. Howard Hunt.

He flew back to New York and I went back to Eureka and waited. He called me the next week and said his boss had approved the story in a meeting that afternoon. Would I be willing to fly to New York to tape the interview? Wow! This was really big! Another week passed, and he called me again; this time with bad news. “As much as I wanted to run with this story, and I think it’s a very important one, Saint John, I’ve been shut down.” It’s clear that this important story has been overlooked by the major news media because the powers that control them put their time and money into books and shows that support the lone gunman theory. Just look at two widely acclaimed books: Case Closed, by Victor Posner and the lengthy Reclaiming History, by ex-crime solver Vincent Bugliosi. That book is 1600+ pages thick and weighs a ton. Bugliosi was asked on a radio show what he thought of the revelations coming from Saint John Hunt. He replied, “Well, you know, Saint John isn’t credible.” Mr. Bugliosi, you’ve cleverly slipped by the point. It’s not my credibility you need to judge, I’m only the messenger. Call my father a liar if you don’t believe his undisputed personal statements, made when he knew the end was near, but don’t shift the burden of proof onto me. You can’t say that my father’s own words aren’t at least worthy of further investigation. I have his memos and his tapes, and he gave me the task of bringing this to the world. There are still surprises left for people like Posner, 60 Minutes and Bugliosi.

We both knew he wasn’t ready yet to tell the whole story. And now he never will. I’m left with parts of a puzzle. ’ve been asked many times what role I think my father really played in the killing of JFK. I have, of course, thought I about it for a long time. After all the bits and scraps of information that I’ve been sent, careful examination of my father’s notes and my own research into who the conspirators were and what connections they may have had, I have come up with what I believe to be a plausible scenario: According to my father, LBJ and just about everybody else in the military-industrial complex viewed Kennedy as a threat and wanted him out of the way. Johnson knew that if Kennedy served another term, he probably had no chance of succeeding to the presidential throne, so he was open to suggestions, and agreed to control the investigation and cover-up in return for his ticket to the Oval Office. J. Edgar Hoover and the Kennedy brothers had been virtually at war, with Hoover having the institutional edge and aligning himself with Johnson. It is alleged that just prior to the assassination, LBJ and Hoover held a secret meeting witnessed by LBJ’s mistress, Madeline Brown. Brown also has gone on record as being present when LBJ said, in a moment of anger, that he was “taking care” of Kennedy. Billy Sol Estes, close friend of LBJ, confided to his attorney, Douglas Caddy, that LBJ had told him he was part of the move to kill Kennedy. I think in trying to find the right men for the job, LBJ landed on Cord Meyer. He was a CIA officer with international connections via London and was married to Mary Meyer, a socialite and mistress of Kennedy. She was later murdered on a Georgetown pathway, her home ransacked and her diary stolen, allegedly by James Angleton, chief of counterespionage for the CIA. LBJ must have known that Meyer had an ax to grind with Kennedy and wanted revenge. From here the plot (according to my father) branches out to involve David Atlee Phillips, a close friend of my father and suspected handler of Oswald in Mexico City. Bill Harvey, another CIA officer, had been involved in many of the darkest ops in the CIA/Mafia plots against", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:67:56b34fd91dd1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4878, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 68, "text": "home ransacked and her diary stolen, allegedly by James Angleton, chief of counterespionage for the CIA.

Bill Harvey, another CIA officer, had been involved in many of the darkest ops in the CIA/Mafia plots against Castro. He was someone who wouldn’t get squeamish about killing the President of the United States. In Harvey’s biography there are notes and cables by Harvey discussing the need to recruit assassins from the Corsican underworld. Harvey was the one with the connections to do just that, and it was my father’s contention that Harvey brought in Lucien Sarti as the hit man on the grassy knoll. Harvey was hoping his reward would be head of the CIA, after Johnson took control. My father would have been the perfect man to organize the Cuban end of the assassination. Well known and respected in the underworld of anti-Castro Cuban exiles with revenge on their minds, he played the role of CIA link to these bloodthirsty mercenaries. Ever loyal to his bosses at CIA, my father shared their fear that Kennedy would virtually disband the CIA. Kennedy did in fact threaten to do just that. In addition he had fired my father’s mentors and patrons after the Bay of Pigs disaster, thereby ending his rise up the CIA ladder. After that, his credibility, like so many others, was ruined. The Cuban paramilitary group included Antonio Veciana, ruthless leader of Alpha 66 and well-known Kennedy hater whose CIA handler was none other than David Atlee Phillips, and Frank Sturgis, another CIA mercenary and Bay of Pigs veteran (he would later work for my father during Watergate and spend time with him in Federal prison). Another member was David Morales, admitted CIA executioner, with a list of bodies dating back to 1954, when he and my father worked successfully to overthrow the Guatemalan government. I believe Morales was part of the ground team and was at the meetings with my father in which the murder was discussed. In later years, personal friends of his have come forward with tales of a drunken Morales admitting to his role in Kennedy’s death. Morales died mysteriously just before he was to testify before the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978. Lucien Sarti was the Corsican assassin who, dressed as a policeman, fired the fatal head shot from the grassy knoll. According to witnesses, he was flown out of Dallas the day of the assassination. My father was a sniper during his stint in the OSS and had expertise in positioning a hit team using triangulation fire.

I think it’s plausible that he may have been the one who scouted out the positions for the three-man sniper team at Dallas. He was flown into and out of Dallas by a pilot from the CIA station in Miami in 1963, according to whom it may well fit the timeline. Frank Sturgis and Morita Lorenz, CIA contract agent and mistress of Fidel Castro, have testified that my father was in Dallas on that day and met with them at a motel room, at which time he gave Sturgis an envelope full of cash. Lorenz was a CIA tart who was used in attempts to kill her lover Fidel. I thank all the people who support my going public, and I respect those who don’t. I urge others to bring forward even the smallest links of information, and I pity my family for such cowardly and disgraceful attempts to keep the truth from coming to light. Most of all, and with a deep sense of pride and respect, love and admiration, I want to thank my father, E. Howard Hunt, who, after living with the terrible truth for over forty years, had the courage to tell me some of his secrets. o much has been written about Watergate, yet so much of what the public believes is incorrect. Having been perthe cover-up did much to distance me from understanding its true nature. I don’t profess to be an authority on the subject, but I will try to explain my interpretation of one of the biggest political downfalls in modern times. What was Watergate? Simply put, Watergate was the name of an office complex and adjoining hotel in Washington D.C. In 1972, the Watergate office complex housed the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. Watergate has also come to encompass a political scandal that eventually caused the resignation of President Richard Nixon. Laying the blame for the scandal at Nixon’s door is one of the untruths that have become fact in the minds of most people. The DNC office was the target of a burglary for the purpose of planting eavesdropping devices on the phones of one or more of its inhabitants. This is not the whole truth. The burglary in progress that was disrupted by D.C. undercover police officers was only one task in a much larger plan approved by various White House officials and carried out by ex-CIA and Treasury Department agents and a small band of Cuban exiles.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:69:7d21dbb07b65", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4880, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 70, "text": "the minds of most people.

War. This might be considered the Wiki-Leaks of its time. The documents known as the Pentagon Papers were excerpts from the classified files of the Defense Dept. 46-volume report revealing outright lies and fabrications fed to the media and the American public regarding Vietnam. The country at the time was already a tinderbox of anti-war sentiments culminating in widespread college shutdowns and massive anti-war demonstrations. The very vocal protesters wanted an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam. From the President’s point of view, it was a very delicate time when the United States could reach an honorable peace as long as the Viet Cong and their allies were convinced that we would never pull out and allow South Vietnam to fall under Communist rule. The publication of the Pentagon Papers showed that the United States had been falsely promising a winning strategy in an unwinnable war. In answer to this internal leakage of classified documents to the New York Times, it was decided to put together a secret covert-ops team (the Plumbers, to stop the leaks; get it?) that could run independently of normal FBI, CIA, and Dept. of Defense channels. According to most accounts, to this end Charles Colson, special counsel to the President, called up CIA agent and fellow Brown alumnus E. Howard Hunt. This is another falsehood of my father’s, designed to give the impression that Colson recruited him. The truth is that my father called Colson many times prior to their first meeting in hopes that Colson would hire him for work in the White House. Hunt had just “retired” from the Agency and was employed as an advertising executive by the Robert R. Mullen Company. He supposedly jumped at the chance to continue serving his country in this very special capacity. This is yet another untruth fabricated by the CIA and Hunt to give the appearance that Hunt was a “free agent” without ties to CIA. After his signing on, a teammate was picked to work with Hunt. This was G. Gordon Liddy, ex-FBI and Treasury Dept., who had worked with Egil Krogh on narcotics matters. Krogh was an advisor in the White House and liaison to the FBI and the Bureau of There were also, according to Liddy in his book Will, a staff of professional killers for missions involving kidnapping, drugging and forcible deportation of anti-war leaders.

This group of killers could, according to Liddy, account for twenty-two deaths, including two hanged from a beam in a garage. Liddy claimed that this information was given him by E. Howard Hunt. The Cubans on this team, all connected to the infamous failed Bay of Pigs invasion, were trained by the CIA in various forms of murder, bomb-making, espionage, interrogation, covert entry, and production of false documents. In the course of time, I met and grew to know and admire some of these men. To me, they were friends and war comrades of my father’s, and I was impressed by their deep loyalty to each other. I didn’t know at the time that these were some of the same mercenaries that took part (according to my father) in the plot to kill John F. Kennedy. The Gemstone Plan was never fully approved but some aspects of it were, like the break-in at Watergate. All of these plans and diabolical schemes were triggered by the Pentagon Papers leaks … or were they? My Father went down to recruit his Cuban team for White House black ops in April of 1971. The first “Plumbers” operation was still three months away. It wasn’t until June 1971 that the New York Times started publishing the Pentagon Papers. How can it be that this was a White House-run op? It has always seemed strange that the Pentagon Papers were of such paranoid concern to Nixon. They referred to a time when Vietnam was a Kennedy-Johnson war, not a Nixon war. One of the first tasks given to my father was to find a means to discredit the man who had leaked the Papers to the Times. His name was Daniel Ellsberg. According to Ellsberg, he had been a top secret Defense Dept. analyst who felt a moral duty to report the truth about America’s involvement in Vietnam. In July 1971, my father sent a memo to Colson outlining the need to put together a psychological profile on Ellsberg: anything that could make him look bad, as well as obtaining his psychiatrist’s private files. Plans were made for my father to assemble his Cuban team for a break-in at Ellsberg’s psychiatrist’s office. Without going into further detail about this break-in, it is enough to say that this was just the beginning. By June 1972 my father was deeply involved in many illegal activities for the White House.

White House and reporting to them, he was secretly reporting all of his findings and activities to the CIA. With this revelation, some of the puzzle begins to make sense. His bogus retirement and employment at the Mullen Company was not the first time he had used this as a cover. According to Jim Hougan in Secret Agenda, Hunt also “retired” from the CIA in 1960. He was given fraudulent retirement papers during the Bay of Pigs. He “retired” again in 1965. This time the cover story was that my father had retired to write novels based on his years at CIA. It was feared that if the KGB studied my father’s books they would be able to glean bits of information about CIA operations. The truth was that the books were meant to give disinformation to the KGB. It’s somewhat comical to think that serious attention would be paid by the KGB to a “disgruntled” CIA agent, hoping to find important operational secrets in his pulpy spy novels! My father wrote five books in this series under the name David St. John. In 1970 when my Father “retired” again from the Agency, he was hired to work as a consultant to the Robert Mullen & Co. advertising agency, which turned out to be a “brass plate” CIA front operation. Now, when we come to understand that Hunt’s retirement from the Agency was only to give deniability in his latest CIA mission, that he was still working and reporting back to the Agency, that Mullen & Co. was a front, and that it was Hunt himself who pressed Charles Colson time after time to bring him into the White House, we can see that “Watergate” was a conspiracy within a conspiracy. It was the CIA placing their “mole” in the White House. Hunt’s repeated visits to CIA Headquarters to obtain false documents, speech-altering devices, wigs, and pocket litter for his work at the White House give credible support to this scenario. The break-in at Watergate that we all heard about was actually the third at those offices. The first two occurred in May, and had been unsuccessful in terms of retrieving anything of value for their sponsors. I’ll never forget that night in June when my father woke me out of a sound sleep.

When the Cubans and James McCord were caught with their hands in the cookie jar, one of the burglars had my father’s name in his phone book. Exposed and vulnerable, he didn’t know which way to turn for help. Should he expect help from the White House? Would the CIA give him cover? Not a chance. His CIA masters had covered their tracks well, and would not be coming to the rescue. The Nixon administration would conspire to keep its involvement secret, and pay off my father for his silence. It was this action, recorded by Nixon himself, which would cause the President of the United States to resign. One further piece of evidence regarding CIA involvement in Watergate: the supplier of the actual bugging devices used by McCord was a wireman named Michael Stevens. His company was Stevens Research Laboratories (SRL), headquartered in Chicago. According to Stevens, McCord came to see him in May to place orders for bugging equipment. According to a Mr. Robert Barcal of Electronic Specialty Devices, SRL was a supplier of sophisticated electronic eavesdropping devices for the CIA. He testified that he was shown documents from the CIA giving SRL authorization to manufacture such devices. For a more in-depth look at this, please refer to Jim Hougan’s book Secret Agenda. The importance of this became clear when my Mother’s plane crashed in Chicago in December of 1972. She was supposedly carrying money to invest with cousins who owned a hotel. After the plane crash and the headlines about Dorothy Hunt’s death and the money, Stevens called the FBI and told them his life had been threatened and he believed that Mrs. Hunt had been murdered. He said that Mrs. Hunt was in fact on her way to pay him money to maintain his silence. Silence about what? Stevens says that he supplied McCord with the bugging equipment in May 1972 because McCord claimed he was engaged in an operation for the CIA. Stevens reported to investigators that the devices that he was working on for Mc-Cord were set to transmit over secret CIA frequencies, and able to transmit to the highly classified CIA, DIA, and NSA networks. Keeping this secret was why Mrs. Hunt flew to Chicago. ow much of Howard Hunt’s scenario holds up under examination? Surprisingly, a great deal.

The men he names as part of the plot have cropped up over and over again in the assassination literature. There is substantial supporting evidence to implicate them in a plot to kill JFK. For this reason, Hunt’s revelations are more credible than they might otherwise be. A review of the literature indicates why this is so. Consider the following statements regarding Bill Harvey, made by author Anthony Summers in his seminal work, Conspiracy. Summers writes, “In the closing stages of the [House] Assassinations Committee mandate, some staff members felt that, while Mafia marksmen may have carried out the assassination, it could only have been orchestrated by someone in American intelligence, someone with special knowledge of Oswald’s background. As they pondered this, investigators gave renewed attention to the senior CIA officer who co-coordinated the CIA-Mafia plots against Castro – William Harvey.” Summers adds, “Yet Harvey was still meeting with Roselli, in the United States, as late as June 1963, and I have learned that he visited anti-Castro camps in Florida, at a time when he was theoretically already in Rome. According to new, unresearched information, initial approaches to hire assassins in Europe were made in Rome – sometime before the recruitment approaches allegedly made to the Corsican Mafia in Marseilles.” Summers quotes one Assassination Committee staffer as saying this: “The feeling of some of the CIA people we talked with was that Harvey was heavily involved with the organized crime figures. The feeling was that he was out of control and may have worked with organized crime figures to murder JFK. He behaved as if he was all-powerful … He may have been the key to accomplishing the assassination.” thor Bayard Stockton quotes Hardway as saying this of Harvey: “I had placed him in the middle of a web of intrigue. Harvey was central to everything that went on … Harvey was a natural suspect. He had the assassination teams. He was in charge of JM/WAVE [the CIA station in Miami]. I was convinced that Bill Harvey was involved in the assassination. I wanted to investigate Harvey vigorously … I was determined to prove his complicity in the assassination, if I could.” Bill Harvey had a history with the Corsican Mafia. In her book ZR Rifle, Claudia Furiati wrote, “It was learned that during 1961, William Harvey traveled to Marseille in France and recruited another agent (code name QJ/WIN) who worked on the Lumumba case. WIN appears in the House Committee investigations: he was one of the men from the Corse Union, the Marseille organized crime group, which showed the presence of the Mafia in the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:74:bf370e53d96e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4885, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 75, "text": "in the assassination, if I could.” Bill Harvey had a history with the Corsican Mafia.

WIN appears in the House Committee investigations: he was one of the men from the Corse Union, the Marseille organized crime group, which showed the presence of the Mafia in the plans to assassinate foreign leaders. QJ/ WIN met the indispensable requirement of being a Mafioso of non-U.S. origin.” Various versions of QJ/WIN’s identity have been published, but it is interesting to note his connection to Marseille and the Corsican Mafia. QJ/WIN was recruited by Harvey as a possible assassin or recruiter of assassins for the CIA, along with another mysterious figure code named WI/ROGUE. Both men were sent to the Congo to take part in a plot against Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba, who was indeed assassinated in January 1961, just before Kennedy took office. Harvey had an affinity for Corsicans, particularly for use in assassination operations. In Flawed Patriot, former CIA officer Bayard Stockton writes that Harvey recommended Corsicans for use in the ZR/RIFLE assassination program. “According to the one set of notes available, Harvey’s inquiries during his trip to Europe seemed to center on Trieste … ZR/RIFLE was intended to be carried out by non-American criminal elements.” In his memo, Harvey wrote, “Exclude organized criminals, e.g. Sicilians, criminals, those w/ record of arrests, those w/ instability of purpose as criminals.” But he added, “organization criminals, those with record of arrests, those who have engaged in several types of crime. Corsicans recommended. Sicilians could lead to Mafia.” Stockton also suggests that Harvey may have used his time in Rome to recruit European criminals for the JFK plot. “Once in Rome, Harvey might have contacted European criminals and/or the Union Corse [Corsican Mafia] , the Sicilian Mafia [with whom he had loose liaison], and the mainland Italian Camorra [Mafia], on behalf of Roselli. Thus, though it has not been proved, Harvey may have acted as a line of communication between European and American plotters.” He adds, “Harvey left behind a hint that he had some knowledge of the JFK killing. After he had testified to the U.S. Senate’s Church Committee in 1975, he commented, ‘They didn’t ask the right questions,’ implying that he might have had some answers to more pointed questions regarding the assassination.” “Corsicans recommended.” Harvey gave the same advice to Peter Wright, head of British intelligence, who wrote about this in his memoir Spy Catcher. Biographer Bayard Stockton, an old friend and colleague from Harvey’s days in Berlin in the 1950s, ultimately reached the conclusion that Harvey was not involved in the assassination, despite the overwhelming evidence against him. Stockton justifies his conclusion with this blanket statement: “No", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:75:2ea79ffd6d18", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4886, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 76, "text": "that he might have had some answers to more pointed questions regarding the assassination.” “Corsicans recommended.” Harvey gave the same advice to Peter Wright, head of British intelligence, who wrote about this in his memoir Spy Catcher.

Stockton justifies his conclusion with this blanket statement: “No one who knew Harvey at his prime believes, or believed that he possibly could have been involved in the JFK assassination. No one. Not even those who had reason to dislike him.” But that statement is false. Its validity flew out the window when E. Howard Hunt, who knew Harvey and worked with him in the CIA, asserted his strong belief that Harvey was the prime mover behind the assassination. Stockton, who died shortly after his book was published in 2006, could not have known that, even as he was writing those words, they were being contradicted by the words of E. Howard Hunt. In his memoir American Spy, posthumously published in 2007, E. Howard Hunt said this of Bill Harvey: “There has been suggestion in some circles that CIA agent Bill Harvey had something to do with the murder and had recruited several Corsicans, including a crack shot named Lucien Sarti, to back up Oswald and make sure the hit was successful. Supposedly, Sarti was dressed in a Dallas police uniform and fired the fatal bullet from the grassy knoll behind the picket fence … Is it possible that Bill Harvey might have recruited a Mafia criminal to administer the magic bullet? I think it’s possible … Harvey could definitely be a person of interest, as he was a strange character hiding a mass of hidden aggression. Allegations have been made that he transported weapons to Dallas. Certainly it is an area that deserves further investigation.” Hunt goes on to say of Harvey’s role in the plot, “If that’s the case, Harvey had seniority and would have been the person in charge, with the others taking orders from him … Having been stationed in Rome, he very well might have come into contact with the Corsican Mafia and heroin traffickers whom theorists claim he recruited for the assassination … Harvey, however, is the most likely suspect. If he felt his position was in jeopardy, he was the type of person who would have taken drastic action to remedy the situation. It is a big leap, because he was a brain-addled pistol-toting drunk … but there is the slightest possibility that Harvey and LBJ could have formed some kind of thieves’ pact between them.” Hunt adds, “If LBJ had anything to do with the operation, he would have used Harvey, because he was available and corrupt … Who knows the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:76:d10423833fdd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4887, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 77, "text": "his position was in jeopardy, he was the type of person who would have taken drastic action to remedy the situation.

He may easily have known Mafia members who have been named as possible conspirators, such as Johnny Roselli, Santos Trafficante, Sam Giancana, and Carlos Marcello … These are names which have come up in connection with the assassination plot on Castro.” 2005, along with his son St. John. Hunt also mentioned another suspicious CIA figure, David Morales, in connection with Bill Harvey: “Another CIA person of interest who has been linked to that dreadful day is David Morales. Bill Harvey posted Morales to the CIA’s Miami station in 1961, where he became chief of Covert Operations for JM/WAVE, an operation to destabilize Castro after the Bay of Pigs. Morales and Harvey could have been manufactured from the same cloth – both were hard-drinking, tough guys, possibly completely amoral. Morales was rumored to be a cold-blooded killer, the go-to guy in black ops situations where the government needed to have someone neutralized. I tried to cut short any contact with him, as he wore thin very quickly.” Clearly, Bill Harvey is a highly suspicious figure in any scenario. But could Harvey have done all this on his own? When I met with Fabian Escalante, former head of Cuban intelligence, in Havana in 1994, he expressed skepticism. “Harvey had to have a patron,” he said, “and that patron was Richard Helms.” Helms was the CIA’s Deputy Director for Plans (head of its covert operations division) in 1963, and later became Director of the CIA under President Johnson. Helms was close to Harvey, and also to Howard Hunt. But Helms was a very discreet figure who kept his hands clean. In ZR Rifle, Claudia Furiati describes Helms this way: “And who was the author of the entire scheme? Richard Helms, the brain of the CIA. Helms was the ultimate chief of the covert and parallel operations from the beginning of Operation Mongoose [the CIA’s plot to kill Castro]. He was the director of the plans which included the [poison] capsules, the special missions, the terrorist commandos, the Mafia, the Banister unit, Pontchartrain, William Harvey, Manuel Artime, Rolando Cubela, Desmond Fitzgerald, Lee Harvey Oswald, Santos Trafficante, David Atlee Phillips, and ZR Rifle. He was the conductor of the invisible government and the maestro of plausible denial. Finally, he was the link of the Agency with the ‘hardliners’ and the mentor of the provocations during the Kennedy administration.

But Helms’ involvement was not apparent; he was behind four walls, an invisible man.” Furiati, writing before Helms’ death in 2002, described him this way: “Currently he is a business consultant. He is tall, with fine black thinning hair. He is discreet and evasive; the perfect bureaucrat. He is considered the most astute and the coldest of all the directors of the Agency – so cold that he was nicknamed “Mr. Cool.” Mr. Cool – an invisible man, hidden behind four walls. What an apt description of Richard Helms. Howard Hunt, in American Spy, put it this way: “But in the end, Helms was an expert in CYA (cover your ass), not CIA. When the time came when he might have been able to help me and come to my defense, Dick said, ‘Oh, Hunt … Oh, well, I sort of know him. He was a romantic.’ And that was all he had to say about me. He pretended that he barely knew me when in fact he had known me for years.” Hunt related to me a very interesting anecdote about Helms and LBJ, which he included in his book. He wrote, “During the course of a year, we would have lunch between three and six times. In fact, Helms had made a confidant out of me, once calling me at the office to say, ‘Meet me downstairs right away. I have something to tell you.’ What he had to tell me was that he had broken up with his wife and had moved to a country club in anticipation of a divorce. This was, at the time, extremely privileged information. We had lunch about six weeks later. Helms told me that he had just been summoned down to LBJ’s ranch and had spent a wild weekend there riding a jeep at top speed through the property. Out of that emerged the confidence that he was going to be announced as the deputy director of the CIA, which, of course, evolved over time to DCI [Director of Central Intelligence, to which he was appointed by Johnson]. So far as I know, I was the first person he told about such important events in his life.” But why did LBJ summon Helms to his ranch, when he could have easily informed him of this in Washington.

Could it be that at this meeting, LBJ flashed a green light to Helms for a plot against JFK, in the privacy of his own Texas ranch? This can only be speculation, but it is clear that Helms had a good and close relationship with LBJ. This meeting had to have taken place in late 1961 or early 1962, as Helms was appointed Deputy Director in February of 1962. And as Hunt points out in his book, “LBJ appointed him as director, but he wouldn’t play ball with Nixon or comply with Nixon’s requests to investigate White House leaks, so the president [Nixon] basically fired him, sending him to Iran during Watergate.” In his own posthumous memoir, A Look over My Shoulder, Richard Helms wrote this of his relationship with Johnson and Nixon: “I was never sure why President Nixon distrusted me, aside from associating me with Allen Dulles and the other East Coast, Ivy League, establishment figures whom he loathed and thought of as dominating the upper brackets of OSS and subsequently CIA. In contrast, I always had an excellent relationship with Lyndon Johnson, who had at least as much claim as Nixon to have been born in a log cabin, and whose views of Ivy Leaguers were, at the best, reserved.” Obviously, Helms and Johnson were close. Likewise, Helms and Hunt were close for many years. Hunt never claimed that he himself had any direct contacts with LBJ. So if Hunt believed that LBJ was involved in the plot to assassinate JFK, which he clearly did, his impression probably came via Richard Helms, the missing link between LBJ and Howard Hunt. Helms was also the missing link between LBJ and Bill Harvey. And what of Richard Nixon? In his interviews with me, Howard Hunt was adamant that Nixon had no role in the JFK assassination. Hunt wrote in American Spy, “As far as I’m concerned, as paranoid as he was, Nixon would never have been involved. He would not only have been horrified of the action but would never have trusted anyone to know he was involved.” Hunt seemed to me to be sincere in this belief, although he did not say the same of Lyndon Johnson. On the famous “smoking gun” Watergate tape of June 23, 1972, Richard Nixon said this to his top aide H.R. Haldeman: “When you get in there with Helms, say, Look the problem here is that this will open the whole Bay of Pigs thing … It would", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:79:08078edca81f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4890, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 80, "text": "the action but would never have trusted anyone to know he was involved.” Hunt seemed to me to be sincere in this belief, although he did not say the same of Lyndon Johnson. On the famous “smoking gun” Watergate tape of June 23, 1972, Richard Nixon said this to his top aide H.R. Haldeman: “When you get in there with Helms, say, Look the problem here is that this will open the whole Bay of Pigs thing … It would be very bad to have this fellow [E. Howard] Hunt, he knows too damned much…. It would make the CIA look bad, and it’s likely to blow the whole Bay of Pigs thing, which we think would be most unfortunate – both for the CIA and for the country.” H.R. Haldeman, in his memoir The Ends of Power, offered his interpretation of this statement. He wrote, “It seems that in all of those Nixon references to the Bay of Pigs, he was actually referring to the Kennedy assassination … After Kennedy was killed, the CIA launched a fantastic cover-up … In a chilling parallel to their cover-up at Watergate, the CIA literally erased any connection between Kennedy’s assassination and the CIA … And when Nixon said, ‘It’s likely to blow the whole Bay of Pigs thing’, he might have been reminding [CIA Director] Helms, not so gently, of the cover-up of the CIA assassination attempts on the hero of the Bay of Pigs, Fidel Castro – a CIA operation that may have triggered the Kennedy tragedy and which Helms desperately wanted to hide.” This is highly suggestive, to say the least. Haldeman in his memoir also quoted former Senator Howard Baker, a member of the Senate Watergate Committee, as saying, “Helms and Nixon have so much on each other that neither one of them can breathe.” Perhaps Helms was blackmailing Nixon with his knowledge that Tricky Dick had originated the assassination plots against Castro (with the help of E. Howard Hunt), plots that may have morphed into a plot against JFK. And Nixon might have been blackmailing Helms with his knowledge of the CIA’s role in the JFK plot. In any case, Nixon found it expedient to get rid of Helms at the height of Watergate, removing him from the directorship of the CIA and dispatching him far away as U.S. ambassador to Iran. It is still an open question as to what Nixon meant when he said on the tapes, “This fellow Hunt, he knows too much.” It is also unclear what Nixon was referring to when he said, “We protected Helms from one hell of a lot of things.” In his own memoir, RN, Nixon wrote that he was never able to get the CIA’s complete file on the Bay of Pigs, despite repeated requests to Helms. Nixon compared the CIA to a locked safe, to which he", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:80:018e7b33d9be", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4891, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 81, "text": "as to what Nixon meant when he said on the tapes, “This fellow Hunt, he knows too much.” It is also unclear what Nixon was referring to when he said, “We protected Helms from one hell of a lot of things.” In his own memoir, RN, Nixon wrote that he was never able to get the CIA’s complete file on the Bay of Pigs, despite repeated requests to Helms. Nixon compared the CIA to a locked safe, to which he could never get the combination. This might have been an additional factor in his decision to remove Richard Helms as DCI. Could LBJ have flashed a “green light” to Richard Helms during their private trip to the ranch? The idea is not unprecedented. Historian Arthur Schlesinger has suggested, in his book Robert Kennedy and His Times, that then-Vice President Richard Nixon may have given a similar signal with regard to the assassination plots against Fidel Castro as far back as 1960. Schlesinger wrote, “Yet the [assassination] plan was an integral part of the invasion plan. And it is hard to suppose that even the runaway agency mordantly portrayed in the reports of the President’s Board of Consultants would have decided entirely on its own to kill the chief of a neighboring country. [CIA Director] Dulles must have glimpsed a green light somewhere. Could it have been flashed by the Vice President of the United States? ‘I have been,’ Richard Nixon said in 1964 of the invasion project, ‘the strongest and most persistent advocate for setting up and supporting such a program.’” Similarly, presidential historian Michael Beschloss wrote in his book The Crisis Years, “We will probably never know for certain whether Vice President Nixon flashed the green light for a CIA-Mafia attempt against Castro. But it is hard to believe that as President he would have made such a heavy-handed demand of Ehrlichman merely to retrieve evidence of his support for invading Cuba in 1960 … The demand makes more sense if Nixon was worried about public embarrassment by information showing his involvement in a murder plot against a foreign leader. This concern may have led to Watergate.” These are two highly reputable historians both suggesting that Nixon may have given a “green light” to assassination plots against Castro. Granted, Nixon was not Johnson, and Castro was not JFK. But the same principle applies. And if we assume that there is a straight line connecting the CIA-Mafia plots against Castro to the plot against JFK, then surely there is a similarity in the modus operandi of the two plots. Nixon would naturally not want his connection to the plot exposed, yet his tacit approval may have been necessary for the plot to go forward. Likewise, LBJ’s flash of a green light to Helms may have provided him with all the authority necessary to go forward with the plot against JFK.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:81:035900619091", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4892, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 82, "text": "is a straight line connecting the CIA-Mafia plots against Castro to the plot against JFK, then surely there is a similarity in the modus operandi of the two plots.

Likewise, LBJ’s flash of a green light to Helms may have provided him with all the authority necessary to go forward with the plot against JFK. In both cases, we have means, motive and opportunity, but we do not have definitive proof. And such proof may be impossible to find, given the extreme secrecy and sensitivity of these operations. We can only speculate, and wonder. But E. Howard Hunt clearly believed that LBJ was part of the plot. In American Spy, Hunt wrote this: “Lyndon Johnson was an opportunist who would not have hesitated to get rid of any obstacles in his way. He could easily have been in touch with [Bill] Harvey or [David] Phillips … Phillips was a man on the way up and became a significant figure that LBJ would have wanted to get to know … In Washington there is a caste system in regard to who will talk to whom. Would LBJ have spoken directly to Harvey? Yes, I think he could have done that, as Harvey’s rank and position was such that a vice president could talk to him. Harvey may have had an intense personal dislike for the Kennedys and even had a severe clash with Bobby Kennedy around the time of the missile crisis.” Hunt went on to add, “The person who had the most to gain from Kennedy’s assassination was LBJ. There was nobody with the leverage that LBJ had, no competitor at all. He was the vice president, and if he wanted to get rid of the president, he had the ability to do so by corrupting different people in the CIA. It has also been said by many LBJ biographers, such as Robert Caro in The Path to Power, that the man idolized money, was corrupt and unprincipled, with unlimited ambition – not the type of individual who was content to end his career as vice president … Many people conjecture that Johnson was set to drop even lower in footnote status, observing that he was set to be cut from the 1964 presidential ticket. He and Kennedy did not get along, and theirs was purely a marriage of convenience Hunt concluded that, “Having Kennedy liquidated, thus elevating himself to the presidency without having to work for it himself, could have been a very tempting and logical move on Johnson’s part. It wouldn’t have been hard for him to make contact with Harvey, another ruthless man who was not satisfied with his position in the CIA and its government salary.

It wouldn’t have been hard for him to make contact with Harvey, another ruthless man who was not satisfied with his position in the CIA and its government salary. He definitely had dreams of becoming DCI, and LBJ could do that for him if he were president. If LBJ had anything to do with the operation, he would have used Harvey, because he was available and corrupt. LBJ had the money and the connections to manipulate the scenario in Dallas and is on record as having convinced JFK to make the appearance in the first place.” Of course, we know that LBJ did not make Harvey the DCI [head of the CIA], but rather put Richard Helms into this position – perhaps another indication that Helms was a key figure in the plot. And what do we know about Lucien Sarti, the French Corsican Mafia gunman named by Howard Hunt as the second shooter on the grassy knoll? In a sidebar to the Rolling Stone article entitled “The Last Confession of E. Howard Hunt,” writer Rob Sheffield wrote, “A Corsican drug trafficker, Sarti was killed by police in 1972. Conveniently, nothing concrete is known about him.” But this is not true. In his book The Great Heroin Coup, published in 1980 before Sarti’s name was connected with the JFK assassination, Heinrik Kruger detailed aspects of Sarti’s criminal career. In his preface to the book, noted JFK researcher Peter Dale Scott states, “… as support for his argument that the traffic once dominated by Ricord was simply redirected to Cuban exiles in touch with the CIA and with Santos Trafficante, Kruger points to the extraordinary story of Alberto Sicilia Falcon. Somehow Sicilia, a twenty-nine year-old Cuban exile from Miami, was able to emerge as the ringleader of the so-called ‘Mexican connection’ which promptly filled the vacuum created by the destruction of the Ricord network in 1972. Lucien Sarti, a top Ricord lieutenant, was shot and killed by authorities in Mexico on 27 April 1972, after being located there by U.S. agents.” This latter fact is quite interesting. Eliminating international drug traffickers was one of the missions of the White House plumbers unit, of which Hunt was a member, and Sarti’s murder occurred just before the Watergate break-in in June 1972. Is this a link between the JFK assassination and Watergate – or is it just another coincidence? Speaking further of the Ricord drug organization in France, Kruger writes this: “The Ricord organization was divided into four teams … Ricord himself ran the main team from Asuncion, Paraguay, and oversaw the entire operation. Chiappe and Michel", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:83:01446835998d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4894, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 84, "text": "missions of the White House plumbers unit, of which Hunt was a member, and Sarti’s murder occurred just before the Watergate break-in in June 1972.

Chiappe and Michel Nicoli led another team, Dominique Orsini and Louis Bonsignour a third, and Andre Condemine and Lucien Sarti a fourth…. It was Murder Incorporated in French. Nearly all had been sentenced to death in France.” It is interesting to note the inclusion of the name Michel Nicoli, who later became one of those who identified Lucien Sarti as the shooter of JFK, while Nicoli was in the federal witness protection program in the US. Kruger refers again to Sarti in his book, saying, “In 1966 Old Man Ricord enlarged his already immense narcotics network upon discovering how easily he could smuggle heroin into the US via Latin America … The old man surrounded himself with hardcore thugs. By 1970 the Mob’s leaders were Ricord, sentenced to death in absentia for treason, torture and murder; Lucien Sarti, wanted for the murder of a Belgian policeman; Christian David, sentenced to death in absentia … and French gangster and former SAC agent, Michel Nicoli.” Nicoli and Christian David, of course, were later the two French criminals who independently identified Lucien Sarti as the assassin of JFK, in separate confessions to author and investigator Steve Rivele. Paraguay taught Christian David and Lucien Sarti that it was time to move on. Their choice of location was Brazil, in particular Ilha Bella, an island off the coast north of Santos, conveniently only two hours from Sao Paulo and five from Rio de Janeiro. It also provided a small harbor and landing strip. The two holed up in the Bordelao, a small hotel run by Haide Arantez and Claudio Rodriguez, friends of Sarti’s Brazilian mistress, Helena Ferreira. Beau Serge [Christian David] was by then the undisputed boss of the ‘Brazilian Connection.’ Its other leaders were Sarti, Michel Nicoli and several others.” Kruger describes the event’s leading to Sarti’s death. “In March Sarti went to Mexico City, where he was joined by his wife Liliane in an attractive residential district apartment. Sarti had no notion that the police had been trailing him ever since his entry into Mexico. Somebody had tipped them off … In the evening of April 17, Sarti and Liliane left their hideout to go to the movies. Before they got to their car, they were surrounded by the police. Sarti was unarmed, but the police shot and killed him, and arrested Liliane.” In their book, Marseille Mafia, Pierre Galante and Louis Sapin provide further background", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:84:50444bfa1e82", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4895, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 85, "text": "district apartment.

Sarti was unarmed, but the police shot and killed him, and arrested Liliane.” In their book, Marseille Mafia, Pierre Galante and Louis Sapin provide further background on Sarti’s criminal career. In 1961, Lucien Sarti was involved in the murder of a Belgian police constable named Albert de Leener. The officer was ambushed by a group of French criminals, one of whom was Sarti. De Leener was shot and killed, and his body dumped into the trunk of a car. “The body was lifted up; the boot of the car opened. During the operation, a small piece of cardboard fell from the pocket of the man who had fired the final shot. The investigators found it on the pavement, a little later. It was a fake identity card bearing the name Lucien Sabatier. The photo was of a known French criminal, aged about thirty, who had a record under that name at the Quai des Orvefres. He was called Lucien Sarti. “The following evening, arriving in Paris, Lucien Sarti read the papers and learned that he had been identified … He was now a hunted man. There was only one thing for him to do: go to South America.” His trail from there led him to Mexico, and from there on to Dallas, according to the findings of author Steve Rivele. In 1985, Rivele became interested in the Kennedy assassination and in particular the French connection. Rivele was a successful author who later became a prominent screenwriter in Hollywood. Rivele’s research led him to a man named Christian David, who had been a prominent member of the French connection, and a leader of the Corsican Mafia. He was then serving time in Leavenworth Penitentiary. Rivele helped David find an attorney, and in return was told a remarkable story by David. As recounted in the book Conspiracy, by Anthony Summers, “In May or June 1963, according to David, he was asked by Antoine Guerini, the Corsican Mafia boss in Marseille, to accept a contract to kill ‘a highly placed American politician.’ Guerini made it obvious whom he meant, calling the politician ‘le plus grosse legume’ – the biggest vegetable. The President was to be killed on US territory. David turned down the contract, on the ground that it was too dangerous. “The contract, said David, was accepted by Lucien Sarti, a Corsican drug trafficker and killer, and two other members of the Marseille mob, whom he refused to name. They were, he said, ‘specialists de tir’ – ‘sharpshooters.’ He learned what happened some time after the assassination, at", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:85:1ae17e8f780b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4896, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 86, "text": "calling the politician ‘le plus grosse legume’ – the biggest vegetable.

They were, he said, ‘specialists de tir’ – ‘sharpshooters.’ He learned what happened some time after the assassination, at a 1965 meeting in Buenos Aires. Present were Sarti, Michel Nicoli, [Christian] David and two others. This is how the assassination was carried out, as David tells it.” Rivele described the scenario, which he learned independently from both Christian David and Michel Nicoli, to British journalist Anthony Summers. In Conspiracy, Summers writes, “Sarti and the two other assassins flew from Marseilles to Mexico City in the fall of 1963. They stayed there several weeks, and were then driven to the United States border, which they crossed at Brownsville, Texas. They were met at the border by a representative of the Chicago Mafia, who conversed with them in Italian. [Could this have been Johnny Roselli?] He drove them to a house in Dallas.” Summers goes on to add, “On November 22, David told Rivele, three gunmen were in position. Two were in buildings to the rear of the President when he was hit – one of them ‘almost on the horizontal.’ The third killer, Sarti, dressed in some sort of uniform as a disguise, was ‘on the little hill to the front, the one with the fence.’ Four shots were fired that day, according to Sarti and another of the assassins. The first shot, from the rear, struck President Kennedy in the back. The second shot missed, and hit ‘the other man in the car’ [Governor John Connally]. The third shot, from Sarti on the hill, struck the President in the head, killing him. Sarti used ‘an explosive bullet,’ the only member of the group to use that type of ammunition. The fourth shot missed the car entirely.” This scenario is remarkable in that its details fit so well with evidence developed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations and other sources. But there is more. “After the assassination, according to David’s allegations, the murderers lay low in Dallas for about two weeks. Then, says David – ‘they were then flown out of the country by private aircraft, to Montreal.’” This is the story of the assassination, as relayed from Christian David to Steve Rivele to Anthony Summers. When Rivele asked David who could confirm his story, he named Michel Nicoli, a fellow Corsican gangster who was then in the U.S. federal witness protection program as a result of his 1972 testimony against the mob. A DEA official who knew him vouched for his credibility in strong terms. Eventually, Nicoli was", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:86:b6dbcaa3d3d4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4897, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 87, "text": "out of the country by private aircraft, to Montreal.’” This is the story of the assassination, as relayed from Christian David to Steve Rivele to Anthony Summers.

Eventually, Nicoli was located, and he told Rivele the same story that David had told, although the two men had not seen each other for years. The FBI did nothing to follow up on this remarkable development. Cord Meyer was born in 1920 and graduated from Yale in 1942. He joined the US Marines and served in the South Pacific, losing an eye in combat. In 1945, he married Mary Pinchot, who would later have an affair with President Kennedy. In 1947, he was elected president of the United World Federalist, and was a strong left-wing advocate of world government and the United Nations. However, by 1949, Meyer had joined the CIA at the urging of Allen Dulles and worked closely with James Angleton, among others. Meyer’s views gradually moved from left to right, and he became a strong anti-Communist, as well as a heavy drinker. In 1958, he was divorced from Mary Meyer, who was a free-spirited artist. In 1961, Mary began an affair with President Kennedy, which lasted until his death (she had known him as far back as prep school in the 1930s). In 1964, Mary was murdered mysteriously during an evening stroll on the banks of the towpath in Georgetown. Officially, the murder was never solved, although rumors had it that the CIA might have been involved. Shortly after her death, James Angleton of the CIA broke into her studio and retrieved her personal diary, the contents of which have never been revealed. Cord Meyer left the CIA in 1977, and died in 2001. In my conversations with Howard Hunt, it was clear that he was fascinated by both Cord and Mary Meyer, in particular her mysterious death, just after the release of the Warren Commission report. This was also evident in his memoir, American Spy. Among other things, Hunt wrote, “Another name that pops up in JFK conspiracy theories is Cord Meyer. He was a high level CIA operative whose wife, journalist Mary Pinchot, was having an affair with John F Kennedy … By the time of the assassination, Cord had been promoted to chief of the CIA’s International Organizations Division … The theorists suggest Cord would have had a motive to kill Kennedy because his wife was having an affair with the President….

By that time, she and Cord had divorced, and the media did not realize that her former husband was a high-ranking CIA official. Neither did they find out about her relationship with the President …” Hunt went on to describe the suspicious circumstances behind Mary Meyer’s death. “Mary had cautioned at least one close friend to grab her diary if anything ever happened to her. Journalist, later editor of the Washington Post, and Kennedy friend Ben Bradlee happened to be married to Mary’s sister, Antoinette, who found the letter and diaries shortly after the death. But there is an interesting fact here. When the Bradlees arrived at Mary’s house shortly after the murder, they found James Angleton already there, rummaging around the house, looking for the diary and letters … Bradlee has said that the door was locked when he arrived. So does that mean Angleton broke in?” It was clear to me from my conversations with Hunt years later that he was bitter about the fact that Angleton had broken in and gotten away Scot free, whereas Hunt himself had served 33 months in prison for a similar break-in. Hunt’s theory of the break-in went like this: “When Antoinette eventually found the diary, she turned it over to Angleton, who later admitted that the book detailed the affair, talking specifically about how Mary and Kennedy would drop LSD before making love. Mary apparently thought that JFK’s murder had taken place because the industrial-military complex couldn’t allow his mind to be expanded by the drug. The fact that Angleton was already there in the house when Bradlee got there is mysterious, as so little time had gone by since the murder.” Bear in mind that Angleton was a very high official of the CIA, unlikely to personally take part in a “black bag job” except in the most extreme circumstances. This would be roughly equivalent to J. Edgar Hoover personally breaking into a building on behalf of the FBI. Hunt concluded his analysis with these suggestive comments: “Journalist Leo Damore wrote in the New York Post that a CIA source told him that Mary’s death was probably a professional hit because ‘She had access to the highest levels. She was involved in illegal drug activity.’ What do you think it would do to the beatification of Kennedy if this woman said, ‘It wasn’t Camelot – it was Caligula’s court?’ So I think it was probably a professional", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:88:9e12c42add64", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4899, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 89, "text": "the FBI.

Renowned historian John H. Davis, author of several books on the Kennedys and the assassination, himself a cousin of Jacquelyn Bouvier Kennedy, wrote an unpublished manuscript in 1998 entitled “John F. Kennedy and Mary Pinchot Meyer: A Tale of Two Murdered Lovers.” Wrote Davis, “When, in early October, 1964 Mary Meyer first read the Warren Report on the assassination of President Kennedy she immediately recognized it as a cover-up. Among its many omissions Mary noted there was no mention in the Report of the CIA-Mafia plots to assassinate Castro.” She told a friend that the document was full of lies and that ‘they had covered up everything.’” Davis added, “We may picture this slim blonde woman of 44 in her small coach house studio in Georgetown … leafing through this report on the murder of a man she had seen regularly during the last 20 months of his life, then tossing the book aside in disgust … and phoning up a few of her closest friends to tell them she thought the Report was worthless, that it was full of glaring omissions and was essentially a ‘pack of lies.’… If it became known among those who perpetrated the cover-up that some woman who had been close to President Kennedy was going around blabbing her mouth off about some of the most sensitive, and potentially explosive, omissions in the Report, that person was taking an enormous risk.” Davis concludes: “It was a tribute to the perspicacity of Mary Meyer to recognize at first reading what almost no one recognized at the time: that the Warren Commission’s investigation of the JFK assassination was deeply flawed and that the official finding was essentially a fraudulent cover-up… We must inevitably conclude that Mary Meyer’s rejection of the Warren Commission’s conclusions when an entire nation was accepting them indicated that she knew things that very few people knew and that for that reason told Anne Truitt she feared for her safety and told her that if anything happened to her she should consign her diary to the CIA’s James Jesus Angleton. The burning question, then, is what did Mary know? And the only answer we can give is that she knew too much.” In the book The Georgetown Ladies’ Social Club, by C.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt:89:21e33e6af4d6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4900, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bond-Secrecy-Watergate-Conspirator-Howard/dp/1936296837", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BoS0005Amazon_cleaned", "chunk_index": 90, "text": "entire nation was accepting them indicated that she knew things that very few people knew and that for that reason told Anne Truitt she feared for her safety and told her that if anything happened to her she should consign her diary to the CIA’s James Jesus Angleton. The burning question, then, is what did Mary know? And the only answer we can give is that she knew too much.” In the book The Georgetown Ladies’ Social Club, by C. David Heymann, Leo Damore was quoted as saying this: “Mary Meyer was killed by a well-trained professional hit man, very likely somebody connected to the CIA. After the assassination of John Kennedy, Mary had become an inconvenient woman, the former mistress of one of the world’s most powerful political leaders and the ex-wife of a CIA honcho. The feeling in the Agency was that here’s somebody who knows too much for her own good. She knows where all the bodies are buried. She knows the Warren Commission report, released shortly before her death, is nothing but a grandiose cover-up. She knows about the Mafia, the Cubans and the Agency, and how any one of them could have conspired to eliminate Kennedy. What she didn’t know, according to Damore, is that a month after the President’s murder, the Agency placed her under twenty-four hour surveillance, tapping her phone, wiring her house, intercepting her mail, and initiating several break-ins in search of notes and letters to and from JFK and others of equal interest.” Interviewed by author David Heymann shortly before his death in 2001, Cord Meyer was asked about the death of his wife Mary. “It was a bad time,” he said. “And what could he say about Mary Meyer? Who had committed such a heinous crime?” His answer to Heymann was revealing. “‘The same sons of bitches,’ he hissed, ‘that killed John F. Kennedy.’” worked with Hunt on the CIA coup in Guatemala as far back as 1954. He also collaborated with Hunt on the plans for the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. The two men were close friends and collaborators over many years in the CIA. Author Gaeton Fonzi, who investigated Phillips in depth for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, came to some firm conclusions about David Phillips, who had allegedly met with co-conspirator Antonio Veciana, a Cuban exile leader, under the pseudonym Maurice Bishop, in the summer of 1963 in Dallas in the presence of Lee Harvey Oswald. The ostensible purpose was to put Oswald, who was about to travel to Mexico, in touch with Veciana’s cousin Guillermo Ruiz, who worked in the Cuban embassy in Mexico City. In his book The Last Investigation, Gaeton Fonzi wrote this: “’Maurice Bishop’ was David Atlee Phillips.

I state that unequivocally … In addition to the abundance of evidence detailed in this book, which unerringly points to Phillips being Bishop, believe me, I know that he was. And Bob Blakey [staff director of the committee] and the House Select Committee knew that he was, although its report did not admit that.” Fonzi continues, “That Phillips rose to the top echelon of the Agency as Chief of the Western Hemisphere division is, I think, significant when we talk about ‘elements’ of the CIA being involved in the Kennedy assassination. (Can those who control the ideological soul and operational body of the Agency be considered simply ‘elements’ within it?)” It should be noted, though, that Richard Helms admitted he kept CIA Director John McCone in the dark about all assassination activities, so the plot probably did not go to the very top of the CIA hierarchy. Gaeton Fonzi went on to add, “Nor is Phillips’ tight working association with the Agency’s most lethal operatives insignificant. His was a cabal of associates whose careers were entwined with the history of CIA assassination plots, that ranged from Richard Helms to E. Howard Hunt and from Ted Shackley to the Agency’s Mob liaison William Harvey. And then, of course, there was David Phillips’ faithful operative, the CIA’s action legend, David Sanchez Morales, whose inebriated admission of involvement in the Kennedy assassination – ‘We took care of that son of a bitch, didn’t we?’ – closed the circle.” Fonzi concludes, “I believe that David Atlee Phillips’ key role was affirmed when he lied under oath. The very fact that he had to lie – both about his manipulation of Oswald in Mexico City and his covert operations as Maurice Bishop – was the definitive statement of his guilt.” Significantly, Hunt admitted that Phillips had met with Oswald in Mexico City shortly before the assassination (presumably to frame him as a Cuban sympathizer), as well as in Dallas before his Mexico trip. It has also been reported by author Tad Szulc, in Compulsive Spy, that Howard Hunt was in Mexico City at the very time Oswald was visiting there. This raises the possibility that both Phillips and Hunt may have met with Oswald there. How else would Hunt know of the meeting with Phillips? In his interviews with me, Hunt did not deny that he was there at the same time as Oswald, but said he would have to check his CIA records. What of Antonio Veciana?

In his interviews with me, Hunt did not deny that he was there at the same time as Oswald, but said he would have to check his CIA records. What of Antonio Veciana? He was a Cuban exile, leader of the militant anti-Castro group Alpha 66, and apparently met with Lee Harvey Oswald and David Phillips prior to the assassination. In E. Howard Hunt’s handwritten memo given to his son St. John prior to his death, Hunt wrote this: “1962 - LBJ recruits Cord Meyer. 1963 – Cord Meyer discusses a plot with Phillips, who brings in William Harvey and Antonio Veciana. He [Phillips] meets with Oswald in Mexico City that summer. Veciana meets with Frank Sturgis in Miami and enlists David British author Anthony Summers, in Conspiracy, said this about Veciana: “Antonio Veciana was the victim of a murder attempt in late 1979 –an ambush while he was on his way home from work. Four shots were fired, and a fragment of one bullet lodged in Veciana’s head. He recovered – in what police and doctors consider a freak escape. Publicly the veteran anti-Castro fighter has blamed the attack on Castro agents, but privately he has also expressed concern that it may have been linked to his allegations about CIA case officer ‘Maurice Bishop’, who – says Veciana –met Oswald shortly before the Kennedy assassination and later urged the fabrication of a false story about Oswald and Cuban diplomats in Mexico City.” Veciana, who later took part in a failed assassination attempt with David Phillips in 1971 against Fidel Castro in Chile, is clearly a very suspicious character. He is also the only one of the plotters named by Hunt who is still living. In a recent interview, Veciana told David Talbot, author of Brothers, that he believed the CIA was involved in Kennedy’s murder. Predictably, Veciana denied that he himself had any part in the plot. Another key figure in the plot was David Morales. In his handwritten memo, Howard Hunt wrote, “In Miami, Sturgis tells Hunt that he’s buying guns for some friends (who could be Mafia or Cuban activists). Sturgis brings Morales to a meeting he has with NADA [Howard Hunt] where the ‘Big Event’ is referred to. After Morales leaves, Sturgis says ‘Are you with us?’ Hunt replies that he can’t make a decision without knowing what the ‘Big Event’ is. When Sturgis says killing JFK, NADA [Hunt] is incredulous.

NADA [Hunt] says he won’t get involved in anything involving Bill Harvey, who is an alcoholic psycho. That ends Second, it is evident that Morales had direct dealings with Veciana, David Phillips, Frank Sturgis, Howard Hunt, and possibly Cord Meyer as well. Morales had worked with Hunt and Phillips in the CIA coup in Guatemala as far back as 1954, as well as in the Bay of Pigs operation and the plots against Castro in the early 1960s. Morales was known as a stone killer and a field operative who was not afraid to get blood on his hands. He was reported to have been in the presidential palace in Chile when President Salvador Allende was assassinated in 1973, and also took part in the CIA Phoenix assassination program in Vietnam. In Fonzi’s book, he describes an incident that took place during a late night drinking bout with Morales and a friend named Bob Walton. “At the mention of Kennedy’s name, he recalls, Morales literally almost hit the ceiling. He flew off the bed on that one,” says Walton… He jumped up screaming, “That no good son of a bitch motherfucker! He started yelling about what a wimp Kennedy was and talking about how he had worked on the Bay of Pigs and how he had to watch all the men he had recruited and trained get wiped out because of Kennedy.” “Walton says Morales’ tirade about Kennedy, fueled by righteous anger and high-proof booze went on for several minutes while he stomped around the room. Suddenly he stopped, sat back down on the bed and remained silent for a moment. Then, as if saying it only to himself, he added: ‘Well, we took care of that son of a bitch, didn’t we?’” Sturgis was associated with Howard Hunt for many years, starting with a novel Hunt wrote in 1949 called Bimini Run, which featured a soldier of fortune named “Hank” Sturgis. (Hunt later maintained that this was just a coincidence.) Sturgis worked closely with Hunt during the Bay of Pigs period, and of course was later arrested with him over the Watergate break-in during 1972. Hunt claimed under oath that he had met Sturgis for the first time shortly before Watergate, but this was clearly not true, by his own later admission. In her book ZR Rifle, Claudia Furiati points out some pertinent facts about Sturgis (aka Frank Fiorini).

In her book ZR Rifle, Claudia Furiati points out some pertinent facts about Sturgis (aka Frank Fiorini). She writes, “The counter-intelligence – Frank Sturgis and Orlando Bosch were two of the principal agents of Operation 40, the ‘parallel’ counter-intelligence structure before, during, and after the Bay of Pigs invasion. David Atlee Phillips represented the CIA in these operations. “The Commandos - Sturgis was one of the initiators of the International Anti-Communist Brigade … David Atlee Phillips was the mentor of these terrorist groups. Sturgis and his partner Gerry Hemming opened the training camp at Lake Pontchartrain in New Orleans in the same era as the creation of Alpha 66 [headed by Antonio Veciana] … Pontchartrain, spared by the police authorities, became the center of the illegal counterrevolutionary operations. Frank Sturgis, Orlando Bosch, Guy Banister, David Ferrie, Clay Shaw, and Lee Harvey Oswald all participated directly in these.” For her book, Claudia Furiati interviewed Fabian Escalante of Cuban intelligence, who in turn cited the book Double Cross, by Sam and Chuck Giancana. Escalante commented, “It is interesting to observe, following the details given in Double Cross, that the assassination of Kennedy was carried out by two groups: one under the control of Jack Ruby, who later killed Oswald; and the other by Frank Sturgis, who later became the chief of the Watergate ‘plumbers’. It is now possible to appreciate why Richard Nixon didn’t want the famous phone tapes about the Bay of Pigs to become known.” The “Bay of Pigs thing” raises its ugly head again. But why was Nixon so concerned about the Bay of Pigs thing, and what it might reveal. After all, the invasion took place under JFK, who took full responsibility for the fiasco. Why then would this cause such embarrassment to Nixon and to the CIA? Perhaps it was a result of the events leading up to the Bay of Pigs, the planning of which took place under Nixon and Eisenhower, and the aftermath of the failed invasion, which caused hatred toward Kennedy on the part of the CIA, the Cuban exiles, and the Mafia. Perhaps these three groups joined forces to plot the murder of JFK. And perhaps Nixon realized that the whole chain of events could be traced back to him, starting in 1960 with the plots against Castro. And who suggested such a plot? One of the first was none other than E. Howard Hunt. As the planning for the Bay of Pigs progressed, Hunt became increasingly dissatisfied with the program being proposed.

One of the first was none other than E. Howard Hunt. As the planning for the Bay of Pigs progressed, Hunt became increasingly dissatisfied with the program being proposed. He felt that “his” Cubans were being pushed out in favor of more moderate to leftist Cuban exiles – in effect Fidelismo without Fidel. Shortly before the actual invasion, Hunt in effect resigned his position in the operation. In his book Oswald and the CIA, historian John Newman writes, “After a detour of several days in Spain, Hunt delivered his recommendations to the Cuban task force [headed by Nixon] in April. He listed four: Subsequently, in July 1960, Hunt was invited to lunch with Nixon’s National Security Adviser and Chief of Staff, Robert E. Cushman. Newman, quoting Hunt himself, says, “Hunt described what transpired: ‘I reviewed for Cushman my impressions of Cuba under Castro and my principal operational recommendations … Cushman’s reaction was to tell me that the Vice President [Nixon] was the project’s action officer within the White House, and that Nixon wanted nothing to go wrong.’” Of course, Nixon and Cushman were gone, and Kennedy was President, by the time the operation took place in April 1961. Why, then, Nixon’s great concern, a decade later, about the “Bay of Pigs thing,” and the fact that E. Howard Hunt “knew too much.” Nixon told Ehrlichman that “if you open that scab [Hunt], there’s one hell of a lot of things.” What they were has never been revealed. Clearly, though, Hunt knew or was familiar with many of the key plotters, as well as the plot itself. Hunt claimed in his memo that he turned down the invitation to play an active role, although he certainly did not alert the police, the FBI, the CIA, or the Secret Service. On an audio tape given by Hunt to St. John in his latter years, Hunt described himself as a “benchwarmer” in the plot to kill JFK. While this does not describe an active participant, it does describe a full member of the team who was ready to take the field at any moment if the need arose. Of course, Hunt could also have been minimizing his role, as might be expected of a career spook. In his handwritten memo to St. John, Hunt added this: “Like the rest of the country, NADA [Hunt] is stunned by JFKs death and realizes how lucky he is not to have had a direct role.

Epsilon [Sturgis] speculates that Jack Ruby was selected to kill Oswald by the mob. Epsilon [Sturgis] reveals that one of the Dallas shooters was a foreigner.” Hunt later informed St. John and me that the foreigner was a French Corsican gunman named Sarti. This could only have been Lucien Sarti, as Hunt suggests in American Spy. Clearly, Hunt was up to his eyeballs in assassination plots. One additional note is provided by Bayard Stockton in Flawed Patriot: “In March 1961, well before [Bill] Harvey was involved in Caribbean matters, [Johnny] Roselli went to the Dominican Republic, accompanied by Howard Hunt of the CIA. Rafael Trujillo, the Republic’s dictator, was ambushed and killed on May 30, 1961, but the CIA was cleared of involvement in the assassination.” Cleared by the CIA itself, that is, just as it was “cleared” of the assassination of Lumumba in the Congo in 1961, even though the Agency had sent killers to eliminate him. It is most interesting to note that in 1961, two years before the Kennedy assassination, Howard Hunt and Johnny Roselli were joining forces in an assassination plot in the Caribbean. Roselli, of course, was the Mafia’s liaison to the CIA, and the representative of the Chicago Mafia in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and points east. He was also a close friend and drinking buddy of Bill Harvey, and of David Morales as well. When we put all these facts together, from various sources, it becomes clear that Howard Hunt’s assassination scenario is at least very possible, if not highly probable. If Hunt had wanted to create a fictional scenario, he would more likely have implicated Fidel Castro and the “Communist Menace” in the plot, instead of his own close friends and colleagues. This adds considerably to the credibility of Hunt’s story. As for Dave Phillips, I knew him pretty well at one time. He worked for me during the Guatemala project. He made himself useful to the agency in Santiago, Chile where he was an American businessman. In any case, his actions, whatever they were, came to the attention of the Santiago Station Chief and when his resume became known to people in the Western Hemisphere Division he was brought in to work on Guatemalan operations.

The navigational systems were developed in conjunction with Global Positioning System (GPS), a space-based radio-navigation system that generates accurate positioning, navigation and timing information for civilian use at no cost. The information signal is obtained through the use of GPS signal receiving equipment.9 Although GPS was originally developed for military use by the US Department of Defense, by the 1990s many civilian applications were emerging. These included navigational use by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and commercial airlines. During this period, however, the US military continued to have priority, and for reasons of national security “selectively downgraded” the GPS signal available for civilian use. This policy changed on May 1, 2000, with the announcement that the US would end the “selective availability” of GPS in order to promote transportation safety, as well as other scientific and commercial interests.10 As a result of this decision, made by President Clinton, the US military partially lifted the “intentional degradation” of the GPS signal, whereupon its accuracy increased by a factor of ten. This shift, 16 months before 9/11, had powerful ramifications for commercial airline navigation. Indeed, by the mid-1990s it had become evident that GPS was the navigation technology of the future. By this point, the FAA, assisted by companies such as Raytheon, was already making plans to eventually replace the older, more expensive ILS landing systems and VOR navigation systems with new augmented GPS signal service. Richard Armitage, a signatory of the “Project for the New Augmented GPS was truly a quantum advance in airline navipending final approval by the FAA. This was just 13 months prior to 9/11. The new Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) was designed to further improve the accuracy of GPS. WAAS utilizes both satellites and precisely surveyed ground stations, which monitor the GPS satellite signal for errors. Timing is crucial in GPS. The problem is that the GPS signal tends to be refracted, i.e., slows down, as it moves through the ionosphere toward earth, which causes errors in the system. The numerous ground stations correct these errors, then, relay the corrected GPS data to ground-based uplink stations, which transmit the corrected data to geostationary satellites. The satellites are the final link, broadcasting the corrected positional data.12 To understand the amazing improvement in accuracy, consider that in the days before GPS, conventional aviation navigation beacon signals provided placement information accurate to within one mile.13 After GPS became available, accuracy improved to within 100 meters. Once the augmented GPS, i.e., WAAS, became available, accuracy of horizontal and vertical positional data radically improved again, to between 1 and 3 meters.

Once the augmented GPS, i.e., WAAS, became available, accuracy of horizontal and vertical positional data radically improved again, to between 1 and 3 meters. This level of accuracy made GPS-supported Category I precision aircraft runway approaches feasible throughout the contiguous United States.14 The newly activated WAAS signal was even utilized to precisely survey the Ground Zero site in New York, following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, according to Raytheon’s director of satellite navigation systems.15 “Required Navigation Performance” (RNP). First developed during the 1990s, RNP is a system for defining tolerances deemed necessary for navigational safety. The RNP system utilizes precisely constructed “highways in the sky” that can be navigated by the autopilot systems of aircraft like those involved in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Such routes “never vary more than 18 meters, half the wingspan of a Boeing 737”.16 WAAS-enabled RNP technology “pinpoints the location of a fast-moving jet to within yards”.17 Once the RNP system began to utilize the WAAS signal, pilots were “able to determine the airplane’s vertical and horizontal position [to] within six or seven meters (about 20 to 23 feet)”.18 The WAAS signal (horizontal and vertical position) accuracy of 1 to 3 meters was a significant improvement over the standard Instrument Landing System (ILS) technology then in general use at major US airports. The latter utilize antenna arrays that provide for aircraft centerline placement over the 150- to 200-foot wide runways; but are only accurate to 7.6 meters both vertically and horizontally at the middle marker.19 RNP “highway in the sky” routes provide for a containment accuracy within a virtual corridor, the dimensions of which are described in nautical miles. In 2003, Raytheon reported further improvement: the narrowing of WAAS-enabled corridors to just 243 feet (RNP 0.02). According to Raytheon, “WAAS … supports required navigation performance (RNP) operations, providing a precision navigation capability down to RNP 0.02 (an accuracy of $0 . 0 2 ) ; $ In plain English, WAAS is capable of maintaining an air corridor accurate to within .02 of a nautical-mile 95% of the time.20 In GPS navigation, a “waypoint” is defined as a three-dimensional location within the National Air Space, comprised of longitude, latitude and altitude coordinates.21 RNP-supported flight paths and runway approach procedures are comprised of a series of waypoints.22 Interestingly, the World Trade Center towers themselves are known to have occupied waypoint coordinates.23 Aircraft Flight Management Systems (FMS) facilitate precision instrument approach procedures that involve the interception of waypoint coordinates.24 By substitution of WTC and Pentagon building waypoint coordinates for flight-leg terminating waypoint coordinates, a RNP-like", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:1:f18312b9920b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4910, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "“waypoint” is defined as a three-dimensional location within the National Air Space, comprised of longitude, latitude and altitude coordinates.21 RNP-supported flight paths and runway approach procedures are comprised of a series of waypoints.22 Interestingly, the World Trade Center towers themselves are known to have occupied waypoint coordinates.23 Aircraft Flight Management Systems (FMS) facilitate precision instrument approach procedures that involve the interception of waypoint coordinates.24 By substitution of WTC and Pentagon building waypoint coordinates for flight-leg terminating waypoint coordinates, a RNP-like waypoint intercept procedure under auto- Federal Aviation Administration, August 24, 2000, posted at http://www.faa.gov/ news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=5249; “WAAS Fact Sheet,” Federal Aviation Administration, posted at http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_ story.cfm?newsId ⌊= 6283. 15 David Johnson, “WAAS: Back in Step, Avionics Magazine,” Avionics Magazine, February 1, 2002, posted at http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/categories/commercial/12571.html. 16 Domic Gates, “Kent company bringing a navigation revolution,” Seattle Times, October 22, 2006, posted at http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003316294_naverus22.html. 17 Michael Copeland, “A fuel-saving flight plan,” CNN Money, July 9, 2008, posted at http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0807/gallery.copeland_naverus. fortune/index.html. 18 Mathew Brellis, “DIRECT FLIGHT NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL GUIDE PLANES,” Boston Globe, October 7, 1999, posted at http://www.highbeam.com/ doc/1P2-8569182.html 19 “Replacing the ILS: the Wide-Area Augmentation System (WAAS) will provide ILS-like accuracy with GPS.

But it is a cruel truism to say that our nation was caught off-guard on 9/11. Yes, it is true, but not in the way that most people think. We humans are easily shocked and traumatized by sudden overwhelming violence, and respond in rather predictable ways to such an experience. Many people shut down and become passive; others fly into a blind rage. The point is that people who have been traumatized can be manipulated, quite easily, for some ulterior purpose.1 In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, I was among a minority of Americans deeply disturbed by the hysterical flag-waving and the jingoistic cries for war. Not because we did not care about our country, but because we sensed that our emotions and the distraught feelings of so many others were being exploited for nefarious ends. At the time, of course, and for years afterward, the tide of indignant patriotism ran so strongly that few dared to raise such concerns. Today however, more than ten years after the attacks, it is clear that the skeptics were correct. Sadly, it is also apparent that most Americans still have not come to terms with the horrible events of that fateful day. Many people simply refuse to talk about it and have clearly pushed the experience into the backs of their minds, perhaps in an at- But we cannot move on because, as a nation, we are stuck in a vicious cycle. Too few Americans have consciously processed the mix of emotions associated with 9/11, and this is frustrating our collective capacity to think rationally about the future. Once again, we have failed to learn the lessons of history, and so are doomed to repeat them. A well-known principle in psychotherapy goes like this: individuals who have been traumatized must face the pain in a conscious way to be free of the trauma’s debilitating effects. Indeed, this is the goal of all therapy in these cases. It is no surprise that the principle also holds at the macro-level, that is, with regard to society as a whole. For what is society if not a collection of individuals? No wonder that in 2012 we as a nation are singularly unprepared for the future that is fast upon us.

Our countrymen have been systematically dumbed down, distracted and demoralized by our own government and its willing minions in the media and throughout much of academia. Here in the US, the dark arts of thought control have been elevated to a level of sophistication almost undreamed of by the Nazis and Soviets. Given the reality of a largely disconnected public, it is hardly surprising that our nation is also bereft of any leadership worthy of the name. The success of democracy, as Jefferson wrote, requires an informed citizenry. Efforts by a small activist minority to reverse the trend and rein in our out-of-control war machine have so far been defeated at every turn. No wonder then that we are increasingly being overtaken by events beyond our control. If this reasoning is accurate, our best, indeed perhaps our last, remaining shot to turn the tide is to revisit 9/11, not for the masochistic purpose of wallowing in pain for pain’s sake, but for the therapeutic goal of honestly facing the key questions at their historical root: Was 9/11 simply a trigger pulled by al-Qaeda for jihad against the United States? Or did it hide deeper and even darker motives? The distinction is of enormous importance, because the correct answer makes all the difference. nation’s capacity to play a positive role on the world stage. Many foreigners no longer view the United States with admiration and respect, but increasingly with fear and loathing. But here, US elites seem oblivious to such concerns. They do not care, and they are quite candid about what they view as the CIA’s pragmatic “need” to associate with unsavory individuals and criminals in the interest of furthering US foreign-policy goals. Their true colors can be identified between the lines of the policy papers. Take, for instance, a 1996 intelligence report prepared by AIG CEO Maurice Greenberg for the Council on Foreign Relations, which earned Greenberg a nomination to replace John Deutch as director of the CIA. Greenberg states that the capability to undertake covert operations ”constitutes an important national security tool.” In a section titled “Intelligence and Law Enforcement,” he is clear about the subordinate place of law enforcement under realpolitik: Foreign policy ought to take precedence over law enforcement when it comes to overseas operations. The bulk of US intelligence efforts overseas is devoted to traditional national security concerns; as a result, law enforcement must ordinarily be a secondary concern.

And in 1982, the CIA and the US Department of Justice apparently even worked out a secret agreement to this effect.2 The deal exempted the CIA from having to report drug trafficking by CIA assets, which made a mockery of then-presidential wife Nancy Reagan’s much ballyhooed “just say no” anti-drug campaign. The foreign policy outlined by Maurice Greenberg is in large part responsible for the drug-related violence on the streets of our cities, and for the epidemic of drug addiction among our children – sacrificed to the false god of national security. Nor is the social carnage limited to the United States. Drug addiction in Muslim Iraq was almost unknown prior to the US invasion in 2003; it has since become a major problem. A similar explosion of heroin use has occurred in Iran, right next door to Afghanistan, where the poppies are grown with the blessing of the CIA. Such foreign policies are evil, a scourge upon the planet, yet are intimately associated with US empire building. Time and again, the same historic pattern has played out: US military intervention, whether in Southeast Asia, Central America or, since 2001, Afghanistan and Iraq, has been accompanied by a sharp increase in narcotrafficking, with all of the attendant evils. The CIA’s secret collusion with/domination of the Department of Justice gave it veto power over law enforcement, effectively blunting the capacity of US law-enforcement agencies to interdict the flow of illegal drugs into the US. The timing seems no accident. The deal of 1982 coincided with the start of the CIA’s Contra war in Central America, and would explain why, in 1983, the Drug Enforcement Agency under pressure from the Pentagon closed its office in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.3 The flow of drugs through Honduras had not diminished, just the opposite. For years, the country had been a transfer point for illegal drug smuggling into the US, a reality that Contra leaders readily exploited to finance their war against the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, and they did so with the full knowledge and approval of the CIA. For many years after, a CIA veto blocked legitimate efforts by US law enforcement to curb the illicit drug trade.4 Meanwhile, the American people were", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:5:f52acb704a17", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4914, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "flow of drugs through Honduras had not diminished, just the opposite.

For many years after, a CIA veto blocked legitimate efforts by US law enforcement to curb the illicit drug trade.4 Meanwhile, the American people were kept in the dark about the policy and its effects at every point in the chain, from the formulation of the policy, to its implementation, to its phony packaging for mass consumption. In fact, our knowledge about this corruption is primarily thanks to a courageous journalist named Gary Webb. In 1996, Webb produced a series of groundbreaking articles for the San Jose Mercury News exposing Contra links and CIA complicity in the crack cocaine epidemic that had ravaged the black communities of Los Angeles in the 1980s.5 The series, appropriately titled “Dark Alliance,” was one of the first big news stories to be carried on the Internet. Later, Webb expanded it into an important book by the same name, in which he laid out the voluminous evidence in stark detail. But it was Webb’s series of articles in 1996 that initially focused media attention on CIA complicity in the drug trade and compelled Agency director John Deutch to announce an internal investigation. Meanwhile, the CIA also simultaneously launched a disinformation campaign to discredit Webb, whom it viewed as a serious threat. The campaign against Gary Webb has been called “one of the most venomous and factually inane assaults on a professional journalist’s competence in living memory.”6 The mainstream press, seemingly always eager to do the bidding of authorities, appeared to take pleasure in savaging the messenger, even while tacitly conceding that his facts were basically correct. One of the low points occurred on live TV on November 15, 1996, when NBC’s Andrea Mitchell, wife of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, referred to Webb’s exhaustively documented expose as “a conspiracy theory,” the kiss of death for any serious journalist.7 At this same time, of course, Greenspan was busily (dare we say “conspiratorially”?) engineering the deregulation of Wall Street, setting the stage for the eventual financial meltdown of the global economy. As we will see, this deregulation may have also had a part in 9/11 itself. main thesis, the CIA suppressed Hitz’s report, even while leaking a denial of the allegations.

This was a blatant lie, indeed a breathtaking example of CIA deception. But it had its intended effect: neither reporter bothered to ask why Hitz’s report was still under wraps. After the onset of the war in Afghanistan, the CIA’s support for Afghan drug lords moved out of the closet. By 2009, even the major US papers were reporting on it.8 However, the political climate of the 1990s simply would not allow an honest airing of the CIA-drug issue, much as a real investigation of 9/11 remains taboo, to this day. Webb’s newspaper publisher ultimately caved under pressure and threw his Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter under the bus, even as Webb was turning up fresh evidence that indicated he had, if anything, understated the case against the CIA.9 When CIA Inspector General Fred Hitz finally testified before the House Intelligence Committee, in March 1998, he admitted it was all true: “Let me be frank about what we are finding. There are instances where CIA did not, in an expeditious or consistent fashion, cut off relationships with individuals supporting the Contra program who were alleged to have engaged in drug trafficking activity.”10 Gary Webb was marginalized at the San Jose Mercury News, which he left to write his award-winning book, Dark Alliance. It appeared in 1999, to both acclaim and, predictably, still more press bashing. Webb subsequently worked as an investigator for the California legislature, and later took a position (at a steep pay cut) for the Sacramento News and Review. But the press attacks, his unemployability as an investigative writer, and deepening financial troubles took a toll on Webb, who had always been prone to bouts of depression. By 2004 the writer was in a downward spiral that was quite apparent to his friends and family. His body was discovered on December 10, 2004, along with a note and other evidence of suicide. Because Webb had been shot twice in the head—evidently not as rare in suicide as might be presumed—many skeptics continue to believe that he was murdered. But even if Webb died by his own tragic hand, and the evidence indicates he did, does that exonerate those who drove him to it?

Government officials are not immune to the temptations of the drug trade, which is now the most profitable business on the planet by a wide margin. Arms smuggling, by comparison, comes in a distant second. The CIA’s policy of protecting drug traffickers did not start with its secret deal with the US Justice Department. The policy had been a longstanding problem for US law enforcement agencies: “In south Florida, by the 1970s, police could scarcely arrest a dope dealer or illegal weapons trafficker without encountering the claim, often true, that the suspect had CIA connections. Perhaps the largest narcotics investigation of the decade, the World Finance Corporation case, involving scores of federal and state agents, had to be scrapped after a year because the CIA complained to the Justice Department that a dozen top criminals were ‘of interest’ to it.” Jonathan Kwitny, The Crimes of Patriots (New York: W.W. Norton, 1987), p. 96. 10 Statement of Frederick P. Hitz, Inspector General CIA before the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, US House of Representatives, regarding investigation of allegations of connections between CIA and the Contras in drug trafficking to the US, March 16, 1998, posted at http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1998_hr/980316- ps.htm. But in the course of my 9/11 research, as you will see, I have had to comprehend even larger sums. For example, merely the gold of a secret treasure hoard falling, albeit incomplete and piecemeal, into the “unofficial” coffers of the US geopolitical establishment would be worth well over $5 trillion with gold at a “mere” $1000 per ounce, a price it has been far above recently. That mind-boggling hoard also included diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, etc.; platinum and other strategic metals; as well as “priceless” art and artifacts; all collected by looting various Asian nations over a fifty year period. Most of the treasure was carefully inventoried. According to the late Chalmers Johnson, a longtime expert on Japan, East Asia and US foreign policy, as much as 40% of the Pentagon budget is “black,” meaning hidden from public scrutiny.2 If his figure is even approximately correct, and I believe it is, this means that democratic oversight of US military research and development has become all but impossible.

In which case, our democratic values and way of life are now at risk: not from without—no foreign enemy can subvert the US Constitution—but from within. At 9:38 a.m. on the morning after Rumsfeld’s press conference, the nascent investigation of the missing money was derailed even before it could get underway, when the west wing of the Pentagon exploded in flames and smoke, the target of a terrorist strike. And with the attack also died any remaining hope that the US military might still get its budgetary house in order. Curiously, the exact point of impact was the Department of Defense accounting offices on the first floor. The odds against this being a coincidence, given the Pentagon’s enormous size, prompted skeptics of the official story to read a dark design into the attack. The surgical destruction of the Department of Defense’s records and staff, nearly all of whom died in the rubble, leads to important questions about who benefited from 9/11. The answers suggest that Deep Throat’s famous dictum during the Watergate revelations—“follow the money”—may be no less important to a deep understanding of 9/11. Without question, the Pentagon’s west wing presented a much more challenging target than the east wing. Targeting the west wing required a difficult approach over the Arlington skyline. The final approach was especially dicey and amounted to a downhill obstacle course, skirting apartments and a large complex of buildings about a quarter-mile from the Pentagon known as the Naval Annex, which sits atop a hill rising from the flat ground along the Potomac River. In April 2008, I interviewed Army Brigadier General Clyde Vaughn, a credible witness to the events of that morning. Vaughn explained over the telephone that on 9/11 he was on his way to work at the Pentagon via the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway (I-395) when the strike occurred. The general told me the hijacked aircraft (presumably American Airlines Flight 77) just missed the Naval Annex and that it would have hit the 270-feet-tall US Air Force memorial presently occupying the site.3 The new memorial was constructed and dedicated in 2006. good chance to crash the offices of Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which were located on the opposite side of the building, in the middle of the outer “E” ring.

Surely terrorists would have been more interested in decapitating the command structure of the US war machine than going after a bunch of accounting clerks. There were other striking anomalies that morning. The crash of American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m. should also have raised red flags, because the point of impact at the 95th and 96th floors was another remarkable happenstance. Both floors were occupied by Marsh & McLennan, one of the world’s largest insurance brokerages, with ties to the private intelligence firm Kroll Associates, which held the security contract at the World Trade Center. Indeed, the network of corporate ties here is so entangled that tracing all the links would fill this entire volume, but the most salient connections can be enumerated. The CEO of Marsh & McLennan on 9/11 was Jeffrey Greenberg, son of Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, owner of AIG, the world’s largest insurance conglomerate (or second largest, depending on the source). Greenberg’s other son, Evan, was CEO of Ace Limited, another large insurance company. Maurice Greenberg had been a director of the New York Federal Reserve Bank for many years, and in 1994-95 served as its chairman. Greenberg was also vicechairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, which, as already noted, sponsored his 1996 report, “Making Intelligence Smarter: The future of U.S. Intelligence.” As a result of that report, Senator Arlen Specter floated Greenberg’s name as a candidate for the directorship of the CIA.4 Although George Tenet eventually got the job, the mere fact that Greenberg was in the running shows the extent of his influence. In 1993, Greenberg’s huge insurance conglomerate AIG reportedly bankrolled the Wall Street spy firm, Kroll Associates, saving it from bankruptcy. Thereafter, Kroll became an AIG subsidiary. After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, Kroll acquired the contract from the Port Authority of New York to upgrade security at the World Trade Center, in the process beating out two other firms.5 Kroll continued with the WTC security contract through the period leading up to the September 11 attacks. One of Kroll’s directors, Jerome Hauer, also managed New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani’s Office of Emergency Management, which was located on the 23rd floor of WTC-7, which was also destroyed on September 11.6 Kroll’s contract gave it unfettered access to all of the buildings destroyed in New York on 9/11. Nor was this all. In 1998, AIG invested $1.35 billion in the Blackstone Group, a private New York merchant bank.7 According to the New York Times, the two companies had worked together", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:10:4bc940403243", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4919, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "Kroll’s directors, Jerome Hauer, also managed New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani’s Office of Emergency Management, which was located on the 23rd floor of WTC-7, which was also destroyed on September 11.6 Kroll’s contract gave it unfettered access to all of the buildings destroyed in New York on 9/11. Nor was this all. In 1998, AIG invested $1.35 billion in the Blackstone Group, a private New York merchant bank.7 According to the New York Times, the two companies had worked together for many years. Indeed, Maurice Greenberg had served on Blackstone’s advisory board since 1989. The connection is of special interest because in October 2000, Blackstone Real Estate Advisors, the real estate management arm of Blackstone Group, purchased the mortgage secured by WTC-7.8 This startling string of coincidences should have been reason enough for the 9/11 Commission to investigate both the Blackstone Group and Kroll’s shady background as well as their relations with AIG, Ace Limited, and Marsh & McLennan. The Commission was armed with subpoena authority and could have probed deeply enough to learn the truth. Unfortunately, the official investigators were not interested in connecting the dots. The 9/11 Commission Report, released in 2004, was at best shamefully inadequate, as will become apparent in the course of this narrative. Important evidence continued to appear, nonetheless. In 2006, a whistleblower named Richard A. Grove went public with stunning testimony about his involvement with the Greenberg empire: an up-close-and-personal experience, Grove says, that nearly cost him his life.9 During the period leading up to 9/11, Grove worked as a salesman for Silverstream Software, a firm marketing designer solutions to a number of Wall Street institutions, including Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Bankers Trust, Alex Brown, and Morgan Stanley. According to Grove, Silverstream “built Internet transactional and trading platforms,” designed “to Web-enable the critical business functions of Fortune 500 companies, basically integrating and making available on the Web the disparate legacy applications and mainframes while simultaneously streamlining workflow and traditional paper processes.” The “end result [was] a lower cost of operation and more efficient transactions because inefficiencies such as people were being taken out of the loop.”10 Grove was so successful as a salesman, that he earned over a million dollars before the age of thirty. He only realized later that the software he sold might have enabled fraudulent trading in the hours before, and possibly during, the 9/11 attacks. The most advanced software of all went to Marsh & McLennan, which, he says, placed an order in 2000 for a technological solution “beyond what we had done for any of the above-named companies; insofar as it would be used to electronically connect Marsh to its major business partners via Internet portals, for the purpose of creating ‘paperless transactions’ and expediting revenue and renewal cycles.” Grove inked the software deal with Marsh & McLennan in October 2000, and Silverstream stationed a team of thirty", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:11:7731857137ca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4920, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "of all went to Marsh & McLennan, which, he says, placed an order in 2000 for a technological solution “beyond what we had done for any of the above-named companies; insofar as it would be used to electronically connect Marsh to its major business partners via Internet portals, for the purpose of creating ‘paperless transactions’ and expediting revenue and renewal cycles.” Grove inked the software deal with Marsh & McLennan in October 2000, and Silverstream stationed a team of thirty to forty technicians in the client’s offices in WTC-1, led by several software developers who proceeded to design and build the software package “from the ground up.” During this period, Grove served as liaison between Silverstream and Marsh, to insure that the software would perform as specified. The team worked around-the-clock, seven days a week, to meet Marsh’s July 2001 deadline. The end result was “a specific type of connectivity that was used to link AIG and Marsh & McLennan, the first two commercial companies on the planet to employ this type of transaction.”11 Grove says he had first noticed fiscal irregularities in October 2000, when he and a colleague helped “identify about $10, 000, 000 in suspicious purchase orders.” Marsh’s chief information officer, Gary Lasko, later confirmed that “certain vendors were deceiving Marsh …selling … large quantities of hardware that were not necessary” for the project. But Grove did not worry too much about this at the time, nor did he run into personal trouble until the spring of 2001, when he learned, while negotiating a license renewal contract with Lasko, that his own employer (Silverstream) had been overbilling Marsh “to the tune of $7 million, or more.” Grove brought the matter to the attention of Silverstream executives, but was told to keep quiet and mind his own business. A Marsh executive advised him to do the same. By this point, a number of Marsh employees had earned Grove’s trust, and when he shared his concerns with them, they agreed that “something untoward was going on.” Grove names these honest employees in his testimonial, who in addition to Gary Lasko, included Kathryn Lee, Ken Rice, Richard Breuhardt and John Ueltzhoeffer. According to Grove, all of these individuals perished on 9/11, and a quick check confirmed that their names do indeed appear on the fatality list of World Trade Center victims.12 The proverbial manure hit the fan on June 5, 2001, the day after Grove sent an email to his sales team informing them that “Silverstream was billing Marsh millions above and beyond the numbers we were being paid commissions on …” There seemed only two possibilities: either the members of his team were being cheated out of their rightful commissions, or Silverstream was defrauding Marsh & McLennan. Later that day, Grove received word from Gary Lasko that Marsh had decided to retain Silverstream for the next phase of the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:12:2fa57e237e89", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4921, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "2001, the day after Grove sent an email to his sales team informing them that “Silverstream was billing Marsh millions above and beyond the numbers we were being paid commissions on …” There seemed only two possibilities: either the members of his team were being cheated out of their rightful commissions, or Silverstream was defrauding Marsh & McLennan. Later that day, Grove received word from Gary Lasko that Marsh had decided to retain Silverstream for the next phase of the project. He immediately informed his boss of the good news. Grove was personally delighted because his rightful commission “would have been a payday worth well over a million dollars.” He never collected it however, because the next morning Grove was summoned to his boss’s office and abruptly terminated. This is not the end of the story. Several weeks later, Grove suffered a medical emergency that required hospitalization, emergency surgery and weeks of recovery. In August 2001, while still bedridden, he was contacted by Silverstream’s Chief Financial Officer and offered $9, 999 in cash plus an extension of his medical benefits if he would agree never to talk about the work he did for the company. Grove needed the continuing medical coverage and agreed to Silverstream’s terms. During his convalescence however, he became suspicious about the secrecy agreement and decided that, at the very least, he should maintain contact with the honest employees at Marsh, several of whom had become close friends. Shortly thereafter, one of them arranged for Grove to attend a meeting they had arranged at the offices of Marsh & McLennan, where they planned to “openly question the suspiciously unconcerned executive who seemed to be at the center of the controversial secrecy.” That executive had agreed to participate via a telephone-conference link from his apartment in uptown Manhattan. This was the same individual who, months before, had warned Grove to look the other way. Grove claimed to be in possession of documents proving illicit activity, and he planned to produce them at the meeting. On the day of the showdown however, he ran late, delayed by heavy Manhattan traffic. Grove says he was on Vesey Street, between Buildings 6 and 7 of the WTC complex, when the South Tower exploded, apparently from the impact of UAL 175. By then, all or most of his friends in the North Tower were already dead or trapped on the upper floors. All told, some three hundred or more Marsh employees perished that morning, the victims of terrorists. Nor is this all. Paul Bremer, one of the neo-conservatives most connected with the US response to 9/11, was also an executive at Marsh & McLennan at the time of the attacks. A long-time associate of Henry Kissinger, Bremer had also worked with Alexander Haig and Paul Schultz during a State Department career that spanned two decades, and which included ambassadorships in Norway (1976-1979)", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:13:4c0ccf7a9181", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4922, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "All told, some three hundred or more Marsh employees perished that morning, the victims of terrorists.

A long-time associate of Henry Kissinger, Bremer had also worked with Alexander Haig and Paul Schultz during a State Department career that spanned two decades, and which included ambassadorships in Norway (1976-1979) and the Netherlands (1983-1986).13 In 1999, Bremer headed up a commission on terrorism that bears his name. Although the Bremer Commission acknowledged that the number of terrorist incidents world-wide had “dramatically declined since the 1980s,” it nonetheless warned that the terrorist threat had actually increased.14 Maurice Sonnenberg, an investment banker who served as the commission’s vice-chairman, later boasted that the commission’s June 2000 report became the blueprint for the Patriot Act.15 During the 2008 financial meltdown Sonnenberg’s company, Bear Stearns, failed despite a $30 billion bailout and was absorbed by JP Morgan Chase amidst allegations of securities fraud.16 Bremer, who more than anyone hyped the threat of international terrorism, went to work at the World Trade Center less than a year before the 9/11 attacks. In October 2000, Bremer took a job as CEO of Marsh Crisis Consulting, a subsidiary of insurance giant Marsh & McLennan. His office was located in the South Tower above where the second plane (UAL175) hit.17 However, like other top Marsh & McLennan executives, Bremer failed to show up for work that morning. Instead, Bremer went on national television and was one of the first to point the finger at Osama bin Laden. Bremer called for “the most severe military response.”18 After the attacks, Bremer’s firm Marsh Crisis Consulting expanded its international operations, offering comprehensive counterterrorism services to client governments.19 This lucrative business environment at the forefront of the new war on terror evidently was ideal preparation for Bremer’s next assignment. In May 2003, His specialty was shock therapy. One of Bremer’s first acts was to ban Baathists from serving in government jobs, which immediately threw a half-million state employees out of work, mostly soldiers but also doctors, nurses, teachers and engineers. The massive layoff of Iraq’s professional class effectively shut down the nation’s large public sector, which, no doubt, was Bremer’s intent. But it also undermined the secular status of the Iraqi government, setting the stage for the violent sectarian strife that would soon plunge the nation into chaos.20 Bremer introduced economic “reforms” that crippled the Iraqi business community, creating huge unemployment, even while opening the country to foreign plunder. Nor was there any legal redress.

Indeed, an estimated $8.8 billion earmarked for the economic development of Iraq vanished without a trace on Bremer’s watch.21 Paul Bremer’s year-long governorship proved to be an unmitigated disaster for the Iraqi people, a disaster that continues to this day. 6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Hauer. 7 Peter Truell, “AIG Will Put $1.35 Billion Into Blackstone,” New York Times, July 31, 1998.

Richard Grove believes that “hundreds of billions in fraudulenttransactions” occurred just prior to 9/11 in addition to the1 idence for insider trading reported by the press in the first days and weeks after 9/11, when many suspected that Al Qaeda had profited from the attacks. Grove’s estimate may be off, but he is right about the evidence for informed, or insider, trading, which from the first appeared to be a worldwide phenomenon. The list of affected nations was long and, in addition to the US, included Germany, Japan, France Luxembourg, the UK, Switzerland, Spain, and even Hong Kong.2 One consultant, Jonathan Winer, told ABC, “It’s absolutely unprecedented to see cases of insider trading covering the entire world from Japan to the US to North America to Europe.”3 Soon, independent investigations were underway on three continents, in the belief that the paper trail would lead to the terrorists. Press statements by leading figures in the international banking community left little doubt that the evidence was compelling. Ernst Welteke, President of the German Deutsche Bundesbank, told the Miami Herald that “a preliminary review by German regulators and bank researchers showed there were highly suspicious sales of shares in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:15:4f1c33ff2d47", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4924, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "world from Japan to the US to North America to Europe.”3 Soon, independent investigations were underway on three continents, in the belief that the paper trail would lead to the terrorists. Press statements by leading figures in the international banking community left little doubt that the evidence was compelling. Ernst Welteke, President of the German Deutsche Bundesbank, told the Miami Herald that “a preliminary review by German regulators and bank researchers showed there were highly suspicious sales of shares in airlines and insurance companies, along with major trades in gold and oil markets, before September 11 that suggest … advance knowledge of the attacks. Welteke said that his researchers came across … almost irrefutable proof of insider trading.” Welteke himself was emphatic: “If you look at the movements in markets before and after the attacks, it really makes your brow furrow.… What we found makes us sure that people connected to the terrorists must have been trying to profit from this tragedy.”4 Germany, Japan and the US had received information about short selling of insurance company shares and airline stocks, which fell sharply as a result of the attacks. The FSA was “drawn into the investigation because it had a transaction monitoring department that checks suspicious share movements.” Richard Crossley, a London analyst, “said that he had tracked suspicious short selling and share dumping in a swath of stocks badly affected by the terrorist attacks.5 Among the World Trade Center tenants were dozens of banks and insurance companies, including several that were now going to have to pay out billions to cover heavy losses from the attacks. Assuming nefarious individuals were armed with foreknowledge, they stood to make a windfall by dumping stock and selling competitors short, not to mention vast potential profits from last-minute electronic money laundering via computers which, the perpetrators had to know, would be destroyed within hours. CBS also reported a sharp upsurge in purchases of put options on both United and American Airlines. A put option is a contract that allows the holder to sell a stock at a set price during a specified time period, which can reap huge profits should the stock plummet. The uptick had occurred in the days prior to 9/11. Although many stocks tumbled, there were also big winners, especially in the military sector. Contractors like L-3 Communications, Alliant Techsystems and Northrop Grumman all reported large gains. The biggest winner, though, was Raytheon, which manufactures Tomahawk missiles. In the trading week of September 17-21, 2001, Raytheon stock climbed by an astounding 37% .7 On the day prior to 9/11, the purchase of call options for Raytheon had suspiciously surged by 600% .8 The sale of five-year US Treasury Notes also spiked just before 9/11, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.

The notes are prized for their safety and their backing by the US government, and usually rally when investors flee riskier investments, such as stocks.” According to a Wall Street bond-market strategist: “If they were going to do something like this they would do it in the five-year part of the market. [Because] It’s extremely liquid, and the tracks would be hard to spot.” The article noted that the value of those notes rose sharply during the three weeks following the events of September 11.9 The Securities and Exchange Commission led the US government probe of allegations of insider trading.10 For weeks, the SEC remained close-mouthed about the scope of its investigation; then it sent out a request to securities firms around the world for more information on trading in thirty-eight different stocks.11 SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt told the House Financial Services Committee, “We will do everything in our power to track those people down and bring them to justice.”12 By this time, however, the fix was apparently in.

The SEC statement included the following passage: “We ask that you disseminate the information within your institution only on a need-to-know basis [my emphasis].”13 In his book Crossing the Rubicon, former LAPD detective Michael Ruppert described the SEC’s move to deputize: “What happens when you deputize someone in a national security or criminal investigation is that you make it illegal for them to disclose publicly what they know … In effect, they become government agents and are controlled by government regulations rather than their own conscience. In fact, they can be thrown in jail without a hearing if they talk publicly. I have seen this implied threat time and again with federal investigations, intelligence agents, and even members of the United States Congress who are bound so tightly by secrecy oaths and agreements that they are not even able to disclose criminal activities inside the government for fear of incarceration … members of congressional intelligence committees … sign even more draconian secrecy agreements in order to get their assignments.”14 This surely means that Al Qaeda had nothing to do with the insider trading.15 When the evidentiary trail led back to Wall Street, the SEC moved quickly to control the evidence and muzzle potential whistleblowers. Despite the best efforts of the SEC, however, a few details did leak to the world press. In mid-October 2001, The Independent (UK) reported, “To the embarrassment of investigators, it has … emerged that the firm used to buy many of the ‘put’ options – where a trader, in effect, bets on a share price fall – on United Airlines stock was headed until 1998 by Alvin ‘Buzzy’ Krongard, now executive director of the CIA.”16 For the most part, the US press failed to pick up the story, which linked Wall Street and the US intelligence community to the 9/11 attacks. Indeed, even before the leak, some of the press had begun backing away from the early reports of insider trading. For example, in a story posted on October 1, 2001, the New York Times cited experts who attributed the spike in put options for United and American Airlines as most likely due to a slumping airline industry.17 George Tenet writes in his memoirs that in February 1998 he recruited Buzzy Krongard to become his Councilor,18 in which capacity Krongard probably served as Tenet’s personal liaison to Wall Street.

Krongard’s known ties to the CIA, however, go back at least as far as 1992.19 In the mid-1990s Krongard had served as a consultant to CIA director James Woolsey. Then he returned to finance and was named chairman of America’s oldest investment banking firm, Alex Brown and Sons, Inc., which in 1997 merged with Bankers Trust. In 1999, BT Alex Brown was in turn acquired by Deutsche Bank, the firm that placed the UAL put options. In 1998, BT Alex Brown refused to cooperate with a Senate subcommittee that was conducting hearings on the involvement of US banks in money-laundering activities.20 At the time, BT Alex Brown, like other large US financial institutions, was in the business of private banking, meaning that it catered to unnamed wealthy clients, often for the sole purpose of setting up shell companies in foreign jurisdictions, such as on the Isle of Jersey, where effective bank regulation and oversight are nonexistent. According to Michael Ruppert, Krongard’s last job at Alex Brown was to oversee “private client relations,”21 meaning that Krongard personally arranged confidential transactions and transfers for the bank’s unnamed wealthy clientele. Private banks typically offer a range of services to their clients for the purpose of shielding them from oversight. Private banks set up multiple offshore accounts in multiple locations under multiple names. They also facilitate the quick, confidential and hard-totrace transfer of money across jurisdictional boundaries. In many such cases, the private banks do not even know who owns the account, which, of course, means that not even the bankers can follow the transactions with “due diligence.” Many private banks do not even try, for fear of scaring away business, especially from foreign clients. Even though private bankers are responsible for enforcing legal controls against money laundering, where such laws exist, in practice oversight is typically weak or nonexistent. Computer technology has also introduced a new level of anonymity, in the form of faceless transactions that do not require the intermediation of a financial institution. Internet money transfers and new payment technologies such as “e-cash,” electronic purses and other electronic payment systems have created new ways to disguise the source and ownership of illicit money, as discussed in a US Treasury report of September 2001 on money laundering.22 It is therefore little wonder that law enforcement has failed to stem the growing international proliferation of laundered drug money and other illicit assets over the past several decades. The failure has been truly", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:19:ad71c1cf2733", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4928, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "a financial institution.

The failure has been truly spectacular. In 1999, a consensus of experts in Germany, Switzerland and at the US Treasury agreed that 99.9% of laundered money routinely escapes detection. The experts estimated that the annual total was between $500 billion and a trillion dollars, a mind-boggling number, about half of which is washed into the US economy, the rest into Europe.23 After Buzzy Krongard’s departure to the CIA, his successor at BT Alex Brown was his former deputy Mayo Shattuck III, who had worked at the bank for many years. In 1997, Shattuck helped Krongard engineer the merger with Bankers Trust, and he stayed on after Deutsche Bank acquired BT Alex Brown in 1999.24 According to the New York Times, Bankers Trust was “one of the most loosely managed [banks] on Wall Street,” and during the 1990s was repeatedly rocked by scandal. In 1994, clients and regulators accused the bank “of misleading customers about its risky derivative products.” The case went viral when tape recordings were made public that showed bank salesmen snickering about ripping off naïve customers. In 1999, BT Alex Brown pled guilty to criminal conspiracy charges, after it was revealed that top-level executives had created a slush fund out of at least $20 million in unclaimed funds.25 The firm had to pay a $63 million fine and would have been forced to close its doors but for the fact that it was purchased, just at this time, by Deutsche Bank, Europe’s largest. According to the New York Times, Mayo Shattuck III stayed on and was named “co-head of investment banking in January [2001], overseeing Deutsche Bank’s 400 brokers who cater to wealthy clients.”26 Shattuck himself reportedly handled the private accounts of such dubious notables as Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi and Seagram’s owner Edgar Bronfmann.27 His sudden unexplained resignation immediately after the 9/11 attacks must therefor be viewed as highly suspicious. Shocking as all of this may sound, the CIA has a long history of quietly playing the stock market, and this may include illicit or insider trading. Such is the view of Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks, co-authors of a best-selling 1974 book, The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence. Marchetti was a former CIA analyst and Marks served at the State Department.

Indeed, Langley was so threatened by the imminent release of their book that it attempted to block publication, though failed in the end, fortunately.28 The authors assert that with the approval of top CIA leadership a small group of senior officers for years played the stock market using the CIA’s “employee retirement fund, certain agent and contract-personnel escrow accounts, and the CIA credit-union’s capital.” In more recent years, the assets likely included slush funds (that I will discuss in a subsequent chapter) generated from the illicit sale of arms, possibly kickbacks from the drug trade, plus assets derived from a vast quantity of Japanese gold seized after World War II. Marchetti and Marks go so far as to suggest that the CIA group may have engaged in insider trading on occasion, for example, in 1970 at the time of a major CIA covert operation in Chile to prevent the election of Salvador Allende. The CIA could easily have reaped a windfall by shorting Anaconda copper stock, which evidently tumbled as a result of the CIA’s political interference in the country. Given the Agency’s tradition of secrecy and the near total absence of fiscal accountability, certainly the potential for this kind of abuse was high, and remains so. areful readers of The 9/11 Commission Report know that many Cof its most important details are buried in the endnotes. This is certainly true with regard to its discussion of the insider-trading flap. The text of the report itself casts no light on the subject, beyond pronouncing government investigations as “exhaustive” and exonerating of Al Qaeda (pp. 171-72): There also have been claims that al Qaeda financed itself through manipulation of the stock market based on its advance knowledge of the 9/11 attacks. Exhaustive investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, FBI, and other agencies have uncovered no evidence that anyone with advance knowledge of the attacks profited through securities transactions.130 Highly publicized allegations of insider trading in advance of 9/11 generally rest on reports of unusual pre-9/11 trading activity in companies whose stock plummeted after the attacks. Some unusual trading did in fact occur, but each such trade proved to have an innocuous explanation. For example, the volume of put options—investments that pay off only when a stock drops in price—surged in the parent companies of United Airlines on September 6 and American Airlines on September 10—highly suspicious trading on its face. Yet, further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with 9/11.

Yet, further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with 9/11. A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10 [Commission’s emphasis]. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, which recommended these trades. These examples typify the evidence examined by the investigation. The SEC and the FBI, aided by other agencies and the securities industry, devoted enormous resources to investigating this issue, including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments. These investigators have found that the apparently suspicious consistently proved innocuous [my emphasis].

Evidently, we are supposed to presume that “American” in the above note means American Airlines. But here it could just as easily refer to American Express, which was also on the SEC’s suspect list. If the major trading of the unnamed “US-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda” was truly hedged as The 9/11 Commission Report states, this would exonerate it of “informed” or insider trading. However, without more information, it is impossible to establish the facts regarding even this one particular investing institution. As we know that thirty-eight firms were under investigation, the Commission’s token nod at the issue is unconvincing. What about the pre-9/11 surge in call options for Raytheon, for instance, or the spike in put options for the behemoth Morgan Stanley, which had offices in the South Tower? And what of the Greenberg insurance firm, Marsh & McLennan (also on the list, along with AIG), whose offices in the North Tower took the full impact of American Airlines Flight 11, and which also saw the second highest spike in pre-9/11 put option activity, second only to United Airlines?30 One will search The 9/11 Commission Report in vain for any discussion of these or other suspect stocks.

Poteshman’s study appeared in the respected Journal of Business, and should have been known to the 9/11 Commission because it was accepted for publication in 2004, while the official investigation was still underway. The Commission’s Final Report, however, makes no mention of it, probably because Poteshman’s conclusion that insider trading occurred, to a probability of 99% , flatly contradicts the official findings.31 The second study, by Professor Marc Chesney and two colleagues, one from the University of Zurich and another from the Swiss Finance Institute, examined in detail fourteen suspect corporations and found evidence of insider trading in a number of stocks, including American and United Airlines, Boeing, Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and Bank of America.32 Chesney’s paper also refutes early reports that some inside traders failed to collect their winnings out of fear of exposure and subsequent arrest.33 On the contrary; the data shows that all of the 9/11-related put options were exercised, meaning that pay-outs occurred for each and every stock option. This was also confirmed by no less than Joseph Cella, the SEC official who headed up the SEC insider trading probe.34 Which of course means that the traders with foreknowledge of the attacks got away with their obscene winnings. The total pay out for the options studied by Chesney was an estimated $15 million. However, according to Paul Zarembka, an economics professor at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo, the total pay-out of all the options before and after 9/11 was probably on the order of $30 million.35 A third study by two Asian economists and a professor at the University of Wisconsin further embarrassed the 9/11 Commission by examining the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which according to the SEC and 9/11 Commission could not be investigated due to the high volume of trading.36 Nonetheless, when the professors did what was supposedly impossible, they found a “significant abnormal increase in the trading volume in the option market just before the 9-11 attacks.” The authors concluded there was “credible circumstantial evidence to support the insider trading claim.”37 They also refuted the counter argument that the spike in options was due to a generally declining stock market.

Incidentally, the SEC’s failure to investigate In sum, three separate statistical studies by three academic teams all reached the same conclusion. The joint probability that all three were “nothing more than random outliers seems” in the words of economist Paul Zarembka, “astronomically low.”38 Nor has anyone to date refuted any of the three important studies. If the options trading in the days before September 11, 2001 was truly “innocuous,” as the 9/11 Commission repeatedly insists in its report, then why did the SEC muzzle potential whistleblowers by deputizing everyone involved with its investigation? The move by the SEC had the result of limiting the flow of information to those with a “need to know,” which, of course, means that only a very few participants in the SEC investigation, those at the top, had the full picture. Did the SEC judge that an open process was too risky, as it might expose the unthinkable? This would certainly explain the SEC’s shredding of evidence. In 2009, David Callahan, executive editor of SmartCEO Magazine, submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the SEC for copies of the documentary evidence of its insider trading probe. The SEC responded that it was unable to comply because “the potentially responsive records have been destroyed.”39 The SEC’s response ought to have surprised no one familiar with the Commission’s long history of destroying records to cover up Wall Street crimes.40 All of this hints at the likely frightening extent of criminal activity on Wall Street in the days and hours before (and during?) 9/11. The SEC was like a surgeon who opens a patient on the operating room table to remove a tumor only to sew him back up again after finding that the cancer has metastasized throughout the body. At an early stage of its investigation, perhaps before SEC officials were fully aware of the implications, the SEC did recommend that the FBI investigate a number of suspicious transactions. We know about this thanks to a 9/11 Commission memorandum declassified in May 2009, which summarizes an August 2003 meeting at which FBI agents briefed the Commission on the insider-trading issue. The document indicates that the SEC had passed on the information about the suspicious trading to the FBI on September 21, 2001, just ten days after the attacks.41 Although the names in the cases are censored from the declassified document, thanks to some nice detective work by Kevin Ryan we know whom (in one case) the SEC was referring to.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:24:7fc0f1c81d5b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4933, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "in May 2009, which summarizes an August 2003 meeting at which FBI agents briefed the Commission on the insider-trading issue.

Ryan was able to fill in the blanks because, fortunately, the government censor was not 100% efficient, and inadvertently left enough details in the document to infer the name of the suspicious trader. His identity, it turns out, is a stunner and should have been prime-time news on every television network, world-wide.42 The trader was none other than Wirt Walker III, a distant cousin to then-President G.W. Bush. Several days before 9/11, Walker and his wife Sally purchased 56,000 shares of stock in Stratesec, one of the companies that provided security at the World Trade Center up until the day of the attacks. Notably, Stratesec also provided security at Dulles International Airport, where AA 77 took off on 9/11, and also security for United Airlines, which owned two of the other three allegedly hijacked aircraft. At the time, Walker was a director of Stratesec. You can’t get more inside than that. Incredibly, as if this were not shocking enough, president Bush’s brother Marvin also sat on the board! Walker’s investment paid off handsomely, gaining $50, 000 in value in a matter of days. Given the links to the World Trade Center and the Bush family, the SEC lead should have sparked an intensive FBI investigation. Yet, in a mind-boggling display of criminal malfeasance, the FBI concluded that because Walker and his wife had “no ties to terrorism….there was no reason to pursue the investigation.” The FBI did not conduct a single interview. The Recovered Hard DrivesThe 9/11 Commission Report also fails to mention other compeldred computer hard drives found by workmen in the ruins of the World Trade Center. In December 2001, Reuters and CNN reported that US credit card, telecommunications and accounting firms had hired a German company named Convar to recoup data from the damaged hard drives. Convar got the contract because it had developed an effective method for recovering data using a cutting-edge laser scanning technology. Richard Wagner, a data-retrieval expert at Convar, told CNN that the new laser process made it “possible to read the individual drive surfaces and then create a virtual drive.” By searching for encryption keys, indicating a financial record, Convar found evidence stored on the drives of an “unexplained surge” in large credit card transactions prior to the attacks. According to Reuters: “Unusually large sums of money, perhaps more than $100 million, were rushed through the computers as the disaster unfolded.” Evidently,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:25:9c327ebb90b5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4934, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 26, "text": "Wagner, a data-retrieval expert at Convar, told CNN that the new laser process made it “possible to read the individual drive surfaces and then create a virtual drive.” By searching for encryption keys, indicating a financial record, Convar found evidence stored on the drives of an “unexplained surge” in large credit card transactions prior to the attacks. According to Reuters: “Unusually large sums of money, perhaps more than $100 million, were rushed through the computers as the disaster unfolded.” Evidently, the criminals wrongly assumed that it would be impossible to trace their transactions after the computers were destroyed. The suspicion is that insider information about the attack was used to send financial transaction commands and authorizations in the belief that amidst all the chaos the criminals would have, at the very least, a good head start … Of course, it’s possible that Americans went on an absolute shopping binge, that Tuesday morning. But at this point there are many transactions that cannot be accounted for. Not only the volume but the size of the transactions was far higher than usual for a day like that. There is a suspicion that these were possibly planned to take advantage of the chaos.44 Henshel was confident that those responsible would ultimately be exposed. Yet, after the initial reporting by Reuters and CNN, the issue of the WTC hard drives disappeared from the news, and nothing has been heard since. Although reports on the Internet that Kroll meanwhile purchased Convar remain unsubstantiated, it is nonetheless clear that someone made the story (and the evidence?) go away.45 But why would anyone wish to do so unless the initial indications from Convar of insider trading were correct? Related evidence for insider trading was also provided in chilling fashion by a Deutsche Bank New York branch employee who survived the attacks. The whistleblower, who insisted on remaining anonymous for his own protection, told Michael Ruppert that “about five minutes before the attack the entire Deutsche Bank computer system had been taken over by something external that no one in the office recognized, and every file was downloaded at lightning speed to an unknown location [my emphases].”46 Insiders Trade Endnotes 1 http://www.freewebs.com/abigsecret/Grove.html. 2 Dave Eberhart, “Still Silence From 9-11 Stock Speculation Probe”, NewsMax, June 3, 2002, http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/6/2/62018.shtml. 3 World News Tonight, September 20, 2001. 4 William Drozdiak, “’Insider trading’ by terrorists is suspected in Europe”, Miami Herald, September 24, 2001, http://web.archive.org/web/20011109160700/www. miami.com/herald/special/news/worldtrade/digdocs/099922.htm. 5 James Doran, “Insider Trading Apparently Based on Foreknowledge of 9/11 Attacks,” London Times, September 18, 2001, archived at http://911research.wtc7. net/cache/sept11/londontimes_insidertrading.html. 6 “Profiting from Disaster,” CBS Evening News, September 19, 2001, archived at http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/09/19/eveningnews/main311834.shtml. 7 Less than a month after the attacks, Bloomberg News reported about suspicious imbalances in a number of sectors: “Bank of America among 38 stocks in SEC’s attack probe,” Bloomberg News, October 3, 2001, archived at http://911research. wtc7.net/cache/sept11/bloombberg_BAamong38.html.

In addition to the suspicious coincidences Trade Center, there is also the extraordinarily heavy pre-9/11 put option activity in the case of the Greenberg-run Marsh & McLennan, which no doubt prompted the SEC to place M & M on its list of 38 suspect companies. Additionally, we have the testimony of Richard Grove and the 1996 national security paper by Maurice Greenberg in which the AIG chief explicitly endorsed a policy of harboring drug traffickers, money launderers, even murderers, in the ill-conceived interests of national security. To this evidence I would add a relevant factoid: Although in 2001 the US insurance industry as a whole suffered through one of its worst years on record, AIG’s immense profitability continued and hardly lost a beat. Whereas the rest of the industry paid out some $40 billion in insurance settlements as a result of the 9/11 attacks, AIG reported a handsome $5.36 billion profit for the year; which was only a slight decline from the $5.64 billion profit AIG posted in 2000.1 Even subtracting Marsh & McLennan’s $126 million in losses, the Greenberg family beat the trends in 2001. All of the above, I would argue, calls for a closer look at Maurice Greenberg and AIG. Although the following discussion will range beyond 9/11, I believe the digression is justified by the overwhelming evidence for criminality, which further supports our darkest suspicions about 9/11. can International Underwriters before assuming its current name), the first western insurance firm in the Far East. From the start, the company’s international scope of operations was ideally suited for intelligence gathering. In 1939, the Japanese invasion of China compelled Starr to relocate to New York, where in 1943 he joined with Office of Strategic Services chief William “Wild Bill” Donovan to form a special insurance unit to gather war-time intelligence about Nazi Germany and Japan. During the war, the OSS actually shared Starr’s offices in New York City. The special unit used Starr’s connections in China, including his Shanghai newspaper, as a spy network. Meanwhile, the agents back in New York sifted through mountains of insurance documents for blueprints of enemy bomb plants, the design of the Tokyo water supply, timetables for tide changes, and other details about shipping and manufacturing which aided the Allied war effort. As World War II drew to a close, the special unit investigated how the Nazis might try to launder their assets via phony insurance policies.2 Maurice Greenberg’s father had begun as Cornelius Starr’s chauffeur in Shanghai, which explains the younger Greenberg’s entry into the Starr empire.

Cornelius recognized Maurice’s promise from an early age, paid for his education, and later brought him into the business. In 1962, Starr picked Maurice Greenberg to manage AIG’s holdings in the US, which were not doing well at the time. Greenberg administered a quick turnaround, and in 1968 he succeeded Starr as head of AIG.3 The next year, Maurice issued a public stock offering and began to expand the company. According to various sources, Greenberg was a longtime confidant of Ronald Reagan’s CIA Director William Casey, who had headed up the Securities and Exchange Commission under Richard Nixon. After his appointment, Casey attempted to recruit Greenberg to be his deputy at CIA, but Greenberg declined, preferring to remain at AIG.4 Once, in a New York Times interview, Casey mentioned Greenberg as one of the few individuals outside of government whom he relied on for advice.5 Henry Kissinger was another friend and client. In 1987, Greenberg appointed Kissinger as chairman of AIG’s advisory board.6 For years, both men lobbied China’s leaders to open the country to western investment, though Kissinger’s role is of course more widely known. In 1980, the Chinese finally granted Greenberg a license to sell insurance in Beijing, and in 1996 AIG reoccupied the same Shanghai offices originally used by Cornelius Starr.7 Under Greenberg’s leadership, AIG generated profits at a rate that blew away the competition. Over a ten-year period, from 1988 to 1998, AIG’s earnings compounded at an average rate of 14% , an impressive figure in a business that tends to be cyclical. While the rest of the insurance industry suffered periodic ups and downs, AIG behaved more like a “growth” company. Its consistently high earnings wowed investors. Some compared AIG to a perpetual money-making machine. In a column, David Schiff, publisher of an insurance industry newsletter, wrote that, “AIG is to the insurance business what the Yankees are to baseball.” 8 The comparison was based on more than whimsy. Rumor had it that Maurice “Hank” Greenberg drew his nickname from the first Jewish superstar of American professional sports: baseball’s “Hammerin’ Hank” Greenberg, a native New Yorker whom the Yankee’s had recruited in 1929, before deciding on another first baseman named Lou Gehrig. Hammerin’ Hank ended up playing for the Detroit Tigers. How did AIG beat the trends? Writing in 1998, Schiff opined, “No one quite knows the answer.

Some who follow AIG have told us they can’t really analyze it.”9 Many investors did not bother to try. They simply accepted the fact that Greenberg was brilliant, and that AIG was somehow unique. The view expressed in 2002 by Morgan Stanley analyst Alice Shroeder was typical: “What investors really want is for Hank to become immortal.”10 Many also felt that way about Bernie Madoff, but there were significant differences: AIG was no Ponzi scheme. Yet, whereas other large insurance firms like State Farm were fairly simple to understand, AIG, by comparison, was “fabulously complex,” virtually impenetrable from the outside. The reason: AIG had hundreds of affiliates spread among one hundred thirty countries, and did most of its business offshore, beyond the scrutiny of US regulators. The Wall Street Journal once referred to AIG as a “black box” (likewise characterizing Enron). This probably helps to explain why Greenberg and AIG remained untouchable for so long. In the spring of 2005, when the dust finally settled, it had become clear that AIG also lost money in the insurance business, but had obscured the fact through a myriad of creative accounting schemes which transformed AIG’s underwriting (business) losses to investment (capital) losses, a slick way to enhance its corporate balance sheets. Insiders recalled one of Greenberg’s favorite expressions: “All I want in life is an unfair advantage.”11 After 9/11, however, it gradually became clear that not even AIG insiders were privy to some of the decisions being made at the top. In 2002, an internal audit committee reported that AIG’s financial accounting was suspect.12 Later that year, the Securities and Exchange Commission uncovered evidence of securities fraud. In 2000, AIG had marketed an insurance product that enabled a company named Brightpoint Inc. to conceal $11.9 million in losses.13 When the case was settled, the SEC doubled AIG’s fine to $10 million because CEO Maurice Greenberg refused to cooperate. One of Greenberg’s tactics was to stall the investigation by delaying the transfer of subpoenaed documents, including one internal whitepaper that “completely contradicted everything they’d been saying about how this was just the fault of one guy who wasn’t getting supervised.”14 Such scams were evidently company policy. In subsequent weeks, even as AIG sought to portray the Brightpoint case as an isolated incident, federal investigators uncovered another phony transaction that enabled a subsidiary of PNC Financial Services to remove problem loans and assets from its balance sheet, thus enhancing its financial position. AIG paid a $115 million fine.

AIG paid a $115 million fine. But this was only the beginning. Soon, both AIG and Marsh & McLennan were in the crosshairs of a state probe launched by New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer. In October 2004, Spitzer sued Marsh for bid rigging and numerous other fraudulent accounting practices. As the investigation widened, several other insurance companies were also named, including Ace Limited (run by Greenberg’s son Evan) and Hartford.15 Spitzer pointedly refused to negotiate with Marsh’s CEO, Jeffrey Greenberg, whom the attorney general accused of stonewalling. The apple, as they say, falls close to the tree. In the end, the younger Greenberg was forced to step down, and Marsh paid $850 million in restitution. Two AIG executives pled guilty to criminal charges. It is notable that Marsh & McLennan purchased Kroll from AIG for $1.9 billion in July 2004, several months before Spitzer’s lawsuit. At the time, Kroll’s CEO was Michael Cherkasky, who years earlier had been Spitzer’s boss at the Manhattan district attorney’s office.16 Cherkasky joined Kroll in 1994, became CEO in 2001, and replaced Jeffrey Greenberg as CEO of Marsh when the younger Greenberg was forced out in late 2004.17 Thus, it was Cherkasky who negotiated the final settlement with Spitzer. Spitzer, whose reputation was squeaky-clean at the time, went on to become governor of New York; but was himself forced to resign in disgrace in March 2008 after being outed as a regular client of a prostitution escort service. The investigation into Spitzer, a married father of three, began when his bank informed the US Treasury Department about suspicious activity in one of his personal accounts. When investigators examined the transactions, they learned that the recipients were apparent shell companies associated with the escort service, to which Spitzer evidently had subscribed since his days as Attorney General.18 By early 2005, separate SEC and Department of Justice investigations were closing in on Maurice Greenberg. By this point, the AIG board was also pressuring Greenberg to name a successor and step down. But Greenberg, who was approaching his 80th birthday, had no intention of relinquishing control of the company he had dominated for thirty-seven years. Hank had always viewed regulators In 1996, for instance, when the state of Delaware launched an investigation of AIG’s bizarre relationship with a Barbados-based reinsurance company named Coral Re, instead of cooperating Greenberg rang up the Delaware insurance commissioner and gave her a tongue-lashing over the telephone.

Greenberg also apparently sent Kroll detectives to harass the state regulators. The get-tough strategy produced the intended result. Even though state laws had been broken, Delaware had no stomach for a fight, and the regulators drew back. In the end, AIG got off with a mildly worded reprimand, and was not even required to pay a fine. When Coral Re was dissolved, as per the settlement, AIG shifted its business to several new shell companies molded upon the form of the defunct reinsurer. Greenberg also resorted to Kroll after AIG’s general counsel Michael Joye resigned in 1992 to protest fraudulent accounting practices. Joye kept the facts secret for many years, but here is the gist: In the early 1990s Joye was evidently shocked to learn that AIG was cheating several states, including New York, out of tens of millions in workers’ compensation funds. Moreover, it was happening with the full knowledge and consent of CEO Greenberg. After conducting his own internal investigation, Joye sent Greenberg a bluntly worded memo informing him that AIG’s “intentional violations” could lead to “criminal fraud and racketeering charges,” in addition to exposing the company to astronomical civil penalties.20 Joye determined that for AIG to comply with regulations, the company “would have to hire about forty new people to do filings properly. It would also have to charge clients more and pay ‘much higher’ assessment fees.” But according to the New York Times, Greenberg was not interested. When the issue came up in a meeting, Greenberg asked, “Are we legal?” An employee responded, “If we were legal we wouldn’t be in business.” Hearing this, “M.R.G. [Greenberg] began laughing and that was the end of it.”21 After Joye tended his resignation, Greenberg sent Kroll a copy of Joye’s personnel file. It is not known what Kroll operatives did with it, but the case illustrates Greenberg’s temperament and autocratic style. By early 2005, AIG’s directors were pursuing their own internal investigation, which eventually led offshore to several Greenbergcontrolled corporations that were a part of the AIG empire. One was the Starr Investment Corporation (SICO), a mysterious holding company which dated to AIG’s original founding by Cornelius Starr. The other firm, C.V.

Both SICO and C.V. Starr held substantial amounts of AIG stock, and were used by Greenberg to reward top AIG executives. But C.V. Starr was also reserved for an inner circle who received lavish compensation.22 The inner group included Howard Smith, AIG’s chief financial officer, and Mike Murphy, SICO’s treasurer. Smith had previously worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting giant that for many years conducted AIG’s annual audits. The final showdown began on March 23, 2005, when a team of AIG lawyers arrived in Bermuda to examine SICO records and conduct interviews. The same facility housed both SICO and AIG employees. Martin Sullivan had already replaced Greenberg as AIG’s CEO; though Greenberg still remained as chairman. By this point, a rift was developing between Greenberg’s supporters and the rest of the board, all of whom wanted the public relations disaster simply to end. The plot thickened when the directors issued a company-wide order to cooperate with regulators. The next day, AIG employees in the company’s Dublin, Ireland office (also shared with SICO) seized a SICO computer and placed it under lock and key. Things quickly escalated. Mike Murphy, a Greenberg loyalist with a passkey, led a group of SICO employees into the Bermuda office under cover of night, and hustled eightytwo boxes of SICO documents out of the building to a separate location. SICO was incorporated in Panama, a major money-laundering center, and there was concern that Murphy was about to move evidence beyond the reach of US law enforcement. The next day, an SEC official in New York received a message: “Looks like they’re destroying documents in Bermuda.”23 It was the last straw. In subsequent months, the court proceedings played out in the press. The details gradually emerged about AIG’s largest deception: a $500 million deal “in which various AIG insiders staged an elaborate artificial transaction with the Gen Re Corporation,” a major reinsurer owned by Warren Buffet. AIG ostensibly bought $600 million in reinsurance from Gen Re for a $500 premium, indicating a risk of $100 million.24 However, because Greenberg wanted no risk exposure, the deal’s “purported terms were all undone” by his staff “in undisclosed side agreements” that rendered the transaction “a sham,” according to the SEC, which claimed that papers had been altered to distort the nature of the transaction.25 Buffet’s company provided records to Spitzer", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:35:6c74416307b5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4944, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 36, "text": "Re Corporation,” a major reinsurer owned by Warren Buffet.

The records showed that AIG’s purpose had been to generate a large tax write-off in order to make the company look more prosperous than it was. The documents also proved Greenberg’s personal involvement.26 One of the investigators told the New York Times that the intent may have been “to mask the activities of murky offshore entities that AIG used extensively during Mr. Greenberg’s tenure at the company.” In 2006, AIG reached a $1.6 billion settlement with state and federal authorities: the largest fine ever paid by any financial services company in US history.27 In February 2008, four former executives of Gen Re, and one from AIG, were convicted of conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and making false statements to the SEC.28 It is important to understand that Maurice Greenberg is not some run-of-the-mill hoodlum. As noted, he served as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is a director of the New York Stock Exchange, is the vice-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, and is a member of the Trilateral Commission. He also served as vicechairman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and is the Director of the Institute for International Economics, is the Director of the US-China Business Council, the vice-chairman of the US-ASEAN Business Council, the Director of Project Hope, founding chairman of the US-Philippine Business Committee, and, until his forced retirement, was a Trustee of the Asia Society. Nor does this pretend to be a comprehensive list of Greenberg’s bona fides. After Hank’s departure from AIG, the new CEO Martin Sullivan told the press that the insurance giant would now prosper “with the right controls and checks and balances in place, and the right level of compliance.”29 As we know, however, things turned out rather differently. By 2008, AIG was in dire financial straits, largely because of the company’s exposure to the sub-prime mortgage crisis, the predictable outcome of no regulation of derivatives. By September 16, 2008, AIG stock had fallen by more than 95% : from a high of $70.13 to just $1.25 /share. For the year, AIG reported a $99 billion loss, and received a controversial $85 billion bailout.30 Greenberg pointed an accusatory finger at the current directors, and told the press that AIG’s sales of credit default swaps had exploded after he left.

Sullivan denied this, insisting that AIG actually stopped writing credit default swaps in 2005. By March 2009, AIG’s federal bailout had expanded to $150 billion, making it the largest single bailout by far in US history. AIG also set another dubious record when it posted a $61.7 billion loss for the final three months of 2008, the largest quarterly loss in corporate history.31 That same month, AIG announced that it would disperse $1.2 billion in bonus packages to its employees, seventy-three of whom would receive checks of at least $1 million.32 Not surprisingly, the bonus announcement stirred public outrage. But the press failed to ask the really important questions. The investigations of the Greenberg empire showed that AIG was not that different from the rest of the industry: AIG also lost money, at times, in the insurance business. Given that AIG managed its risks by ceding as much as 70% of its premiums to various reinsurers, this means that most of AIG’s insurance revenue was unavailable for investment. Nor can the remaining 30% account for AIG’s impressive earnings over many years.33 So, how did Maurice Greenberg manage for so long to produce a silk purse from a sow’s ear? Did Greenberg succumb to the temptations of the powerful, and step over the line? What is clear is that AIG’s offshore dealings were key to the company’s profitability, even during the downturns that affected the rest of the industry but to which AIG seemed largely immune. David Schiff, a Greenberg admirer, put it this way: “AIG’s unique global franchise obscured the reality of the company’s financial condition.”34 Former LAPD narcotics detective Michael Ruppert arrived at a different conclusion. In August 2001, just weeks before 9/11, Ruppert posted an article exploring possible AIG involvement in the drug trade.35 Ruppert was astounded to learn that Coral Talavera Baca, the wife (or girlfriend, it is not clear which) of Medellin drug lord Carlos Lehder was at the time employed at AIG’s San Francisco office, ostensibly as a legal consultant, a position for which Talavera had neither the requisite training nor the credentials. What was she doing there? Talavera’s husband, Carlos Lehder, was one of the central figures in the notorious Medellin drug cartel led by Pablo Escobar, which in the mid-1980s grew into the world’s largest cocaine-smuggling ring. Shortly after Lehder’s 1987 arrest in a Columbian jungle, he reportedly cut a deal with US officials that allowed him to keep much of his estimated $2.5 billion fortune amassed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:37:528a7de2da1c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4946, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 38, "text": "consultant, a position for which Talavera had neither the requisite training nor the credentials.

Shortly after Lehder’s 1987 arrest in a Columbian jungle, he reportedly cut a deal with US officials that allowed him to keep much of his estimated $2.5 billion fortune amassed from the drug trade.37 Lehder was extradited to the US where he entered a witness protection program. But why would the US government negotiate with a man who had been “public enemy number one”? Lehder and his cohorts in Medellin are believed to have ordered the assassination of numerous Columbian officials, newspaper editors, journalists, informants, as well as six hundred policemen. But the cartel is perhaps best known for the grisly attack on the country’s Palace of Justice in November 1985 that left nearly one hundred people dead, including eleven of Columbia’s supreme court justices. No mistake, Lehder was a bad apple. Although Lehder testified for US prosecutors at the 1992 trial of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, his testimony proved of little value to the prosecution. According to knowledgeable sources, Noriega’s conviction was a foregone conclusion. Some wondered why the US was so interested in Noriega in the first place, since Lehder was a much bigger fish in the drug world. Alfred McCoy, a respected historian of the drug trade, believes that the US prosecution of Noriega had nothing to do with curbing the drug trade and everything to do with projecting US power in Central America. Noriega’s crime was that he had turned nationalist, developed his own power base, and was pursuing an independent path for Panama, much like his predecessor General Omar Torrijos, who died in a mysterious plane crash possibly orchestrated by the CIA.39 But there is also more to the story. George H.W. Bush probably ordered the December 1989 invasion of Panama and the arrest of Noriega to clean up his own mess, that is, to protect his own political rear. It was Bush as CIA director who had first put Noriega on the Agency payroll. According to investigator Joseph Trento, Noriega was in possession of highly compromising information about the Bush-led CIA’s first attempt to finance covert operations in this hemisphere with profits from the drug trade, just as it had done in Southeast Asia many years before. For instance, Noriega knew all about Operation Watchtower, a highly illegal mission in 1975-76 involving US Special Forces teams that were sent into the jungles of northern Columbia to set up transmitters enabling dozens of aircraft loaded with narcotics to fly from Bogota into Panama undetected by radar. The drug money was then laundered through Panamanian banks and the cash used to arm factions in Columbia deemed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:38:97253efca512", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4947, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "drug trade, just as it had done in Southeast Asia many years before.

The drug money was then laundered through Panamanian banks and the cash used to arm factions in Columbia deemed friendly to the CIA. Once in custody, Noriega’s chances of damaging Bush were nil. At his trial, Noriega’s only defense was that he had been working for the CIA. He claimed that he had been paid $10 million for his services. But the judge ruled that “information about the content of the discrete [CIA] operations in which Noriega had engaged in exchange for the alleged payments was irrelevant to his defense” and would only “confuse the issues before the jury.”40 Three years after the Noriega trial, Lehder complained in a letter to US District Judge William Hoeveler of Miami that he had been double-crossed by the US government. Weeks later, according to eyewitnesses, Lehder was whisked away in the dead of night from the witness protection center at Mesa, Arizona. He was not seen again for ten years, when he appeared in a Florida courtroom in 2005 to appeal his life-plus-135-years prison sentence. The judge dismissed his appeal out of hand. No surprise there. But what about the $2.5 billion in assets that Lehder reportedly retained? Nearly eleven years after 9/11, the questions raised on the eve of the attack by Mike Ruppert about Baca’s connections with AIG, and AIG’s possible involvement in the drug trade, remain unanswered. But the Baca connection is not the only evidence of illicit activity. Consider the strange case of Coral Re. t is curious that Maurice Greenberg chose to expand AIG into I financial services in 1987, the year of Lehder’s arrest in Columbia. The timing corresponds with a sharp upsurge in the revenues of the international drug trade at this time, which by the late 1980s exceeded an estimated trillion dollars a year.42 That same year, AIG also entered into the strange relationship with Barbados-based Coral Re. The details, as I have noted, came to light in the mid-1990s when Delaware state regulators discovered that AIG secretly controlled Coral Re. In the insurance world, companies often reduce their exposure to underwriting losses by passing on a percentage of the risk to insurance wholesalers, also known as reinsurance companies. As payment, the reinsurance companies receive a percentage of the premiums. Wholesalers are generally based offshore in places like Bermuda, Barbados, the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, where taxes are minimal or nonexistent and accounting records can legally be kept secret.

Wholesalers are generally based offshore in places like Bermuda, Barbados, the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, where taxes are minimal or nonexistent and accounting records can legally be kept secret. Although state laws in the US require insurance companies to keep a certain amount of capital in reserve to cover losses, the amount is less if a company has reinsurance. AIG was a major user of reinsurance because it specialized in high-risk policies. US law, however, requires that both parties to such a transaction, i.e., the insurer and reinsurer, must be independent of one another, for obvious reasons. If the two are affiliated, then reinsurance provides no true risk reduction. This was the issue with Coral Re, and what had attracted state regulators in the first place, because despite persistent denials by AIG, Coral Re turned out to be a shell company, created by AIG for reasons that were never made clear and seem doubly suspicious in retrospect. At the time that Coral Re was established, the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs sent around a confidential memo cautioning those involved to keep the whole business secret. Indeed, the memo stipulated that all copies of the memo were to be returned to Goldman Sachs. When Delaware state regulators nevertheless managed to obtain a copy, they were incredulous. The dozen or so “investors” who lent their names to the enterprise put up no money of their own, yet were guaranteed a profit, a sweet deal if ever there was one.43 Within days of its creation, Coral Re recorded $475 million in losses, which soon topped $1 billion. Between 1987-1993 AIG ceded $1.6 billion of insurance premiums to the new reinsurer. Yet, Coral Re’s total equity capital never exceeded $52 million.44 In addition to being severely under-capitalized, the new company had no actual offices of its own; it was managed by a subsidiary of AIG. Coral Re’s board of directors made no decisions and conducted no business. Rubin’s main “achievement” during his tenure at Treasury was persuading President Bill Clinton to support repeal of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, a key part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal program. Glass-Steagall had created a regulatory firewall between commercial and investment banking, for the soundest of reasons: to prevent conflicts of interest and other abuses within the banking system. But Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan and others on Wall Street viewed the New Deal as an aberration, and in 1999 they brought Clinton around.45 Born and others correctly saw as a threat to the stability of financial markets.46 The defeat of every attempt to regulate derivatives, together with the repeal of Glass-Steagall, opened the floodgates to the wild speculation of the G.W.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:40:4935f63c400d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4949, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 41, "text": "banking, for the soundest of reasons: to prevent conflicts of interest and other abuses within the banking system.

Bush years, and is responsible for the real estate bubble, collateral debt obligations, sub-primes, credit default swaps, legalized skimming rackets and, ultimately, the 2008 global financial meltdown. After Rubin departed from Treasury in July 1999, he joined the board of Citigroup, the largest US bank, which had recently been rocked by several huge money-laundering scandals. One was on the order of a $100 million, and involved the brother of Mexican President Carlos Salinas. Yet, in 2001, under Rubin’s tutelage, Citigroup paid $12 billion to acquire the second largest bank in Mexico, Banamex, whose owner Roberto Hernandez Ramirez was known to be deeply involved in the international drug trade. In December 1998, the daily Por Esto!, Mexico’s third largest newspaper, reported that Ramirez’s estate on the coast of Yucatan was a regular transshipment point for tons of South American cocaine. According to local fishermen, the coke arrived by boat during the night and, after being offloaded, was sent to the US via small planes operating out of a private airstrip on Ramirez’s sizable estate. The property is located on the tip of Punta Pajaros: “Bird Point.”47 So flagrant was the trafficking that local people dubbed it “la peninsula de la coca”: the cocaine peninsula. When Ramirez sued Por Esto! for libel, a Mexican court threw out the case after determining that the evidence for narcotrafficking was genuine.48 A succession of Mexican presidents, including Ernesto Zedillo and Vicente Fox, reportedly vacationed with the drug lord-banker at his lavish estate, as did President Bill Clinton in February 1999.49 Citigroup evidently acquired Banamex to gain easy access to drug money, which many US banks now depend on for liquidity. In 2009, Antonia Maria Costa, head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, told the press that billions of dollars of laundered drug money had saved the US financial system during the 2008 meltdown on Wall Street.50 the Federal Reserve, the second largest bailout after AIG’s.

Others evidently include Bank of America, American Express Bank, Wells Fargo and Wachovia. Recently, Bloomberg reporter Michael Smith learned why US authorities have failed to crack down harder on the big banks’ profiting from the drug trade when he interviewed Jack Blum, a legendary US Senate investigator.53 Said Blum: “There’s no capacity to regulate or punish them [the big banks] because they are too big to be threatened with failure.… They seem … willing to do anything that improves their bottom line, until they’re caught.” Blum called their too-big-to-fail status “a get-out-of-jail-free-card for big banks.”54 However, banks do not become money laundering institutions merely by chance, but thanks to the complicitous involvement of regulators, elements of the US intelligence community, and corrupt US government officials – often at the highest level. As we are about to discover, Hank Greenberg’s decision in 1987 to expand AIG into financial services also corresponds with other developments half-way around the world, namely, the ouster of Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, whose fabulous wealth, like AIG’s bottom line between 1988-2000, has stirred considerable speculation. astation,” Insurance Journal, September 10, 2004.

By that time, the US president had his own dark history. Clinton’s complicity with the international drug trade began during his Arkansas governorship. For it so happens that one of the original investors in AIG’s shell entity, Coral Re, was the Arkansas Development and Finance Authority (ADFA), created in 1985 by then-governor Bill Clinton to promote job creation in the state; but which is known to have laundered hundreds of millions of dollars of drug money during Ronald Reagan’s Contra war against the Nicaraguan Sandinistas. The story of the CIA’s arms pipeline through the small town of Mena in western Arkansas is no secret and has been public knowledge for many years. The fact that the vast majority of Americans still know nothing about it is an indictment of our so-called free press, which has regularly failed to inform on many issues vital to our democracy. Although this operation was but a small part of the broader Contra war effort, the Mena story was, and continues to be, political dynamite because of its direct linkage to Clinton and also George H.W. Bush. Terry Reed and John Cummings, Compromised (Landham, MD: Clandestine Publishing, 1995). The Mena operation came about as a result of 1982’s so-called Boland amendment, passed by a Democratically controlled Congress. It was actually a series of amendments intended to tie President Reagan’s hands: laws blocking him from supporting the counter-revolutionary Contra war in Nicaragua. Frustrated by Congress, the Reagan administration resorted to other means. In 1984-85, CIA flight instructors trained Contra pilots at a secret airstrip in the Ouachita National Forest, located about twelve miles north of Mena, Arkansas.

Meanwhile, CIA pilots, including William Cooper and Barry Seal, airlifted arms out of Mena to Contra bases in Central America. They flew planes owned by Southern Air Transport, the largest of several CIA proprietary airlines. The pilots returned with duffel bags full of cash, which they air-dropped at night at a ranch outside of Little Rock. Some of the cash may have originated from the sale of arms, but most of it came from the drug trade. Clinton cronies retrieved the duffel bags and washed the dirty money through the ADFA with the assistance of another Clinton confidante, Dan Lasater, who ran a local bonding agency. Lasater’s personal chauffeur was none other than Roger Clinton, the governor’s brother. Just to show how closely-knit the Clinton political machine was, much of ADFA’s legal work was handled by the Rose Law Firm, which employed Hillary Clinton. At that time. Arkansas-style politics was one big happy family. Ibid., p. 67. Some of the millions washed through ADFA probably financed new industries that created jobs benefiting the people of Arkansas. But much of it went as “preferred loans” to arms manufacturers involved in the Contra resupply effort. According to whistleblower author Terry Reed, one of the CIA flight instructors, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North orchestrated the Mena operation out of the White House “basement.” At the time, however, Reed knew him only as “John Cathey.” In his remarkable memoir, Compromised, published in 1995, Reed writes that he was shocked to learn that his friend and fellow pilot, Barry Seal, was bringing in planeloads of cocaine, some of which ended up in the hands of Roger Clinton, later convicted of narcotrafficking. Seal was a legendary figure, and is believed to have personally smuggled somewhere between $3 billion and $5 billion worth of drugs into the US, making him the largest drug smuggler in US history. Yet, Seal was no thug. By all accounts he was a likable, if haunted, individual. This is according to a 1986 letter from the Louisiana attorney general to then-US Attorney General Edwin Meese; quoted in Sally Denton and Roger Morris, “The Crimes of Mena,” Penthouse, July 1995. This exposé was to have appeared in the Washington Post, but was pulled at the last minute. Seal was certainly a highly skilled pilot.

In 1984, Seal faced jail time after a drug-smuggling conviction, but he stayed out of prison by turning informant. Subsequently, he helped the Drug Enforcement Agency prosecute several cases of narcotrafficking. Seal also provided evidence leading to the indictment of Medellin drug lords Carlos Lehder, Pablo Escobar, Jorge Ochoa and Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. Meanwhile, he flew arms out of Mena for the CIA. “The Drug War and Cold War Collide,” Frontline, July 17, 1984. But Seal’s flying days came to an abrupt end on February 19, 1986, outside a federal halfway house in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Seal was sitting in his car, when two hit-men from the Medellin drug cartel sprayed him with automatic weapons fire. In 1985, Seal had participated in a sting operation purportedly linking the leftist Sandinistas to Columbian cocaine traffickers, part of Ronald Reagan’s ideological war against the Communists. Daniel Hopsicker, Barry and the Boys (Eugene, OR: Madcow Press, 2001). Seal’s cover was blown when the White House leaked details to exploit the sting’s propaganda value. Claiming he was acting on orders, Oliver North told Frontline that he briefed a US Senator, who passed the information to the press, thus masking the White House as the source of the leak. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/ frontline/shows/drugs/special/north.html Seal’s attorney Lewis Unglesby believes that a federal judge effectively set his client up for the hit by confining him to the halfway house, which made Seal an easy target. Unglesby says he was with Seal shortly before his murder when Seal make a direct call to Vice President George “Poppy” Bush; Seal was irate because the Internal Revenue Service had just seized his property. According to Unglesby, Seal told Bush, “If you don’t get these IRS assholes off my back, I’m going to blow the whistle on the Contra scheme.” The details were confirmed in a phone conversation with me on January 28, 2011, by Richard A. Sharpstein, the lawyer who defended Miguel Velez, one of the Columbian hit-men. Also see Barry and the Boys, p. 442. One week later, a federal judge ordered Seal confined to the halfway house. Within days, he was dead. Unglesby’s view is supported by evidence obtained by New Orleans attorney Sam Dalton, legal counsel to the Columbian hit-men who murdered Seal.

For the details go to http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKseal.htm. When I spoke with attorney Richard A. Sharpstein, he confirmed all of the above and told me something more. According to Sharpstein, the assassins claimed to have spoken to a US military officer who not only approved the hit, but actually gave them the address of the halfway house. Sharpstein is convinced that Barry Seal was about to go public with the evidence in the boxes, more than enough to incriminate both Vice President Bush and Governor Clinton.

When criminals evade justice should we not expect theircriminal activities to burgeon, over time, and become ous and straightforward. When society fails to hold wicked men accountable, what is to stop them from proliferating their criminal behavior, even to the point of undermining an entire nation? All the more so when the criminals in question are captains of industry, finance, and government. It is a fact that despite the unprecedented security failures on September 11, 2001, none of the officials responsible, at the time, for protecting the US were subsequently held accountable. None were disciplined, sacked, nor even reprimanded. The only “just deserts” meted out after 9/11 were awards and promotions. One prime example was CIA Director George Tenet who, despite having presided over the greatest security failure in US history, was awarded the nation’s highest honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Another important CIA player in the systematic failure that day, Richard Blee, chief of the Bin Laden unit (who had been charged with keeping Tenet briefed), was subsequently made station chief in Kabul, an important post where he promptly launched a regime of renditions and torture.1 These are examples of accountability-in-reverse, a phenomenon that is more than suspicious and, in my opinion, constitutes prima facie evidence for collusion in the attacks. Although such a possibility ought to be obvious, it has continued to be politically out-of-bounds here in the US. Throughout the decade after 9/11, the journalists and talking heads who dominate political discourse in the “land of the free” were strangely reticent to ask the key questions. How do we account for their reluctance? Again, the same blunt answer flies back in our face: the most rational explanation is that the prime suspects include highly placed Instead of viewing 9/11 through the standard lens, i.e., as a terrorist attack, E.P. Heidner chose to study that horrible day as a detective would in the investigation of a crime. In this, Heidner took his cue from several skeptics who had suggested that the attacks were staged to cover up financial criminality. After conducting his own six-year investigation, Heidner posted the results in 2008: a heavily documented 57-page paper titled “Collateral Damage,” in which he argues that the skeptics basically had it right.2 Heidner’s research convinced him that a number of individuals who had escaped justice for Iran Contragate in the mid 1980s became emboldened, and hatched an even more outrageous plot at the end of the Cold War for the purpose of eliminating Russia, once and for all, as a potential future challenger to the sole remaining global superpower. Heidner argues that in 1991 a cabal of bankers and intelligence spooks led by H.W. Bush financed this clandestine operation with $240 billion in 10-year securities that, as it happened, were scheduled to come due in September 2001. The securities were backed by a secret CIA fund known simply as the Hammer Fund, one of a number of secret slush funds established by the US during the Cold War for a variety of reasons, some of them arguably legitimate. The Cold War against “international Communism” and the Soviet Union actually began before the end of World War II, but by 1991 almost fifty years of state secrecy had enabled any number of opportunists to abuse the secret funds for dubious ends, including their own personal enrichment.

Heidner theorizes that the G.H.W. Bush-led covert economic war against Russia in the 1990s was four-pronged, and included: the actual theft (through collusion of ex-KGB and other Soviet officials) in 1991 of all the gold in the Russian treasury, a coup against Gorbachev later that same year (which, incidentally, failed), a scheme to debase the ruble, and finally, a complex initiative to take control of key sectors of the Russian economy, especially the country’s vast oil and gas reserves. Heidner writes: “At its inception the program was conducted within the policy framework of the U.S. Government as defined by several Executive Orders authored by Vice President Bush and signed by President Ronald Reagan. There is good reason to believe that the plan was initially formulated by Reagan’s CIA Director, William Casey…. Many of the program operatives were probably engaged through official CIA and National Security channels.”3 Heidner reasons that the operation, however, soon crossed over into illegality, probably out of expedience, thus repeating the pattern of the October Surprise and Iran-Contra: covert operations which subverted the US Constitution and violated international law. Although Heidner does not mention the Bosnian War, it is also likely that the same individuals in the US power elite came to view the ethnic strife in the former Yugoslavia as yet another opportunity. As noted (see Chapter Five, note 49), Bill Clinton had been compromised from the days of his Arkansas governorship and thus, was in no position as president to pursue an independent, let alone an enlightened, foreign policy. So, it should be no surprise that Clinton’s policy in the Balkans amounted to neither. The Bosnian war pitted US-backed Islamic jihadists, including fighters loyal to Osama bin Laden, along with members of the KLA, a Kosovo terrorist group with known ties to the drug trade, against a Serbian nation whose only natural ally was fellow Slavic Russia.4 It is hardly surprising that astute observers of the war identified Moscow as the West’s ultimate target. According to Heidner, the covert economic war against Russia eventually sparked at least nine independent investigations by federal agencies and foreign governments into securities fraud and money laundering. Any one of which might have exposed the operation and the conspirators. He goes on to argue that the growing threat of exposure through the decade of the 1990s eventually compelled the conspirators to take their clandestine operation to the next level. Circa 1998,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:49:31bd4fe650fb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4958, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 50, "text": "war identified Moscow as the West’s ultimate target.

He goes on to argue that the growing threat of exposure through the decade of the 1990s eventually compelled the conspirators to take their clandestine operation to the next level. Circa 1998, Heidner says, the group hatched plans for a false-flag terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon to destroy critical evidence, shut down the ongoing investigations, divert attention away from themselves, and generally cover their tracks. The diabolical plot may also have served other converging interests, one of them being to create a pretext for a vastly expanded use of US military force worldwide. The neocons boldly outlined such a plan in their strategy paper, Rebuilding America’s Defenses, which went up on the Internet in September 2000, a year before 9/11. The paper includes a passage that is chilling in retrospect: “The process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.”5 Heidner agrees with my conclusion that the point of impact on the newly renovated west wing of the Pentagon was no coincidence (see Chapter Three), although be argues that the primary target was not the Accounting Office but the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). According to Heidner, the ONI had been investigating crimes associated with the plundering of Russia. What we know for sure is that a month before the attacks, the ONI inexplicably moved to its new quarters in the outer “E” ring, from a much less vulnerable location within the Pentagon. On 9/11, ONI suffered total destruction: thirty-nine out of forty ONI staffers died, including the entire chain of command.6 Heidner argues that specific offices at the World Trade Center were targeted, as well, especially Cantor-Fitzgerald, the leading US security broker. Cantor-Fitzgerald had offices in the North Tower (on floors 101-105) above the impact point of American Airlines 11, and lost more personnel in the attacks (661 employees) by a wide margin than any other occupant of the WTC. Heidner believes that a little-known FBI office on the 23rd floor of the North Tower was likewise targeted, as evidenced by numerous eyewitness accounts of explosions on the 22nd floor.7 Another security broker, Garbon Inter-Capital, had offices on the 25th floor of WTC-1, just above this zone, and may also have been a target. The early reports of near-total destruction of this portion of the North Tower, 70 floors below the AA 11 impact zone, is hard to explain by jet fuel-caused fires. Flight 175 struck at 9:03 a.m. Eurobrokers also suffered heavy loss of life (i.e., 61", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:50:e1093b35b18c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4959, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 51, "text": "as evidenced by numerous eyewitness accounts of explosions on the 22nd floor.7 Another security broker, Garbon Inter-Capital, had offices on the 25th floor of WTC-1, just above this zone, and may also have been a target.

Flight 175 struck at 9:03 a.m. Eurobrokers also suffered heavy loss of life (i.e., 61 fatalities). All together, brokerages accounted for 41% of the total casualties at the WTC. Another target may have been the actual securities themselves. According to the Federal Register, the attacks destroyed unknown thousands of certificates stored in vaults maintained by the broker-dealers.8 Heidner argues that the offices of securities brokers were specifically targeted and offers the following rationale: “a critical mass of brokers from the major government security brokerages in the Twin Towers had to be eliminated to create chaos in the government securities market. A situation needed to be created wherein $240 billion dollars of covert securities could be electronically ‘cleared’ without anyone asking questions.”9 Another likely target was the El Dorado Task force, an interagency money-laundering watchdog group led by the US Customs Service and the Internal Revenue Service. At the time of 9/11, the interagency task force was based in the US Customs Office in Building Six, and was responsible for coordinating federal and state money laundering investigations.10 Its location in Building Six is noteworthy, because the destruction of WTC-6 remains one of the strangest mysteries from 9/11. Aerial photos of the WTC site taken after the attack show an enormous cavity in the middle of Building Six. The pictures are extraordinary, and raise obvious questions. The hole has been compared to a crater.11 What, other than a huge explosion, could have hollowed out the core of this eight-story building? According to the official story, WTC-6 was wrecked by falling debris during the collapse of the adjacent North Tower. But subsequent inside photos of the huge cavity fail to show any of the tell-tale exterior columns or other identifiable debris from the North Tower. Indeed, judging from the available photos, the cavity was remarkably free of any type of debris. After 9/11, an official FEMA photographer, Kurt Sonnenfeld, descended with several others into the wreckage of Building Six. The team located the US Customs vault in the basement and, according to Sonnenfeld, were surprised to find the vault door sprung partly open. They managed to wriggle inside, and when they did were shocked to find it was completely bare.12 Evidently, someone had cleaned it out before the attacks. Sonnenfeld’s electrifying report about WTC-6, posted in 2009, strongly points to foreknowledge and is powerful supporting evidence for Heidner’s general thesis. Later, Sonnenfeld endured government harassment when he dared to question the official 9/11 story. He and his wife", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:51:7294a743f0b5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4960, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 52, "text": "basement and, according to Sonnenfeld, were surprised to find the vault door sprung partly open.

Later, Sonnenfeld endured government harassment when he dared to question the official 9/11 story. He and his wife emigrated from the US, for this reason, and at last report were living in Argentina. This brings us to the unexplained collapse of WTC-7: a 47-story skyscraper that was untouched by any airliner on 9/11 and, judging from photos and videos, suffered only minor fires on a few floors. Yet, at 5 : 20 P.M . on the afternoon of the attacks, the building dropped into its own footprint at free fall speed.13 Fortunately, we have an excellent video record of the belated collapse of WTC-7 from several different angles, and this remarkable footage is compelling evidence that the building was taken down in a controlled demolition. But why WTC-7? Again, Heidner thinks that several offices in the building were specifically targeted. These include the Securities and Exchange Commission on floors 11, 12 and 13, the Secret Service offices on floors 9 and 10, and the Internal Revenue Service offices on floors 24 and 25. All three agencies suffered the total loss of files and records for ongoing investigations which had been stored in WTC-7. Although SEC officials later refused to discuss how many ongoing cases had been impacted by the attacks, the agency claimed that it lost only two weeks’ worth of computer data which had not been backed up. But New York securities lawyers who practice before the SEC told a different story. One of them, Bill Singer, stated that a case he had pending was settled quickly because so many of the pertinent documents had been destroyed. Said Singer: “Regardless of what the regulators say, they lost a ton of files. In my opinion it was a wholesale loss of documents.”14 It is quite possible that other federal offices were also targeted in WTC-7. The largest CIA facility outside of CIA headquarters at Langley was housed on the building’s 25th floor, and the Department of Defense also had offices in WTC-7.

Admittedly, such a plan would have been fiendishly clever. To sum up, Heidner proposes that at the very time George H.W. him hatched a diabolical scheme involving a secret war chest controlled by the CIA and certain Wall Street bankers: to buy out, undermine, and ultimately wreck the Russian economy; and that while waging this covert program the policymakers overstepped a number of legal boundaries, both at home and abroad, transgressions that came back to haunt them. While it is not yet possible to confirm Heidner’s thesis definitively, it is important to understand that the premise of a secret CIA slush fund is nothing new, and has a sound basis. In his memoirs, Israeli whistleblower Ari Ben-Menashe confirms the existence of one CIA slush fund created in the 1980s during Iran-Contra.15 Ben-Menashe, an Iraqi Jew, served as Israeli PM Yitzhak Shamir’s personal envoy during this momentous period, and was intimately involved in Israel’s secret arms pipeline to Iran, which continued throughout the Iran-Iraq war. Ben-Menashe had access to highly sensitive information, and was one of the primary sources for Seymour Hersh’s 1991 book about Israel’s nuclear weapons program, The Samson Option. According to Hersh, “Ben-Menashe’s account might seem almost too startling to be believed, had it not been subsequently amplified by a second Israeli, who cannot be named.”16 Ben-Menashe’s role as insider gave him a unique perspective on the US arms-for-hostage negotiations with Tehran in 1980, including President Carter’s failed initiatives but also the ultimately “successful” channel secretly arranged by Ronald Reagan’s then campaign chairman William Casey. During World War II, Casey headed the Secret Intelligence Branch of the OSS (the CIA’s predecessor) and, as noted, later became Ronald Reagan’s Director of Central Intelligence. According to Ben-Menashe, the Iranian arms deal, which has become known as the October Surprise, was worked out in secret meetings, starting in August 1980.17 In June 1992, Ben-Menashe told a closed session of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he had been present in Paris in October 1980 for the final round of the secret negotiations with the Iranians. Ben-Menashe explained that he personally witnessed George H.W. Bush, former Director of Central Intelligence, enter the conference room along with William Casey.18 Weeks earlier, Saddam Hussein had invaded southwestern Iran, and, according to Ben-Menashe, the Iranians, desperate for arms, would have gladly released the US embassy hostages immediately if an arms deal could be struck with the Carter administration. As we know, such a deal never materialized. The talks broke down, probably because of Carter’s reluctance to trade arms for hostages.19 Bush and Casey, however, had no such scruples, despite Ronald Reagan’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:53:6ca1e6db6b6d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4962, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 54, "text": "Central Intelligence, enter the conference room along with William Casey.18 Weeks earlier, Saddam Hussein had invaded southwestern Iran, and, according to Ben-Menashe, the Iranians, desperate for arms, would have gladly released the US embassy hostages immediately if an arms deal could be struck with the Carter administration. As we know, such a deal never materialized. The talks broke down, probably because of Carter’s reluctance to trade arms for hostages.19 Bush and Casey, however, had no such scruples, despite Ronald Reagan’s rhetoric to the contrary. Bush and Casey insisted that the hostages must remain in captivity, thus insuring Carter’s defeat in the presidential election. As per the terms of the agreement, the hostages were subsequently released within minutes of Reagan’s presidential inauguration on January 20, 1981. The strange timing elicited hardly a peep from the US press, which apparently was too preoccupied with Reagan’s “decisive” victory over the “inept” Carter to notice. Israel served as middleman, (or “cut out” in spy-speak), and made the actual arms deliveries on behalf of the cabal around Reagan. The deal was not “on behalf of the United States” since this channel was wholly unauthorized, arranged behind the back of President Jimmy Carter. In his memoirs, Ben-Menashe refers to the secret arrangement as the “Joint Committee,” and he names David Kimche as the senior Israeli negotiator who worked closely with the CIA’s Robert Gates on the implementation. The first arms deliveries to Iran commenced in March 1981. I found surprising support for Ben-Menashe’s explosive charges in Bob Gates’ own 1996 memoir, From the Shadows. In 1981 Gates served as CIA director Casey’s chief of staff, and in his memoir he brags that he was “closer to him [Casey] professionally and knew him better than anyone else at CIA or in government.” Gates also writes that he “was in on virtually all of his [Casey’s] meetings.” This surely means that Gates was in the loop on sensitive issues.20 Gates also corroborates Ben-Menashe on another point. He confirms the key role played by the Israeli Mossad agent, David Kimche.21 Gates would go on to become President H.W. Bush’s Director of Central Intelligence. After a profitable stint in the private sector followed by four years as president of Texas A&M University, Gates returned to “public service” in 2006, replacing the embattled Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense. After the Iran-Contra scandal broke in October 1986, an embarrassed Reagan admitted to a stunned American public that he had done what he said he would never do: supply arms to so called terrorists to secure the release of US hostages, in this case hostages kidnapped by Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Incredibly, the secret arms deliveries to Iran via the original channel continued even during the Iran-Contra hearings and sham investigations.23 To this day, the average American remains clueless about this important history. Now to the point: Ben-Menashe claims that the joint Israeli-CIA arms pipeline generated huge profits, and he was in a position to know. At the time, the Israelis were handling the money transfers. The Iranians were desperate for weapons to fend off Saddam Hussein’s well equipped army, and the Israelis made them pay a whopping mark-up ranging from 50% to 400% .24 As a result of this profiteering, cash piled up in a secret Israeli account, and a second parallel CIA account, each of which eventually totaled some $780 million.25 Heidner argues that H.W. Bush used the CIA slush fund to support the August 1991 coup against Gorbachev, and he might be right. Ben-Menashe writes that the CIA slush fund inexplicably ended up in the hands of media mogul Robert Maxwell,26 whom Seymour Hersh outed as a Mossad agent in The Samson Option.27 Maxwell had close ties to H.W. Bush, after being introduced by a mutual friend, Senator John Tower, who was also Maxwell’s business associate.28 As we know, President Reagan had appointed Tower to head up the official commission (that bears his name) charged with the sham investigation of Iran-Contra. Tower knew which questions to ask and, more importantly, which ones to avoid. He could have been briefed about every aspect of the sordid affair by his aide, former Marine Colonel Robert “Bud” MacFarlane, who had played an important role in the secret arms-for-hostages negotiations orchestrated by Casey in 1980.29 Maxwell had large investments in the eastern bloc, and high-level connections that, amazingly, included KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov, the leader of the plot to oust Gorbachev. According to various accounts, Maxwell had contacts with Kryuchkov in the weeks before the coup.30 Former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky claims that the two actually met on Maxwell’s yacht, during this period.31 Maxwell had a long history of money laundering and shady dealings with both the intelligence community and underworld figures, and it is entirely plausible that he served as a bag-man for Bush.32 There are other fishy details.

Senator Tower also died when his commuter plane crashed during a landing approach in Georgia, killing all aboard.33 As in the case of narcotrafficker Barry Seal (see Chapter Five, note 49), people who got close to Bush had a curious way of turning up dead. After the Berlin Wall came down, then-President H.W. Bush as-sured Gorbachev that the US would not expand NATO into eastfication of Germany. However, in retrospect it is clear that the Cold War never ended. At the G-7 summit in June 1990, Bush demanded that Russia and the eastern bloc submit to shock therapy as prescribed by the International Monetary Fund; which, of course, meant auctioning off valuable state industries for pennies on the dollar.34 Russia was true to its word regarding German reunification. However, President Clinton reneged on Bush’s promise and expanded NATO to the Russian frontier. Clinton’s Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, went on tour promoting NATO expansion which, she argued, would stabilize central Europe politically and economically. But more thoughtful critics, such as former Senator Sam Nunn (D-GA), a long-time nuclear policy expert, warned that the consequences would be dire since Moscow would naturally view the eastward expansion of NATO as a grave threat to its national security. Although Clinton (and the US press) made light of Moscow’s fears of encirclement, the critics were correct. The expansion of NATO into Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary was not in the best interests of Europe; far from it. The only beneficiaries were US arms manufacturers and their financial backers on Wall Street, who viewed the break-up of the Soviet bloc as an opportunity to enrich themselves. At the time, the relatively poor nations of eastern Europe could ill afford to purchase advanced US weaponry, a NATO requirement. Decades of communism had devastated their economies, and their top priority should have been to rebuild their infrastructure. Although the US pledged to support their entry in the European Union, which most of western Europe opposed at the time, this enticement was an illusion because the purchase of large quantities of US arms actually slowed their economic recovery. Clinton’s NATO policy set the stage for his successor G.W. Bush’s arguably insane decision to shred the 1972 ABM Treaty and to deploy advanced ABM technology in Poland and the Czech Republic. Although Bush claimed that the ABM system was strictly defensive: to guard against a presumed missile threat from the Mideast, i.e., Iran, the argument was hardly convincing.

Although Bush claimed that the ABM system was strictly defensive: to guard against a presumed missile threat from the Mideast, i.e., Iran, the argument was hardly convincing. As Russian leader Vladimir Putin pointed out, “missile weapons with a range of about five to eight thousand kilometers that really pose a threat to Europe do not exist in any of the so-called problem countries.”35 Retired US Lieutenant General Robert Gard admitted that the ABM deployment in Poland would defend against Iranian missiles and warheads at some unspecified time in the future.36 Implicit in his statement was that Iran had no such missiles, at present. Serious analysts also questioned why the US had not selected a site much closer to Iran, say, for example, in Turkey, or perhaps Kuwait, both US allies. When Putin offered the US the joint-use of a Russian radar site in Azerbaijan, very near the Iranian border, Bush responded with deafening silence.37 A White House spokesman announced that the president had taken ill. But what could Bush say, in any event? Putin had called his bluff, and exposed the real policy. The only logical reason for siting an ABM system in eastern Europe, on Russia’s doorstep, was to “defend” against a Russian nuclear counterattack. Which of course, means that the ABM deployment was part of a broader US plan, probably set in motion during the 1990s, under Clinton, to achieve a nuclear first-strike capability.38 Such a strategy vis a vis Russia, involving an implied threat of nuclear blackmail, goes far beyond even economic warfare. If US leaders were capable of this, then they are truly capable of anything. The CIA Iran/Contra slush fund of $780 million was a substantial sum, certainly large enough to finance a coup or a large covert operation. But it is mere petty-cash compared to the $240 billion in ten-year bonds that, Heidner alleges, came into play in the covert program against Russia. Heidner’s figure is so large, in fact, that initially I dismissed his thesis out of hand, that is, until I learned about another CIA slush fund on a similarly vast scale. This other secret fund came into existence at the close of World War II when US intelligence agents in the Philippines recovered a enormous treasure trove, primarily gold bullion but also substantial quantities of platinum, silver, diamonds, gemstones and priceless artistic treasures.

The atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, plus the fire bombing of Tokyo, have no doubt contributed to this strong impression. But as horrible as those events were (and they were horrible), they were the exceptions to the rule. Most of the cities in Japan survived the war intact, as did most of the nation’s industrial infrastructure. Although the US government has assiduously perpetuated the view that Japan was bankrupted by the war, the truth is exactly the reverse. Despite losing World War II, Japan emerged much richer than before, as a result of having systematically plundered a dozen Asian countries over a period of decades. Have you ever wondered why there was no Marshall Plan in the East, as in Europe? The reason is simple: none was needed; and this also explains Japan’s rapid post-war recovery. While it is true that the Nazis also plundered outrageously, they did so within a much shorter time frame. The Nazi regime lasted less than fifteen years. By contrast, Japan’s fascist march across Asia commenced with the invasion and humiliation of Imperial China in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 and the simultaneous annexation of Korea, and continued through the last days of World War II. The plundered Asian nations, with their long histories and deep distrust of officialdom, contained much more off-the-books gold in private hands than anyone in the West ever imagined. Japan’s plundering of East Asia was well organized and ruthlessly efficient. The Japanese army carried off everything worth taking. Acting under the supervision of royal princes appointed by Emperor Hirohito, they systemically ransacked each nation they occupied, and transferred the wealth back to Japan. After 1943, when US submarines made the sea lanes around Japan impassable, the booty was packed aboard freighters painted to look like hospital ships, and rerouted to the Philippines, where Japanese engineers had secretly begun excavating a network of underground storage sites. The Japanese selected the Philippines because they believed Japan would retain the islands in a post-war peace settlement. Many of the vaults were carved out deep under cathedrals and hospitals, and on former US military bases: on sites the Japanese rightly judged would be excluded from US bombing. When the work was done, the Japanese insured secrecy by entombing the slave laborers who had worked to construct the sites. Tens of thousands of men were buried alive, including US prisoners of war.

When the work was done, the Japanese insured secrecy by entombing the slave laborers who had worked to construct the sites. Tens of thousands of men were buried alive, including US prisoners of war. When the last underground treasure crypts had been completed and packed with gold, over one hundred and seventy Japanese engineers were lured to a “farewell party” inside Tunnel-8 and likewise sealed along with the treasure, even as they drank toasts to Hirohito’s health. Of course, things did not turn out as the princes had hoped. Japan lost control over its colonies, including the Philippines, under the terms of the US-imposed unconditional surrender. Moreover, a team under the command of General Douglas MacArthur soon heard rumors about hidden gold, which were promptly confirmed. The team extracted the locations of a dozen sites by torturing the personal chauffeur of General Yamashita, Japan’s most brilliant military strategist during the war: the man who had conquered Singapore. In the waning days of the conflict, Yamashita had been assigned to organize the defense of the Philippines. The US intelligence community was involved, from the outset. MacArthur’s team included Ed Lansdale, an OSS officer who later became one of the CIA’s most celebrated Cold Warriors. It is strangely fitting that Lansdale launched his inglorious CIA career as a torturer. The team also included a Filipino-American, Severino Garcia Santa Romana, who would also play a key role. Vandenberg who then headed the interim Central Intelligence Group. Lansdale next briefed President Harry Truman, who promptly sent him back to the Philippines accompanied by Robert B. Anderson, one of Secretary of War Henry Stimson’s top advisers. According to the Seagraves, Anderson and MacArthur toured several underground caverns north of Manila, the first to be opened, where they strolled down row after row of gold bars piled to the ceiling.3 Even as the US military was presiding over the initial gold recoveries, Truman made a decision that would prove fateful. It was a decision that he may also have come to regret, given Truman’s belated secondthoughts about the CIA. In 1945, the president decided to keep the plunder secret, off the books.

The name is curious, and may itself have been a calculated piece of deception, another false flag, because although recovered Nazi war loot was also folded into the trust, the Japanese hoard made up by far the largest portion. US secrecy in the disposition of the plundered gold also accounts for the oddities of US foreign policy vis a vis Japan since World War II. It explains, for instance, why Truman’s special envoy to Japan, John Foster Dulles, crafted a postwar treaty in 1951 that made it legally impossible for US POWs and other victims of Japanese war crimes to sue Japan for restitution or reparations, unlike the victims of the Nazis. The black gold (in this case a term with a rather explicit meaning, not a metaphorical reference to petroleum) also explains why the US exonerated Hirohito and rehabilitated the royal family. And it explains why MacArthur, the de facto ruler of postwar Japan from 1945-51, reinstalled the same corrupt elite to power who had been responsible for the war, in the first place. MacArthur, by the way, also specifically exempted from any warcrime trials the leading Japanese “scientists” who had practiced vivisection and other unspeakable horrors on living prisoners, because of their valuable biological/chemical-warfare expertise. Unit 731’s obscene experimentation was hushed up, and the few survivors of this Holocaust, almost all Chinese and Korean, never got to tell their stories, which would have absolutely discredited the official history.4 In addition to the booty stashed in the Philippines, much treasure had already made its way to the Japanese homeland, where it was very effective in keeping the extreme right wing party in power, over many years. This explains why, as Chalmers Johnson pointed out, Japanesestyle democracy has over the years remained so corrupt, inept, and weak.5 The purported justification for all of this, the consuming war on communism, was just another part of the same tapestry of lies. Even as MacArthur was exonerating the actual war criminals, he ordered the execution of an innocent man, General Yamashita, who according to the Seagraves was actually a moderate and had not engaged in war crimes. Nor had he been responsible for the live burials of the slave laborers. Yamashita had to die, quite simply, because he knew too much. Months before the start of the Nuremberg trials, the general was hauled before a kangaroo court, convicted of war crimes based on false testimony, and summarily hanged to get him out of the way.

The black gold also explains why most US government documents about Japan’s predatory looting remain classified, even to this today.6 In addition to Anderson, the small group that administered the gold trust included Truman’s closest adviser, Clark Clifford, and also John L. McCloy, an ally of the Rockefellers. Later, McCloy headed the World Bank, served as chairman of Chase Manhattan, and was even appointed to the Warren Commission. Anderson became Secretary of the Navy, probably to facilitate the secret trans-shipment of vast quantities of gold out of the Philippines aboard US naval vessels. During this period Anderson traveled to banks all over the world setting up black gold accounts. The key role he played probably also explains why Anderson was named as Treasury Secretary during Eisenhower’s second term. Late in life, Anderson was convicted of money laundering and died in disgrace.7 Clark Clifford’s reputation was also ruined due to his involvement in the BCCI scandal, which the Wall Street Journal called the “world’s largest bank fraud.”8 The group around Stimson included Robert Lovett, formerly an executive at Brown Brother’s Harriman where, no doubt, he rubbed elbows with fellow Yale Bonesman Prescott Bush, father and grandfather of two presidents. During World War II, Lovett oversaw the massive expansion of US military forces, and played such a vital role that after the war Truman at first refused to accept his resignation. Lovett went back to Wall Street, but he returned to Washington to become George Marshall’s Under Secretary of State in 1947. When Marshall became According to the Seagraves, Lansdale worked with Severino Garcia Santa Romana supervising the early gold recoveries in the Philippines, which continued through 1947. Lansdale also inventoried the loot and provided for security. A number of the early gold accounts were placed in Santa Romana’s name to conceal the CIA as the actual owner. Although the Santa Romana personal accounts are thought to have contained more than $50 billion in gold (at the then-current value), this was only a fraction of the total hoard. Twenty years after the initial searches ended, the treasure hunt resumed in the late 1960s under the sponsorship of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who had learned about the underground vaults. Like most Americans, I had always assumed that Marcos acquired his obscene wealth by skimming US and international aid to his impoverished nation.

Marcos also pressured Santa Romana to cede the power of attorney for his Manila bank accounts, and when Santy passed away in 1974, Marcos seized some of these accounts, greatly enriching himself. At about the same time, Ed Lansdale also managed to transfer Santy’s remaining gold accounts into his name, thus insuring CIA control. Marcos succeeded in opening a number of underground sites thanks to the competent assistance of an American mining engineer and metallurgist, Robert Curtis, whom Marcos recruited in 1974. Though Curtis nearly fell prey to treachery at the hands of Marcos, the engineer survived and eventually became one of the leading experts on the Japanese gold. After World War II, the Philippines had served as a staging area for US military and CIA operations throughout Southeast Asia,10 and this continued under Marcos, who proved a valuable ally during the Vietnam War. For example, Marcos assisted the CIA by providing false end-user certificates which enabled the CIA to launder arms shipments for various covert operations, and thereby, to evade US law.11 But Marcos eventually fell out of favor with Washington. The man’s unbridled greed was his own worst enemy; and in 1986, as pro-democracy protests were spreading throughout the country, Reagan’s CIA chief William Casey intervened to terminate the regime. Ferdinand and his wife Imelda were flown to Hawaii and placed under house arrest. By this point, Marcos was also in failing health. The CIA meanwhile expedited the removal of vast quantities of gold from vaults in the presidential palace. Billions in gold certificates were also confiscated from Imelda Marcos’ person. When Imelda protested, the US announced that the certificates were fakes, a standard ploy to prettify theft on a grand scale.12 While it is not entirely clear why the US moved when it did against Marcos, it is likely that Casey and H.W. Bush deemed the seizure of Marcos’ gold stockpiles as vital to shore up a number of US banks, which were in deep trouble because of reckless lending in the Third World, during the late 1970s and early ^(′)80s .13 In 1987, a team of US generals, including ex-CIA superstar John Singlaub and Reagan’s National Security Advisor, Robert Schweitzer, organized another attempt to open up new sites in the Philippines and recover more gold, both for personal profit and to set up a new slush fund for covert action.14 The team sought to recruit Curtis, just as Marcos had done.

However, the earlier betrayal had made Curtis wary; and although he was persuaded initially to participate, he withdrew soon after from what he judged to be a poorly led venture. Although the Singlaub initiative came to nothing, it nonetheless showed the continuing interest of the US intelligence community in the Japanese plunder, an estimated third of which had not been recovered. How much gold did the Japanese stash in the Philippines? No one knows for sure, but the Seagraves provide some tantalizing hints. One of the larger sites was a series of three natural caverns located near the San Fernando army camp. The largest of these, Tunnel-8, was said to be the size of a football field, while the other two were gymnasium-sized; and all had been packed with bars of gold bullion.15 Among the Seagraves’ documents that I reviewed is the transcript of a 1987 conversation with engineer Robert Curtis, who in the course of discussing the Singlaub fiasco proffered an educated guess about the size of the stash. According to Curtis, 172 underground sites contained about $500 billion in gold, at $35 /ounce.16 Assuming his figure is ac- These figures are roughly consistent with an accounting authorized by Marcos himself, which certified that, as of 1987, a little more than two-thirds of the original hoard had been recovered, totaling some 280,000 metric tons.17 Contrast the Japanese total with the Nazi plunder from World War II, estimated at only about 11,000 tonnes, and the US Treasury gold (reputed to be) inside Ft Knox, which, at the time of the last known audit, many years ago, contained only about 8,000 tonnes.18 I should add, however, that when I checked with the Seagraves they cautioned against placing too much weight on these estimates, which involve a considerable amount of guesswork. In an email, Sterling Seagrave pointed out that there were actually 175 sites, not 172, and that Curtis’s estimate did not include these three sites, his favorites, which he never recovered.19 Seagrave also mentioned that Marcos re-smelted and eventually rehid a great many ingots to prevent the US from confiscating them. All of which suggests that the above estimates could actually be on the low side. In any event, the official world total of 130,000 metric tons of gold is obviously much too low.20 Although the figure is supposed to include all existing gold in the form of coinage, bullion and jewelry, the true amount, or at least the best estimation, is no doubt among the world’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:65:8cb3717f862d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4974, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 66, "text": "and eventually rehid a great many ingots to prevent the US from confiscating them.

For our purposes, it is enough to show that the best estimates of the gold recovered in the Philippines, even when shared out and siphoned off, would be far more than enough to collateralize the Hammer Fund as described in an April 2000 deposition by Erle Cocke, one of the fund’s managers. In the next chapter, we will examine this important document. The Seagraves argue in their book that the Black Eagle Trust was used to buy elections in Italy, Greece and Japan, for the purpose of preventing the rise of left-wing political parties in those countries. The events in Italy and Greece they describe correspond with the covert operations involving Operation Gladio, NATO’s stay-behindarmy project, organized by Frank Wisner, the CIA master of dirty tricks who suffered a mental breakdown in the late 1950s.21 As we are about to learn, the Hammer Fund, a part of the larger Black Eagle Trust, was similarly used during the Cold War to shore up South Af- The authors believe that the trust also came into play in 1971-72 during Nixon and Kissinger’s backdoor negotiations with China over the thorny issue of Taiwan. At the time, longstanding US support for Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist Chinese base on Taiwan was the principal obstacle to a US rapprochement with the Peoples’ Republic of China (PRC). The dangerous alternative to a settlement was the implicit threat of a communist invasion of the island, which Mao Tse-tung insisted must eventually be reunited with the mainland. As we know, the US made concessions as a quid pro quo for Mao’s promise to forego an invasion, and to be helpful in winding down the Vietnam War. In return, Nixon agreed to remove US forces from Taiwan, and to cease US open hostility to the PRC at the United Nations.22 It was a major victory for Mao and a decisive defeat for the remnant power of Chiang Kai-shek. The PRC was ultimately given China’s permanent seat, with concomitant veto power, on the UN Security Council. The Seagraves examined bank documents showing that during this period Nixon secretly transferred large amounts of gold bullion to the People’s Republic, which suggests that Nixon and Kissinger paved the way for their celebrated renewal of formal US-China relations in 1973 with a sweetener: they returned some of the loot previously carried off by the Japanese imperialists.23 Endnotes 1 Chalmers", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:66:b87231a92088", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4975, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 67, "text": "of Chiang Kai-shek.

An official US Army report came into their hands indicating that General MacArthur and his staff were fully aware that wholesale looting had occurred during Japan’s imperial march across Asia.

Although US entanglements in SE Asia lie beyond the scope of this book, the importance of this history cannot be overstated. The gist is that the US intelligence community found it expedient to cooperate with narcotraffickers in SE Asia after World War II, just as in Italy during the war. But whereas the objective in Europe was the defeat of the Nazis, the goal in China was to encircle China. In 1950, when Mao Tse-tung drove Chiang Kai-shek’s defeated KMT army across the border into Burma, a decision was made to keep Chiang’s remnant forces, which numbered about 10,000 men, on life support.

Cocke’s testimony was recorded in New York District Court just ten days before he passed away from pancreatic cancer, and thus, also carries the weight of a deathbed confession.1 E.P. Heidner describes the deposition as “a critical starting point for understanding the [Hammer] fund.”3 By any standard, it is an extraordinary document. In my case, a careful reading precipitated one of those humbling experiences: I rudely awakened to the fact that the world is a much bigger (and darker) place than I had ever dared to imagine. The document is the transcript of an interview in which an attorney plies Cocke with questions about the so called Hammer Fund. Three individuals named as litigants on the first page had brought suit in a New York court, contending that they had been swindled out of their commissions for a particular transaction. The three were probably brokers or traders. Erle Cocke and another attorney were hired to arbitrate on their behalf and hopefully to reach a settlement. Cocke states that he made several trips to New York and a lot of phone calls trying to mediate, but got the run-around and was ultimately unsuccessful (Cocke Deposition (CD), pages 43-44). On page 17, Cocke confirms its existence and begins to explain what it was all about. He says the fund originated in the 1940s and 1950s as a hush-hush project to “repatriate monies” back to the US “from all types of activities, both", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:68:db7ead622613", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4977, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 69, "text": "hopefully to reach a settlement.

On page 17, Cocke confirms its existence and begins to explain what it was all about. He says the fund originated in the 1940s and 1950s as a hush-hush project to “repatriate monies” back to the US “from all types of activities, both legitimately and illegitimately.” Cocke acknowledges that he does not know who created the Hammer Fund, but says it had to be “somebody at a pretty high level.” Then, he adds (CD, page 18): “obviously [it] got way out of proportion as time went on…” He explicitly confirms the involvement of the US intelligence community, including the CIA and FBI, as well as the Departments of Defense and Treasury. Curiously, he also mentions the Federal Reserve. Cocke identifies the primary depository for the fund as the New York offices of Citibank, which became Citigroup after a 1998 merger (CD, pages 19-20). Cocke states: “They [i.e., Citibank] were going to be the trustees. They were going to be running the program. They were going to be the disbursing agency. They were the cheese.” Incidentally, this is the same Citibank, as noted (see Chapter Five), that was implicated during the 1990s in a $100 million money laundering scandal involving the former Mexican president Salinas, and which, in 2001, under the “leadership” of former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, acquired the second largest bank in Mexico, Banamex. The Hammer Fund apparently constituted a block of at least 30 accounts (CD, p. 37) at Citibank’s New York branch, with parallel accounts in Citibank’s Athens, Greece office. At one point in the interview the attorney asks (p. 19): “It sounds like it would involve many different commercial or financial banking institutions, over the years.” To which Cocke replies: “No question about it. Everybody got into the act that could.” Evidently, much of the international banking community was involved through Citibank’s numerous correspondent accounts. Cocke also names Citibank’s John Reed, a former bank vice president and CEO at the time of the deposition, as the coordinator and primary trust officer for the Hammer Fund (CD, p. 20 & 26). Later, in an implicit reference to the compartmentalization of duties that is standard in covert actions, he observes (CD, p. 26), “I can see the President of the United States with no trouble. [but] I cannot see Erle Cocke was somebody, the scion of a well known Georgia banking family.

His father Erle Sr., was also at one time the president of the American Bankers Association and Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.4 Erle Jr. served in three wars with distinction: World War II, Korea, and Viet Nam. He entered World War II as an artillery officer and eventually became a division staff officer. He was captured by the Germans on three different occasions, and each time he escaped. On the third occasion he survived the execution of his entire unit by a Waffen SS firing squad by playing dead. Hours later, a local villager found him and tended his wounds until he could be rescued. In short, Cocke was a genuine war hero. His division commander, Maj. Gen. Anthony McAuliffe, later stated that he had “displayed courage of the highest degree, enthusiasm, and excellent judgement.” By war’s end, Cocke had earned the silver star, a purple heart with three clusters, the Bronze Star, the French Croix de Guerre, and numerous other citations.5 He left the service after the war, but was later recalled for the Korean conflict, during which he served as liaison between Secretary of Defense Marshall and General Douglas MacArthur, who commanded the UN expeditionary forces. Earlier, Cocke also had an eleven-year civilian career at Delta Airlines, where he was a special assistant to the airline president and vice-president. He also served as a US delegate to the United Nations (with the rank of ambassador), and did a four-year stint at the World Bank from 1961-64. From 1962 to the time of his deposi- In his deposition Cocke makes an astounding claim (CD, p. 9) about the World Bank: “After the UN, I was the first full time US representative at the World Bank … At that time I owned 28 percent of the stock [my emphasis] and, of course, I had all kinds of people at the Treasury tell me what to do. Don’t get me wrong, I made all the decisions.” Until you remember Cocke’s family pedigree, his claim that he owned 28 percent of the World Bank might seem like outrageous braggadocio, or even senility. But perhaps not for the son of the former president of the American Bankers Association. Cocke mentions (CD, p. 12) that “He [i.e., his dad, Erle Sr.] was the commercial banker, and I was the international banker. So we had ways that we came together.

He apparently had a talent for closing deals, and perhaps for this reason served at the beck and call of every president from Truman to Clinton, although Cocke admits in his deposition that some of these duties were minor. ocke’s skills as a mediator extended to diplomacy. In 1987, CIA CDirector William Casey recruited him for a highly sensitive mission to North Korea. It seems that the North Koreans had just been approached by Pakistan with an offer to assist them in developing nuclear weapons. The North was already supplying Pakistan with nuclear-capable missiles, and a deal could be struck to have the missile sales offset a portion of the cost of a nuclear program. North Korea’s leaders were reluctant to accept the Pakistani offer, however, because they knew their nation could not afford the immense expense of a nuclear weapons effort. Although Cocke was suffering from prostate problems, at the time, he agreed to make the secret trip to Pyongyang with William Zylka, another Casey associate. The two Americans spent several weeks in North Korea, and were no doubt shocked when the North Koreans informed them that the US had secretly supplied some of the hardware for Pakistan’s nuclear bomb program. The discussions went more smoothly than expected. According to Cocke, the North Koreans offered to begin to negotiate a pledge not to develop nuclear weapons in exchange for a $1 billion-dollar loan from the US to purchase food and avert a country-wide famine. In sum, the prospects for a non-proliferation treaty with the North were excellent. Unfortunately, by the time Cocke and Zylka returned to the US the nation was focused on the breaking Iran Contra-gate scandal, and Casey was dying from brain cancer. Moreover, because Casey had failed to inform the Reagan White House about the backdoor channel with Pyongyang, the good news fell on deaf ears. Nor did the subsequent Bush presidency show any interest. Cocke reportedly said, “I could not get anyone in the new Bush administration to pay attention. They did not want to hear about Casey.” Which is how both the Reagan and Bush administrations fumbled a rare opportunity to keep the nuclear genie in the bottle in NE Asia.6 US Treasury documents show that during 1979-1980 Cocke’s Washington offices doubled as the US", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:71:cc94e4793613", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4980, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 72, "text": "with Pyongyang, the good news fell on deaf ears.

Cocke and the nominal bank president Admiral Earl P. Yates, who was also based in the Washington office, were probably not themselves involved in the money-laundering, but had been brought in due their military backgrounds, to lend Nugan-Hand the appearance of respectability. Cocke was a shrewd choice for the Washington office because he had connections within the Carter administration and was willing to tap them. Like Carter, Cocke was a Georgia boy, and he later acknowledged that he had arranged White House meetings for bank cofounder Frank Nugan.8 Nugan-Hand was a bank that did no banking. Most of its employees were salesmen rather than clerks or experienced investment counselors. The bank employees hustled to keep new deposits coming in the front door faster than cash was leaking out the back to cover bank cofounders Frank Nugan and Mike Hand’s high salaries and lavish expenses. Alfred McCoy, author of The Politics of Heroin, describes Nugan-Hand as “a carnival shell game, courting depositors for cash and moving money from branch to branch to conceal one fundamental fact: the bank simply had no assets behind it.”9 Nugan-Hand specialized in complex currency transactions for clients who wished to hide money and evade government taxes. The bank became a laundry for a wide array of shadowy Asian business interests, including known narcotraffickers. Indeed, it catered to this clientele. While Nugan was milking clients in the main office in Sydney, Hand, a former green beret and CIA operative, spent much of his time on the road establishing new branch offices that laundered drug money, engaged in arms trading, and provided cover for CIA operations. A third partner, Maurice Bernard Houghton, assisted Hand in the off-shore side of the “business.” Houghton was a soldier of fortune who for years had run a seedy restaurant in Sydney, the Bourbon and Beefsteak, that was a hangout for CIA officers, American GIs on leave from the Vietnam war, gangsters, and corrupt Australian politicians. Hand and Houghton had long-standing relationships with senior CIA spooks Theodore “Ted” Shackley and Thomas Clines; and Houghton was also connected with Australian intelligence. Nugan-Hand Bank collapsed in 1980, just days after Frank Nugan was found dead from a gunshot wound.

Nugan-Hand Bank collapsed in 1980, just days after Frank Nugan was found dead from a gunshot wound. Although his death was officially ruled a suicide, knowledgeable individuals, including Mike Hand, believed that Nugan had been murdered. Six months later, Hand himself dropped out of sight, apparently having fled Australia to escape legal prosecution.10 His subsequent whereabouts have never been revealed. The linkage to the drug trade is well established. A number of Nugan-Hand’s clients were known narcotraffickers, some of them convicted felons.12 Just to give some insight, in 1977, the bank opened two new offices in Thailand, one in Bangkok, another in Chiang Mai, an unlikely outpost in the northern part of the country. The town has only one export. Just as Napa is famous for fine wine, and Germany has a reputation for sausages and beer, Chiang Mai is known for heroin. For many years, ever since Mao Tse-tung drove Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang army out of China, the town of Chiang Mai had functioned as a drug outlet for the legendary Golden Triangle, including Burma’s Shan province, which lies to the north.13 Some of the evidence linking Nugan-Hand to the drug trade was made conspicuous by its omission. In March 1983, when an Australian Task Force on Drug Trafficking released its final report on the failed Nugan-Hand Bank, it was immediately evident that government censors had deleted portions of the report, including all nine pages of Chapter 34. The title of the missing chapter was: “Nugan Hand in Thailand.” The stated reason for the official redactions: “….release of material is contrary to public interest,” either because of “likely interference with ongoing or future inquiries…” or because “disclosure is likely to identify informants or other confidential sources of information.”14 The CIA’s other money-laundering banks Nugan-Hand was not the first phony bank to serve as a conduit decessors Castle Bank and Mercantile Bank, both formed by infamous CIA operative Paul Helliwell.15 Castle and Mercantile banks were shell companies that shared common offices and directors. Each owned large blocks of stock in the other, and each deposited substantial funds with the other. As in the case of Nugan-Hand, both were chartered in the Cayman Islands, and as with Nugan-Hand, both ultimately collapsed because they ran afoul of the law. It is no coincidence that Nugan-Hand expanded its global money-laundering operations in 1976-77, just as Castle and Mercantile were going under.16 Similarly, when Nugan-Hand suddenly collapsed in 1980 its intelligence functions shifted to the notorious Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), which was then expanding.

Founded by Agha Hasan Abedi, a Pakistani national, BCCI was the first global Third World Bank, and was officially committed to providing financial assistance to developing countries. This and Abedi’s charismatic personality drew considerable international support for BCCI, even as the bank robbed depositors of their life savings, assisted dictators in the looting of their own countries, and regularly did business with terrorists, drug lords, and CIA operatives.17 In the 1970s, subsequent to Watergate, when President Jimmy Carter and Congress were pressuring the CIA to reform itself, the Saudis emerged to take up the slack in the spy world; and BCCI became one of the primary vehicles. According to investigative journalist Joseph Trento, the idea for an expanded Saudi intelligence role did not originate with the royal family, but was the brainchild of the much respected Washington attorney Clark Clifford, who had longtime CIA connections.18 The CIA-Saudi relationship blossomed after Clifford approached Saudi intelligence chief Sheikh Kamal Adham with a request that he set up an informal intelligence network outside the US. Adham was the brother-in-law of the late King Faisal, and one of the driving forces behind BCCI. senior member of President Reagan’s National Security Council, Reagan’s CIA chief William Casey and other Reagan administration officials frequently asked Adham to fund covert CIA operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere, as a convenient way to bypass Congress.20 Casey is also known to have met regularly with BCCI founder Abedi, both in Washington and Islamabad.21 From the late 1970s until it was forced to close, BCCI served as a laundry for a wide variety of black operations, even nuclear proliferation. According to Trento, during the 1980s, hundreds of millions in US foreign aid money meant for the Afghani Mujahedeen resistance was diverted by Pakistani intelligence (ISI) through BCCI and ultimately funded Pakistan’s clandestine nuclear weapons program. This happened with the full knowledge and support of the Saudis, who were also secretly funding the program. It is quite likely that H.W. Bush also knew about the diversions and approved them. Trento argues that Bush’s overarching Mideast strategy was to establish parity between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which, of course, meant that Pakistan would become the nuclear proxy for the Saudis.

BCCI, however, came to an ignominious end in July 1991 when a British magistrate finally ordered the closure of the bank. bique and Angola, probably for counter-insurgency campaigns in support of South African Apartheid. As Cocke also notes, later the fund supported US-backed mayhem in Sudan (CD, p. 27). One of the plaintiffs mentioned on page one, Roelf Ignatius Johannes Van Rooyen, had been a member of the South African military, or security police. In a separate deposition (see the Appendix) van Rooyen describes the Hammer Fund as an “extremely large very delicate operation in cooperation with the authorities of various countries” that were involved with his company Oceantec. Just how large is indicated by the following exchange (CD, p. 36), in which the interviewer presents Cocke with a document identified as exhibit one: In short, the Hammer Fund was a secret cache of wealth so vast as to be almost beyond human comprehension. Over time, the covert trafficking in arms became secondary as the fund developed into a collateral trading program. The financial managers began to realize the fund’s incredible potential for generating still more wealth, which they accomplished by using the asset base as collateral for sales of large numbers of leveraged derivatives or banking instruments that were then marketed at a discount. In other transactions, certain types of derivatives were also treated like collateral (CD, p. 31). Curiously, this time frame closely follows the CIA’s ouster of Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos and its seizure of untold billions of gold then in Marcos’ possession. It also coincides with the wholesale looting of Russia during the 1990s, and with AIG’s expansion into financial services and its subsequent period of uninterrupted growth.

The responsibility is… Cocke: Generally, you have a ledger account, off ledger account. Now, they may give some other fancy name for putting it on the door of the building; but, yes, every big bank has got an off ledger balance. And they pull it every day. This is not something you do monthly, you do it at the close of every business day. In other words, by operating two sets of books, one for public scrutiny and another in private, Citibank managers could easily hide transactions of any size. As long as they designed the various transactions and obligations to cancel out at the end of each banking day, so that the off ledger balance would remain unchanged, the total amount of business conducted that day would be off the record, hence, invisible, even if the trading was in the trillions.24 David Guyatt argues that because the Hammer Fund was based in US dollars the trading was very lucrative for the US government. He thinks the US Treasury, by prior arrangement, received a percentage of the take. This would explain the complicity of various federal agencies, including the Treasury Department, and perhaps even a private bank like the Federal Reserve. It might also explain, in part, the CIA’s continuing involvement, assuming, of course, What a system! Whatever part of its principal (described by Cocke as “hardly touched”) originated in the Black Eagle Trust, one can readily appreciate why the Hammer Fund would attract private investors looking to both hide and multiply wealth. Using the off-ledger account, fund managers could create limitless amounts of money and securities which, though heavily leveraged, were still gold-backed, and hence more secure than the US dollar and more desirable from a trading standpoint. A manager could safely play the world market, extending credit, making loans, buying and selling, in the process moving assets around (by 2000 in milliseconds) via electronic transfers through a network of correspondent banks, while neatly avoiding foreign taxation and regulatory oversight. One could hide a billion dollars or a hundred billion with equal ease, and with very little risk. And because these transactions were secret and off-ledger one could also divert the profits as desired, to serve whatever purpose.

One of the most successful frauds ever perpetrated upon theAmerican people is the notion that the CIA exists to prolinks to Wall Street suggest that the CIA was created to serve the perceived interests of investment bankers. The well documented links to Wall Street can be traced to the founding of the agency. According to former CIA director Richard Helms, when Allen Dulles was tasked in 1946 to “draft proposals for the shape and organization of what was to become the Central Intelligence Agency,” he recruited an advisory group of six men made up almost exclusively of Wall Street investment bankers and lawyers. Dulles himself was an attorney at the prominent Wall Street law firm, Sullivan and Cromwell. Two years later, Dulles became the chairman of a three-man committee which reviewed the young agency’s performance. The other two members of the committee were also New York lawyers.1 For nearly a year, the committee met in the offices of J.H. Whitney, a Wall Street investment firm.2 According to Peter Dale Scott, over the next twenty years, all seven deputy directors of the agency were drawn from the Wall Street financial aristocracy; and six were listed in the New York social register.3 So we see that from", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:77:df15fbf5f2c8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4986, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 78, "text": "of a three-man committee which reviewed the young agency’s performance.

Allen Dulles himself became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence in early 1953. The prevalent myth that the CIA exists to provide intelligence information to the president was the promotional vehicle used to persuade President Harry Truman to sign the 1947 National Security Act, the legislation which created the CIA.4 But the rationale about serving the president was never more than a partial and very imperfect truth.5 Col. L. Fletcher Prouty, an early critic of the agency, has referred to this oft-repeated notion as “the CIA’s most important cover story.”6 In his important book The Secret Team, Prouty argues that the cover story was actually a front for the CIA’s main interest, what he calls “fun and games,” in other words, clandestine operations.7 Prouty was in a position to know the facts. For nine years, from 1955 - 1964, he served as the focal point for contacts between the CIA and the Pentagon on matters pertaining to “special operations,” officialese for covert activities. In this capacity Prouty worked directly with CIA Director Dulles and his brother John Foster, who was then Secretary of State, and also with several different Secretaries of Defense and chairmen of the Joint Chiefs, and many other government officials. Col. Prouty’s work with the CIA took him to CIA offices and hot spots in more than sixty countries, where he observed various covert operations then in progress. For some reason, perhaps through an oversight, Prouty was never required to sign a security oath, and so, was unencumbered, completely free to write a detailed expose of the agency, released in 1972. In his book Prouty does not mince words. He describes Allen Dulles’ concept of intelligence as only 10% intelligence, and 90% clandestine operations.8 In another passage, he fleshes out his meaning: “the CIA is at the center of a vast mechanism that specializes in covert operations…or as Allen Dulles used to call it, ‘peacetime operations.’ In this sense, the CIA is the willing tool of a higher level Secret Team, or High Cabal, that usually includes representatives of the CIA and other instrumentalities of the government, certain cells of the business and professional world, and, almost always, foreign participation.”9 If this sounds conspiratorial it is because Allen Dulles and his allies on Wall Street managed to get around the law and thwart the will of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:78:af8b03595cba", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4987, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 79, "text": "operations…or as Allen Dulles used to call it, ‘peacetime operations.’ In this sense, the CIA is the willing tool of a higher level Secret Team, or High Cabal, that usually includes representatives of the CIA and other instrumentalities of the government, certain cells of the business and professional world, and, almost always, foreign participation.”9 If this sounds conspiratorial it is because Allen Dulles and his allies on Wall Street managed to get around the law and thwart the will of Congress. The National Security Act, which created the CIA, included no provision for intelligence gathering or covert operations because, as Prouty points out, the intent of Congress was for the CIA to function as a central clearinghouse for intelligence collected by other government departments and pre-existing intelligence agencies. This is why Congress placed the CIA under the direct authority of the newly created National Security Council. But Allen Dulles and those around him wanted to take the new agency into the shady world of clandestine operations to serve the interests of the US financial and corporate elite, interests that in their distorted world view were synonymous with the interests of the United States of America. Dulles and his allies achieved their goal by exploiting a loophole in the legislation, a catch-all provision stating that the CIA would “perform such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security Council (NSC) may from time to time direct.” As worded, the passage grants the CIA no authority on its own to stage operational activities, but only as instructed by the National Security Council. Moreover, the passage “from time to time” indicates that Congress never intended that such operations would become a full time program. Prouty argues that the CIA and the Secret Team immediately “tested this clause in the act and began to practice their own interpretation of its meaning.”10 Unfortunately, the National Security Council failed to live up to the role that Congress intended, that of providing leadership and direction. In part, this happened because NSC members had other fulltime duties and were not able to allocate sufficient time and energy to direct the CIA and keep it honest. Before long, the NSC had delegated its primary responsibilities to subcommittees, which the CIA easily captured by packing them with its supporters through patient maneuvering and unrelenting pressure. Soon, the NSC became a rubber stamp for a full-time program of endless black operations. The CIA also insinuated its supporters and agents throughout the other branches of government: into the FAA, the Departments of State and Defense, even within the White House. From that point on, in the words of Prouty, the agency created “its own inertial drift….without the knowledge of most higher level authorities.” Through the use of organizational strategies like compartmentalization and plausible deniability, and by limiting the flow of information to “a need to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:79:7b2415cb459a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4988, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 80, "text": "a full-time program of endless black operations.

Prouty relates one instance where he briefed General Lyman L. Lemnitzer, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the subject of the largest covert operation that the CIA had ever mounted, up to that point. Whereupon, Lemnitzer, in shock, said to the other Chiefs, “I just can’t believe it. I never knew that.”11 Allen Dulles was up to such tricks even before becoming director. In his voluminous history of the CIA, Legacy of Ashes, journalist Tim Weiner describes how in 1951 Allen Dulles, then deputy director of plans (i.e. covert operations), and Frank Wisner routinely stonewalled their boss, CIA Director Bedell Smith, about ongoing covert projects. At the time, Wisner headed up the bland-sounding Office of Policy Coordination, newly instituted to counter the USSR threat in Europe.12 That meant staging covert operations throughout western Europe (i.e., Operation Gladio). Smith fumed at being kept in the dark, and was also aghast that the CIA budget being proposed by Dulles had mushroomed eleven-fold since 1948, with most of the increase allocated for covert operations–––three times the budget for espionage and analysis. Smith correctly worried that “this posed a distinct danger to CIA as an intelligence agency,” because “the operational tail will wag the intelligence dog.”13 Smith was an Army General, and clashed sharply with the lawyer Dulles, who made a habit of evading direct orders. Weiner cites the CIA’s Tom Polger, who observed the two men trying to work together. Said Polger: “Bedell clearly doesn’t like Dulles, and it’s easy to see why. An Army officer gets an order and carries it out. A lawyer finds a way to weasel…”14 Weiner recounts how Dulles lied to Congress to conceal an unbroken string of failed covert operations during the Korean war.15 General Bedell Smith never succeeded in bending Dulles and Wisner to his authority. As we know, Dwight D. Eisenhower won the 1952 election on a platform of confronting Communism and rolling back the iron curtain. Ike’s closest foreign policy advisor was none other than John Foster Dulles, Allen’s brother. So, when the time came for Ike to pick his new CIA chief, it was no surprise that he tapped Allen Dulles for the job, over Bedell Smith’s strong objections.

With the appointment of Dulles as CIA Director, the US financial elite finally achieved through peaceful means the perversion of democracy it had sought to achieve through a violent coup in 1934, when a cabal of Wall Street bankers and industrialists attempted to overthrow the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. During the 1930s, a number of prominent individuals on Wall Street, including In 1934, the plotters enlisted a genuine war hero to their cause: two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner General Smedley Butler. Although Butler initially appeared to go along with the conspiracy, much to his credit, the general remained loyal to the Constitution and ultimately alerted Congress to the plot.16 The attempted coup against FDR failed, but the bankers’ moment finally arrived after World War II with the onset of the Cold War. The Red Menace was made-to-order for Wall Street. The international threat of communism, real or imagined, was the perfect rationale for a national security apparatus with the power to undermine and ultimately trump our democracy. Along with this went the systematic manipulation of public opinion through mass propaganda and spin. In 1947, the “War Department” was re-christened the “Defense Department.” That same year, the English writer George Orwell sat down to finish his dystopian masterpiece 1984 in which he prophetically describes a fictional world-turned-upside-down: which has since become all too real. Words and expressions that Orwell coined, like “Big Brother”, “Newspeak”, “Ignorance is Strength“, “Freedom is Slavery”, “War is Peace”, even the term “Orwellian,” have long since become integral to our language. Truman lived to regret his role in creating a monster. One month to the day after the murder of JFK in Dallas, the elder statesman posted a letter in the Washington Post, in which he addressed the nation. In the letter Truman explained that he had set up the CIA to provide raw intelligence to the office of the president, but that in practice things had turned out very differently. Truman wrote that I think it has become necessary to take another look at the purpose and operations of our Central Intelligence Agency…..For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment.

Some of the complications and embarrassment I think we have experienced are in part attributable to the fact that this quiet intelligence arm of the President has been so removed from its intended role that it is being interpreted as a symbol of sinister and mysterious foreign intrigue…there are now some searching questions that need to be answered. I, therefore, would like to see the CIA be restored to its original assignment as the intelligence arm of the President….and that its operational duties be terminated or properly used elsewhere. We have grown up as a nation, respected for our free institutions and for our ability to maintain a free and open society. There is something about the way the CIA has been functioning that is casting a shadow over our historic position and I feel that we need to correct it.17 [my emphasis] Truman’s line about the CIA “casting a shadow over our historic position” may have been a thinly-veiled reference to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, exactly one month before, an assassination which new research suggests was a rogue CIA operation conducted with the cooperation of Chicago mobsters.18 It is quite possible that by December 1963 Truman had privately reached the same conclusion. But he may also have been referring to the CIA’s many inglorious foreign policy disasters in the Mideast, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, about which the aging Truman surely must have been painfully aware. The most obvious example, of course, was the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961 that led to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis which brought the world to the brink of nuclear Armageddon. Another was the CIA’s 1953 plot to overthrow the popular and democratically elected leader of Iran, Mohammad Mossadegh, and replace him with the dictatorial Shah, the fallout from which continues to bedevil geopolitics, many years later. No example of US treachery has ever done more harm to American prestige, world wide, than the CIA’s destruction of the fledgling Iranian democracy. At the time, Iran was friendly to the West and a US ally. During World War II, Iran had played a key role in US efforts to resupply the Soviet Union and prevent a Nazi victory on the eastern front. Yet, the US repaid Tehran with betrayal. And there are many other examples.19 It appears that Truman’s successor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, despite his eminent role as Cold Warrior, may in due course have learned to distrust the CIA.

And there are many other examples.19 It appears that Truman’s successor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, despite his eminent role as Cold Warrior, may in due course have learned to distrust the CIA. During Eisenhower’s two terms the CIA often kept him in the dark, when they were not actively manipulating him. There is some evidence that the CIA may even have gone so far as to wreck Ike’s scheduled 1960 peace summit with Nikita Khrushchev by secretly arranging for the Soviets to shoot down an American U-2 surveillance plane piloted by Gary Powers.20 The incident embarrassed Eisenhower, causing renewed hostility between Washington and Moscow at the very moment when a thaw in the Cold War seemed within reach. Like the murder of JFK, three years later, the U-2 incident is suspicious and may have been a calculated move by CIA hardliners. This dark possibility may even have motivated Eisenhower to warn the American people in 1961 about the growing threat to democratic institutions posed by “the military-industrial complex.”21 But while most Americans have at least heard of Ike’s famous warning, delivered in his final address to the nation, by contrast, Truman’s remarkable letter has been forgotten. No doubt, Truman ruffled some powerful feathers, because, later that day, his letter was mysteriously yanked from subsequent editions of the Post. As we now know, by the early 1960s the CIA had enlisted many frontline journalists for undercover work. Estimates of how many range from 50 to 400, or more.22 But the exact number is less important than the confirmed fact that selected journalists at every major US magazine and newspaper, including the Post, were on the CIA payroll, in sufficient numbers to leak disinformation into the media and deceive the American people on a range of issues. The willing CIA operatives were only too happy to plant phony “news” or, as in the case of Truman’s letter, to make troublesome stories disappear. One or two phone calls from Langley may have done the trick. There was no follow up in the press regarding the Truman letter, not in subsequent weeks, months, or years. None of Truman’s biographers mention it, probably because they did not even know about it.23 This includes David McCullough, author of the 1992 bestseller, Truman, which won the Pulitzer Prize and has been called “the most thorough account of Truman’s life yet to appear.”24 Thorough, perhaps, but not thorough enough.

In 1975, on hearing from a professor acquaintance that forty copies of the book had inexplicably vanished from the shelves of a university library, Prouty visited the Library of Congress in Washington to see if his book was still in the stacks where he had seen it on a previous visit. Not only was it missing, his book was no longer even listed in the library card catalogue. Someone had expunged every trace of its existence. Until the occasion of its re-publication in 2011, The Secret Team remained, in Prouty’s words, “an official non-book.” The Dulles-led committee produced a report dated January 1, 1949, that was submitted to President Truman upon his re-election. According to Fletcher Prouty “No report on the broad subject of intelligence has ever been more important than this one was.” Prouty continues: “The report….clearly and precisely outlined what Allen Dulles was going to do; and to his credit, he did just that, and more. During that busy summer of election year, 1948, Allen Dulles was officially the speechwriter for the Republican candidate, Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York. All through the campaign it had been generally accepted that Dewey would defeat President Truman. Allen Dulles, his brother, John Foster Dulles, and the others of that Dewey team fully expected to move into Washington on the crest of a wave with the inauguration of their candidate. In this context the Dulles-Jackson-Correa report takes on a special meaning. Although this select committee had been established by President Truman, they had timed their work for delivery to the President during his–––they expected–––“Lame Duck” period. Then they planned to use it as their own plan of action in the new Dewey administration. In one of the greatest political upsets of all time, Truman beat Dewey, and the Republicans were forced to wait another four years. Thus it happened that this crucial report was reluctantly delivered into Truman’s more than hostile hands on January 1, 1949.” According to Prouty, only 10-12 copies of the 193-page report were published, and later, efforts were made to collect and destroy the copies not under CIA control.

Because warfare is vastly more profitable than peace. Wall Street achieved the desired objective by means of CIA manipulation.

W. Martin Schotz, History Will Not Absolve Us: Orwellian Control, Public Denial, and the Murder of John F. Kennedy (Brookline, MA: Kurtz, Ulmer and DeLucia Press, 1996), appendix VIII, p. 237. 24 The quote is by Alan Brinkley, whose review appeared in the New York Times Book Review. fficial White House documents declassified in the 1990s show that, starting in 1982, Ronald Reagan signed at least three national security directives that declared economic warfare on the Soviet Union. According to oil expert James R. Norman, “the most pivotal” of these, “NSDD-66, launched a huge effort which marshaled the CIA, the Pentagon, Treasury, and other governmental agencies to devise ways to increase economic pressure on the Soviets.”1 NSDD-66 gave rise to a series of internal papers, one of which was a “massive secret study on international oil pricing” which the Treasury Department completed in early 1983. The study determined that oil was the USSR’s principle cashproducing export, and that a sustained drop in world oil prices would, therefor, have a devastating impact on the Soviet economy. The Reagan White House moved quickly to exploit this perceived weakness, in part, by engineering a world oil glut. OPEC nations, especially the Saudis, were encouraged to increase production at the wellhead. The US also took steps to block a Soviet natural gas pipeline to Europe then under construction. The US succeeded in delaying its completion by two years, which deprived Moscow of an estimated $20 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, a new factor also came into play: the emergence of speculative “short” sellers on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In his 2008 book, The Oil Card, Norman writes that the identity of the “short” sellers “was never clear, since the ultimate buyers and sellers of NYMEX contracts were known only to the brokers handling their", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:86:d1629a18d7f7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4995, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 87, "text": "Europe then under construction.

[And] even then, the identity of futures buyers could be disclosed as no more than a nominee in the Cayman Islands.”2 And because the futures margin requirement per thousand-barrel-contract was only 5% , relatively small amounts of cash, persistently applied, had a “snowballing effect.” The speculative shorting of oil futures ultimately decoupled prices from supply-and-demand fundamentals, and helped cause a world collapse in the price of oil that continued for years. The resulting chronic shortfall in oil revenues dealt the Soviet Union a mortal blow, according to a Russian academic, Yegor Gaidar, who had served as Russian prime minister from 1991-1994.3 In his book, The Soviet Collapse, Gaidar states that the Soviet government ran out of funds in November 1991, at which time the Soviet Union effectively ceased to exist.4 That same month, Gosbank director Victor Geraschenko announced that the gold vault in the country’s Central Bank was empty. Incredibly, some 2-3,000 metric tonnes of gold, worth an estimated $22–33 billion, had simply vanished.5 Geraschenko’s statement, reported by Izvestia, was confirmed the same day by Aleksandre Orlov, a member of the Supreme Soviet. The Russian gold was never recovered; nor has its disappearance ever been explained. The failed coup against Gorbachev had occurred just three months earlier, i.e., in August 1991; and Gorbachev resigned on Christmas day, 1991. Also, during 1991-92, vast quantities of rubles were illegally laundered out of Russia, in what came to be known as the “great ruble scam.” 400 billion rubles were embezzled from the Central Bank alone, a crime that many Russians believe was a cyber-attack.6 The Central Bank did not finally staunch the looting until encryption software was introduced in December 1992. At the time, the ruble was not traded on world currency markets. Its value was artificially set by Soviet decree. As reported by the New York Times, the ruble was then worth 57 cents, which means that the 400 billion rubles looted from the Central Bank was worth about $228 billion in US dollars.7 Notice, this approximates the $223 billion figure mentioned in the Cocke deposition. Moreover, the date of the transaction discussed in the deposition (CD, p. 49), i.e., November-December 1991, also appears to line up with events in Russia. Is this merely coincidence?

Heidner charges in “Collateral Damage”?8 We may never know. In September 2006, Andrei Kozlov, a Russian official who had been investi- gating the 1991-92 looting of Russia’s Central Bank, was murdered in Moscow along with his driver.9 The two men were gunned down by unknown assailants as they exited a soccer match. Kozlov had been a leading bank reformer, and at the time of his death served as first deputy chairman of Russia’s Central Bank. Authorities described the deaths as “a contract killing.” During the critical period of 1991-92, Russian officials issued public statements that the nation was under outside attack. In 1991, Premier Valentin Pavlov went so far as warn of an “imperialist plot.” Although Pavlov was ridiculed in the West, at least one western journalist, Claire Sterling, concluded after a two-year investigation that the premier’s suspicions were “not far off.” In 1993, Sterling wrote that “the flow of rubles out of Soviet Russia was heavy enough to suggest a conspiracy, and a lot of it was moving through western banks. It was moving through Russian banks also, however. Everybody with any rubles to speak of was racing to exchange them illicitly for hard currency, starting with those who had the most: communists on the way out, politicians on the way in, and the Russian mafia.”10 “While they were in it for money, others were in it to manipulate the politics of a dying Soviet state. In the end, the case that shook Russia turned out to be an enormous and almost indecipherable conspiracy in which elements of the KGB, in collusion with the international underworld, set out deliberately to destabilize the Soviet Union’s currency, almost certainly with the tacit consent if not active participation of the western intelligence community.”11 peddled on the world market for a fortune. The asset stripping was too easy. The old Soviet state was gone. Russia stood defenseless, without custom controls, laws or procedures for confiscating contraband and prosecuting corruption. A Brookings scholar, Raymond Baker, has called this rip-off of Russia’s natural resources “the greatest theft of resources that has ever occurred from any country in a short period of time.”13 Asset stripping was Russia’s baptism by fire into the world of “free” markets.

And it happened thanks to men like Marc Rich, named by Business Week as the most powerful commodity trader in Russia in the early 1990s.14 Rich has another dubious distinction. At the time he was pardoned in 2001 by President Bill Clinton on his last morning in the Oval Office, Rich had been a fugitive from the US since 1985, and faced a combined 325-year prison sentence for fifty-one charges of racketeering, mail and wire fraud, tax evasion on $100 million of unreported income, not to mention trading with the enemy, i.e., Iran during the hostage crisis.15 The FBI had even offered a $750, 000 reward for his capture. Yet, Clinton set Rich free with the stroke of a pen. Why? Was the pardon Marc Rich’s reward for helping to bring Russia to her knees? To be sure, the hemorrhaging of gold, rubles, and assets out of Russia would not have been possible without co-conspirators inside the country, i.e., corrupt Party and KGB officials, willing Russian businessmen, oligarchs, not to mention the Russian mafia. All of whom were eager to squeeze whatever profits they could from the dying Soviet system and move it out of the country. Indeed, after the failed coup, this became an urgent priority for certain highranking KGB officials, who became pariahs overnight. Between 1991-1997, the flight of capital swelled to a flood, prompting one western observer to describe Russia as “a pocket with holes in it.”16 It seems that in 1995-1996, BoNY executives, working under the authority of senior vice-president Natasha Kagalovsky, set up a computerized wire transfer system to enable the speedy washing of funds out of Russia.17 Records later confirmed that Russian gangsters and even the Cali drug cartel made use of the system.18 Some of the laundered money may also have included loans to Russia from the International Monetary Fund, which points to the likely involvement of corrupt Russian officials.19 Curiously, Ms. Kagalovsky’s husband had been an economic adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and was also an associate of Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky.20 As many as 160,000 separate money transfers were spun through the system over a period of several years: an average of 170 transfers each business day.21 Some of the individual transfers were very large, in the range of $200 million, and they totaled at least $10 billion, though a lawsuit filed in 2007 by the Russian government put the total much higher, at $22 billion.22 Much of the cash ended up in off-shore accounts in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:89:33234127fbd7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4998, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 90, "text": "of Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky.20 As many as 160,000 separate money transfers were spun through the system over a period of several years: an average of 170 transfers each business day.21 Some of the individual transfers were very large, in the range of $200 million, and they totaled at least $10 billion, though a lawsuit filed in 2007 by the Russian government put the total much higher, at $22 billion.22 Much of the cash ended up in off-shore accounts in the Cayman Islands, Liechtenstein and other safe havens. A story in the New York Times hinted at the background role played by the US intelligence community.23 The article named Israeli banker Bruce Rappaport, one of BoNY’s principal shareholders, whose Inter-Maritime Bank in Geneva had directed BoNY’s initial expansion into Russia. Rappaport, a long-time US intelligence asset, had been William Casey’s golfing buddy, one of a select group of cronies who made regular use of Casey’s private elevator when visiting their pal at CIA headquarters.24 A source at the CIA confirmed that Rappaport and Casey even shared a private phone line.25 In the mid-1980s, at the time of Iran-Contra, Rappaport had served as Oliver North’s personal banker. Three different sources have confirmed that a $10 million contribution to North’s Contra War effort from the sultan of Brunei had been deposited in one of Rappaport’s Swiss accounts.26 Also during the 1980s, Rappaport and several other traders including Marc Rich reportedly made a fortune supplying oil to South Africa, in defiance of the world economic embargo against Apartheid.27 Curiously, the Cocke deposition includes what may be a reference to Rappaport’s Swiss American Bank. When Cocke was asked by the interviewing attorney (CD, p. 53) if he knew the origin of the name “Hammer,” his response was: “I do not. And certainly I don’t know where the name Rosebud comes from. Rosebud seems to be the secondary code name to Hammer. But nobody can tell me who is Rosebud, and who is not Rosebud, and I asked a half dozen people…” In their pathbreaking study of global banking, money laundering and international organized crime, All is Clouded by Desire, Alan Block and Constance Weaver mention that Rosebud Investments was a shell company set up in 1985 by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) for the purpose of laundering drug money through a branch of Rappaport’s Swiss American Bank, based in Antigua. While the name could be a coincidence, Rappaport’s shady dealings have done nothing to allay suspicions; on the contrary. In 1987, when US authorities rolled up the IRA ring and attempted to recover $7 million in laundered funds under the RICO act, Rappaport’s bank refused to cooperate and ultimately handed over the cash to the Antiguan government, which, needless to say, was also firmly under Rappaport’s personal control. According to Block and Weaver, in the early 1980s Rappaport and Marvin L. Warner, a business", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:90:8b369b2e958d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 4999, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 91, "text": "be a coincidence, Rappaport’s shady dealings have done nothing to allay suspicions; on the contrary.

According to Block and Weaver, in the early 1980s Rappaport and Marvin L. Warner, a business associate, “practically took over the small Caribbean Island.” In subsequent years, Antigua earned a reputation for Russian money laundering.28 Rappaport even served in an official capacity as the Antiguan ambassador to Russia.29 In 1990, Rappaport made the news again when it was revealed that Israeli mercenaries had been running arms through Antigua to the Medellin drug cartel. The mercenaries had used a “melon farm” owned by Rappaport as a base for training paramilitary forces for the Columbian cartel.30 Incredibly, the property had been purchased with funds provided by an agency of the US government: the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The loan totaled more than a million dollars, courtesy of the US taxpayer.31 In 1985, Rappaport bought out Marvin Warner after an Ohio court convicted his partner of fraud and conspiracy, sentencing him to thirty-two years in prison. In 1997, another business associate, Abbas Kassimali Gokal, who had served on the board of Rappaport’s Inter-Maritime Bank from 1978-1982, was sentenced to 13 years for his involvement in the notorious money laundering BCCI.32 But Rappaport proved more capable than his unsavory associates at staying one step ahead of the law. The investigation into the BoNY money laundering scam was delayed by the 9/11 attacks, but it eventually resumed. In 2007, two BoNY executives who had pled guilty to conspiracy were finally sentenced to six months’ house arrest and a five-year probation period. The two were also ordered to pay a $20, 000 fine and $6 in compensation: a hand slap.34 The Bank of New York reportedly paid $38 million in penalties and compensation, and agreed to “sweeping internal reforms to ensure compliance with its antifraud and money laundering obligations.” Natasha Kagalovsky, who had supervised what may have been the largest money laundry in history, was never charged with a crime.35 After reportedly cutting a deal with BoNY, she testified on behalf of the bank, and was allowed to exercise millions in stock options.36 Did BoNY’s defense attorneys purchase Kagalovsky’s testimony (and her silence) in order to limit the scope of the federal probe? While many questions remain unanswered, it is absolutely clear that BoNY failed to reform itself. On February 14, 2012 New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed suit against BoNY Mellon (in 2007 BoNY merged with Mellon Financial Shares) for defrauding thousands of clients out of some $2 billion in a foreign currency exchange manipulation scheme. According to Schneiderman,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:91:bff663a58c5f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5000, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 92, "text": "stock options.36 Did BoNY’s defense attorneys purchase Kagalovsky’s testimony (and her silence) in order to limit the scope of the federal probe?

On February 14, 2012 New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed suit against BoNY Mellon (in 2007 BoNY merged with Mellon Financial Shares) for defrauding thousands of clients out of some $2 billion in a foreign currency exchange manipulation scheme. According to Schneiderman, BoNY had hatched the scheme in 2001, which of course means that securities fraud was ongoing even during the earlier money laundering investigation and settlement!37 Even as they were agreeing to reform bank practices, BoNY managers were busily fleecing customers! Speaking of chutzpah. In retrospect, there was scarcely a time from the mid-1990s up to the present when BoNY was not engaging in criminal activity. Now we will explore why this matters. As we know, the attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11 proved devastating to the New York financial district. The loss for at least 74% of the civilian casualties. The collapse of WTC-7 sent “I” beams crashing into the Verizon building at 140 West Street, causing telecommunications outages across lower Manhattan. Due to the attacks, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market never opened. The government securities market was especially hard hit because it opens earlier. Trading of government securities starts at 8 a.m., and the borrowing and lending starts at 7 a.m. On a typical day, most of the trading occurs before 9 a.m. and, as a result, at the time of the 9/11 attacks nearly $600 billion in transactions had already been executed.38 The Bank of New York had offices in the financial district (at One Wall Street and at 101 Barclay Street) and was compelled to evacuate some 8,300 employees. BoNY immediately shifted to its backup systems and contingency sites, all of which were located outside the City of New York. Although the press reported otherwise, none of BoNY’s backup facilities were affected by the attacks. The initial backlog was heavy and was due mainly to the widespread phone outages. However, according to Thomas P. (Todd) Gibbons, BoNY’s executive vice president in charge of risk management, BoNY was able to continue processing transactions through its backup facility located in Utica, New York. The initial disruptions lasted for only 2-3 days and by Friday September 14th, the bank had returned to normal processing.39 BoNY actually issued a press release to this effect. Over the weekend of September 15-16, BoNY staff succeeded in clearing the backlog. On Monday the 17th, the New York stock exchange reopened, after a four-day closure, the longest stoppage since the Great Depression. BoNY is one of the largest funds transfer banks in the world, and at the time of 9/11 was responsible for clearing about 50% of government", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:92:df64d8b194d0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5001, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 93, "text": "by Friday September 14th, the bank had returned to normal processing.39 BoNY actually issued a press release to this effect.

BoNY is one of the largest funds transfer banks in the world, and at the time of 9/11 was responsible for clearing about 50% of government securities traded in the United States. Chase Manhattan was the other important clearing bank (though in November 2001 it merged with J.P. Morgan to form J.P. Morgan-Chase). At the time of the attacks, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also shifted to backup contingency procedures and, thereafter, it functioned smoothly throughout the crisis. The Fed facilitated the markets’ return to normalcy by relaxing the rules on trading, and by waiving overdraft fees and penalties. The Fed also made monies and securities available to Wall Street to mitigate the liquidity problems that continued for many weeks. The biggest problem was the persistence of failed transactions, known as “fails,” which happen when sellers are unable to deliver securities on time. The volume of fails jumped from $1.7 billion a day during the typical week of September 5, 2001, to $190 billion a day during the week ending September 19th; and it remained high According to a 2002 study prepared by Federal Reserve officials, the rate of failed transactions “rose initially because of the destruction of trade records and communications facilities. They remained high because the method typically used to avert or remedy a fail, i.e., borrowing a security through a special collateral repurchase agreement (RP), proved as costly as failing to borrow the security.”40 RPs (or repos) are short-term borrowing instruments, and are commonly used by some market participants, especially dealers and owners of hedge funds, who often commit themselves to making purchases in excess of their balances, or commit to selling more securities than they own at a given moment in time. Fails multiplied, in large part, because one failed transaction caused others, setting in motion a type of chain reaction known on Wall Street as a “daisy chain.” If a seller, for example, had not yet received the securities in settlement of a previous purchase, he might not be able to meet an obligation to deliver those same securities in a timely manner, for a subsequent unrelated transaction. In simple language, the system backed up. The problems persisted even after the Fed relaxed the rules because the interest rate on repos fell to near zero. Lenders, as a result, had no incentive to lend. The system of repo borrowing stalled. On October 4, the Fed attempted to resolve the issue by announcing an unprecedented “snap” auction of 10-year securities. The snap auction pumped about $6 billion into the markets,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:93:e795abbc1e5e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5002, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 94, "text": "in a timely manner, for a subsequent unrelated transaction.

On October 4, the Fed attempted to resolve the issue by announcing an unprecedented “snap” auction of 10-year securities. The snap auction pumped about $6 billion into the markets, and in subsequent days the rate of fails began to drop.41 Anyhow, this is the official version of what transpired, according to Federal Reserve officials. E.P. Heidner was not convinced, however, because in his view the Fed never satisfactorily explained why the fails problem was largely concentrated at BoNY, the same institution that had laundered at least $10 billion out of Russia in the 1990s, and which, as noted, continued to engage in securities fraud after 9/11, indeed, even as the earlier money laundering investigation was underway. It is also curious, as BoNY executive Todd Gibbons later acknowledged, that the press chronically misrepresented the situation at BoNY.43 Several articles in the Wall Street Journal, for instance, wrongly stated or implied that the location of BoNY’s Wall Street offices near the WTC rubble pile in lower Manhattan was somehow responsible for its continuing fails problem.44 Not so. And the Financial Times and New York Times made similar errors.45 But were these errors simply honest mistakes? Heidner argues in “Collateral Damage” that 9/11 was the mother of all money laundering scams. He proposes that the reported $100 billion in fails at BoNY was but the “tip of a three-day operation,” during which the Fed conspired with BoNY to launder the $240 billion in covert securities that the cabal around H.W. Bush had collateralized in 1991, and which were coming due at the time of the attacks.46 Heidner thinks the Fed surreptitiously pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into the system, and may even have held down the interest rate on repos to provide the necessary cover for this subterfuge. The truth is that BoNY and the Fed could have gotten away with almost anything in the confusion that prevailed after the 9/11 attacks. Unfortunately, we will probably never learn the truth, unless we succeed in generating sufficient political support to compel a genuine audit of the Fed and the Bank of New York.47 lthough the Fed has acknowledged pumping more than $100 Abillion into the system in the weeks following 9/11,48 to this day the American people have never been told about the sharp spike in the US currency supply that occurred in the weeks before the attacks.

I learned about this from William Bergman, a former financial market analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, where he worked for fourteen years. Bergman contacted me in February 2011 after reading one of my articles online. He believes the whole truth about 9/11 remains to be told.49 In December 2003, soon after accepting a new money laundering assignment at the Chicago Fed, Bergman learned about a supervisory letter that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors had issued to staff on August 2, 2001. The letter was concerned with suspicious activity reporting, and although it did not explicitly mention terrorism or terrorist financing, it nonetheless got Bergman’s attention because these were known to be important elements of selfpolicing initiatives to curb money laundering activities. Bergman had studied the financial data for June - August 2001, and he had some related concerns about the unusual growth in the money supply during this period. Indeed, the expansion in the currency component of the M1 aggregate (which includes demand deposits in checking accounts and the total currency in circulation) was unprecedented. The expansion of currency in circulation in the US between June and August, 2001, which Bergman estimated at $5 billion, was the largest such increase since the Fed began recordkeeping in 1947.50 The currency expansion in July-August 2001 largely consisted of $100 bills, and could be evidence of foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks. Bergman reasoned that someone had withdrawn large amounts of cash beforehand, perhaps to protect himself, assuming he had reason to believe that the US government would seize his assets after the attacks. There were historical precedents. For example, the US government froze Iranian assets at the time of the 1979-81 hostage crisis, and a similar seizure occurred following the 1998 al-Qaeda attacks of the African embassies. Bergman speculated that something similar might have occurred in the weeks before 9/11, though he acknowledges that the August increase could also have been due in part to the Argentinian banking crisis that was ongoing at that time.51 Bergman contacted the Fed’s board of governors about these concerns after first consulting with his supervisor, who instructed him to follow up. However, about a week later Bergman was summarily terminated from his position, and his credentials were canceled. He was told that he had committed a serious breach of protocol. But rather than replacing him, the Fed eliminated the position to which Bergman had been assigned, and his department was absorbed into another department. In March 2004, Bergman accepted a severance package and left the bank. The Government Accountability Project, a whistleblowers’ organization, summarized Bergman’s case", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:95:a7185e90b99f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5004, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 96, "text": "instructed him to follow up.

In March 2004, Bergman accepted a severance package and left the bank. The Government Accountability Project, a whistleblowers’ organization, summarized Bergman’s case in a January 2006 letter sent on his behalf to Fed chairman Alan Greenspan. A copy apparently also went to Mr. Harvey Witherspoon, the Fed’s Inspector General. In the letter GAP urged Greenspan to respond to the questions Bergman had raised, noting that “The Fed’s failure, to date, to publicly address the growth in currency in mid-2001 is conspicuous. If a benign explanation exists, or if for whatever reason the currency growth is irrelevant, the Fed should say so publicly, and explain why this is the case. A failure to do so raises….troubling questions.” This much, at least, ought to be clear: Someone with foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks withdrew very large amounts of cash beforehand, from US bank accounts. The total was at least $5 billion, a vast sum compared to the paltry half-million that, according to the 9/11 Commission, financed al-Qaeda’s plot against America.52 As professor R.T. Naylor suggests in his fine book Satanic Purses, the movement of large amounts of money in association with a terrorist event is an indicator of state terrorism.53 Endnotes 1 James R.

When Mikhail Khodorkovsky was indicted in 2003 for tax evasion and fraud, the powerful Russian oligarch was, at that moment, on the verge of selling off a 40% stake in Russia’s second-largest oil company, Yukos, to Exxon-Mobile and Chevron-Texaco. The talks with the western oil giants had begun soon after an unpublicized meeting between Khodorkovsky and Vice President Dick Cheney. Tanvir Ahmad Khan, “Russia’s Return to Center Stage,” Dawn, February 26, 2007. The timing of the arrest was curious for another reason. It came just a few weeks before a decisive vote in the Russian Duma, where, according to various sources, Khodorkovsky had used his wealth to purchase a majority. Had Russian authorities not acted when they did, the vote might have enabled Khodorkovsky to legislate a pathway to political power. It was a deal-breaker–––Khodorkovsky had agreed to stay out of politics in return for state patronage–––and on this basis William Engdahl concluded that Khodorkovsky made himself the willing vehicle for “a Washington-backed putsch against Putin.” F. William Engdahl, Full Spectrum Subsequent reports tend to bear this out. The Washington Post revealed that Khodorkovsky was also a consultant to the Carlyle Group, a privately held US investment company that is heavily invested in arms manufacturing. Khodorkovsky’s status as consultant would have given him direct access to G.W. Bush, a senior member of the Carlyle board. Greg Schneider, “Arrested Russian Businessman is Carlyle Group Adviser,” Washington Post, November 10, 2003. The Washington Times reported another relevant tidbit. On his arrest, all of Khodorkovsky’s shares in Yukos, including his voting rights, passed to banker Jacob Rothschild, according to a “previously unknown arrangement” that was to take effect if Khodorkovsky was unable, for any reason, to administer his share of the company. Khodorkovsky’s controlling stake in Yukos was worth an estimated $13.5 billion. “Arrested oil tycoon passed shares to banker,” Washington Times, November 2, 2003. This shows that powerful western bankers were backing Khodorkovsky, no doubt, for the purpose of gaining control over a key sector of the Russian economy. As we know, Khodorkovsky’s arrest touched off a flurry of angry editorials in the western press. Outraged critics chaffed that Russia was slipping backward under Putin into authoritarian rule. Western editors were only too happy to feature spirited op/eds by Khodorkovsky himself which, no doubt, he penned from prison. The oligarch’s defense of liberty was less than convincing, but he nonetheless remained a cause celebre in the US and a symbol of dashed freedom.

The oligarch’s defense of liberty was less than convincing, but he nonetheless remained a cause celebre in the US and a symbol of dashed freedom. In order to sustain this mythic image of the persecuted champion, Khodorkovsky’s defenders had to overlook certain unpleasantries: for starters, that he had acquired Yukos via a rigged auction; and that his bank Menatep preyed upon ordinary Russians by selling phony bank shares, which, needless to say, was illegal. David Hoffman, The Oligarchs (New York: Public Affairs, 2003 edition), p. 297-315; p. 211. For this piece of work Khodorkovsky might have been indicted in the West, but in the wild west of Russia it was business as usual. Like many others who found a way to feed on the carcass of communism, Khodorkovsky was less interested in producing something of value than making windfall profits from far more lucrative speculative schemes–––including predation. When the ruble tumbled, in 1998, and bank Menatep along with it, three western banks attempted to recover their $266 million investment by cashing in their collateral, i.e., their secured shares in Yukos. But Khodorkovsky refused to sell, offering oil in lieu of cash (probably because he was strapped). When the western banks declined, the oligarch threatened to dilute their stake with an avalanche of new shares, forcing the banks to dump their stock at a huge loss. Paul Klebnikov, “The Oligarch Who Came in From the Cold,” Forbes, March 18, 2002. While legal in Russia, the predatory practice might have landed Khodorkovsky in a western jail cell. In their hypocrisy, western commentators failed to acknowledge what should have been obvious: that Russia, like any nation, has a right, indeed, a responsibility, to protect vital sectors of its economy in its own interest. Yukos certainly fit that profile. Here in the US no one bats an eye when our government does the very same thing. It is taken for granted that national security will always trump the free market. There were no cries of dashed liberty, for instance, when Washington recently blocked the attempted purchase of Unocal by Chinese capitalists. “China’s CNOOC drops bid for Unocal,” Associated Press, August 2, 2005. The attempted purchase was a thinly-veiled bid by China to expand what was already a Chinese near-monopoly of the world supply of rare earth elements, a commodity that has become crucial for high-tech, hence, vital for national security.

No surprise that the US government intervened on its own behalf, just as the Russian state did in the case of Yukos. Although Heidner writes that George Soros and Jacob Rothschild gained control over Yukos and the other Russian oil giant, Gazprom, Putin reportedly reassumed control over Yukos, in December 2004, by nationalizing the company. “Putin defends Yukos oil asset purchase,” CBCnews, December 23, 2004 n May 2010, an avionics technician named Wayne Anderson went public with testimony about a specific type of black tech-Inology long rumored to exist, but never previously confirmed. In the interview, Anderson told Rob Balsamo, co-founder of Pilots for 9/11 Truth, that in late 1996 or early 1997 he personally witnessed an avionics engineer use black software to remotely control the autopilot of a Boeing 757, in the process “locking out” the flight crew.1 If such a test occurred, it means that this type of remotecontrol technology is not science fiction but reality, and already existed at the time of the 9/11 attacks. For years, critics have pointed to discrepancies in the official 9/11 conspiracy narrative, discrepancies suggesting some type of remote-control operation. But hard evidence, let alone proof, has remained elusive. In the interview, Anderson names the engineer, David Prentice, who Anderson says was a coworker at Dalfort Aviation Services based in Dallas, Texas. At the time, the Boeing 757 was supported on jacks in a hanger at Love Field where it was undergoing maintenance. Anderson says he served as a gofer during the test, and that throughout, Prentice maintained walkie-talkie communication with him and with two other avionics technicians, who were in the 757 cockpit. The first part of the test was a routine procedure known as a “return to service” check, a standard set of protocols done after an overhaul to insure that a plane’s autopilot is working properly. While the technicians put the 757 through its paces in a groundsimulated test flight, the engineer monitored everything from the avionics lab, located at some distance from the aircraft on a second floor between the hanger bays. Once the techs had run through all of the usual protocols, Prentice launched the black software program on his laptop and keyed in a command, which was transmitted by radio signal to the 757’s flight management computer via the aircraft’s mode “S” transponder. The more common mode ^(″)C^(″) and mode “A” transponders transmit a plane’s altitude and air speed to air traffic controllers. A mode “S” transponder does the same. However, in addition, it also includes a data-link capability that allows for two-way sending and receiving of “data", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:101:099ca129db0d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5010, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 102, "text": "the usual protocols, Prentice launched the black software program on his laptop and keyed in a command, which was transmitted by radio signal to the 757’s flight management computer via the aircraft’s mode “S” transponder.

However, in addition, it also includes a data-link capability that allows for two-way sending and receiving of “data packets.” The mode “S” is standard equipment on Boeing 757s. Prentice then took over control of the aircraft and locked out the technicians in the cockpit, who apparently were stunned. Prentice had not briefed them beforehand about what was going to happen during this additional test, which was not a part of the usual return to service check. Anderson, meanwhile, was listening to the chatter, and he says the crew became increasingly distraught when they realized they were no longer in command of the aircraft, a perfectly understandable reaction. Like pilots, avionics technicians take their control of an aircraft for granted. The engineer, now fully in command of the 757, next used the aircraft’s $^ { \\prime \\prime } { \\cal S } ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ transponder to upload a different flight plan into the aircraft’s flight management computer. The new flight plan instructed the autopilot to “fly” a new course. During this time, the technicians in the cockpit were still out of the loop. All they could do was watch helplessly as the autopilot proceeded to fly the 757 on the newly designated course. Anderson says that Prentice tried to calm them down over the walkie-talkies and even had them pull various circuit breakers to see if they could regain control. But they were unable to do so. In a subsequent debriefing with the team, Prentice explained what he had done. But he never revealed where he obtained the mysterious software that had allowed him to control the aircraft’s flight management computer via remote access. The engineering manager, Prentice’s boss, ordered the technicians to hand over all of the documentation for the remote control test, and also made it abundantly clear there would be no further discussion about it. According to Anderson, the manager issued the order after quietly muttering “something about this being a career basher.” Wayne Anderson believes the test utilized “high level commands,” not just “control data,” and that it also necessarily involved more than the black software on the laptop. The test required a hidden “back door,” some kind of firmware, probably engineered into the aircraft when Boeing designed the 757 series. After the test, Prentice instructed two technicians to thoroughly search the aircraft. But they never found any suspicious equipment or wiring.

Anderson was not surprised by this, since the techs did not have authorization from the 757’s owner to disassemble any equipment, only to look. In a subsequent email, Anderson explained: “What they were searching for in the aircraft would be a clandestine electrical panel that would provide a parallel source of power. The power switching electronics existed at the time to make this functional under computer control. Also, the hardware would be very small and easy to hide or camouflage. One would have to know very specifically what to look for.”2 Anderson added that the existence of this type of back door was illegal: a blatant violation of FAA regulations that require all the components in a commercial airliner to be fully documented in the official wiring diagrams. Even so, at the time he assumed that the test only involved proprietary manufacturer’s trade secrets, not “black ops stuff,” as he put it. 3 After 9/11, his views evolved. Wayne Anderson’s testimony offers powerful support for a scenario posted on the Internet soon after the 9/11 attacks by the late Joe Vialls, a British aeronautical engineer who was one of the first to reject the official story about 9/11. In October 2001, Vialls charged that 9/11 was an inside job staged with black technology. Although Vialls’ website has long since disappeared from cyberspace, his original paper fortunately was archived and can still be viewed. He called it “Operation Home Run.”4 Vialls claimed that plans for an avionics back door originated as and the US military jointly launched a top-secret research program in response to a sharp increase in the number of terrorist hijackings during that period. According to Vialls, the research program succeeded in taking remote-control technology to a higher level. The program’s goal was laudatory: to cut the hijackers out of the control loop while empowering ground controllers to return a hijacked plane to a chosen airport, where police could then deal with the terrorists. To be truly effective, however, the new fail-safe technology “had to be completely integrated with all onboard systems.” This could only be achieved by incorporating it into a new aircraft design. The security problems inherent with this type of design ought to be self-evident, because the same technology engineered to foil hijackers might just as easily be used to commit acts of terrorism, such as flying planes into tall buildings. It all depends on who is at the controls. Assuming Vialls was correct, and Boeing did develop such a system, one has to wonder why", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:103:0caef85b22e9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5012, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 104, "text": "all onboard systems.” This could only be achieved by incorporating it into a new aircraft design. The security problems inherent with this type of design ought to be self-evident, because the same technology engineered to foil hijackers might just as easily be used to commit acts of terrorism, such as flying planes into tall buildings. It all depends on who is at the controls. Assuming Vialls was correct, and Boeing did develop such a system, one has to wonder why it was never unveiled. It stands to reason that such a system would be an effective deterrent only if potential hijackers understood that they faced certain capture and prosecution. Vialls also made another startling claim. He contended that Lufthansa airlines discovered the hidden back door soon after taking delivery of a fleet of Boeing jetliners in the 1990s. Lufthansa officials then ordered the Honeywell flight management systems to be stripped out of the Boeings, at considerable trouble and expense. The Honeywell equipment, deemed unacceptable due to the obvious security concerns, was replaced with a German-made counterpart. Although Vialls’ claims have never been confirmed, insofar as I know, they have never been refuted either. Today, they need to be carefully revisited in light of Wayne Anderson’s tale. Andreas von Buelow, a former German government minister of research and technology, took Joe Vialls’ Home Run scenario seriously enough that he discussed it in his controversial 2003 book, The CIA and September 11.5 Von Buelow also made a stunning charge of his own. He claimed that the 9/11 attack was not the work of Islamic extremists, but was an inside job orchestrated by the CIA. Von Buelow’s provocative book probably helps to account for the dramatic shift in German public opinion about 9/11. A recent poll indicated that 89% of Germans do not believe the official version of events on 9/11.6 Nor has von Buelow ever retracted his views. On the contrary, in subsequent radio interviews he continued to insist Von Buelow thinks 9/11 was a covert operation carried out by a sub-group within the US intelligence community, probably numbering fewer than fifty persons. He also joined with 9/11 truth activists in calling for a new (and this time, honest) 9/11 investigation. Von Buelow reportedly served on a German intelligence committee as late as the 1990s, and in that capacity had access to classified information. Von Buelow may have been privy to the details concerning Lufthansa’s experience with Boeing and perhaps other classified information about 9/11 as well. 9/11 Truth as a Process of EliminationT he 9/11 Commission Report describes Hani Hanjour, the alleged ist] operation’s most experienced pilot.”8 But an FBI brief released in early 2009,9 plainly shows that Hanjour had neither the training nor the skills to fly a commercial jetliner.

In 2009, after conducting my own extensive review of all the pertinent documents in the case, I estimated the likelihood that Hanjour piloted AA 77 into the Pentagon at “approximately zero.”10 Hanjour was a perpetual novice who, just three weeks before 9/11, flunked a flight test in a one-engine Cessna, one of the easiest planes to fly. One week later, Hanjour also flunked a simple test for a Virginia driver’s license. It seems clear that Hanjour would have been lost in the cockpit of a commercial airliner. Evidently, a number of professional pilots agree with this assessment. One of them, Philip Marshall, who is licensed to fly both 757s and 767s among other commercial planes, offered his professional opinion in his 2008 book False Flag 911 that the basic flight training the four alleged hijack pilots are known to have had “in no way can explain the expert level of airmanship required for the 9/11 hit.” Recounting his own career as a pilot, Marshall stated, “It took me 20 years, dozens of ground school courses, and 15,000 hours between my first lesson and taking command of my first commercial airliner.” Moreover, without advanced training and many additional hours of in-flight experience needed “to understand the momentum of a 767 [or a 757], they [the hijackers] would have been all over the sky and completely out of control.”11 As we know, such was not the case on 9/11. The 9/11 radar data show that three out of the four allegedly hijacked planes maintained tight trajectories en route to their targets. They were not “all over the sky.” Anything but. In this context, another account of 9/11 deserves mention, even though it adheres to the standard jihadists-flew-the-planes scenario. Robert Schopmeyer, owner of a software company in Los Altos, California, is the author of a unique book, Prior Knowledge of 9/11, in which he recounts his own stranger-than-fiction tale.12 Schopmeyer says that seven months before the World Trade Center attacks, he was reading a magazine article about al-Qaeda while passing time on a transcontinental flight from San Francisco to Newark, when he realized that Osama bin Laden’s 1998 Fatwa calling for the murder of Americans was, in his words, “nothing less than a declaration of war against the United States.”13 Using only his native intuition, simple logic and an engineer’s capacity for deduction, Schopmeyer concluded that an Islamic attack against the US was in the offing, and would probably target the World Trade Center in New York. His analysis turned out to be", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:105:c244614afca8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5014, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 106, "text": "transcontinental flight from San Francisco to Newark, when he realized that Osama bin Laden’s 1998 Fatwa calling for the murder of Americans was, in his words, “nothing less than a declaration of war against the United States.”13 Using only his native intuition, simple logic and an engineer’s capacity for deduction, Schopmeyer concluded that an Islamic attack against the US was in the offing, and would probably target the World Trade Center in New York. His analysis turned out to be correct, down to the smallest details. Schopmeyer anticipated that hijacked airliners would be used as weapons, and even predicted the date of the attack to within about a week. He actually traveled to Boston’s Logan Airport on September 8, 2001 in an attempt to spot terrorists surveying airport security points. For years after the attacks, Schopmeyer endured his own personal purgatory of guilt for not having tried harder to prevent them. I realize that all of this sounds incredible, but several long telephone conversations with Schopmeyer after reading his book convinced me that he is for real.14 His 9/11 research deserves a lot more attention than it has yet received. At first, Schopmeyer believed the official story. However, his own personal 9/11 investigation left him “increasingly perplexed regarding the intelligence agencies’ excuses for not anticipating and preventing … 9/11.^(′′15)A turning point occurred at the 9/11 Commission hearings of April 13-14, 2004, which he attended. Schopmeyer told me that he became enraged listening to CIA Director George Tenet spin obvious lies to the Commission. In Schopmeyer’s words, the CIA chief’s testimony was “so abysmally absurd that it was impossible to understand why the mainstream media gave Tenet a pass.”16 The lying was so transparent that, according to Schopmeyer, just about everyone in the audience was aware of it, including the families of the victims sitting in the front two rows who were shaking their heads, visibly agitated by Tenet’s dissembling. At the hearing, Schopmeyer handed copies of his own account (in an FBI interview) to several of the Commissioners. One of them, Bob Kerrey was so impressed that he came over and inquired in all seriousness why Schopmeyer was not working on the counter-terrorism unit at the CIA. In subsequent days, Schopmeyer continued his own personal investigation. In July 2004, for example, he conducted a twohour interview with Coleen Rowley and her boss in Minneapolis. Rowley, you may recall, was the whistleblower FBI agent who revealed, in an open letter to Bureau director Robert Mueller in May 2002, how the bizarre obstructionism of various intelligence officials delayed FBI agents in the Minneapolis field office from obtaining a search warrant for Zacarias Moussaoui’s laptop computer, already in custody after his arrest for overstaying his visa. Moussaoui was a hypothetical “twentieth hijacker,” and his laptop held information which might have prevented the attacks, if FBI agents had been granted access.

Moussaoui was a hypothetical “twentieth hijacker,” and his laptop held information which might have prevented the attacks, if FBI agents had been granted access. Moussaoui was convicted of various terrorism-related charges in 2006 and sentenced to life in prison. Today, Schopmeyer can cite chapter and verse from many of the official 9/11 reports, large portions of which he has apparently committed to memory. These include the 2002 Joint Inquiry Report prepared by the Joint House/Senate Intelligence Committee, The 9/11 Commission Report released in 2004, both versions of the Department of Justice Inspector General Report (i.e., the November 2004 redacted version and the May 2006 unredacted version), the 2006 account of FBI agent Ali Soufan, and the 2007 Report by the CIA’s Inspector General. One of these documents I had not even heard about. Although several of the official reports were heavily redacted to keep the public in the dark, Schopmeyer defeated the censors in several instances by aggregating and crosschecking all of the reports, which enabled him to fill in key names and connect the dots. author of the bestselling The Looming Tower. Whereas Wright leaves numerous loose ends, Schopmeyer offers a consistent account of what probably happened, including a rational explanation for the CIA disconnects and how, time and again, the Agency withheld key evidence that would have enabled the FBI to roll up the terrorists and prevent the attacks. In Schopmeyer’s view, these were not just missteps, but a deliberate and criminal pattern of obstruction of the honest field agents who were trying to do their job and protect the nation. Ultimately, Schopmeyer succeeded in exposing most of the chain of command at the CIA that was responsible. From the top down, the chain goes from George Tenet to Cofer Black to Richard Blee to Tom Wilshire, the foot soldier who, in May 2001, was ordered to monitor the FBI investigation, and to intervene as necessary to keep the FBI guessing.17 Elsewhere, I have argued that the order by Pentagon higherups to destroy vast amounts of intelligence data became “necessary” after a legitimate counter-terrorism operation known as Able Danger threatened to expose the plot-within-a-plot.18 By February 2000, Lt Col. Anthony Shaffer and his fellow staffers at Able Danger, based at Ft. Belvoir, Virginia, had learned the identity of Mohamed Atta and the other hijackers by means of data-mining: sweeping the Internet with powerful search engines. When higher-ups learned of their success, they ordered the Able Danger staffers to shut down their operation and to destroy 2.5 terabytes of intelligence data.

In 1996, Scheuer set up the CIA’s bin Laden desk, Alec Station (named after Scheuer’s son), and directed it until Director Tenet removed him in June 1999. Scheuer’s replacement was Richard Blee, whose role in the pre-9/11 period has remained obscure. Several 9/11 Commission files refer to Blee, but never by name, either by an alias or with a nondescript label like “an intelligence officer.” The US media has done likewise, referring to Blee only by a number of aliases. In his book Ghost Wars, Steve Coll refers to Blee as “Rich,” and in his memoirs George Tenet refers to him as “Rich B.” Wikipedia identifies Blee only as “Richard” or “Rich” or “Richie.”19 Why the obscurity? Possibly to conceal Blee’s role as the critical link in the chain of command between Blee’s superiors Cofer Black and George Tenet on the one hand, and his immediate subordinate, Tom Wilshire, on the other. Schopmeyer thinks Wilshire was the willing foot soldier carrying out orders from above to obstruct the FBI’s domestic surveillance, so that 9/11 would go off as planned. Blee’s identity would have to be shielded to conceal his true role and protect his superiors. But I digress. Returning to the issue of remote control, Schopmeyer thinks the CIA was complicit in the attacks, but he also believes that the hijackings really happened and that the terrorists actually flew the planes into the buildings. Although I disagree, his conclusions are otherwise so credible that his argument deserves mention. Schopmeyer is a pilot himself, and he argues that the hijacker pilots’ lack of experience gave them a surprising advantage. He thinks they achieved the near impossible, not despite their lack of training but, strangely, because of it. How so? Quite simply, because Hani Hanjour, Mohamed Atta, and Marwan al Shehhi did not stop to consider the level of difficulty of what they were attempting to do. They succeeded precisely because they did not stop to think. They simply shoved the stick forward with a single-minded determination, and flew into history. I do not buy this scenario, because the available evidence shows that the alleged terrorist pilots did not have nerves of steel, quite the contrary.

I do not buy this scenario, because the available evidence shows that the alleged terrorist pilots did not have nerves of steel, quite the contrary. Hani Hanjour, for example, the most experienced of the four terrorist pilots according to the 9/11 Commission was a rather timid and incompetent fellow. Hanjour’s personal issues were not limited to his inability to learn English: the man could not even remember the PIN number for his own bank account. My own beliefs have evolved by degrees. I have come around to the view that the Islamic plot to hijack planes was probably and his cohorts. But the evidence also points to the likely involvement of private corporate interests, with the complicity of various members of the G.W. Bush administration and elements of the US military and intelligence establishments, possibly freelancers. I also wonder about Israeli involvement. Indeed, I suspect it was the Israelis who initially penetrated bin Laden’s operation in Afghanistan. The sum total of evidence points to a plot within a plot. Evildoers guided the jihadist plan, semi-controlling it, augmenting it in various ways, and ultimately making it serve a very different purpose, for which the only adjective is “diabolical.” In short, the spooks hijacked the hijackers, and they succeeded because of cutting-edge technology, which was the handmaiden of the operation. Reality can be stranger than fiction, a lot stranger. If Hani Hanjour was not at the helm of AA 77, there are only two other possibilities, each involving a different type of remote-control technology. Either perpetrators remotely accessed and controlled the flight control systems of the “hijacked” planes using the type of black technology described by Wayne Anderson, or they somehow managed to replace all of the “hijacked” planes with look-alike drones wired for remote control in the more conventional manner. Over the years, a number of 9/11 researchers have entertained one or another version of the plane-swap hypothesis, which in my opinion deserves consideration because a plane-swap was included in a Cold War-era plan that almost became operational. Operation Northwoods was a covert false-flag terrorist scheme hatched by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962 as a pretext for a US invasion of Cuba. The previously secret memoranda documenting the proposals were declassified upon release in 1997 by the J.F.K. Assassination Records Review Board. One of Northwoods’ mock attacks (the plan also proposed real attacks on Americans) involved the mid-flight swap of an identical drone for a chartered civilian aircraft, which would then be safely diverted.

One of Northwoods’ mock attacks (the plan also proposed real attacks on Americans) involved the mid-flight swap of an identical drone for a chartered civilian aircraft, which would then be safely diverted. The identical drone would continue on the chartered plane’s designated flight path, carefully selected to overfly Cuba, where it would transmit false MAYDAY signals indicating attack by Cuban MIG’s. The drone would then be exploded over the Caribbean by radio signal. First revealed in 2001 by former National Security Agency employee James Bamford,21 the plan was never implemented. President John F. Kennedy rejected it out of hand and fired the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Lyman Lemnitzer (who had already antagonized the president in other ways). The record plainly shows that US military strategists are capable of such schemes. Yet, insofar as I am aware, no one has produced a scintilla of evidence that a plane swap occurred on September 11, 2001. This is no surprise because the plane-swap scenario suffers from insurmountable difficulties. Northwoods assumed an unquestioning compliance by the unharmed crew and passengers of the diverted flight, who were to be sworn to secrecy, while a new list of dummy aliases was substituted for the actual passenger list. Taking that level of compliance for granted was unlikely in 1962, and certainly unimaginable in 21^(st) century America. Other nagging questions also bedevil the plane-swap scenario. If commercial aircraft were swapped for drones on 9/11, what became of the passengers and crew? And what happened to the swapped planes? These are salient questions. It seems obvious that the planned scenario of Operation Northwoods does not translate well to September 11, 2001. True, not all of the difficulties would apply in the case of a different variant of the plane-swap hypothesis. Journalist Christopher Bollyn thinks the Israeli Mossad somehow staged a plane swap before flights AA 11 and UAL 175 took off from Boston’s Logan International Airport. Bollyn has been investigating IAI (Israeli Aerospace Industries, formerly known as Israeli Aircraft Industries), which controls several aircraft leasing and maintenance companies in the United States, one of which, ATASCO, began operating in the early 1970s.22 Bollyn says 23that within hours after he contacted Shalon Yoran, the former Israeli chairman of ATASCO, three undercover policemen arrived at his house, tasered him, and broke his elbow in front of his wife and children. IAI reportedly specializes in converting Boeing aircraft into tankers, and has done this for a variety of customers since the early 1980s. According to the Jerusalem Post, IAI completed its first conversion of a Boeing 767 passenger jet into a cargo plane in 2000.24 For these reasons, it is theoretically possible that Israeli agents", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:110:9be55882816b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5019, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 111, "text": "the former Israeli chairman of ATASCO, three undercover policemen arrived at his house, tasered him, and broke his elbow in front of his wife and children.

According to the Jerusalem Post, IAI completed its first conversion of a Boeing 767 passenger jet into a cargo plane in 2000.24 For these reasons, it is theoretically possible that Israeli agents helped arrange a plane swap just prior to 9/11. To date, however, neither Bollyn nor anyone has presented any evidence that this actually happened, and his scenario must be viewed as purely speculative. In recent years, Bollyn’s online articles have explored the suspicious role on 9/11 of an Israeli-owned security firm, International Consultants on Targeted Security International (ICTS), which was founded in 1982 by former members of El Al (Israeli Airlines) and the Shin Bet (currently known as Shabak), the Israeli equivalent of the FBI. A subsidiary of ICTS, Huntleigh USA, reportedly shared security duties at Logan International on September 11, 2001. Curiously, ICTS also handled security at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris in December 2001, when the mentally disturbed “shoe bomber” Richard Reid successfully boarded a US-bound jetliner. Nor is this all. The Israeli company also had the security contract for London’s bus system at the time of the infamous July 7, 2005 terrorist bombings in London.25 According to an Associated Press report, then-Israeli Finance Minister (and once-and-future Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu that morning canceled plans to attend an economic conference in a hotel located above the subway stop where one of the blasts occurred, after receiving a last-minute warning from the British police.26 In a bizarre twist, the AP subsequently retracted the story following an emphatic denial from the Israeli embassy. Meanwhile, Stratfor, a private security firm, reported that the press got it exactly backwards. Stratfor claimed it was actually Israeli government officials who warned Scotland Yard, not vice versa. According to Stratfor, the Israeli warning came several days earlier, but the British chose not to act.27 An ICTS subsidiary was also responsible for security at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport on Christmas day 2009, when the so called “underwear bomber,” a Nigerian named Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, successfully boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 253, bound for Detroit.28 Abdulmutallab was arrested after he attempted to detonate plastic explosives hidden in his underwear, which fortunately failed to go off. This means that ICTS personnel were at the scene of four of the most notorious terrorist attacks of recent years, and on each occasion failed to prevent the attack.29 Was this merely a set of coincidences? But whatever role Isrealis may have had in the events of 9/11, the complexities of a plane-swap operation make this an unrealistic alternative to the elegant simplicity of remote control.

But whatever role Isrealis may have had in the events of 9/11, the complexities of a plane-swap operation make this an unrealistic alternative to the elegant simplicity of remote control. In March 2007, after posting an article on the Internet in which I speculated about the use of remote-control technology on 9/11, I heard from a veteran pilot with more than forty-five years flying experience. “If there truly is a back door,” he wrote, “then it would be a simple matter to have remotely done 9/11.” According to this veteran pilot, a single transmitter in a window of each World Trade tower and at the Pentagon would have provided all of the necessary guidance for a “routine autopilot coupled approach.”30 Although generally unknown by the public, the computerized flight management system in commercial airliners is so advanced that pilots seldom touch the controls. A modern autopilot, officially termed the “flight director,” is more than capable of flying a modern passenger jet from takeoff to landing. Moreover, as good as the system already was, in the mid-to-late 1990s the airline industry achieved a quantum jump in navigation performance with the rapid development of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, a critical path that my colleague Aidan Monaghan covers very thoroughly in this book’s Foreword and Afterword. Despite strenuous efforts, however, I have not been able to independently confirm that the remote control test reported by Wayne Anderson actually took place. In August 2010, I located the engineer David Prentice, who was then employed in Houston at Continental Airlines. I reached Prentice at work and spoke with him over the telephone. He remembered Wayne Anderson from his days at Dalfort Aviation; this in itself was a partial confirmation. However, Prentice denied staging a remote control test at Love Field.31 I was left with the frustration that so often attends 9/11 research, a field wherein promising leads so often play out in fuzzyland, or sputter in the face of denial. Wayne Anderson was not in the least surprised by David Prentice’s response, however, and he may have the right perspective. After all, Prentice still works in the airline industry. Were he to acknowledge his central part in staging an unauthorized test of what surely must have been a highly classified type of software (assuming Anderson’s story is accurate), it is a safe bet that disclosure might wreck Prentice’s career. The likely loss of both job and retirement benefits would be reason enough to deny everything. And who knows? An affirmation could have even more serious consequences.

The national security apparatus does not look kindly upon impertinent leaks of black technologies that officially do not exist. Individuals have been made to disappear for less. There is a simple way to determine if Wayne Anderson is telling the truth. If Boeing did hardwire a back door into its commercial airliners, records of this must exist, records that a genuine 9/11 investigation could subpoena. And if it turns out that the records have gone missing, or, if by some act of God a raging fire should sweep through the Boeing offices where the records are stored, well, there would still be the physical evidence, i.e, the firmware.

June 21, 2010. n August 2004 when the 9/11 Commission completed its official investigation of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Com-Imission transferred custody of its voluminous records to the National Archives and Records Administration,1 where the records remained under lock and key for four and a half years. In January 2009, NARA released a considerable fraction (about 35% of the total) for public viewing. Each day, more of the released files are scanned and posted on the Internet, making them readily accessible. Although most of the newly released documents are of little interest, a select few contain important new information. Several files show that the FBI and 9/11 Commission suppressed crucial evidence about Hani Hanjour, the alleged hijack pilot of American Airlines Flight 77. By undermining the official explanation that Hani Hanjour crashed AA 77 into the Pentagon at high speed after executing an extremely difficult top-gun maneuver, this evidence indirectly supports the case for remotely controlled aircraft. But to understand how all of this plays out, it is best to approach the story in bite-sized pieces. As we know, the 9/11 Commission did not begin its work until late 2003, more than two years after the attacks. By this time, a number of journalists had already done independent research and published articles about various aspects of 9/11. Some of this work was of excellent quality. The Washington Post, for example, interviewed aviation experts who said that AA 77 had been flown “with extraordinary skill, making it highly likely that a trained pilot was at the helm.”2 Experts told CNN the same story: the hijackers, including Hani Hanjour, must have been extremely knowledgeable and capable", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:114:2243f95d4498", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5023, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 115, "text": "after the attacks.

Danielle O’Brien, who was working in the radar room at Dulles Airport on 9/11 and who handled the routine, on-time departure of American Flight 77, later tracked the blip as it sped toward the Pentagon. “The speed,” she told ABC News, “the maneuverability, the way that he turned, we all thought in the radar room, all of us experienced air traffic controllers, that that was a military plane.”4 CBS interviewed experts who said that the hijacker pilot of AA 77 executed a difficult high-speed descending turn, during which the aircraft dropped 7,000 feet in two and a half minutes. “The steep turn was so smooth, the sources said, it’s clear there was no fight for control going on. And the complex maneuver suggests the hijackers had better flying skills than many investigators first believed.”5 In a related story, the Washington Post quoted an expert who described the steep, accurate descent into the Pentagon as the work of “a great talent … virtually a textbook turn and landing.”6 Yet, strangely, when journalists investigated Hani Hanjour himself, they found a trail of clues indicating he was a novice pilot, wholly incapable of executing any top-gun maneuver, let alone in a Boeing 757. By early 2003, this independent research was a matter of public record, which created a serious problem for the 9/11 Commission. By all accounts, 29-year-old Hani Hanjour was a diminutive fellow. He stood five-feet-five and was slight of build. As a young man in his hometown of Taif, Saudi Arabia, Hanjour cultivated no great dreams of flying airplanes. The man was satisfied with a more modest ambition: he wanted to become a flight attendant. That is, until his older brother Abulrahman encouraged him to aim higher. While it is true that Hani Hanjour trained at various flight schools in the US, the evidence shows he was a perpetual novice. Hanjour dropped out of his first school, the Sierra Academy of Aeronautics, located in Oakland, California, after attending only a few classes. Next, he enrolled at Cockpit Resource Management (CRM), a flight school in Scottsdale, Arizona. But his performance as a student was less than satisfactory. Paul V. Blair, the school’s controller, told the Duncan K.M. Hastie, owner of the school, described Hanjour as “a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:115:98902bc56fab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5024, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 116, "text": "at various flight schools in the US, the evidence shows he was a perpetual novice.

Blair, the school’s controller, told the Duncan K.M. Hastie, owner of the school, described Hanjour as “a weak student” who was “wasting our resources.”8 After several weeks, Hanjour withdrew from the program, but then returned in 1997 for another short period of instruction. This on-and-off pattern of behavior was typical of the man. Hastie says that over the next three years Hanjour called him at least twice a year, and each time wanted to return for more training. By this time, however, it was obvious to Hastie that his erstwhile student had no business in a cockpit. Hastie refused to let Hanjour come back. “I would recognize his voice,” Hastie said. “He was always talking about wanting more training. Yes, he wanted to be an airline pilot. That was his stated goal. That’s why I didn’t allow him to come back. I thought ‘You’re never going to make it.’”9 Rejected by CRM, Hanjour enrolled at nearby Sawyer Aviation, also located in the Phoenix area. Wes Fults, a former instructor at Sawyer, later described it as the school of last resort: “It was a commonly held truth that, if you failed anywhere else, go to Sawyer.” Fults remembers training Hanjour, whom he describes as “a neophyte.” He says Hani “got overwhelmed with the instruments” in the school’s flight simulator. “He had only the barest understanding of what the instruments were there to do,” said Fults. Hanjour “used the simulator three or four times, then disappeared like a fog.”10 In 1998, Hanjour enrolled at another flight school in the area, Arizona Aviation. There, his initial trainer was a Japanese flight instructor who later submitted a detailed statement to the FBI about his impressions of Hanjour. We do not know the instructor’s name, which is redacted from the document, but he claimed that he instructed Hani Hanjour “for about four months,” from May to September 1998. going. I did not think that he was the type of person to become an airline pilot. He was a follower and not a leader, had few opinions of his own and had, in my view, almost no initiative.

His knowledge of the academic side of training was weak, his flying skills were marginal, but most significantly his judgment was very poor.”11 The Japanese instructor goes on to explain that on one occasion Hanjour failed to remember even the most rudimentary protocol: he was about to take off on a training flight with a near-empty fuel tank, and would have if the instructor had not caught the error and reminded him to be more careful. Strangely, when the instructor “questioned him about the lack of fuel,” Hanjour “seemed mildly amused rather than appalled by his possibly life-threatening mistake.” The instructor concludes his testimonial as follows: “In retrospect, Hani Hanjour was not someone cut out to be a pilot. He had no motivation, a poor understanding of the basic principles of aviation, and poor judgment, combined with poor technical skills. His personality was weak and I have no doubt that he could have been easily persuaded to do almost anything.”12 n the United States, fluency in English is required to qualify for I a pilot’s license, for which reason Hanjour’s atrocious English should have barred him from ever obtaining a license. But it appears that Hanjour exploited a loophole in the Federal Aviation Administration system, which for years has outsourced the pilot certification process. According to a June 2002 story in the Dallas Morning News, Hanjour was certified in April 1999 as an “Airplane Multi-Engine Land/Commercial Pilot” by Daryl Strong, one of the FAA’s 20,000 designated pilot examiners.13 Although an FAA official later defended the agency’s policy of using private contractors, some critics, including Heather Awsumb, took issue with it. Awsumb is a spokesperson for the Professional Airways Systems Specialists Union, which represents more than 11,000 FAA and Defense Department employees. She pointed out that the FAA does not have anywhere near enough staff to oversee its 20,000 designated inspectors, all of whom have a financial interest in certifying as many pilots as possible. It seems that Hanjour evaded the language requirement by finding an examiner willing to ignore the rule. Said Awsumb, “They receive between $200 and $300 for each flight check. If they get a reputation for being too tough, they won’t get any business.” According to Awsumb, the present system allows “safety to be sold to the lowest bidder.”14 I must also emphasize that Hani Hanjour’s commercial license did not qualify him to fly commercial airliners, only to begin training to fly them. When he subsequently enrolled at Jet Tech International, another flight school in the Phoenix area, Hanjour’s horrible English prompted school officials to question the authenticity of his FAA-approved pilot’s license.

When he subsequently enrolled at Jet Tech International, another flight school in the Phoenix area, Hanjour’s horrible English prompted school officials to question the authenticity of his FAA-approved pilot’s license. Peggy Chevrette, operation manager at Jet Tech, later told FOX News: “I couldn’t believe that he had a license of any kind with the skills that he had.”15 She explained that Hanjour’s English was so bad it took him five hours to complete an exam that normally should have taken about two. But it wasn’t just his poor English that failed to impress. In his evaluation, the Jet Tech flight instructor Rodney McAlear wrote, “Student made numerous errors during his performance and displayed a lack of understanding of some basic concepts. The same was true during review of systems knowledge … Hani is very intelligent, but to move beyond the comprehension level (or rote level in some cases) Hani needs more experience … I doubt his ability to pass an FAA [Boeing 737] oral [exam] at this time or in the near future.” The 737 instructor also concluded his evaluation of Hanjour with a significant comment: “He will need much more experience flying smaller A/C [aircraft] before he is ready to master large jets.”16 The 9/11 Commission Report fails to discuss or even mention these negative written evaluations, even while presenting Hanjour’s substandard performance in a Boeing 737 simulator as sufficient evidence that Hanjour could fly a Boeing 757, an even larger plane. The wording of the final report succeeds in giving this dubious impression, while obscuring the facts: an amazing achievement of propaganda.17 Early in 2001, Peggy Chevrette, the operation manager at Jet Tech, contacted the FAA repeatedly to convey her concerns about Hanjour. According to Chevrette, a federal inspector eventually showed up at the school and examined Hanjour’s credentials, but found them to be in order and took no further action. Apparently he even suggested that Jet Tech provide Hanjour with an interpreter. This surprised Chevrette, because it was a violation of FAA rules. FOX News was unable to reach the inspector for comment, but FAA spokesperson Laura Brown defended the FAA employee. “There was nothing about the pilot’s actions” she said, “to signal criminal intent or that would have caused us to alert law enforcement.”19 This is true enough. The Jet Tech staff also never suspected that Hani Hanjour was a terrorist. But that is not the point.

According to Marilyn Ladner, vice-president of Pan Am International, which owned Jet Tech: “It was more of a very typical instructional concern that ‘you really shouldn’t be in the air’” [my emphasis].20 Although Pan Am dissolved its Jet Tech operation shortly after 9/11, a former employee who knew Hanjour expressed amazement “that he could have flown into the Pentagon. He could not fly at all.”21 We know that in the months before the September 11, 2001 at-tacks, Hani Hanjour rented planes at several small airports on the outskirts of New York City and Washington DC. The 9/11 Commission Report mentions these local flights and suggests that Hanjour was scouting the terrain: familiarizing himself with possible targets.22 But the record here also shows the same pattern described above. For example, on May 29, 2001 Hanjour rented a plane at a small airport in Teterboro, New Jersey and flew the “Hudson Tour,” accompanied by a flight instructor. However, the next day, when Hanjour returned for a repeat flight, the same instructor “would not allow it because of Hanjour’s poor piloting skills.”23 The 9/11 Commission Report actually cites this incident, but in a context that diminishes its significance.24 This pattern played out again on August 16 and 17, 2001, when Hanjour attempted to rent a plane at Freeway Airport, in Bowie, Maryland, about twenty miles from Washington. According to a report in Newsday, although Hanjour presented his FAA license, the Freeway manager insisted that instructors first accompany him on a test flight to evaluate his piloting skills. During three such flights over two days in a single-engine Cessna 172, instructors Sheri Baxter and Ben Conner observed what others had before them. Hanjour had trouble controlling and landing the aircraft. Afterward, Baxter interviewed Hanjour extensively about his flight training and experience, and she also reviewed his flight log, which documented six hundred hours of flight time. On the basis of that record, she and Conner declined to approve a current license rating until Hanjour returned for more training. On their recommendation, Freeway’s chief instructor Marcel Bernard refused to rent Hanjour a plane.25 This was less than a month before 9/11. The 9/11 Commission Report acknowledges Hanjour’s poor English and substandard flying skills. The report even mentions that flight instructors had urged Hanjour to give up trying to become a pilot.28 As stated previously, however, an endnote describes him as “the operation’s most experienced pilot,” suggesting that the Commission may have had a mixed opinion about Hanjour.29 In the end the official investigation evidently interpreted Hanjour’s FAA license as sufficient proof he had “persevered” in overcoming", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:119:55832252e10e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5028, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 120, "text": "than a month before 9/11.

Perseverance obviously was not enough. The instructor’s negative evaluation was based on Hanjour’s skill set at the time. The Other Flight InstructorThe NARA files released since 2009 raise further issues. It turns ation in a Cessna 172 at Freeway Airport, he showed up at Congressional Air Charters, located down the road at Montgomery County Airpark in Gaithersburg, Maryland, also in the Washington suburbs. Once again, Hanjour attempted to rent a plane, and again he was asked to go up with an instructor for a flight evaluation to confirm his flight skills. The plane was the same: a Cessna 172. Yet, on this occasion Hanjour passed with flying colors and this other instructor later gave testimony to the commission that turned out to be crucial. Their Report mentions the instructor’s name only once, in a brief note buried at the back in small print, as is typical of its treatment of crucial data: Hanjour successfully conducted a challenging certification flight supervised by an instructor at Congressional Air Charter of Gaithersburg, Maryland, landing at a small airport with a difficult approach. The instructor thought Hanjour may have had training from a military pilot because he used a terrain recognition system for navigation. Eddie Shalev interview. (Apr. 9, 2004)31 The note gives a name, “Eddie Shalev,” but no other information about him. Indeed, his identity remained a mystery until January 2009, when NARA released the 9/11 files.32 But David Ray Griffin had already identified the key questions in his 2008 book The New Pearl Harbor Revisited: “How could an instructor in Gaithersburg have had such a radically different view of Hanjour’s abilities from that of all of the other flight instructors who worked with him? Who was this instructor? How could this report be verified?”33 Fortunately, one of the newly released documents, an FBI file on Hani Hanjour, sheds additional light on the case.34 The file ingovernment’s case against Hanjour.

I learned about it from Miles Kara, who served as a staffer on the 9/11 Commission, and who insisted to me in an email that the file verifies Hani Hanjour’s expertise as a pilot. At a glance it appears to do that. On closer examination however, the file is much less impressive, and I have to wonder if Kara actually studied it. As we will see, the document not only falls short of confirming Hanjour’s flight skills, it shows signs of having been “enhanced” to obscure the record. Crucially, the FBI file includes not one scintilla of evidence that Hani Hanjour ever trained in a Boeing 757. Although, as we know, Hanjour did some sessions in a Boeing 737 simulator, the press accounts, and more importantly his own instructors’ written evaluations, offer a clear and unambiguous assessment of his actual skills. It is also important to realize that even if Hanjour had mastered the controls of a Boeing 737 on the simulator, this would not have qualified him to fly a Boeing 757, which is a significantly larger and less maneuverable aircraft. These are the views of commercial pilots who fly these planes every day.35 Philip Marshall, one such pilot who is licensed to fly Boeing 727s, 737s, 747s, 757s and 767s, in his book False Flag 911, states categorically that none of the alleged 9/11 hijacker pilots could have flown 757s and 767s into buildings at high speed without advanced training and practice flights in that same aircraft over a period of months. As Marshall put it: “Hitting a 90-foot target [i.e., the Pentagon] with a 757 at 500 mph is extremely difficult—absolutely impossible for first-time fliers of a heavy airliner. It’s like seeing Tiger Woods hit a 300-yard one-iron, and someone telling you he never practiced the shot.”36 Marshall speculates that the hijackers may have received advanced flight lessons from Arabic-speaking instructors at a secret desert base somewhere in Arizona or Nevada, possibly arranged by complicit Saudi diplomats or by members of the Saudi royal family.37 However, Hanjour’s inability to pass a test flight evaluation in a one-engine Cessna at Freeway airport, just weeks before 9/11 effectively rules out Marshall’s theory of advanced instruction. Close inspection of the FBI file shows that someone padded the record, evidently to put the best face on Hanjour’s flight training. This was done in a curious way.

Even so, the enhancement becomes transparent upon examination. The day-by-day detail also obscures Hanjour’s tendency to jump around from school to school and his inability to finish anything he started, which would appear clearly in a more standard, summary account. The FBI file also conspicuously fails to mention the Jet Tech instructor’s written evaluation of Hani Hanjour’s flying skills. The omission is serious, and qualifies as suppression of evidence, because we know the FBI had the document in its possession. The document was first made public at the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui in 2004, when it was submitted as evidence. This means, of course, that the 9/11 Commission also had the document and suppressed it. The FBI file also grossly mischaracterizes what happened at Freeway Airport. The file mentions Hanjour’s visits, but wrongly indicates that Hanjour received flight instruction. When I specifically asked Marcel Bernard about this, he categorically denied it and emphasized that Hanjour’s test flights included no lessons and were strictly for the purpose of evaluation.38 The FBI should have known this because Bernard and his two flight instructors notified the FBI after 9/11 about Hanjour’s visit, and they were subsequently interviewed by FBI agents. The file, however, makes no mention of these interviews. The file also conspicuously fails to mention that Hanjour flunked his test flight evaluation. Whether through incompetence or deception, the FBI failed to state the facts correctly. The FBI file does, however, offer some fresh insights into Hani Hanjour the man. On August 2, 2001, according to the timeline, Hanjour showed up at the Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles in Arlington, where he flunked a standard written test for a Virginia driver’s license. This is significant, and it ought to make us wonder how Hanjour ever managed to acquire his previous driver’s licenses—a 1991 Arizona license and a Florida license issued in 1996—let alone master the controls of a Boeing 757. There is another interesting item. The record indicates that on September 5, 2001, just six days before 9/11, Hanjour showed up at the First Union National Bank in Laurel, Maryland, where he made four failed bank transactions. The file cites bank records showing that Hanjour was unable to make balance inquiries and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:122:678e22cde01c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5031, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 123, "text": "how Hanjour ever managed to acquire his previous driver’s licenses—a 1991 Arizona license and a Florida license issued in 1996—let alone master the controls of a Boeing 757.

The file cites bank records showing that Hanjour was unable to make balance inquiries and withdraw funds from his account because he failed to enter the correct PIN number, which he evidently had forgotten. Two days later, Hanjour returned to the bank, this time accompanied by an unidentified male, and made another unsuccessful attempt to withdraw funds, in this case $4900 . It is astonishing that the FBI file was ever touted as authenticating Hanjour’s flight credentials. The document falls short on that score and actually raises new questions. How likely is it that a man who was unable to remember his own PIN number, and who just weeks before 9/11 flunked a simple test for a driver’s license, could have executed a difficult maneuver in a commercial airliner? The chances, I would submit, are approximately zero. The FBI file includes one other curious entry. On August 20, 2001 Hanjour shopped at Travelocity.com for information about September 5, 2001 flights from Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles. This suggests that, as of August 20, Hanjour did not yet know the date of the planned attack, either because he had not been briefed or because the date had not yet been selected. By the end of the month, however, the die was cast. Who is Eddie Shalev?The record compiled by the FBI for the purpose of authenticatfails to support the testimony of the “other flight instructor,” Eddie Shalev, who certified Hanjour to rent a Cessna 172 from Congressional Air Charters just three days after Marcel Bernard, the chief instructor at Freeway, refused to rent Hanjour the very same type of plane. As we know, The 9/11 Commission Report makes no mention of the incident at Freeway airport, nor does it discuss Eddie Shalev, other than identifying him in a brief endnote. The failure to discuss this other flight instructor was a grave omission, because it now appears that Shalev’s testimony was crucial. By telling the Commission what it was predisposed to hear, Shalev gave the official investigation an excuse to ignore the preponderance of evidence, which pointed to the unthinkable. So, who is Eddie Shalev? His identity remained unknown for more than seven years, but was finally revealed in one of the files released in January 2009 by the National Archives. The document, labeled a “Memorandum for the Record,” is a summary of the April 2004 interview with Eddie Shalev conducted by commission staffer Quinn John Tamm.39 The document confirms that Shalev went on record: “Mr", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:123:10b2ab5f9d9c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5032, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 124, "text": "investigation an excuse to ignore the preponderance of evidence, which pointed to the unthinkable.

The document, labeled a “Memorandum for the Record,” is a summary of the April 2004 interview with Eddie Shalev conducted by commission staffer Quinn John Tamm.39 The document confirms that Shalev went on record: “Mr Shalev stated that based on his observations Hanjour was a ‘good’ pilot,” which is certainly consistent with the endnote in The 9/11 Commission Report. It is noteworthy that Tamm also spoke with Freeway instructors Sheri Baxter and Ben Conner, as revealed by yet another recently released document.40 Although I was unable to reach Tamm or Baxter for comment, I did contact Conner, who confirmed his conversation with Tamm.41 Conner says he fully expected to appear before the Commission, where he would have been able to challenge Shalev’s assessment. However, the call never came. But the real news is the revelation that Eddie Shalev had previously been in the Israeli military. The file states, “Mr. Shalev served in the Israeli Defense Forces in a paratroop regiment. He was a jumpmaster on a Boeing C-130. Mr. Shalev moved to the Gaithersburg area in April 2001 and was sponsored for employment by Congressional Air Charters … [which] has subsequently gone out of business.” The memorandum raises a number of disturbing questions. Consider, for example, the staffer’s choice of words in describing Shalev’s employment. What did Quinn John Tamm mean when he wrote that Shalev “was sponsored for employment”? The same curious wording can be found in a subsequent court document, which indicates that although Congressional Air Charters agreed in March 2001 to “sponsor and employ” Eddie Shalev as a test pilot, Shalev did not actually show up for work until August 2001, shortly before his test flight with Hani Hanjour.42 Are we to believe this was a mere coincidence? Had the Commission bothered to investigate Congressional Air Charters, they would have learned that its owner, Monty Lilley, was a convicted felon. In 1992, a Gaithersburg, Maryland court sentenced Lilley to 30 months in prison and ordered him to pay $3 million in restitution, after finding him guilty of embezzling $3.1 million from a pension fund.43 We are indebted to 9/11 researcher Chris Bollyn for his diligence in recently bringing this important information to light.44 It is well known that intelligence operations often make use of “cut outs” or front companies run by individuals with criminal backgrounds. Monty Lilley’s criminal record therefor raises questions about his charter service and also about Eddie Shalev.

But the whereabouts of Eddie Shalev has been unknown for years. As reported by David Griffin, a 2007 search of the national telephone directory, plus Google searches by research librarian Elizabeth Woodworth, turned up no trace of Shalev. A LexisNexis search by Matthew Everett also came up dry. ersburg-Rockville, Maryland area. But the leads went nowhere, and his phone number was no longer in service. Court documents indicate that Shalev attempted to obtain permanent legal residence status in the US after his visa expired in July 2004. However, the courts ruled against him in 2007, suggesting that Shalev eventually returned to Israel.46 Further searches turned up an Israeli businessman with the same name. According to his on-line bio, Eddy Shalev of Herzliya Pituach, Israel has had a long career as an equity investor in various emerging growth and technology companies.47 The bio describes Shalev as “one of the best known figures in the Israeli business community.” This Eddy Shalev holds a Masters Degree in information Systems and B.A. in statistics, both from Tel Aviv University, and mentions that he worked for a time in the computer center at the Israeli Ministry of Defense. However, the bio says nothing about flying or military service. This Eddy Shalev appears to be a different individual. Did a spook borrow his name? Eddie (or Eddy) Shalev, Monty Lilley, Quinn John Tamm and the two Freeway instructors, Sheri Baxter and Ben Conner, are key witnesses; and all of them should be subpoenaed and questioned under oath before a new 9/11 investigation. The search for, identification of, and extradition of the man pretending to be Eddie Shalev could prove controversial, but we must follow the trail of evidence, regardless. Should it lead into a dark wood, we must resolve to go there. No political force can be allowed to trump the search for 9/11 truth. 1 http://www.archives.gov/research/9-11-commission/. 2 Marc Fisher and Don Phillips, “On Flight 77: ‘Our Plane is Being Hijacked’,” Washington Post, September 12, 2001. 3 “Hijackers ‘knew what they were doing’,” CNN, September 12, 2001, posted at http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/12/hijackers.skills/. 4 “‘Get These Planes on the Ground’: Air Traffic Controllers Recall Sept. 11, ABC News, October 24, 2001, posted at http://web.archive.org/web/20011025074733/ http://abcnews.go.com/sections/2020/2020/2020_011024_atc_feature.html. 5 “Primary Target: 189 Dead Or Missing From Pentagon Attack”, CBS News, September 21, 2001, posted at http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/09/11/national/ main310721.shtml. 6 Steve Fainaru and Alia Ibrahim, “Mysterious Trip to Flight 77 Cockpit”, Washington Post, September 10, 2002, posted at", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:125:047c787dc795", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5034, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 126, "text": "Hijacked’,” Washington Post, September 12, 2001. 3 “Hijackers ‘knew what they were doing’,” CNN, September 12, 2001, posted at http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/12/hijackers.skills/. 4 “‘Get These Planes on the Ground’: Air Traffic Controllers Recall Sept. 11, ABC News, October 24, 2001, posted at http://web.archive.org/web/20011025074733/ http://abcnews.go.com/sections/2020/2020/2020_011024_atc_feature.html. 5 “Primary Target: 189 Dead Or Missing From Pentagon Attack”, CBS News, September 21, 2001, posted at http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/09/11/national/ main310721.shtml. 6 Steve Fainaru and Alia Ibrahim, “Mysterious Trip to Flight 77 Cockpit”, Washington Post, September 10, 2002, posted at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/ 8 Amy Goldstein, Lena H.

First, I will state the official explanation, then, introduce the anomalous physical evidence and eyewitness accounts that call the official story into question. In the course of the discussion I will also propose solutions to several outstanding mysteries, including the controversy over the crash time and the prescient question raised by Air Traffic Controller Stacey Taylor about United 93’s transponder which, as we know, had been turned off earlier in the flight but came back on just moments before the plane disappeared from radar. Within hours, a swarm of FBI agents descended upon Shanksville and the alleged crash site. Initially, the FBI refused to rule out a shootdown, and even briefly entertained the possibility of a midair explosion. However, on September 13, 2001, the US military announced that no NORAD fighters had been involved in a shootdown.2 The next day, FBI spokesman William Crowley repeated the NORAD denial when he told the press, “There was no military involvement.”3 Soon the major networks began parroting the line that hijacker edge of a reclaimed strip mine about three miles north of Shanksville.6 More details soon emerged about how, in the final moments, a group of determined passengers nearly regained control of the aircraft. The passengers apparently took matters into their own hands after learning about suicide attacks at the World Trade Center from phone calls with loved ones. As the story goes, the group was in the act of forcing its way into the cockpit when the terrorists crashed the plane nose-down. The tragic heroes included passengers Mark Bingham, Jeremy Glick, Tom Burnett, Lou Nacke and Todd Beamer, whose overheard battle cry “Let’s roll!” achieved something akin to national anthem status.7 So often and so persistently did the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:127:f28087c7f2e7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5036, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 128, "text": "into their own hands after learning about suicide attacks at the World Trade Center from phone calls with loved ones.

Almost three minutes separated the two reported crash times. How was this discrepancy to be explained? From shortly after sented as a case of either/or. It is assumed that only one of the times can be correct. Either United 93 crashed at 10:03 a.m., or at 10:06 a.m. For years I followed this script myself. However, my views on the matter matured in 2014 and I now suspect that the two different times represent two separate events. Indeed, I have come to believe that the crash time controversy probably holds the key to explaining what happened to United 93. Had the FBI focused its considerable resources on this one issue, the controversy over the crash time, there is little doubt that the FBI investigation would have taken a very different course; and because what happened at Shanksville was a microcosm of the whole, the dark truth about the fourth plane would have exposed the bigger lie. The stunning news that US government officials and members of the US military and intelligence community had been complicit in the attacks would have exploded across every TV screen in America, shocking the nation back to its senses, indeed, back to reality. Of course, it never happened. In subsequent days the FBI came under intense political pressure from above to wrap up its Shanksville investigation quickly. After NORAD officially disclaimed media reports of a shoot down, the FBI had a ready-made excuse and took the easy out. The FBI officially ended its investigation in Shanksville on September 25, 2001. Later, the 9/11 Commission, which was likewise blessed with a technically competent staff, could also have uncovered the facts had this been its objective. But, as commission co-chairs Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton later acknowledged in their 2007 book Without Precedent, “We were set up to fail.”10 In retrospect, it is clear that the 9/11 Commission was not created to uncover the truth about 9/11 but for the purpose of mind control, that is, to reaffirm a slightly revised version of the original cover story. This was the filter that all evidence and eyewitness testimony had to pass to qualify for inclusion in the 9/11 Commission Report. All other evidence was discarded, ignored, suppressed and/or ridiculed.

All other evidence was discarded, ignored, suppressed and/or ridiculed. The filter certainly was in effect in the case of the 10:06 a.m. seismic signal. Here was scientific data, forensic evidence, as “hard” as any evidence associated with 9/11. Yet, instead of taking it as an obvious starting point, the 9/11 Commission attempted to explain it away. Why? Well, probably because the seismic data was incompatible with the cover story. In a footnote the Commission stated that “The seismic data….are far too weak in signal to noise ratio and far too speculative in terms of signal source to be used as a means of contradicting the [10:03 a.m.] impact time established by the very accurate combination of FDR [Flight Data Recorder], CVR [Cockpit Voice Recorder], ATC [Air Traffic Control audiotapes], radar, and impact site data sets. These data sets constrain United 93’s impact time to within one second, are airplane and crash-site specific, and are based on time codes automatically recorded in the ATC audiotapes.”11 Notice that the Commission here adopts the logic of either/or, never entertaining the possibility that the two times, i.e., 10:03 a.m. and 10:06 a.m., might point to separate events. At the very least, the 9/11 Commission should have considered this possibility without prejudice. The fact it did not should make us skeptical. Although the above litany of technical expertise sounds impressive, it is less so under scrutiny. For example, the RADES radar data from 9/11, which was made public in 2007, does not prove that a crash occurred at 10:03 a.m.. It so happens that NORAD/FAA radar is blind below 6,000 feet in the vicinity of Shanksville because radar coverage is limited by the nearby Allegheny Mountains and by the distance from NORAD/FAA radar towers. Thus, radar cannot tell us what happened to United 93 after it disappeared from radar at 10:02:32 a.m.. It also appears that the Commission made a fundamental error when it dismissed the 10:06 a.m. seismic signal because of its weak signal strength. A study published in 2013 by four Scandinavian scientists showed the feasibility of utilizing seismic data to locate impact sites of plane crashes and to determine the exact time of such accidents, even though aircraft impacts generally produce weak seismic signals.12 A second paper published in 2003 by a Canadian geophysicist made similar points.13 According to these experts, weak signal strength is to be expected in plane crashes, and is not a valid reason to discount seismic data. A weak signal, in other words, does not equate to weak", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:129:23fefa3fed13", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5038, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 130, "text": "showed the feasibility of utilizing seismic data to locate impact sites of plane crashes and to determine the exact time of such accidents, even though aircraft impacts generally produce weak seismic signals.12 A second paper published in 2003 by a Canadian geophysicist made similar points.13 According to these experts, weak signal strength is to be expected in plane crashes, and is not a valid reason to discount seismic data. A weak signal, in other words, does not equate to weak evidence. According to David McCormack, author of the 2003 paper, a “detailed study of the seismic signals recorded from an impact can give insight into whether an aircraft was intact when hitting the ground and an estimate of the speed at which the plane struck the surface. The strength of seismic signals from an impact depends on the energy contained in the falling object. This in turn is a function of the mass and velocity at the time of impact, such that the heavier the object, or the faster it is traveling, the larger the resulting seismic signal. Adding up these factors can give clues about whether the craft exploded in air [or] rapidly descended intact to the surface.”14 McCormack’s highly relevant paper was available at the time of the official 9/11 investigation. The Commission staff could easily have found it by making a simple search. Yet, they failed to reference it in their report, and likewise failed to recruit professional seismologists to help with the investigation. Why? Well, probably because the input from experts in the field might have compelled them to abandon the official story, which they were unprepared to do. In a personal email, Miles Kara, the intelligence officer who prepared the radar analysis for the 9/11 Commission and no doubt also authored the summary paragraph cited above, insisted to me that the 10:06 a.m. seismic signal was an ‘outlier’, in other words, a fluke, a lone data point unsupported by other evidence. Kara dismissed it on this basis. He also claimed that other seismologists had refused to support Dr. Won-Young Kim of the Lamont-Doherty Observatory, principal author of the paper that reported the 10:06 a.m. signal.15 Kara’s insolent assertion that Kim stood alone, as unsupported as the 10:06 a.m. seismic signal itself, reflects the unfortunate politicization of science in the highly-charged aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and is sadly ironic, in retrospect, because it was actually the 9/11 Commission itself that stood alone, having failed to recruit the services of professionals in the field. Kara’s expertise in seismology, by his own admission, is limited to some undergraduate coursework.16 Southern Arizona Seismic Observatory, told the Philadelphia Daily News that “the seismic signals are consistent with an impact at 10:06:05, plus or minus two seconds [which was Dr. Kim’s conclusion]. I don’t know where the 10:03 time comes from.”17 When I contacted Wallace in 2010 at the Los", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:130:099d302d5f55", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5039, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 131, "text": "the 9/11 Commission itself that stood alone, having failed to recruit the services of professionals in the field.

I don’t know where the 10:03 time comes from.”17 When I contacted Wallace in 2010 at the Los Alamos National Lab where he currently serves as a director, he stood by the seismic data (and Dr. Kim), repeating what he had said in 2002. Wallace then added, “The original analysis was the best hypothesis on the data available at the time.”18 Moreover, there is reason to be suspicious of United 93’s recov-ered Flight Data Recorder (FDR). Although the commercial down at a velocity of ∼ 500 mph, surprisingly, the black box in the tail of the aircraft failed to register a sudden longitudinal deceleration at the moment of impact.19 This is in sharp contrast with American Airlines Flight 77, presumably the plane that crashed into the west wing of the Pentagon. The black box from the tail of AA77 was likewise recovered, and it registered the maximum deceleration value possible, exactly what one would expect of a high speed crash. In sum, the FDR-based evidence for a high-speed nose-down crash is less persuasive than we have been led to believe. The anomalies with the FDR and CVR raise the possibility that United 93 began to disintegrate before it hit the ground, perhaps due to one or more explosions. This might also explain the absence of a seismic signal at 10 : 03 a.m. ., though I hasten to add, it is also possible and perhaps even more likely that the signal strength of the crash was simply too weak to be detected. ed 93 was intact when it crashed.22 Another witness, however, Jim Stop, was fishing on Indian Lake that morning when he heard a plane in the sky above. Stop said he looked up and saw a trail of debris falling from the aircraft.23 Sure enough, paper debris and scraps of seating material were later recovered from the lake.24 Although these two, and a number of other local residents, reportthis day we do not have a clear composite picture of the crash based on the testimony of eyewitnesses, because even though the FBI issued a plea for witnesses to come forward, and even posted a contact phone number,25 there is no evidence that the FBI cross-checked the various accounts, even though this is standard in police work.

The place is a blue-collar town and quite picturesque, with a fine river running through it. The surrounding countryside is beautiful, at least where the land has not been ruined by strip mining. I was reminded of postcards of New England. The local residents were friendly and helpful and, when they learned that I am a writer, more than willing to talk about 9/11. I spoke with one eyewitness, Nevin Lambert, at the suggestion of another resident who gave me his address. I found Lambert at his farm on Skyline Road, about three-eighths of a mile from the crash site. The man had lived in the area all of his life – a quaint country road and a nearby borough, ‘Lambertsville,’ bear his family name. Lambert told me he was shoveling coal outside his home that morning when it happened. As I listened, his voice cracked and he visibly struggled with his emotions as he talked about the 44 people who had died. Over the years, Lambert had probably retold the story many times. Yet, the traumatic memory remained an open wound. Before my trip, I had seen his account on the Internet. But it is very different to hear such a story firsthand. Nothing had prepared me for the depth of feelings. Although Lambert told me the horrendous crash littered his farm with tiny pieces of debris,26 I realized later that my questions had been somewhat haphazard, reflective of my own disordered state of mind at the time. I came away without a clear answer to the most important question, what exactly had Lambert seen? More recently, when I attempted to contact Lambert again to follow up, I learned that his phone number had been disconnected. The man looked to be in poor health when I spoke with him in 2011, and I assume he has since passed away. Curious locals and first responders who flocked to the scene within minutes after an enormous explosion rocked the area were amazed to discover a crater roughly twenty feet across, and about six to eight feet deep, still smoking, but no visible sign of any aircraft. There was no fuselage, no wings, no tail, no engines, no landing gear, and no bodies anywhere near the crater, the presumed point of impact. State police Major Lyle Szupinka told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that the debris field stretched for several miles. “If you were to go down there,” he said, “you wouldn’t know that a plane crashed.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:132:fd186c86ba8e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5041, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 133, "text": "a crater roughly twenty feet across, and about six to eight feet deep, still smoking, but no visible sign of any aircraft.

You would look around and say, ‘I wonder what happened here?’…. The debris is very very small.” He estimated that the largest piece he observed was the size of a “briefcase.”29 Capt. Frank Monaco, another state cop, told the press that the crash site looked “like a trash heap. There’s nothing but tiny pieces of debris.”30 During my visit to Shanksville, I interviewed another local resident who was one of the first to reach the site. John Fleegle was working at the Indian Lake marina, that morning, when he heard an enormous explosion. Fleegle told me that he and his friend Tom Spinelli immediately jumped into a pickup truck and drove toward the smoke plume, which was about two miles to the northwest. Later, when I spoke with Spinelli on the phone, he verified this and added that during the drive tiny pieces of debris were falling all around, and some actually landed in the back of the truck.31 As the clean-up proceeded, teams scoured the countryside searching for the remains of United 93. Over one weekend 300 volunteers combed an area about a half mile square and recovered enough to fill about a third of a dumpster. A Stony Creek Township information packet about the recovery and clean up effort includes a grainy black & white photo of this partially-filled dumpster. Unfortunately the poor quality of the photo makes it unsuitable for inclusion here.32 Another separate debris field was discovered at least eight miles from the impact crater, at New Baltimore, near the Pennsylvania turnpike, where a child found a canceled payroll check and a brokerage statement. Authorities later confirmed that the paper debris originated from United 93. We know the plane was carrying several thousand pounds of US mail. A nine m.p.h. breeze apparently had lofted the light materials over a mountain ridge to New Baltimore.33 On September 24, 2001 FBI spokesman Bill Crowley announced that his investigation was complete and that 95% of the plane had been recovered, an obvious bit of official hyperbole. Crowley also mentioned that the largest piece of wreckage was a seven-foot-long shred of fuselage skin.35 The FBI later posted a photo of this piece of debris, but never indicated where they found it.36 Most pieces, however, were much smaller.

WC-PO-TV, an ABC-affiliated television station based in Cincinnati, Ohio, reported that “a Boeing 767 out of Boston” landed in Cleveland amidst concerns about a possible bomb on board. According to the report, “United [Airlines] identified the plane as UAL 93.”38 But this was incorrect information. United 93 was a Boeing 757, Questionable sources also led down rabbit holes. For example, the group Pilots for 9/11 Truth has posted an FAA document released in 2009 supposedly indicating that United 93 was still airborne after the official crash time at a location well south of Shanksville.40 The document is not a primary source, however. It is a compilation based on phone conversations between FAA traffic controllers in Cleveland FAA (who were tracking United 93 in “real time”) and officials at the FAA headquarters at Herndon, Virginia (near Dulles IAP).41 The calls may have been close to “real time,” but nonetheless reflect the inevitable time-lag associated with secondhand information. The FAA document is a secondary source with regard to United 93 and hence less reliable. One need only ask, was a plane crash documented south of Shanksville? The obvious answer is “no.”42 iven that United 93’s Flight Data Recorder (FDR) is suspect, Ghow can we be certain the flight ended near Shanksville? It is a very good question. Fortunately, we do not need to rely on United 93’s FDR. In October 2007, a Freedom of Information Act (FOI) request led to the release of the RADES (Radar Evaluation Squadron) 9/11 radar data. In addition, numerous air traffic control (ATC) audiotapes (and transcripts) from 9/11 also became available.43 These are primary sources, and they appear to be genuine. I have seen no indication that they have been altered or faked in any way. Multiple radar towers tracked United 93 continuously from the moment the plane departed Newark International Airport, and the radar track ends about three miles north of Shanksville. Also, the Cleveland ATC tapes were made freely available on the Internet. Anyone may review the record and follow the air traffic controllers in “real time” as they grappled with an unprecedented midair disaster.

Anyone may review the record and follow the air traffic controllers in “real time” as they grappled with an unprecedented midair disaster. The radar data and the ATC tapes are mutually corroborative. Taken together, they show conclusively that United 93 went down north of Shanksville. There were also reports about a terrorist bomb. Cleveland ATCs heard two transmissions that morning about a bomb aboard what they presumed was United 93.44 Several passengers also mentioned a bomb in phone calls to family, loved ones, and operators.45 The last of these calls was from a computer engineer, Ed Felt, who said he was in a lavatory on the plane. A 911 dispatcher in Westmoreland County named Glenn Cramer took the call and spoke with Felt for about a minute. Cramer described the caller as “very distraught.” Felt told him the plane had been hijacked. He also said there had been an explosion and that he thought the plane was going down. The call ended abruptly at 9:58 a.m..46 The FBI ultimately rejected the idea that a terrorist bomb brought down United 93. The 9/11 Commission agreed and wrote in its final report: “One of the passengers who mentioned a bomb expressed his belief that it was not real. Lacking any evidence that the hijackers attempted to smuggle such illegal items past the security screening checkpoints, we believe the bombs were probably fake.”47 Minutes after departing Andrews Air Force Base near Washington DC at 9 : 32a.m . on the morning of 9/11, Lt. Col. Steven O’Brien was piloting his C-130H transport west over the Potomac River when he was instructed by the nearby Reagan Airport tower to tail and describe an incoming rogue aircraft, presumably American Airlines Flight 77 then making its fatal approach to the Pentagon. O’Brien witnessed the explosive crash-impact before flying over the Pentagon himself. After he described the scene of destruction to the ATCs, he was released to resume his own scheduled flight to his Air National Guard base in Minnesota. O’Brien’s flight path over southern Pennsylvania coincidentally made him a witness to another aerial disaster that was unfolding near Shanksville. United 93, an apparent hijack, had flown west into Ohio before reversing direction at 9:40 a.m. About a minute later, the plane’s transponder stopped transmitting. The Air Traffic Controllers who had been busy diverting other aircraft out of its path no longer had any information about the rogue plane’s altitude or flight speed. They were reduced to tracking a blip on a radar screen.

The Air Traffic Controllers who had been busy diverting other aircraft out of its path no longer had any information about the rogue plane’s altitude or flight speed. They were reduced to tracking a blip on a radar screen. A few minutes after the errant airliner flew over Pittsburgh on a generally southeast heading, a Cleveland ATC contacted O’Brien to vector his C-130H out of harm’s way. O’Brien complied with a 90-degree jog to the northeast at 10:03:43 a.m., while maintaining his altitude of 20,000 feet. At 10:06:54 a.m. the ATC vectored him again. O’Brien responded with a second 90-degree turn, this time to the northwest, which put him back on course to Minnesota. O’Brien’s witness to the Pentagon strike and his proximity to what happened at Shanksville has produced deep skepticism, even suspicion, about the possible role that his C-130H may have played in the 9/11 attacks. This is understandable given the circumstances. However, O’Brien’s account of what he saw at Shanksville was recorded in “real time” by an air traffic control tape, and this testimony, as I am about to show, far from supporting the official story, calls it into question. For this reason I believe his presence was not only a genuine coincidence, but fortuitous. The radio conversation between O’Brien (GOF06 or gopher 06 in the transcript of the ATC tape) and George Keaton, the Cleveland ATC (IRL-R in the transcript) during the first leg of the C-130’s zigzag detour around Shanksville includes an important detail that never made it into the 9/11 Commission Report. 10:05:45 GOF06 well it looks like its suspended in the air sir ah it looks like its at the same level as the scattered clouds i guess it to be about ah three to five thousand feet in the air i can’t tell if its coming up off the plume right now but there is a ah round cloud of black smoke at our nine oclock Notice, pilot O’Brien cannot tell if the cloud of black smoke he is seeing is rising from the ground or if it originated at altitude. His testimony is consistent with either a crash or a mid-air explosion below 5,000 feet. From the transcript we cannot tell which. Also, thanks to the ATC audiotape timer we need not rely on United 93’s Flight Data Recorder (FDR) to know that whatever happened to United 93 happened before O’Brien reported black smoke at 10:05:15 a.m. This rules out the possibility that United 93 crashed at 10:06 a.m., and indicates that the seismic signal must have been caused by a separate event.

The question arises: What then, happened at 10:06 a.m.? est. At the time of the 9/11 attacks, she lived just down the road from the official crash site and had an encounter, that morning, with a small white aerial vehicle. McElwain says it buzzed her minivan as she slowed to a stop at a neighborhood intersection. It was so low, no more than 40-50 feet above the ground, that she says she instinctively ducked her head. McElwain watched it bank and disappear behind some trees in the general direction of the crash site. Moments later, she heard an enormous explosion.50 At the time, she had not learned about events in New York and Washington. Later that day, McElwain contacted the FBI and told them about her experience. That evening, two FBI agents showed up at her house and conducted a brief interview. But the agents showed little interest in her story and even tried to talk her out of it. By that point, the official narrative was already being touted in the news media. Over the years, McElwain stuck by her story, insisting that she got a good look at the aerial craft.51 She described it as small and “pure white, with no markings.” She saw no cockpit, no wings, and no rivets, and when asked to describe it, she used terms like “molded,” and “all one piece.” She said it had fins, including what she described as “a spoiler” at the rear, evidently some kind of a tail stabilizer. In March 2011, when I visited Shanksville I had no difficulty locating the rural intersection where McElwain says the incident occurred. I recognized the junction of Buckstown Road and Bridge Street from McElwain’s video interviews on the Internet. The spot is about two miles north of Shanksville and within a mile of the official crash site. I found McElwain’s story credible, and while in Shanksville I looked her up. Initially, I suspected that she had encountered some type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drone.52 However, I now think I was mistaken about this. Recently, I was persuaded by an Internet video that McElwain probably had an encounter with a missile in flight. The video is explicit. It claims she saw an AGM-158 Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).53 This cannot be correct, however, because the AGM-158 has wings that deploy after launch, and McElwain is certain she saw no wings.

Nevertheless, when I reviewed my correspondence with her I realized that her observations are consistent with some type of missile.54 At my request, McElwain has studied photos of various kinds of missiles but, thus far, none of them resemble the object that buzzed her van on the morning of 9/11. Susan McElwain’s account would be easy to dismiss if it stood alone. But it does not stand alone. Several local residents reportedly heard the distinctive sound of a missile. According to the Boston Globe, one resident, “Joe Wilt, 63, said he heard a whistling like a missile, then a loud boom as he stood in the doorway of his Shanksville home across the road from the alleged crash site. Although his view was blocked by trees, he said he saw a fireball rise 800 feet into the air, then give way to black smoke.”55 Barry Lighty, mayor of the nearby community of Indian Lake, also reported hearing a missile. He said it flew over his house.56 Chris Smith, a groundskeeper at the Indian Lake golf course, also heard a “very loud screeching sound” as something passed over. Moments later, he heard a huge explosion.57 And Ernie Stull, Mayor of Shanksville, told the Philadelphia Daily News that he personally knew of two local residents who claimed they heard a missile.58 A missile impact and explosion might account for the otherwise unexplained seismic signal at 10:06 a.m. Many skeptics of the official story have understandably interdown United 93 with a heat-seeking air-to-air missile; and there is no question that a number of eyewitnesses in and around Shanksville reported seeing a low flying military aircraft, that morning. The official explanation is that these sightings were a case of mistaken identity, because a Falcon commuter jet is known to have been in the area. The Falcon pilot was making an approach to Johnstown Airport when he was diverted by air traffic controllers and asked to reconnoiter. He obligingly flew to the United 93 crash site and circled it several times. The official story is that the local witnesses mistook this commuter jet for a fighter; and this probably does explain some of the sightings. However, it cannot account for all of them, for instance, the sighting at Shanksville high school by three students who reportedly saw a fighter plane fly over just as a mushroom cloud was rising from the crash site.59 The unexplained sighting at the high school and the other evidence for a missile suggests that a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:138:ff83f66caf76", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5047, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 139, "text": "times.

However, it cannot account for all of them, for instance, the sighting at Shanksville high school by three students who reportedly saw a fighter plane fly over just as a mushroom cloud was rising from the crash site.59 The unexplained sighting at the high school and the other evidence for a missile suggests that a fighter plane may have been in the area. If so, it had to be an unauthorized aircraft, because NORAD fighters are equipped with military transponders and doubtless would have shown up on radar at some point in their flight. Yet, a summary of the 9/11 radar data from NORAD’s Northeastern Air Defense Sector (NEADS) shows that no NORAD fighters were anywhere near Shanksville during the relevant time frame.60 The only NORAD aircraft in the vicinity was Steven O’Brien’s C-130H Compilation of 9/11 radar data showing the flight paths of all NORAD aircraft in the Northeastern Air Defense Sector (NEADS) on September 11, 2001, between 9:45 - 10:15 a.m. The data confirms that the only NORAD plane in the vicinity of UAL93 at the time of the crash was a C-130H transport (call sign: GOPHER06) piloted by Lt. Col. Steve O’Brien, who was en route to his Air National Guard base in Minnesota. During my trip to Shanksville I visited the local high and elmiles from the alleged crash site. When I explained to the high school principal that I was investigating the crash of United 93, he gave me permission to conduct interviews at the school, and for the next hour I roamed the corridors. I spoke with high school teachers and with teachers at the nearby grade school, several of whom told me that they felt a powerful shock wave pass through the building, that morning. They assumed the cause was the crash of United 93. The teachers compared it to a small earthquake. However, when I discussed this with the French geophysicist André Rousseau, he told me that such a shock wave is indicative of an explosive event, not a plane crash.61 Even before reading an early draft of this paper, Rousseau had concluded on his own that a missile probably caused the 10:06 a.m. seismic signal. Incidentally, Dr. Won-Young Kim confirmed to me that in principle explosions of dynamite and military ordnance can be distinguished from plane crashes and from earthquakes.62 Kim agreed that plane crashes generate weak signals that travel only a short distance, which may explain why there was no seismic signal at 10 : 03 a.m ., and no record of the Pentagon impact. In both cases, the nearest seismic stations were too far away to detect a weak signal.

DiscussionThe possibility that a missile was deployed north of Shanksville we think we know about the September 11, 2001 attacks. If a covert fighter and missile were deployed it means that someone, apart from the hijackers, made a decision to destroy United 93. But how do all of the pieces fit together? Let us now try and imagine a scenario that accounts for all of the known facts. Here, it is important to distinguish between the terrorist hijackers, whom I believe were indeed aboard United 93, and the intelligence spooks who, together with various officials of the G.W. Bush administration and select US military officers, orchestrated the “attacks” for their own nefarious ends. Crucially, the 9/11 operation did not come off without a hitch. Something obviously went awry at World Trade Center 7, and also, quite likely, in the case of United 93. The radio transmissions and phone calls about a bomb aboard the plane may indeed have been genuine. It does appear that one or more explosions rocked United 93 while in flight, and may ultimately have caused it to crash. Eyewitness testimony supports this view. Several local residents reported hearing “two loud bangs” or “two booms” before a final explosion.63 But why fire a missile if there were bombs aboard the plane? I suspect the answer is that the perpetrators and hijackers were not on the same page, at least not fully. The intelligence spooks monitoring the operation in real time probably knew that bombs had somehow been smuggled aboard the aircraft, but there was no certainty that in the moment of truth the hijackers would actually detonate them, crashing the plane and killing themselves in the process. And because the aircraft and all aboard had to be destroyed, nothing could be left to chance. Assuming this context, it is logical that someone might have made a decision to fire a missile; which apparently arrived", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:140:0262efe6a443", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5049, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 141, "text": "monitoring the operation in real time probably knew that bombs had somehow been smuggled aboard the aircraft, but there was no certainty that in the moment of truth the hijackers would actually detonate them, crashing the plane and killing themselves in the process. And because the aircraft and all aboard had to be destroyed, nothing could be left to chance. Assuming this context, it is logical that someone might have made a decision to fire a missile; which apparently arrived too late. The missile exploded on impact at the crash site, further dispersing the wreckage of United 93. This suggests a logical explanation for another 9/11 mystery. In her report, filed on September 16, 2001, Air Traffic Controller Stacey Taylor describes how she struggled, that morning, to cope with an unprecedented air emergency.64 Taylor was working the Indianhead sector at the Oberlin Air Traffic Center (Ohio), and she men- Near the end, for some reason that has never been explained, United 93’s transponder came back on, and it continued transmitting until the aircraft dropped below radar.65 Assuming there was a contingency plan to deploy a missile, a likely answer is quite simple. The perpetrators needed United 93’s altitude and flight speed to move the fighter into position. Once again, I must remind the reader: this is speculation. Whoever made the decision to obtain this “real time” information by turning United 93’s transponder back on, probably via remote access, was running a serious risk of exposure, and this suggests a degree of urgency, even desperation. I would add, however, that another 9/11 researcher, Rowland Morgan, author of a 2006 book about United 93, takes a different view of it. Morgan disputes the contingency plan hypothesis and believes that the only improvising occurred after the crash.66 Morgan thinks the plan from the beginning was to take down United 93, pretty much as it happened. Either way, we are very fortunate that Lt. Col. O’Brien was approaching Shanksville that morning in his C-130H at the critical moment, and that by chance he just happened to look out his cockpit window and report smoke when he did.67 We are also fortunate that a local resident, Susan McElwain, just happened to be out driving in her car and encountered a missile in flight when she did, at a place where no missile had any legitimate reason to be. Without these two lucky data-points, this paper would not have been possible. The most likely scenario of events at Shanksville, and the dark truth about the last moments of United 93, would have remained out of reach. versity of St. Thomas posted a story about an alum, Lt.

On September 4, 2002, the contractor filed a “final closure report” with the PDEP, a copy of which is on file at the PDEP’s Pittsburgh office.

Plane crash or explosions can also be observed on infrasound signals they generate - sound waves that are longer period [= lower frequency) than audible range (less than 20Hz ) that can travel longer distance from the source than audible high frequency band. Some seismic stations nowadays are equipped with infrasound sensors as well. It is of interest that when the 9/11 Commission interviewed C-130H pilot Lt. Col. Steven O’Brien in 2004 during its official investigation, O’Brien testified that during his fly-by of Shanksville, that morning, he saw smoke rising from the ground. This is hardly surprising. From a distance of at least seventeen miles, and from an altitude of 20,000 feet, it is unlikely that O’Brien would have noticed a surface explosion at 10:06 a.m. However, as he continued his detour around Shanksville he would almost certainly have observed the subsequent smoke plume rising from the official crash site, and quite naturally would have concluded that he was seeing the plume from the crashed airliner that he previously missed. He would have conflated two events into one. The transcript of the March 4, 2004 interview is posted at http://www.oredigger61.org/?p=6314 Given that the 9/11 attacks involved an extremely complex set of operations, the success of which depended on precision clockwork, it is hardly surprising that problems would arise. The facts surrounding United Flight 93 point to a botched operation, as does the belated collapse of WTC-7, which was not hit by an aircraft. With regard to WTC-7, I tend to agree with those who think the original plan was to drop the building immediately after the collapse of the North Tower, when the immense dust cloud would have provided concealment, obscuring a classic demolition. It appears that something went wrong, however, compelling a decision to drop WTC-7 in plain sight at 5 : 20 p.m . on the day of the attacks. The perpetrators only got away with it by exercising near total control over the mainstream media, which has kept the shocking footage of WTC-7’s collapse out of the public eye. Although United 93’s intended target remains unknown, it appears that something went wrong in this case, as well, something that compelled the men behind the curtain (probably elements of the US intelligence community) to resort to a back-up contingency plan, call it “Plan B,” some of the likely elements of which I have already presented.

Evidently, the perpetrators felt it necessary to take extraordinary measures involving serious risks to themselves. The fate of United 93 therefor holds one of the keys to exposing the overall plot. United 93 was a late departure from Newark International Airport on the morning of September 11, 2001. The flight was scheduled to leave at 8 a.m. but was delayed on the runway for approximately 42 minutes. Some skeptics reject this “late factor” as too obvious to account for United 93’s failure to reach its target. Surely, they argue, the plotters would have been well aware that flights out of Newark are subject to frequent delays. Some even think the delayed take-off was a part of the plan. But I seriously doubt this. United 93 departed Newark just minutes before American Airlines Flight 11 impacted the North Tower. If the flight had been delayed much longer, United 93 would have been grounded before it could leave. This tells us (or should) that delay was not part of the planning. It is hard to escape the conclusion that Newark was simply a poor choice in an attack plan where everything depended on timing. So, why, Newark? Some will not like my answer, but in my opinion the circumstances of United 93 suggest that the masterminds did not exercise total control over every planning decision. The selection of Newark indicates that Mohamed Atta & company were actively involved in planning various details of the operation. Even if they were being used as patsies in someone’s larger plan, it would nevertheless be essential for the terrorists to believe that they were in control. Did Mohamed Atta simply make a poor choice by selecting Newark? This is my view, though I would not be surprised if the masterminds anticipated trouble and organized Plan B from the moment that Atta selected a flight out of Newark. We cannot know why United 93 failed to reach its target. But among the list of likely causes must be included a possible glitch in the perpetrators’ remote control of the aircraft. If this is how it happened, it illustrates just how ill-prepared the terrorist pilots were to fly the planes, left to their own devices.

But there is more to the story. Since that day, we have also been awash in disinformation due to the subsequent failed official investigations that cherry-picked facts and testimony in support of the official cover story. The powers-that-be have aggressively promoted propaganda in place of history. They would have us view 9/11 through the dubious lens of their own narrow political agenda. Winnowing out the facts from the false accounts therefor presents a challenge. As we saw in the previous chapter, the radar data from 9/11 has already proved its usefulness, and there are other examples. Recently, Farmer showed that the radar data for American Airlines Flight 77 (AA77) supports the testimony of former Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta before the 9/11 Commission in 2004. Curious readers are encouraged to check out Farmer’s post, on line.1 One can find numerous stories on the Internet that one of the F-15s scrambled from Langley Air Force Base brought down United 93 with a sidewinder missile.2 According to another report, it was an F-16 from Andrews AFB.3 These reports have circulated widely and some are quite detailed. One source actually names the fighter pilot who supposedly pulled the trigger on United 93.4 Another unnamed individual claims to be the E-3 Sentry pilot who administered the shoot down order.5 The 9/11 radar data plainly shows, however, that all of these reports are false. Consider the following diagram, based on the 9/11 radar data, showing the flight path of the three Langley fighters scrambled on September 11, 2001. As indicated, the F-15s from Langley AFB were airborne by roughly 9 : 30a.m . but failed to reach Washington until 10a.m . The pilots were delayed after being sent on three consecutive wild goose chases, a fact so embarrassing to the US military that for years the Pentagon covered up the actual flight path of the Langley fighters. The 9/11 Commission mentioned the first and second wild goose chases in its final report,6 published in 2004, but perpetuated the cover-up regarding the third. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the cat was out of the bag and an official acknowledgment of some kind was inevitable. Not long thereafter, the US military disclosed the rest of the story to author Lynne Spencer, who was the first to document the Langley fighters’ wildly erratic third leg south of Washington in her 2008 book Touching History. 7 You will notice that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:148:647ddc707325", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5057, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 149, "text": "goose chases in its final report,6 published in 2004, but perpetuated the cover-up regarding the third.

Not long thereafter, the US military disclosed the rest of the story to author Lynne Spencer, who was the first to document the Langley fighters’ wildly erratic third leg south of Washington in her 2008 book Touching History. 7 You will notice that the F-15s from Langley reached Washington just three minutes before United 93‘s official crash time (10:03 a.m.), whereupon, the pilots established a defensive cap over the capital. They did not cover the more than 120 miles to Shanksville in three minutes. (Nor could they have done so had they tried.) Fortunately, the radar data renders the issue moot. Although one of the Langley pilots flew up the Potomac River as far as Great Falls, he never got close to Pennsylvania. End of story. According to another Internet report, “one of the four Langley pilots” returned to base on 9/11 minus his full complement of Sidewinders. On this basis, we are evidently supposed to conclude that the pilot used one to shoot down United 93.8 But this report is also wrong, and again Spencer set it straight. In the first place, only two F-15 pilots were on alert at Langley AFB on the morning of September 11, not four. At the last minute, a third F-15 pilot, Capt. Craig Borgstrom, was ordered to join the scramble. His third aircraft (call sign = Quit27) ) was not fully armed: Borgstrom returned to base without missiles for the simple reason that he had none when he took off.9 This is self-evident from the data, but I will briefly recap the story. On the morning of 9/11, three F-16s departed Andrews at 8:35 a.m. on a training mission to North Carolina. The fighters were not armed with Sidewinders. Shortly after Andrews AFB went on alert (sometime between 9:30-9:35 a.m.), the three pilots were recalled to base. The first of the F-16s returned to Andrews at 10:14 a.m., which was already well after United 93 dropped below radar north of Shanksville. The Andrews pilots were low on fuel by this time, but one of them, Major Billy Hutchison, evidently still had enough for a short flight over Washington. Hutchison took off again and was the first F-16 pilot scrambled from Andrews AFB on 9/11 in defense of the nation’s capital.11 By then of course, as noted, the fighters from Langley had already established a defensive cap over the city. Perhaps you are wondering, OK, but what about a NORAD fighter from some other base? To check this out, I asked John Farmer to consult the radar data for Shanksville.

When he did he determined that no NORAD fighters were anywhere near United 93 at the time of the crash.13 No fighters were on patrol over southwestern Pennsylvania during the relevant time frame. [See the composite diagram in the previous chapter showing the flight paths of all NORAD aircraft on 9/11 during the relevant time frame.] Thus, the assertion on the Internet by a self-proclaimed E-3 Sentry AWACS crew member that he gave the order for NORAD fighters to shoot down UAL 93 cannot be correct. The testimony, by the way, is anonymous, which ought to make us skeptical.14 The account is also dubious for other reasons. The individual states that his E-3 was based at Andrews AFB; which cannot be correct since the home base for all US Air Force E-3s is not Andrews but Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City. The individual, moreover, asserts that after 8 a.m. his pilot received an order “to loiter between Washington and Pittsburgh.” But, again, the 9/11 radar data shows that no E-3 was in the vicinity during the relevant timeframe. We must conclude that the testimonial is mistaken and may even be a deliberate attempt to muddy the waters. There were two E-3 AWACS planes on patrol that morning, but not over Pennsylvania. After a thorough search of the radar data, John Farmer located one E-3 northwest of Memphis, Tennessee. Another was in an orbit off the Virginia coast. However, this E-3 did not enter the NEADS radar coverage until 11:36 a.m. (flying west to east), and began orbiting off the Virginia coast at 12:37 p.m.15 Thus, it can have played no role in the fate of United 93. A second Internet account is a bit more credible. In 2002 The Aquin, the student newspaper of the University of St. Thomas (located in St. Paul, Minnesota) posted a story about one of its graduates, Lt. Anthony Kuczynski, who, it asserts, piloted an E-3 on 9/11. The article later disappeared from cyberspace, though a portion was archived.16 According to the story, on the morning of 9/11 Lt. Kuczynski received an order to shoot down United Flight 93; however, the associated fighters were unable to carry out the order before United 93 allegedly crashed at Shanksville. This account is sketchy, although Farmer concluded that it might have some basis in fact. Farmer speculated that Kuczynski’s E-3 might have been the one orbiting off the Virginia coast.

The radar data indicates that a lone NORAD aircraft was in the vicinity of Shanksville during the relevant time period. As I have already noted, this was the same C-130H transport (call sign = Gopher 06) piloted by Lt. Col. Steve O’Brien which earlier had tailed the aircraft (presumably AA 77) that struck the Pentagon.18 Although I agree that this bizarre coincidence is suspicious, as already indicated, I am convinced that O’Brien’s presence was not only innocent, but fortuitous. If a military plane fired a missile in the vicinity of Shanksville, that morning, it had to be an unauthorized aircraft that had its military transponder turned “off.” General Myers’ MalfeasanceThere is another serious ramification, one scarcely mentioned man of the Joint Chiefs Richard Myers exhibited a shocking level of ignorant bravura two days after the attacks, when he told the Senate Armed Services Committee, “We had launched on the one that eventually crashed in Pennsylvania. I mean, we had gotten somebody close to it.”19 Moments later, Myers backpedaled, admitting to the senators that he was clueless about the total breakdown of US air defenses. One would think that the acting commander of all US military forces would have arrived at his own Senate confirmation hearing fully briefed about the force structure under his command, and ready to explain how and why it had failed to perform on 9/11. But no such thing happened. The gross ignorance Myers displayed is so shocking that I believe we must view it as suspicious. Instead of ratifying his promotion to Chairman, the Senate committee should have urged the president to relieve Myers of his command, effective immediately, and replace him with someone who could answer the obvious questions. When staffers at Popular Mechanics magazine later did some checking, however, they discovered that Gibney was in Bozeman, Montana on the morning of September 11, 2001, and so could not possibly have flown one of the Langley fighters.

He sent it to me with the following note: Mark: The image below is the history of the Andrews fighters. Three took off from Andrews AFB at around 12:35 (GMT) and headed south. I think some of the confusion may be coming from tracking them by M3 codes which can change as they are handed off from one ARTCC to the next. The M2 codes (military) for these three aircraft are: 6413,1212 and 6402. What is interesting to me is that at 12:50 they drop to below 2,000 feet and off radar until just after 13:00 (approximately 10 minutes). They then enter the North Carolina bombing range area and remain there until around 13:37. At that time, one (M2 = 1212 ) heads in a direct line back towards Andrews AFB, landing there at approximately 14:13. That fighter takes off again from Andrews AFB at 14:41 and takes up a holding pattern over DC. The remaining two fighters head back at approximately 14:12 from the NC area, with M2 = 6402 landing at Andrews AFB at approximately 14:30 followed by M2 = 6413 at 14:45. I’ve attached an Excel file that has the raw data for the Andrews Fighters and an extra tab for all M2 bit traffic in the DC and Langley area from 12:15 until 14:40. All military aircraft may or may not have an M2 code (like the infamous C-130), but they all have the M2 bit. Let me know if I can assist further. John.

It is indeed intriguing that the very first explicit reference to United Flight 93 by the US media on September 11 actually touched on one of these mysteries. As the attacks were unfolding, CBS News mistakenly announced that United 93 had crashed near Camp David, Maryland, which is located about 90 miles east of Shanksville.1 An FBI official in Washington told CBS he had received this information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

CBS also cited un-named “FBI and terrorism experts” who pointed out the historic and symbolic significance of the date and the presumed target, noting that Camp David is the presidential retreat where, on September 11, 1978, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat signed the historic Camp David Peace Accords, ending decades of on-and-off warfare between the two states. As it happens, the un-named experts were wrong about the facts on all counts, including the date. The Camp David Accords were actually signed on September 17, 1978. Nor is there any basis for the implicit suggestion that jihadists targeted Camp David out of disdain for the historic peace treaty. No evidence has ever surfaced that Camp David was a target on 9/11. It is noteworthy that during its ongoing coverage CBS reported, almost simultaneously, that “a large plane crashed in western Pennsylvania, at Somerset,” not far from Shanksville, which is in Somerset County. The ambiguous coverage reflected the fog of war, as Americans, including journalists, attempted to piece together what was happening in “real time.” A story by CNN posted very late on the evening of 9/11 also mentioned a crash at Camp David, adding a new wrinkle: “Intelligence sources told CNN there were indications of attempts to divert the United Flight from Newark [i.e., United 93] to crash at Camp David, Maryland, the presidential retreat. It is unclear how that plan may have been thwarted.”2 Bush administration officials were also on record. During a midair press briefing on his flight back to Washington from Peru, Secretary of State Colin Powell told journalists, “One [plane] crashed near Camp David and the other crashed out in western Pennsylvania.”4 Powell’s wording resembled the ambiguous real-time reporting by CBS, and this suggests that Powell may have been watching the CBS coverage of 9/11 while en route and simply repeated what he heard from a source presumed to be reliable. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer also mentioned a Camp David crash, while participating in a 9/11 commemoration event on September 11, 2006. Fleischer had been with President Bush in Sarasota, Florida on the morning of 9/11. At the commemoration, responding to a question from CNN anchor Soledad O’Brien, he reminisced about his experience: “We heard about the Pentagon on the way to Air Force One in the motorcade. We boarded Air Force One and went straight into the president’s cabinet to start taking notes. That’s when we heard about the fourth plane.

That was the first report the president got.”5 Although the reported Camp David crash soon disappeared down a memory hole, there is reason to wonder if something did happen that morning in the vicinity of Catoctin Mountain Park, where Camp David is located. In addition to the press reports and official statements already cited, the Northwestern Chronicle, a campus newspaper associated with Northwestern University, posted a curious news update on September 11 about Camp David. The update was brief, and reads as follows: “Air Force officials say an airliner has been forced down by F-16 fighter jets near Camp David.”6 I use the term “curious” to describe this factoid, because when radar expert John Farmer checked the 9/11 radar data in his computer at my request, he found that no airliners or military aircraft were anywhere near Camp David during the relevant timeframe.7 The radar coverage in the area is excellent, ruling out any possibility that an incident occurred below radar. A glance at the link shows that the reporter at Northwestern Chronicle posted his news blurb at 10 : 50 a.m . on September 11, 2001. The time is of interest because this tallies with another source. A dossier of Secret Service files from 9/11 made public in 2010 includes a timeline document stating that a “plane crashed at Camp David” at 10 : 38a.m .8 As should be apparent, the timeline in this government source is quite compatible with the report in the Northwestern Chronicle because a crash occurring at 10 : 38 a.m . might plausibly be reported at 10:50 a.m. Based on these additional sources, one may well wonder, did something occur at Camp David on 9/11? On September 12, 2001 the Baltimore Daily Record printed a “correction” under the headline “Camp David crash rumor proves false.” According to the paper, “Early reports that an airliner had crashed on or near Camp David, the presidential retreat in Western Maryland’s Catoctin Mountains, proved unfounded.” The Daily Record cited J. Mel Poole, the Catoctin Park superintendent, who flatly denied that there had been any crash. Yet the article also contained other information which to my knowledge was not reported anywhere else and which challenges the apparently blanket denial in the Record. The article quoted a restaurant manager in Thurmont, Maryland, who “heard that a plane went down … in the Catoctin Mountain Park,” which is about three miles", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:154:d2c5e958a906", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5063, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 155, "text": "in Western Maryland’s Catoctin Mountains, proved unfounded.” The Daily Record cited J.

The article quoted a restaurant manager in Thurmont, Maryland, who “heard that a plane went down … in the Catoctin Mountain Park,” which is about three miles east of Thurmont. This would place the crash at, or very close to, Camp David. The same source told the paper that first responders were on the scene: “Lots of fire trucks were on the road,” she said on September 11, “and no one can get up there.” Park superintendent Poole, however, was insistent: “All the [fire] trucks here in the park are still in station.”9 With the passage of time, this story was all but forgotten. Few noticed that The 9/11 Commission Report, released in 2004, introduced new evidence that supports the Thurmont restaurant manager’s account. On page 31, the report cites an exchange between someone at NORAD’s Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) headquarters in Rome, New York and an FAA official who also mentions a crash at Camp David: NEADS: I also want to give you a heads-up, Washington. FAA (DC): Go ahead. NEADS: United nine three, have you got information on that yet? FAA: Yeah, he’s down. NEADS: He’s down? FAA: Yes. NEADS: When did he land? ‘Cause we have got confirmation-FAA: He did not land. NEADS: Oh, he’s down? Down? FAA: Yes. Somewhere up northeast of Camp David [my emphasis]. NEADS: Northeast of Camp David. FAA: That’s the last report. They don’t know exactly where.10 The phrase “somewhere northeast of Camp David” is telling, because this is the wrong direction. Shanksville is located about 90 miles west and slightly north of Camp David, not to the northeast. It would appear that whoever included this excerpt in the Commission’s report was ignorant about the geography and also unaware of the early reports about a Camp David crash. We can be thankful for this. Had the individual known what we know today, the passage would likely have been excluded from the report. And why? Well, because it’s provocative, plainly at odds with the official cover story. “Somewhere up northeast of Camp David” lines up perfectly with the location mentioned in the denial published in the Baltimore Daily Record. I first learned about an “incident at Camp David” from Ken Jenkins, a well-known 9/11 activist (and video producer) who heard about it from a close friend who lived in Maryland at the time of the attacks. The friend was acquainted with a man who said he witnessed a midair explosion, that morning, near Camp David.

The friend was acquainted with a man who said he witnessed a midair explosion, that morning, near Camp David. As the story goes, the man was working on his roof with several helpers when they saw a plane explode high above. Although I succeeded in contacting this witness, he declined to be interviewed. To sum up, we are left with multiple reports of an air disaster, because, as noted, no aircraft, military or otherwise, showed up on radar anywhere near Camp David during the relevant time period. This absence of hard evidence would have persuaded me to dismiss the reports out of hand, where it not for my new analysis of United 93 indicating that a missile may have been deployed at Shanksville. If true, this means an unauthorized fighter must also have been in the vicinity, which raises a tantalizing question. Were the events at Shanksville and the early reports of a crash at Camp David related somehow? If the reports of an incident at Camp David do have a basis in fact, we can rule out the crash of a commercial airliner, which would have shown up on radar and would also have been impossible to hush up because of the large number of fatalities. In this, the correction issued by the Baltimore Daily Record that no airliner went down near Camp David may have been technically accurate. But did the incident involve a smaller plane, a fighter, say? The chronology of both events lines up rather well. As we know, the destruction of United 93 near Shanksville occurred prior to 10 : 05a.m. ., the presumed incident at Camp David shortly thereafter. Allow me to speculate. Assuming an unauthorized aircraft equipped with stealth technology had been deployed in an covert operation to destroy United 93, the disposition of this same covert fighter, once its mission had been completed, might have have presented the masterminds with a thorny problem. The operation itself had already threatened the homegrown perpetrators with exposure, and the risks would have increased with every passing minute. A return to base might have been deemed too risky. What then to do with the covert fighter? Given the existential threat of exposure, did a ground controller make a decision to terminate the mission (and the pilot) with pre-placed explosives? To be sure, such a decision would have necessitated a cover-up at the site of the downed fighter. But perhaps the risks associated with that were viewed as much less of a problem than returning the fighter to base. I hasten to add, all of this is conjecture.

Nonetheless, if the evidence and reasoning I have presented are valid, it is likely there are potential witnesses, even today, people who have crucial information about the incident. They could be Maryland firemen or other local emergency responders who were warned to silence on 9/11 for “reasons having to do with national security,” the same old canard that has served, time and again, to undermine the US Constitution. If there are such witnesses, they are probably unaware just how important their testimony might be to the restoration of our democracy. Let us hope these individuals are motivated to come forward, and soon. The confirmed crash/explosion of a covert aircraft on 9/11 might presage the unraveling of the plot against America, and lead to the exposure and, let us hope, the swift prosecution of the guilty. In which case, justice delayed will not be justice denied. Endnotes 1 The CBS footage may be viewed at Youtube, as a part of a skeptical analysis.

Information about the 10 : 38 a.m . crash can be found on page 13. he possible deployment of a missile at Shanksville raises T questions about the 9/11 attacks that few have thought to ask, until now. For example, what was the status of US surveillance aircraft on September 11, 2001? Were AWACS planes on patrol over the northeastern United States? And what about the capability of US surveillance satellites? That the latter question should arise now is curious indeed, because on the morning of September 11, 2001, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the hybrid agency of the US intelligence community that operates satellites for the NSA, CIA and Pentagon, was involved in a training exercise. The NRO drill, one of many scheduled that day, had been in the works for several months. It was to start at 9 a.m. which, as it happened, was just fourteen minutes after American Airlines 11 struck World Trade Center One, and just three minutes before United Flight 175 impacted World Trade Center Two.1 The drill was to involve the simulated crash of a corporate Learjet into a wing of the NRO headquarters at Chantilly, Virginia. The NRO headquarters is located about four miles from Dulles International Airport, where American Airlines Flight 77 departed at 8:20 a.m. that morning on its ill-fated flight. The staged crash was to occur at 9 : 32 a.m . which, as it happened, was just five minutes before AA77 plowed into the West wing of the Pentagon. A document obtained by the 9/11 Commission describes the exercise and the simulated crash. No real plane was to be involved, nor was it to involve terrorism. The cause of the crash was to be a mechanical failure. According to the prepared script, soon after leaving Dulles the Learjet pilot would discover that one of his engines was on fire. Moments later, while losing altitude, he would contact Dulles with the urgent message, “I’m losing it….I can’t maintain attitude….I’m going down!”2 The same document describes the imaginary crash in colorful language: “The aircraft broke out of the clouds and clipped the western edge of [NRO] tower number four before disintegrating as it fell to earth. Various parts of the aircraft struck the outside portions of the building, scattering jet fuel.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:158:ecb88db3ea3b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5067, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 159, "text": "would discover that one of his engines was on fire.

Various parts of the aircraft struck the outside portions of the building, scattering jet fuel. The final portions of the wreckage were scattered around the entryway between tower one and two. Jet fuel was burning uncontrollably in the vicinity of the flagpoles. There are a number of injured and dead NRO employees.”3 To make the exercise seem as realistic as possible, stairwells and exits at the NRO building were sealed off to simulate damage from the crash and to compel NRO employees to find other ways to evacuate to safety. A smoke generator was brought in and other “inputs,” such a flood of phone calls about fires in the building, were also planned for realism. Fire engines from the Fairfax County Fire Department were supposed to arrive on the scene at 9:37 a.m. The fires would be extinguished by 10 : 30 a.m , and the exercise would terminate at 11:45 a.m. But was the “incredible coincidence” as described, or was it part of a planned military stand-down for the purpose of enabling the 9/11 attacks to succeed? All but essential NRO staff were to be sent home immediately after the simulated crash, and according to various reports were indeed sent home once the exercise was canceled. This can only mean that, from then on, some or all of the US spy satellite apparatus was under-staffed or unmanned altogether, possibly compromising the NRO’s mission, which is to provide for the national security of the United States.5 And so, one must ask: Was the NRO drill actually designed to achieve the perverse goal of inhibiting the agency from doing its job? Was the real purpose of the drill to sow confusion, and to empty the building in order to prevent honest government employees from seeing something they were not meant to see, such as evidence of complicity in the attacks? The reported sighting by Susan McElwain of a very low-flying a cruise missile, which because they do fly low are extremely difficult to spot and track with ground-based radar. The most effective way to track them is from above using look-down radar systems, such as the US Air Force’s E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) planes. The E-3 Sentry is a militarized Boeing 707 equipped with a distinctive radar dome piggy-backed above the fuselage. The E-3’s 30-foot rotating dome commands a full 360-degree sweep of the horizon, with a range of 250 miles at operating altitudes.

The E-3’s 30-foot rotating dome commands a full 360-degree sweep of the horizon, with a range of 250 miles at operating altitudes. The E-3 Sentry is a very effective surveillance platform, and for this reason has been a workhorse for the US military since first deployed in 1977. However, maintaining E-3 AWACS planes on continuous patrol is very expensive. The cost factor evidently prompted the Pentagon to develop a lighter-than-air blimp-mounted radar system known as JLENS, the first installation of which is being completed, as I write, near the Aberdeen Proving Ground east of Baltimore. A single unit (consisting of two unpiloted balloons tethered by cables at a stationary height of 10,000 feet) will provide cost-effective 24 X 7 radar coverage from Raleigh, North Carolina to Boston, thus shielding the northeastern United States from surprise cruise missile attack. However, at the time of 9/11, JLENS was still under development and thus, can have played no role. As I have already noted, the 9/11 radar data shows that on the morning of 9/11 an E-3 Sentry AWACS plane was on patrol in an orbit off the coast of Virginia. However, the aircraft did not move within range of Shanksville until well after 11:36 a.m. – too late to matter. John Farmer’s exhaustive review of the 9/11 radar data found no other E-3s aloft over the northeastern US during the relevant time period. In sum, there was no AWACS capability to spot and track a hypothetical unauthorized aircraft and cruise (or other type of ) missile at Shanksville. This ought to make us doubly suspicious of the Internet reports already discussed in chapter 13. As noted, the 9/11 radar data plainly shows that these reports were false; and their falsity begs the question. Why would anyone knowingly post a false account? Assuming perpetrators deployed a missile north of Shanksville, one must ask, were these false reports an attempt to mask the absence of radar coverage over Pennsylvania? Their falsity is transparent in 2014, but let us remember that when the reports were posted soon after the attacks, the NORAD/FAA radar data had not yet been released.

From the outset and for many years, the US military’s spy satellite tence only occurred in 1973 when a US Senate report inadvertently mentioned the NRO by name.6 Five years later, President Jimmy Carter crossed an important threshold when he acknowledged that the United States actively engaged in satellite reconnaissance.7 The timing of Carter’s disclosure was no accident. It was intended to bolster confidence that the US could effectively monitor arms control. At the time, the US Senate was considering ratification of the SALT II Nuclear Weapons Treaty with the Soviets; and the Carter White House lobbied hard for its passage. Despite this early glimmer of light, blanket secrecy prevailed through the Reagan and H.W. Bush presidencies. The existence of the NRO was not officially disclosed until 1992.8 To this day, the NRO satellite program remains one of the most highly classified activities of the Department of Defense. The New York Times once referred to the NRO as “probably the most secretive of the [sixteen US] intelligence agencies.”9 Here, it might be helpful to review some history. As early as 1963, the US military first utilized an infrared satellite to detect the test launch of a Soviet intercontinental missile. From then on, throughout the dark years of the Cold War, the primary purpose of infrared satellites was to provide early warning of a surprise nuclear attack against the United States. However, by the time of the first Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm), infrared sensors had improved enough that they could also detect tactical missile launches, in this case, Saddam Hussein’s inaccurate Scuds.10 After the Cold War ended in 1991, the NRO satellite surveillance program actually expanded to evaluate missile activity and potential threats from other states with emerging nuclear and missile programs, including India, North Korea, Iran, Israel and Pakistan, in addition to Russia and China. For many years, a little-known intelligence office housed deep inside the National Security Agency (NSA) known as the Defense Special Missile and Astronautics Center (DEFSMAC, pronounced “deaf-smack”) has handled the job of evaluating data collected by the NRO satellites. DEFSMAC was established in 1964 by Defense Secretary Robert MacNamara largely as a result of the Cuban missile crisis.11 The hybrid office is run by NSA civilian experts and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) military officers, and “has all the inputs from all the assets.” The office receives intelligence from listening posts, human agents and seismic detect, in addition to radar and infrared satellites.12 According to a former NSA official, DEFSMAC probably has “a better feel for any worldwide threat to this country from missiles, aircraft, or overt military activities, better and more timely, at instant fingertip availability, than any group in the United States.”13 Due to continuing blanket secrecy, it is extremely difficult to assess the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:161:717fa5bf330b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5070, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 162, "text": "“has all the inputs from all the assets.” The office receives intelligence from listening posts, human agents and seismic detect, in addition to radar and infrared satellites.12 According to a former NSA official, DEFSMAC probably has “a better feel for any worldwide threat to this country from missiles, aircraft, or overt military activities, better and more timely, at instant fingertip availability, than any group in the United States.”13 Due to continuing blanket secrecy, it is extremely difficult to assess the capabilities of US spy satellites. In 1997, during a press briefing, General Howell M. Estes, then Chief of the US Space Command, commented on the operational capability of the US infrared spy satellites of the time. Estes explained: “And I would tell you, to be very blunt and very factual about this, that the infrared source out of a small missile is not intense enough for us to see with these infrared systems.”15 intelligence think-tank, insisted to this writer that the US had the capability in 2001 to spot and track a cruise missile from space.17 Dr. Bill Deagle agreed.18 However, John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, took the view that even today space radar and infrared satellites are simply too distant to track an object as small as a cruise missile.19 Infrared satellites reportedly surveil the earth from space, 22,300 miles above the equator.20 uestions about US satellite capability were partially answered on October 4, 2014, when the NSA released its infrared signal data of the presumed crashes of all four aircraft allegedly hijacked on September 11, 2001, including United Flight 93.21 Evidently the NSA had no trouble spotting the impacts via satellite. The data is displayed graphically, and has been posted on line for viewing and download.22 The NSA released the infrared satellite data in response to an appeal submitted five months before by former DIA officer and 9/11 Commission staffer Miles Kara.23 The same data had been made available to the 9/11 Commission in 2003-2004. In its final report the Commission listed infrared satellite data as one of the primary sources of evidence for the official 10:03 a.m. crash time of United 93.24 Judging from emails I received from Kara, and from statements on his website, Kara pursued the release to establish definitively the commission’s work, and its conclusions, and to put an end, once and for all, to speculations about the 10:06 a.m. seismic signal and conspiracy theories about the fate of Flight 93. I myself was not surprised that the NSA had recorded a 10:03 a.m. infrared signal at the alleged United 93 crash site. Unfortunately, Kara failed to request the release of all of the infrared satellite data recorded on 9/11, including any signal recorded at 10:06 a.m. The text of his May 15, 2014 letter of appeal to the NSA shows that his request was limited to the infrared signals of the crash times", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:162:0fcecfa70df4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5071, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 163, "text": "theories about the fate of Flight 93.

Kara’s wording gave the NSA an easy out. On October 27, 2014, I therefor submitted my own Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the NSA, calling for the release of any and all additional infrared satellite data recorded that morning, especially data recorded at 10:06 a.m. On November 5th, I also sent a separate letter to DEFSMAC in which I mentioned the possibility that United 93 may have exploded mid-air at an altitude below 5,000 feet, possibly as low as 500-800 feet. Assuming that a mid-air explosion did occur, I asked, how could the NSA have distinguished such an explosion at a very low altitude from a crash at the surface given that infrared satellites surveil the earth from such a great distance? I also wanted to know why DEFSMAC released no infrared photos or videos. As of this writing I have received no response to these questions. We have determined that the fact of the existence or non-existence of the materials you request is a currently and properly classified matter in accordance with Executive Order 13526, as set forth in Subparagraph c of Section 1.4. Thus, your request is denied pursuant to the first exemption of the FOIA which provides that the FOIA does not apply to matters that are specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign relations and are, in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order. The NSA denied my request, citing the first and third exemptions of the FOIA. The NSA claims that the fact of the existence or non-existence of the materials I am requesting is a classified matter in accordance with Executive Order 13526, which provides that the FOIA does not apply to matters that properly need to be kept secret in the interest of national defense. I am appealing because the NSA’s denial on the basis of national defense is improper.

Aside from the 2006 conviction of Zacarias Moussaoui, which was at most a peripheral case, not one of the actual perpetrators of the attacks of September 11, 2001 has been brought to trial, let alone convicted. Indeed, it is likely that some or many of those responsible have not yet been apprehended nor even identified. They remain at large and constitute a continuing grave threat to the security of the United States. For this reason it is imperative that the discovery process continue unencumbered by needless bureaucratic red tape. The NSA’s continued withholding of the requested infrared satellite data is therefor improper and may inadvertently result in harm to the United States. Serious questions remain about the events of that day, including the fate of UAL93. Certainly the official explanation about what happened to the fourth plane has never been established beyond a reasonable doubt. The unresolved issues may turn out to be crucial to solving the crime and bringing the perpetrators to justice. Data Recorder (FDR) is not consistent with a crash, and points to a different conclusion. A 9/11 researcher named Warren Stutt has been studying these files, which were released as the result of a FOIA request. Stutt confirmed to me that the black box in the tail of UAL93 failed to record a sudden deceleration at the presumed moment of impact, an anomalous finding to say the least. If the aircraft had crashed nose down at ∼ 500 mph as we have been told, the black box in the tail of the aircraft should have registered a sudden deceleration. Such a deceleration did occur in the case of AA77, the plane that crashed into the west wall of the Pentagon. AA77’s recovered FDR recorded the maximum allowable reading for deceleration at the moment of impact. (If you care to discuss this, please contact Warren Stutt, at xxxxxxxxxxxx) The 9/11 Commission had a “sweeping” mandate: “to provide the fullest possible account of the events surrounding 9/11.” (The 9/11 Commission Report, p. xv-xvi). Yet, the commission’s investigation of UAL93 was, to be kind, less than adequate. A DIA intelligence officer named Miles Kara served as the commission’s lead investigator in this area. It was Kara who analyzed the primary source data for UAL93, including the 9/11 radar data, air traffic control tapes, FDR, CVR and seismic data, as well as the infrared satellite data which the NSA (DEFSMAC) made available to the Commission at Kara’s request. Kara states on his blog that “we spent considerable time running", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:164:890919f26543", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5073, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 165, "text": "of UAL93 was, to be kind, less than adequate.

Kara evidently assumed that it was a case of either/or. Either UAL93 crashed at 10:03, or, it crashed at 10:06. He failed to consider another possibility, that the seismic signal was the result of a separate event. He neglected to request to view any infrared satellite signal(s) recorded at 10:06 a.m. My FOIA request attempts to remedy this oversight. thermore, because the NSA has already declassified the infrared satellite data showing the crashes of the other three allegedly hijacked planes, as well as the signal recorded at 10 : 03 a.m . north of Shanksville, it is illogical to refuse on the grounds of national defense to release similar data recorded just moments later, at 10:06 a.m., assuming that such data exists. 1973. 7 Jeffrey T.

But even this obscene number may be too low. Christopher Hellman, a former policy analyst at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, has argued that the actual figure is a staggering $1.2 trillion per year, if we also factor in military aid to foreign countries, international peacekeeping operations, veteran’s benefits, military pensions, and the military component of the interest we pay on the national debt.1 As I write, the Congressional spigot flows unchecked into Pentagon coffers. Untold billions of taxpayer dollars continue to disappear down numerous rabbit holes into a black world lost to our sight. The flow of cash feeds hundreds of Top Secret projects, many involving next generation weapons and military technologies that have never been unveiled. Some of them have probably been under development in government labs for many years. The American people know nothing of this classified world, which has been kept shrouded in secrecy. I have argued that some of these cutting-edge technologies were used on 9/11. If I am even partly correct, it means the vast increase in US military spending after 9/11 was not the start of our troubles but the inevitable outcome of many years of failed democratic oversight. In that case, the September 11 attacks were not only more complex than we have been led to think, they were stranger than most of us have guessed in our wildest nightmares. If the full story is ever told, it will mock our complacency like the gods of the ancient world. I believe the issue of secrecy is paramount. The technologies I have discussed certainly were not on my radar screen before I began to investigate 9/11. Like most Americans, I was blithely unaware that technological advances were altering our world, almost beyond recognition. While it is certainly true that new technologies hold amazing potentials to free us from drudgery and improve the quality of our lives, make no mistake, technology can just as easily enslave us. Nor is it likely that its most hopeful possibilities will be realized so long as the cutting edge remains shrouded in secrecy. But I would go even further: If ordinary citizens do not soon awaken to the insidious dangers that black technologies pose to our freedoms, the shameless puppeteers who command them from the shadows may ultimately succeed in imposing their new world order upon us.

In that case, the experiment in self-government that began with the drafting of the US Constitution more than 200 years ago will come to an inglorious end, just another of history’s failed experiments. Even as a majority of Americans continue to shrink from the pivotal significance of 9/11, fortunately, an international consensus is emerging on the issue. This is reflected by a January 2011 poll in Germany, arguably home to the world’s most informed and best educated public. The poll showed that 89% of Germans have rejected the US government’s official story about 9/11.2 The figure represents a startling defeat for US propagandists. Nor is it likely that the political reality it reflects will be reversed, any time soon. Credibility being a precious commodity, once lost, it is extremely difficult to recoup. Germany’s recent withdrawal of support for the NATO-backed conflict in Libya shows that the tide of opinion is already being reflected in the policy decisions of the German government.3 Moreover, the same trend may soon be repeated in Japan, in part due to the ongoing nuclear disaster in Fukushima prefecture. That decision was an unconscionable blunder given that Japan is situated atop several active tectonic fault lines and has a long history of major earthquakes and tsunamis. As the Japanese people struggle to recover, they will likely become more nationalistic and independent of the United States. For many years, the Japanese supported US deficit spending by loyally purchasing US government bonds. But this will probably change, as all available capital will be urgently needed at home. Even before Daiichi, the Japanese media was more open to opposing viewpoints about 9/11 than its US counterpart. In post-Daiichi Japan, skepticism about the US and especially 9/11 is likely to increase and could even develop into open hostility. The German poll and the nuclear disaster in Japan together represent a stunning reversal for the United States, which since the end of World War II has stood at the pinnacle of world power. Incredible as it seems, in a mere sixty years the US has squandered the rare opportunity bequeathed to it after World War II: to lead the world into an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity. Instead, US elites have demonstrated that they are unworthy to lead.

Instead, US elites have demonstrated that they are unworthy to lead. As a global shift in economic power occurs that is less friendly to US interests, possibly led by the BRIC nations (i.e., Brazil, Russia, India and China), we should expect that Washington will increasingly resort to the use of raw military force to maintain US strategic advantages, much as the Crown did in the twilight of the British empire. In that case, US and NATO-sponsored wars will likely continue and escalate until they trigger another world conflagration, just as waning British power led to World War I. Except, this time, there will be a crucial difference: today, any global conflict will probably involve the use of nuclear weapons. One thing is clear. We will not succeed in our efforts to demobilize the US war machine and restore the US Constitution unless we open our eyes, full wide. Because our only chance to exert a positive influence on events will be through right action, and that means we must understand our world as it actually is, not as we would like it to be, or as some would have us believe. The facts are stark, as I have attempted to show. Our nation is presently in the grip of diabolically evil forces that have betrayed and subverted our democratic values. But who are these individuals? I would argue: they are the same people who keep telling us that unregulated, i.e., predatory, capitalism is divinely ordained, and not to be questioned. They and their allies presently dominate Wall Street, both political parties, the courts, Congress (which they have bought), not to mention the White House (also bought) and the major US corporate media outlets (which they own); and by which means they have put many of our countrymen to sleep. No mistake, mass hypnosis and denial will continue to be the greatest obstacles to a democratic renaissance here at home. The uncompromising search for truth cuts against the grain of US exceptionalism, instant gratification, reality and celeb TV, consumerism, cheap thrills, sports-on-demand, infotainment and every other readily available form of escapism in our mass culture. As Orwell wrote, “in a time of universal deceit, speaking the truth becomes a revolutionary act.” Sometimes, in order to see the light, it is necessary to wake up and face the darkness.

Descending constant radius turns are another feature of GPSguided navigation systems involving both Required Navi-Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) signal. Such turns, also known as Radius-to-Fix (RF) turns, 1 are similar to the 330-degree descending right turn that American Airlines Flight 77 performed over Alexandria, Virginia on 9/11, immediately before its final approach and impact with the Pentagon.2 The point at which AA 77’s 330-degree descending right turn terminated is also comparable to a Final Approach Fix (FAF), the point from which a straight final runway approach segment would commence. Such autopilotcontrolled turns were possible on 9/11. As noted, the WAAS signal became available one year before the attacks. The Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University described experimental RF turns, similar to the 330-degree descending turn performed by AA 77, following 1998 test flights in Alaska involving a WAAS prototype: “The Wide Area Augmentation System … allows pilots to fly … approaches that cannot necessarily be flown with current instrumentation… including ap- Both aircraft that struck the WTC also performed descending turns prior to impact. The approximately 20-degree banked constant radius turn executed by UAL 175 from about 1.5 miles away, eight seconds before impact, was especially challenging from the standpoint of hands-on pilot control. Before the turn, UAL 175 was wings-level and on a sharply descending trajectory. A precisely timed and properly banked turn was critical to offset crosswinds that otherwise would have caused the aircraft to drift laterally an estimated 122 to 134 feet.4 In which case, UAL 175 would probably have missed the South Tower altogether. Two factors were required for successful impact. The first was selection of the correct banking angle, which also had to be uniformly maintained throughout the final approach. The second was the correct start-time of the banking turn. If UAL 175 had started the turn just one second sooner, or later, (assuming a speed of 799 feet per second), the aircraft would probably have missed the tower. If the banking angle had been just 5 degrees more, or 5 less, than observed, a difference indiscernible to a casual observer, UA 175’s flight path would have been displaced approximately 100 feet to the left or right, respectively. In this case, the plane’s fuselage would have come close to missing the tower.

In this case, the plane’s fuselage would have come close to missing the tower. The stability of UAL 175‘s banking turn during the final approach suggests that the aircraft was under autopilot control. Because this additional bank angle was so dramatic and not necessary for a well centered impact, it raises the possibility that it was performed under autopilot control, in order to simply create an impression of active human control for the numerous cameras by then focused on the towers. Would a pilot have jeopardized an otherwise inevitable impact with such a reckless and unnecessary maneuver? Analysis of UAL 175’s final approach shows that the small margins for error in the constant radius banking turn required to impact WTC-2 from approximately 1.5 miles distant would have posed a substantial challenge to an inexperienced pilot. The uniformity and accuracy of the initial bank in achieving impact indicates that the initial angle selection was very nearly correct to achieve a perfectly centered impact. AA 11’s impact via its descending banked turn was in fact perfectly centered. All of this weighs against human control. Documents show that this type of descending constant radius autopilot controlled turn was specifically supported by augmented GPS service made available just one year prior to September 11, 2001. As noted, this type of turn was also supported by Boeing 767 Flight Management Systems (FMS) as early as 1998.6 n September 6, 1996 Rockwell-Collins Commercial Avion-Oics announced plans by Boeing and other major commercial airlines to install Rockwell-Collins Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) landing systems within their Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft.7 The MMR system can utilize the WAAS signal as well as the basic GPS signal, Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF), Very High Frequency Omnirange (VOR) navigation signals and eventually the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) navigation signal.8 LAAS is an application of WAAS technology designed for local use at major airports. A Boeing document circa 1999 describes this technology: “Operators of 757s and 767s may also choose to upgrade to the recently certified Future Air Navigation System (FANS) FMC (Pegasus), which is Y2K-ready and available. Service bulletins for the 757 and 767 FANS retrofit will be issued upon operator request.”10 Aviation and popular publications describe a 2006 test flight involving a commercial Boeing 757 airliner outfitted with this technology. During the test, the Air China flight snaked along a narrow river valley in Tibet between towering Himalayan peaks, then descended “on a precisely plotted highway in the sky” through heavy clouds to a remote airstrip.

During the test, the Air China flight snaked along a narrow river valley in Tibet between towering Himalayan peaks, then descended “on a precisely plotted highway in the sky” through heavy clouds to a remote airstrip. The destination was the brand new runway at Linzhi, one of the world’s most difficult-to-reach towns. En route, the 757 passed through the planet’s most challenging terrain. The mountainous region has no radar coverage, no groundbased navaids, and no air traffic controllers to provide assistance. The plane was guided entirely by autopilot using global-positioning satellites and on-board instruments. The test was so successful that Air China subsequently announced that it would start regular commercial air service into Linzhi. Capt. Chen Dong Cheng, an Air China pilot who rode as an observer on the inaugural flight, explained that commercial service into Linzhi would never have been feasible without the precise, automated navigation system which was custom-designed for that particular plane and airfield.11 According to Aviation Week, the Boeing 757 that made the historic flight was equipped “with dual GPS receivers, [dual] flight path computers and [dual] inertial reference systems so that no single failure could cause a loss of navigation capability.” The approach to the 9,700 foot-elevation runway at Linzhi airport is difficult, but according to Steve Fulton, the technical officer at Naverus, which developed the technology, “RNP is very precise and the aircraft … [was] equipped with Honeywell Pegasus flight management systems and Rockwell Collins multi-mode receivers.” The GPS-based system was accurate to within 3-4 meters (10-13 ft). Although the test occurred in 2006, according to Fulton, “this type of accuracy has been routinely possible since 2000.”12 By 1999, Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft like those involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks contained digital flight control systems that could “automatically fly the airplanes on pre-selected routes, headings, speed or altitude maneuvers.”13 Records show that between 1994 and 2002, the FAA, US Air Force and NASA sponsored numerous runway approach and to-land systems of Boeing 757, 767 and other Boeing 700 series aircraft routinely achieved horizontal and vertical positional accuracies of several meters or less. Nearly all of these tests occurred prior to 9/11. Also significant is the fact that the parameters of the “highways in the sky,” as well as the runways at major US airports like JFK International, Chicago-O’Hare International and Los Angeles International, closely match the physical dimensions of the World Trade Center towers. The major runways are between 150 and 200 feet wide.14 The WTC towers were each 208 feet wide.15 In October 1994, the FAA sponsored a series of test flights which demonstrated the amazing accuracy of augmented GPS.

The tests involved a United Airlines Boeing 737 and occurred at NASA’s Crows Landing Flight Facility in California. During 110 autopilot approaches and touchdowns, the Boeing 737 consistently achieved “accuracies on the order of a few centimeters.”16 During October 1994, the FAA sponsored another series of automated landings in cooperation with Ohio University. In this case the augmented GPS was integrated into the Flight Management System (FMS) of a donated United Parcel Service Boeing 757-200 aircraft. During 50 automated approaches and touchdowns, the augmented GPS system performed at least as well as the standard Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) technology then in use at US airports.17 During July and August 1995, Honeywell, Boeing and NASA sponsored tests at NASA’s Wallops Island, Virginia flight test facility using NASA’s Boeing 757-200 test aircraft. GPS was used in the tests to provide guidance for 75 autopilot approaches and touchdowns. Preliminary performance data showed that the augmented GPS landing system achieved the predicted positional accuracy of 1-2 meters.18 During October-December 1998, WAAS signal en route navigation and Category I precision instrument aircraft runway approaches were conducted over the North Atlantic Ocean and in the nation of Chile, using FAA-owned Boeing 727 test aircraft. Overall positional accuracies of 3-4 meters were successfully achieved.19 During August 1999, the FAA sponsored multiple augmented GPS signal autopilot approach and touchdown tests using a donated United Parcel Service 767 aircraft. The tests involved the prototype GPS-based Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS), which is intended to compliment the FAA’s WAAS service. The LAAS signal can provide aircraft positional accuracy of less than one meter vertically and laterally.20 This is even better than the 3-4 meter accuracy achieved by WAAS. During the summer of 2001, the US Air Force and Raytheon jointly sponsored test flights at Holloman AF Base, New Mexico of a new automated GPS-based landing system for the Department of Defense. The new system, known as the Joint Precision Approach and Landings System (JPALS), was designed to be fully interoperable with similar planned civilian systems also under development. On August 25, 2001, a Fed-Ex 727-200 aircraft equipped with a Rockwell-Collins GNLU-930 Multi-Mode Receiver, achieved the first precision approach and touchdown using JPALS, which is the military counterpart of the civilian LAAS system.21 On October 9, 2001, a company named Cubic Defense Systems, Inc. applied for a US patent for a system that transfers pilot control of an aircraft to the autopilot during an emergency, which then implements an", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:BPIPG_cleaned.txt:172:3235f01435a5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5081, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "BPIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Black-11-Money-Motive-Technology/dp/1634240812", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "BPIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 173, "text": "fully interoperable with similar planned civilian systems also under development.

The plant certainly was not a buna production facility. The electrical consumption alone – equal to that of Berlin, then the eighth largest city in the world – was preposterously high for making buna. The power expenditure was in line, however, with uranium enrichment requirements of an atomic weapon, based on my personal knowledge of its U.S. counterpart. The traditional history of the buna plant explicitly states that, while it was in existence four years, it never created any buna. But the massive consumption of energy, whatever the plant was intended to create, suggests that it was to some significant degree operational and creating something. If not buna, what? How did the Germans come to create so much enriched uranium before even the United States had achieved it? Unfortunately for the U.S., by far the most successful expert on uranium enrichment – in Germany or the United States – Manfred von Ardenne was captured and taken to Russia after the war. We know the Soviets almost immediately made Ardenne head of Institute A, their nuclear weapons program, and that he was the leader of the division for electromagnetic separation of isotopes. In 1953, Ardenne was awarded the Stalin Prize, first class, for contributions to the atomic bomb project, and became known as the Father of the Soviet Atomic Bomb. The second material information you should take note of, I believe, is that the contributions to the Manhattan Project of the surrendered U-234 did not stop there. I believe the surrender of U-234 had impact on the development of the implosion device – the plutonium bomb dropped on Nagasaki – as well. I was well acquainted with the development of the implosion device and the difficulties our scientists experienced in developing a detonation system that would give a proper spherical implosion. This concern kept the entire group on edge until the famous Trinity Test in New Mexico proved it to be successful. Detonating the device, along with the scarcity of plutonium, led the scientists just prior to the Trinity test to build a large cast iron containment vessel in which they could place the device to contain it for recovery of the plutonium if the detonation system failed to create a nuclear explosion. Surprisingly, as the date of the test approached, last-minute improvements in the firing system reduced their concern enough about the reliability of the detonation system that the containment vessel was never used. I was never told how the details of the improvements came about, but it was during this period that the passengers on board U-234 were debriefed and it was learned one in particular, the scientist Heinz Schlicke, had knowledge of fast operating energy transfer systems.

The rapid and consistent release of electrical energy was a key part of the problem the LANL scientists were experiencing triggering the detonators with the simultaneity necessary to achieve a clean spherical implosion. There apparently is no written unclassified record available to provide us with what may have come from the debriefing of Heinz Schlicke but this we do know, over the summer months after his capture and the surrender of U-234 the confidence in the detonation system greatly improved, and the production of uranium for the gun weapon increased significantly. I am convinced that Carter Hydrick presents in Critical Mass a credible theory backed by documentary evidence that the surrendered submarine U-234 contained important material to construct and possibly deliver both the uranium and plutonium atomic bombs. Carter has spent a significant part of his life sifting through the historical documents and technical information to give the reader some ideas as to just how close the race for a nuclear weapon was. In the process he has found information suggesting possible collusion between U.S. and German high officials that led to the surrender of U-234 to the U.S. An undertaking of this size always requires a huge commitment that,paradoxically, due to myopia and naivety, usually is still too small to match the task at hand. The truth – that I was looking at the elephant’s trunk but thought I was seeing the entire beast – was not discovered until the project was too far down the road to turn back or give up on. This admission does not reflect a low level of enthusiasm for the work on my part. Working as a private researcher sans credentials, foundation funding, or assistants required a much higher level of commitment than originally anticipated. The effort ultimately cost over $20, 000 and fifteen years of research, writing and marketing. Those fifteen years and that $20, 000 were not mine alone to give. My wonderful wife of nearly 45 years, Kris, and our children, Elias, Ashley, Yurii and Fleming, have by far sacrificed more than anyone in order to make this book possible.

They are at the top of the list for a very personal and heartfelt “thank you,” for giving up three different family vacations and countless additional hours with husband and father while I spent their time and money traveling to archives to do research or sitting alone in a closed room writing. It feels a very selfish thing for me to do. But understanding how important this history is, or at least how important I believe it is to our collective understanding of these important events, they supported me in the end; and even as this third edition is going to press have encouraged the process. There is nothing I can say or do that can express the intense appreciation I hold for each of them for their patience and support – often when it wasn’t in their own interests. Thank you so much, guys. For this third edition particularly I recognize a debt of gratitude once again to Dr. Delmar Bergen, retired director of the Nuclear Weapons Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory, for reaching deeper into his reserves of knowledge, courage and integrity to both add additional important technical insight, as well as having vetted the work and provided the forward to it, and ultimately having further endorsed and defended it. Revisionist historian Dr. Joseph Farrell came to my attention while I once was surfing the internet to see what was happening with the two previous editions of Critical Mass. I found he had not only discovered and enthusiastically endorsed the book, but he led me to one of the compelling discoveries that swayed me to publish this third edition: the discovery of 126,000 barrels of spent uranium from the Nazi atomic bomb program, which proves the findings in Critical Mass are correct. He then in private encouraged me, despite some misgivings I had due to previous challenges with this project, to prepare a third edition. In the end, he led me to TrineDay, the publisher who agreed to take up the task. For all of these contributions I am grateful; including to Kris Milligen of TrineDay for his commitment to the work.

David Davis, a priceless friend since high school, did the same. In November 1999, a Houston television station did a newscast about this research. In the segment, Dr. Anthony Stranges, PhD, associate professor of history at Texas A&M University, provided the opposing viewpoint in favor of the traditional history. I immediately made arrangements to show the research to Dr. Stranges, who kindly allowed me an opportunity. After three-and-a-half hours reviewing the documentation, Dr. Stranges agreed that my findings were, in fact, plausible and that critical review and additional research were appropriate. I very much appreciate Dr. Stranges, who not only had the courage to look unafraid at this evidence that flies in the face of the entrenched history, but who, over the course of the years since then, has also provided professional and moral support, along with opportunities for me to share my findings with the scholastic world. During one of these events, while presenting to Phi Alpha Theta (the national collegiate historical society) at Texas A&M, for which Dr. Stranges was the faculty advisor, Dr. John Poston, Sr., head of the university’s Nuclear Engineering Department, was in attendance. Dr. Poston provided valuable additional insight into atomic theory and technology that have further strengthened the conclusions forwarded within these pages. Dr. Bernhard Wehring of the University of Texas J.J. Pickle Nuclear Research Center, and Drs. Harlow Russ, Edward Hammel and John Allred – all retired from the National Atomic Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico – and the late Clarence Larsen – formerly director of the Oak Ridge calutrons – also provided valuable insight and information. Captain Carl Triebes (USN retired), former submariner and navigator extraordinaire, who helped me analyze U-234’s war log, deserves recognition, as well. My son Eli went the additional mile by serving as my German translator for the war log and for many interrogation transcripts and original German documents. Of prime importance in getting this work off the ground are Arthur Naujoks, the man who initiated this effort, and Rob Bell, who introduced me to Art. Rob was a friend and film producer who wanted me to write the screenplay for a motion picture about U-234.

While these few pieces of information fit together well, they were very far from conclusive. My respect for properly recorded history led me to convince Art and Rob that the research should be completed first, proving or disproving the assumptions we were making about those few shreds of evidence. If the hypothesis proved true, we agreed, the documentation should be presented first in a book for critical review; if not, then we could go ahead and make a movie from the idea. Art asked how long it would take to do the research. I estimated no longer than a year. Cal Jochetz, Bret Reich, Rick Page and Ken Anderson deserve a note here for being the first to serve as editors for this work. That was many years and multiple drafts ago, but they set me on the right track with sound guidance both in terms of such things as structure, grammar and word usage, and, more importantly, in overall readability. Receiving their corrections was painful, so I suppose it is appropriate they are, respectively, a dentist and three lawyers. It has been many years since I have seen the last three, but I still consider them all good friends, and I appreciate immensely their willingness to hurt me in order to make this book better. Finally, there are a number of others who helped drive this work forward. Robert Morin, of Birmingham, Alabama, was the first outside of my own family to contribute by providing means for me to work in the National Archives Southeast Region at East Point, Georgia, partially at his own expense. Archivists Barry Zerby and John Taylor lead a long line of specialists within the National Archives and Records Administration and elsewhere without whose help I could have completed this work. Archivist Charles Reeves gave great and enthusiastic assistance at the Southeast Regional Archives in East Point, Georgia. The reader may note in the endnotes that citations are given from the Northeast Regional Archives in Waltham, Massachusetts, as well, but may notice no acknowledgements are credited to archivists from there. When I first started this project, all of U-234’s documents were in the main building of the National Archives and Records Administration on Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC.

Many of the key documents that I had already reviewed in Washington, DC, however, were sent to the Northeast regional facility in Waltham. Rather than go to the expense of an additional trip just to re-identify locations of these documents in the northeast archive, I have used citations provided for them in Joseph Mark Scalia’s book about U-234, Germany’s Last Mission to Japan: The Failed Voyage of U-234. My thanks to Mr. Scalia, and by extension to the archivists who worked with him in the northeast archives. Harry Cooper, founder and president of Sharkhunters International, a historical society dedicated to the preservation of submarine history, provided much assistance in connecting me to people close to events, as well as in giving me an open pass to the archives of Sharkhunters. Dr. Alan Bath, PhD, formerly of the Office of Naval Intelligence, and who wrote his doctoral thesis on Naval Intelligence, reviewed the manuscript for accuracy as relates to intelligence matters, most specifically ENIGMA/ULTRA and MAGIC/PURPLE cryptography, but also regarding American naval intelligence policy, processes and practices. Carina Lyne provided a great service in preparing the original documents for presentation within these pages. There are many others who have helped with this work, I am sure, whom I have forgotten over these years. It takes so many people to make a project such as this happen – all people to whom I owe a deep debt of gratitude and to whom I express my profound appreciation. If I have forgotten you in these meager acknowledgements I am truly sorry. Please take compensation in knowing that you contributed to a work that will hopefully make a difference in how we understand this world in which we live. his micro-history is the result of newly discovered, very significant events that occurred during the closing weeks of World War Two. As the story of Critical Mass unfolds, it questions the foun dations of the traditional history of World War Two regarding the making and use of the first atomic bombs, as well as challenges our understanding of how the Nuclear Age was born.

Instead, the evidence shows enriched uranium and other atomic bomb components developed by Nazi Germany were surrendered to United States forces during the final weeks of the war – probably according to prearranged surreptitious agreements – and were a vital part of the materials used to create the bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The evidence indicates that without these materials the United States would have fallen short of achieving its nuclear weapons objectives. And it shows that without achieving these objectives, it is highly probable the Soviet Union would have become and remained for many decades the reigning super power on earth. Interwoven into this story is provocative evidence that connects Hitler’s behind-the-scenes right-hand man, Nazi Party Chief Martin Bormann, to Germany’s very nearly successful effort to create an atomic bomb; and to Germany’s last-ditch efforts to transfer that technology to Japan. Evidence also suggests that Bormann, at the latest possible moment, turned against his Asian ally and decided to hand the keys of world dominion – in the form of the atomic bomb – to any Allied country that would deal with him. Thus Bormann covertly negotiated a separate, and very secret, personal peace with the United States that allowed him to disappear from the front page of history and slide silently between the shadows of a murky past and a phantasmal future. As I researched this history, the initial events, striking as they were, each led to astounding new revelations that had the net effect of continually, and, seemingly endlessly, expanding the scope of this book. As a private citizen who researched and wrote the book around the demands of a full-time job and who, with the aid of generous family and friends, financed the research and writing, generating unlimited resources to constantly expand the book’s scope was impossible.

In almost every case, as will be seen, this has been accomplished. In many cases, three or more proofs are given. In a few instances only one piece of evidence is extant; but taken on the whole, the accumulated evidence is considerable if not incontrovertible. The question may be asked that, with the hundreds if not thousands of books, articles and histories that have been written about the making of the first atomic bombs, how can any new and unpublished information be added to the chronicle. Remarkably, the answer, in part, is that very few of the writers of those histories ever saw any of the original records of the most seminal events that constituted the makings of the bombs. As far as I can tell, I was the first to review the actual uranium enrichment production records, the shipping and receiving records of materials sent from Oak Ridge to Los Alamos, the metallurgical fabrication records of the making of the bombs themselves, and the records and testimony regarding failure to develop a viable triggering device for the plutonium bomb. Of the 38 boxes of Oak Ridge records held in the Southeast Regional Archives in East Point, Georgia I had pulled for review, only four had been opened since their declassification in 1967 and 1978. I was the first to open and cull through the vast majority of boxes I was focused on, and within these containers I found many critical documents. And there are boxes that remain, their declassification seals yet unbroken. Apparently, the authors described earlier have relied on personal accounts and the administrative, strategic and general records harbored in the National Archives in Washington for their research. The critical daily production records of Oak Ridge and elsewhere have been all but ignored, though they reveal important information not previously considered in other histories, and although they tell a different story than that presently believed. Even if those authors had read, assimilated and interpreted the available records, the discrepancies may have been considered anomalous and possibly would have been ignored when compared against the overpowering reputation of the traditional history.

There was, undoubtedly, justification for this guarded approach considering the exigencies of the era. The chronicle of history should, however, be corrected when opportunity allows – though it all too often is not – for the understanding and benefit of generations to come. And for the just recognition of all those who played a part, as well as the enlightenment of those who simply desire to know the truth. Democracies especially depend on an informed citizenry to safeguard the proper use of power and appropriate oversight of important military and political policy. Certainly not all information and actions of a government at war or in conflict with another sovereignty can be reviewed on an open basis contemporaneously with the critical events. But as timely issues are resolved or neutralized by new events, it is incumbent upon that democratic society to carefully review and analyze the events and equitably judge the system and the people involved. In this manner we ensure the nation’s best interests are preserved, and make whatever adjustments are necessary to provide a guide for future endeavors. Other official and semi-official accounts of the Manhattan Project and the programs that competed against it have been written, the best among them being Richard Rhodes’ exceptional Pulitzer Prize winning book, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb. Critical Mass attempts in no way to re-document the otherwise reliable historical elements of a very complex and detailed subject, other than to provide a basic understanding useful to the reader’s analysis of the scenario forwarded within these pages. Critical Mass simply suggests the data recently found describe some very different events than are recounted in the presently accepted history. As noted, many other authors’ accounts are cited herein, but all of them, ultimately, either directly or indirectly, by default or design, have been molded by the man who presided over the project itself, General Groves. During the very process of the making of the atomic bombs, through compartmentalization and by mixing a high percentage of genuine data with innuendo – as well as judicious use of the occasional untruth – Groves was able to create a resilient and coherent self-perpetuating myth of the birth of the atomic age. Although driven by primary, first-hand documentation, some of the information used to tell the story in Critical Mass comes from the writings of Groves and other authors.

Although driven by primary, first-hand documentation, some of the information used to tell the story in Critical Mass comes from the writings of Groves and other authors. David Irving, Britain’s controversial but document-dependant World War Two historian, has recorded much of the German effort to create a nuclear weapon in his book, The German Atomic Bomb – which Rhodes in turn depended upon for much of his account of the Nazi program. Irving’s account alone, though he seems not to realize it, goes a long way toward impeaching the accepted history; which is that, because Germany failed to create plutonium, it therefore failed to build a weapon. There are two ways to build an atomic bomb, one of plutonium, the other of uranium. Irving brings to light ample information that, when considered with other evidence newly discovered and revealed within Critical Mass, suggests the Germans produced the material for and all but assembled a uranium bomb. pursued. And he has magnified this misinformation, couched in a cushion of half-truths, to immense proportions – large enough to hide what appears to be a huge German uranium enrichment project behind it – and thus he has shielded the Nazi near-success from the view of the world. His motivations for doing so will be discussed in detail later. One of many other authors quoted in Critical Mass is former World War Two intelligence officer Ladislas Farago, who documented Martin Bormann’s escape from Nazi Germany at the end of the war and his ensuing life in semi-secret exile in South America in his book Aftermath. Farago was accused, with supporting evidence provided by the CIA, of having forged some documentation that he used to verify his claims about Bormann. There is evidence Farago did, in fact, use photographs that were not what he asserted; whether there was deception in his intent or not is uncertain. Critical Mass reviews the subject of the CIA and its predecessor the OSS and their possible involvement in negotiations with Bormann and eventual surrender of German-made nuclear bomb materials, as well as their protection of Bormann afterward. Suffice it to say here that, because the CIA appears to have participated in certain of these events, and because it then required controlling any leaks about these actions, the agency’s involvement makes suspect any conclusions about the accusations against Farago. Critical Mass goes on to quote other authors who have independently discovered documentation corroborating much of Farago’s work. Among these authors is Paul Manning, former journalist for the New York Times and author of Martin Bormann – Nazi In Exile.

Among these authors is Paul Manning, former journalist for the New York Times and author of Martin Bormann – Nazi In Exile. Manning’s credentials as a journalist are impeccable. Although he did not accept an offer immediately after the war to serve as the civilian deputy of the United States’ occupation zone of Germany, the offer itself attests to the high regard in which he was held, as well as to the potential military intelligence and other resources he had available when researching his book. Many other authors are quoted, as well, to highlight and validate the conclusions presented in Critical Mass. But the definitive body of evidence is the actual, seminal documents cited in this book that dispassionately record the numbers and weights and dates and times and places and people that constituted the real events that occurred. The silent archives, in some cases long untouched, contain the remaining few pieces of the picture that had been painted over with duplicitous details and fraudulent facts. Exposing those lost data to the light of day is much like the art curator who takes a blacklight to a painting to ascertain its origin. Under scrutiny of light tuned only to see the original, the primary picture is exposed underneath as well as any revisions that may later have been made. So it is with the certifieds cited in Critical Mass. The light of day, “always a great disinfectant” as the saying goes, reveals through newly-disclosed documentation the true story of the Manhattan Project during the birth of its atomic offspring – with all its flaws, foibles and unholy alliances as well as its ultimate, although somehow twisted, success. And even with those flaws and foibles it is, at once, a story of genius and perseverance as well as a lesson in man’s own struggle to grow morally and spiritually at the same pace that he has grown intellectually and technologically. For, as social beings who must share this earth, we are all interdependent upon one another. When one such as Hitler rises to power, the only defense against the bully who insists on blood, when all reason has failed, is to be more the aggressor, or submit and perish.

The massive size of the U-boat alone – the submarine was three times larger than the standard German submersible – was quite enough to draw attention to the vessel. But there were other hints that spoke of the craft’s singular status: News reporters covering the surrender of U-234 had been ordered, contrary to all U-boat surrender procedures before and after its capture, to keep their distance from crew members or passengers of U-234 on threat of being shot by the attending Marine guards.3 Strict orders had been given that the press and all other observers must stay at least eight feet away from the disembarking POWs, and ropes were used to cordon off a corridor so the prisoners coming off the boat could march unhindered through the crowd. The first group of sequestered POWs that marched down the gangway revealed another clue to the mysterious vessel’s mission. At the lead was Luftwaffe Lieutenant General Ulrich Kessler, former commander-in-chief of the German Air Force in Norway and the North Atlantic and newly-assigned air attaché to Japan.4 The stern and monocled Prussian general was followed by an entourage; including Dr. Heinz Schlicke, 5 a high-frequency electronics expert; seven other military officers, all scientists, engineers or military staff members; and two mysterious civilians. Neither the reporters nor indeed any members of the United States armed services at Portsmouth would ever see or know about the passenger who it now appears had been on board but who was not among the prisoners taken off the boat. Nor would the reporters soon find out about the cargo still deep inside U-234’s hull. Reports did circulate of two Japanese officers on board who took their own lives in hara kari rather than submit to capture and the failure of their top-secret mission,6 which was to guarantee the safe arrival of cargo and passengers to Japan. According to rumors later proved to be true, they were buried at sea. But it seems another, more foreboding guest also had been on board. He probably now was somewhere in Spain.

For jampacked throughout the monstrous boat was the elite of Nazi Germany’s newest weapons development; including a completely disassembled Messerschmidt 262 jet fighter8 – the first jet aircraft to be used in combat – and the plans and material to build Germany’s ultra-secret V-4 rocket, the long-distance version of the feared V-2; as well as a mysterious “stratosphere plane,” apparently an aircraft that could reach and cruise in the rarefied atmosphere of near space. But most important, buried in the nose of the mammoth boat, sealed in cylinders “lined with gold,”9 was 560 kilograms, 1,120 pounds, of uranium oxide10 labeled $^ { \\mathrm { { \\sc } } } \\mathrm { U } 2 3 5 ^ { \\mathrm { { \\sc } , \\mathrm { { \\sc } } 1 1 } }$ – the fissile material from which atom bombs are made. Despite the cutting-edge technology, all of the other goods were dwarfed in significance by the uranium portion of U-234’s cargo. The United States, dangerously short of its nuclear objectives, would spirit away the uranium, and other captured materials, for use in its own atomic bombs. Orders from the Commander Naval Operations in Washington D.C. to the Naval Yard at Portsmouth commanded: How the uranium came to be in the U-boat, and the impact it would have on the outcome of the war against Japan and the future of the world, is a story of international intrigue to rival the most thrilling of espionage accounts.

It is the story of the struggle to control that power.

To this day, it is the culminating story of power politics on earth. The traditional history of the race for the atomic bomb – written by the victorious Allies – has taught us to believe the United States’ atomic bomb program, the Manhattan Project, with help from Britain and mistakenly believing that Germany’s nuclear program was striving to attain a bomb, had forged ahead and beaten the Germans to the development of a nuclear weapon. The authors of that history would have us believe that only later was it discovered the Germans never were successful in progressing beyond a very elementary level of the bomb’s development. The arrival in the United States of U-234 and its stockpile of nuclear materials saved the United States’ atomic bomb program. Because of shortages of time and materials within the American bomb project, unreported until now, the United States needed the German goods and technology not only to gain victory over Japan, the only surviving member of the German-Italian-Japanese triumvirate, and win the war, but to establish its objective, as well, of making its place once and for all among the top world powers. Prior to World War Two, America, while considered an ambitious contender for a place in the upper echelon of Earth’s geopolitical elite, was still relegated to the status of “also ran” among the countries of the world. The British Empire, though slowly being dismantled, could still brag the sun never set upon its holdings and still acted as the reigning world power. Germany, in the few short years before and during the early part of the war, was making an aggressive effort to unseat Britain’s shaky imperialism. Japan hoped to do the same in the East. The Soviet Union, like the United States, saw the war as an opportunity to make up distance in the international arena and fought for its place on the geopolitical globe. The potential introduction of an atomic weapon added a singular and determining dynamic to the equation. The bomb was the international equivalent of a sandlot free-for-all where one of the youngsters shows up with a machine gun: whoever had the weapon had control of the playground – if he could prove it was real and that he would use it. Up to the time of the U-boat’s surrender, America still had not been successful producing the weapon.

To be sure, the Manhattan Project was enjoying levels of success on all fronts of the newly developing technology. Bombgrade uranium was being enriched in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Plutonium for nuclear weapons was being bred in huge reactors in central Washington State. Advances in the understanding of nuclear technology and how to utilize it were being achieved at the national laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico and elsewhere. The major problem was that the desired result – a usable bomb – was not going to be completed in time. While development of the bomb components were moving forward, a date had been set after which use of the bomb would be difficult to impossible; and even if it was used after that date, significant political potential would be lost. To optimize atomic bomb technology politically required it be used to foreshorten the war in the Pacific by the time Russia declared war on Japan, which the Soviets planned to do in mid-August 1945. Any action significantly later would result in the parceling out of the Asia/Pacific region in the same way Europe was to be partitioned, leaving Russia with more than its fair share of the globe. Worse, once the Soviet Union was in the war in the Pacific, in order for the United States to use the bomb details of its existence and development would have to be shared with the Soviet Bear – an intimidating proposition indeed, giving nuclear war capabilities to Joseph Stalin. Russia’s helping to foreshorten the fall of Japan through conventional warfare before the bomb could be used would also eliminate America’s powerful (and arguably justifiable) rationalizations for use of the bomb against the Island Nation. The United States would not only lose the opportunity to save countless Allied and Japanese lives, but it would also lose powerful political advantage it hoped to gain psychologically and in real terms if it could demonstrate it had an atomic weapon and the resolve to use it. Lacking enough enriched uranium to produce a uranium bomb (the type dropped on Hiroshima) at the time U-234 landed, and unable to complete the development of a reliable triggering device for a plutonium bomb (the type dropped on Nagasaki), the Manhattan Project greedily gobbled up the enriched uranium and detonation components available from the surrendered submarine.

Three months later, the bomb materials finally reached Japan. Substantial evidence exists that Germany led the race for an atomic bomb throughout the war. The Germans were unable, however, to use the weapon against their enemies in Europe because the weapon components were not completed until after the Luftwaffe (the German Air Force) had lost air supremacy in Europe. Germany then had no means to deliver the weapon on an enemy target. Following D-day, in June 1944, the Allies’ close proximity to German troops on the European continent and in the Fatherland itself eliminated any potential attempt to use the weapon by Germany because of the improbability of successfully surreptitiously spiriting a nuclear weapon weighing several tons many miles behind enemy lines for detonation. There was no guarantee the weapon might not be captured and turned against them in one treacherous moment. As a result, arrangements were made at the highest level to export the technology and bomb components to Germany’s ally, Japan. Germany presumably hoped a Japanese victory in the Pacific would mean a victory for the Triumvirate, which would still ultimately result in Aryan domination of Europe. The masterminds behind development of the German nuclear weapon were not those men so often cited as the reigning scientific minds of the Third Reich – Heisenberg, Hahn, Weizsacker, Bothe and others. Heisenberg and his cronies are correctly characterized in the traditional history as having been so full of petty professional jealousies and pompous pride they could not productively work together to reach a common goal. The true masterminds of the German atomic bomb did not struggle under these conditions and the paltry budgets the traditional history suggests were provided the German scientists. The real masterminds of the German atomic bomb were not restricted by a lack of highly technical production capacity either, as the traditional history suggests was the German program. Nor was that production program under constant scrutiny by Allied nuclear reconnaissance efforts, as the traditional history asserts would have been the case had the Germans actually been more successful with their bomb project. The true masterminds of the German atomic bomb program were experimental physicist Baron Manfred von Ardenne, his theoretical/experimental physicist colleague Fritz Houtermans, and an army of scientists and technicians. This intellectual armada was provided, as was the extravagant funding for the program, by one of the Third Reich’s richest and most successful sources of research and development sustenance – the German postal service.

As bizarre as this may seem, it is a documented fact the postal ministry supported with hundreds of millions of reichsmarks, possibly billions, an excellent technical branch that, among other remarkable achievements, successfully tapped and decrypted the complex technology of a dedicated transatlantic hot-line established early in the war between Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. All students of the race for the atomic bomb know Adolf Hitler himself once joked (as they, probably wrongly, characterized the comment) following a report by his Minister of Posts on the progress of the ministry’s nuclear research and development program, that it would be his postal service, not his military, that would win the war for him with the secret weapon it was developing.13 Significant and substantial documentation exists that proves Ardenne and Houtermans worked on far-reaching nuclear weapons programs well advanced over Heisenberg’s work, and funded and supported by the Ministry of Posts; and that Hitler on multiple occasions personally visited Ardenne’s laboratories in Berlin Lichterfelde. 14 No record could be found by this author of Hitler ever having shown such support for Heisenberg’s supposed atomic technology-leading nuclear reactor site, or that of any other nuclear scientist. Hitler insisted, nonetheless, that Germany would win the worldwide struggle using a secret weapon with destructive powers far superior to any previously known instrument of war. Once Ardenne and Houtermans developed the technology, the massive and sophisticated mechanisms required for producing the fissile material had to be built and operated in a safe location, free from Allied detection and bombing. With United States aircraft screening German skies daily for emissions laced in xenon- 133¹⁵ and monitoring the Fatherland’s electrical power usage for indications of inordinately high consumption of electricity and other characteristics that would signify existence of uranium enriching facilities, the Germans needed to find a location that would allow the work to go forward undisturbed. And big business needed to be brought in and tasked with building the secret, gargantuan industrial complex to enrich uranium.

During the war, this German conglomerate constituted the largest single chemical concern in the world, outsizing the top four United States chemical companies combined (all of which were working on the Manhattan Project). Farben had pioneered and owned the worldwide rights to the development and production of synthetic gasolines and rubbers – including those in the United States. Synthetic product technology required high-pressure, very demanding capabilities that were a good jumping-off point for the science needed to enrich uranium or build and operate a nuclear plutonium-breeding reactor. In the early 1940s, the company had in fact started constructing a buna plant, a synthetic rubber product, at a location outside of Germany – perfect for the requirements of freedom from scrutiny by Allied reconnaissance. The buna plant construction would allegedly last twice as long as planned, eventually cost I.G. Farben 900 million reichsmarks16 (approximately $2 billion), utilize over 25,000 laborers,17 and devour more electricity than the entire city of Berlin, but it would never produce a pound of buna. All of these characteristics run counter to those one would expect to observe from an actual buna manufacturing plant. But they would have been perfectly expected of an electromagnetic isotope separation facility – the technology Ardenne and Houtermans had successfully pioneered – required to enrich uranium for nuclear bombs. Located on the banks of the Vistula River in Poland, the Nazi concentration camp was the perfect site for Farben’s facility. Vast coal reserves to provide the fuel necessary for allegedly heating buna and for use as buna feed stocks, but, in fact, for generating electricity, were mined nearby. The river provided additional energy and cooling for the plant’s high-temperature processes. The major railroad spur located there provided easy transportation of equipment to, and product from, the plant. The vast pool of cheap labor available from the camp, which Farben infamously exploited throughout the war and for which the company paid the price dearly afterward when the Nuremberg Trials found it guilty of crimes against humanity and other human rights violations and ordered the dismantling of the conglomerate, were all components in selecting the location. But the best reason of all for selecting the site was the fact the proposed buna plant would provide the needed technological base and an excellent cover for what would actually be produced – enriched uranium. Synthetic rubber technology was still so new few people would know what to look for in a buna plant – or a uranium enrichment plant.

Qualified Farben personnel performed the demanding aspects of construction, while almost all of the non-technical facilities at the “buna” plant at Auschwitz, requiring a veritable army to erect and maintain the buildings and simple structures that supported the sophisticated technology, were built and manned largely by the ill-fated inmates. The last of their physical energy – their very beings – was drained from them by the work and they were driven to the gas chambers while enriched uranium was being collected and stockpiled for its future, sinister purpose. Standing silently at the center of this immense German atomic bomb program was one man. He had deep and powerful personal connections to each key player in the project. One of these relationships was old and sealed with blood – that he had with Rudolf Hoess, the Commandant of Auschwitz, with whom he helped murder a man, an enemy to the cause, when they were both young and unknown. Another of these relationships was bound together by tremendous wealth. Billions, probably tens of billions of reichsmarks, were amassed when he colluded with Hermann Schmitz, the chairman of I.G. Farben. He and Schmitz camouflaged a huge fortune in securities and other portable properties and, with the war winding to a close, they removed the funds from Nazi Germany and carefully disseminated them into the markets of the free-world economy for their later use. Still another of these relationships was bound together by power derived from the position he held as the most highly regarded lieutenant of arguably the most powerful man on Earth. His advocacy with the Fuehrer on behalf of Minister of Posts Wilhelm Ohnesorge fed the enormous research and development program Ohnesorge – formerly a mathematician and physicist – operated within the postal ministry. The final, fateful, least secure but most important relationship was forged in the final days of his, and Nazi Germany’s, power – with Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz. Doenitz was commander of the German U-boat navy, and was the man with whom he would trade the supreme leadership of all Germany for a place on one of the Admiral’s fleeing U-boats, apparently having previously secretly agreed to pay to the United States the price of his own ransom – in the currency of atomic weaponry.

In the dismal days at war’s end, buried in the bunker in Berlin that constituted the final seat of Hitler’s government; with the world crashing in around them; with Hitler high on drugs and low on mental and emotional reserves; with the Nazi leadership panicked and breaking for cover; the mysterious Martin Bormann, true to his Machiavellian nature, weaved one of his most deadly, intricate and yet enduring webs. These machinations succeeded in deft strokes to dismember from the Nazi Party leadership both Hermann Goering, political heir apparent to Hitler’s throne, and Heinrich Himmler, purportedly next in line of ascension. In their stead a seeming anomaly, and long misunderstood historical event, occurred, in which Admiral Doenitz, with no apparent political leanings and no political following, mysteriously took over the reins of German government from Adolf Hitler. Bormann had shrewdly negotiated with Doenitz the now hollow leadership of all Germany in exchange for a place on the U-boat he knew was leaving for Japan with its belly full of the power of the future, which to a large extent Bormann had made possible. From the bunker Bormann made his final arrangements to reach Doenitz at his U-boat headquarters. The web was being woven. The fortune from I.G. Farben and additional funds that Bormann had camouflaged through a variety of financial instruments and then had surreptitiously exported into banks and businesses around the world silently awaited him once he was free of Germany. Agreement by the United States to allow his escape and to protect him from the justice sure to be demanded by Nazi victims following the war appears to have already been achieved. The arrangement would ensure his life-long freedom in the post-war world, paid for with the atomic bomb.

The accepted history also acknowledges these passengers were whisked away to Washington for interrogation and the cargo was quickly commandeered for use else where. The traditional history even concedes two Japanese officers were onboard U-234 and that they committed a form of unconventional Samu rai suicide rather than be captured by their enemies. The traditional history denies, however, the uranium on board U-234 was enriched and therefore easily usable in an atomic bomb. The accepted history asserted there was no evidence the uranium cargo of U-234 was transferred into the Manhattan Project (although recent admissions acknowledged this occurred). And the traditional history asserts the bomb components on board U-234 arrived too late to be included in the atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan. Before U-234 landed at Portsmouth – before it even left Europe – United States and British intelligence knew U-234 was on a mission to Japan and that it carried important passengers and cargo.4 A portion of the cargo, especially, was of a singular nature. According to U-234’s chief radio operator, Wolfgang Hirschfeld, who witnessed the loading of the U-boat: The most important and secret item of cargo, the uranium oxide, which I believe was highly radioactive, was loaded into one of the vertical steel tubes one morning in February, 1945. Two Japanese officers were to travel aboard U-234 on the voyage to Tokyo: Air Force Colonel Genzo Shosi, an aeronautical engineer, and Navy Captain Hideo Tomonaga, a submarine architect who, it will be recalled, had arrived in France aboard U-180 about eighteen months previously with a fortune in gold for the Japanese Embassy in Berlin.

I saw these two officers seated on a crate on the forecasting engaged in painting a description in black characters on the brown paper wrapping gummed around each of a number of containers of uniform size. At the time I didn’t see how many containers there were, but the Loading Manifest showed ten. Each case was a cube, possibly steel and lead, nine inches along each side and enormously heavy. Hirschfeld’s straightforward account of the uranium being “highly radioactive” – he later witnessed the storage tubes being tested positively with Geiger counters6 – and labeled 𝔲_(Z3)ζ^(′′) provides profoundly important information about this cargo. U²³⁵ is the scientific designation of enriched uranium – the type of uranium required to fuel an atomic bomb. While the uranium remained a secret from all but the highest levels within the United States until after the surrender of U-234, a captured German Enigma encoder/decoder had allowed the Western Allies to decode intercepted German radio transmissions. Some of these captured signals had already identified the U-boat as being on a special mission to Japan and even identified General Kessler and much of his cortège as likely to be onboard, but the curious uranium was never mentioned. The strictest secrecy was maintained, nonetheless, around the U-boat. Press representatives may be permitted to interview officers and men of German submarines that surrender. This message applies only to submarines that surrender. It does not apply to other prisoners of war. It does not apply to prisoners of the U-234. Prisoners of the U-234 must not be interviewed by press representatives.7 Two days later, while the Sutton was steaming toward Portsmouth with U-234 at her side, more orders were received. “Documents and personnel of U-234 are most important and any and all doubtful personnel should be sent here,”8 the commander of naval operations in Washington, D.C. ordered. The same day, the commander in chief of the Navy instructed, “Maintain prisoners U-234 incommunicado and send them under Navy department representative to Washington for interrogation.”9 The effort to keep U-234 under wraps was only partially successful. Reporters had been allowed to interview prisoners from previous U-boats, and, in fact, were allowed to interview captured crews from succeeding U-boats, as well. When the press discovered U-234 was going to be off limits, a cry and hue went up that took two days to settle.

On23May, the cargo manifest of U-234 was translated,12 quickly triggering a series of events. On the second page of the manifest, halfway down the page, was the entry ^(𝔞)10 cases, 560 kilograms, uranium oxide.” Whoever first read the entry and understood the frightening capabilities and potential purpose of uranium must have been stunned. Certainly questions were asked. Was this the first shipment of uranium to Japan or had others already slipped by? Did the Japanese have the capacity to use it? Could they build a bomb? Whatever the answers, within four days personnel from the Office of Naval Intelligence had brought U-234’s second watch officer, Karl Pfaff – who had not been brought to Washington with the original batch of high-level prisoners but who had overseen loading of the U-boat in Germany – to Washington and interrogated him. They quickly radioed Portsmouth: The identification that the uranium was stowed in gold-lined cylinders and that it would become “sensitive and dangerous” when unpacked provides persuasive substantiation that this was U²³⁵ – enriched uranium – and not natural uranium. Uranium that has had its proportion of the isotope U²³⁵ increased compared to the more common isotope of uranium, U²³⁸ , is known as enriched uranium. When that enrichment becomes 70 percent or above it is bomb-grade uranium. The process of enriching uranium during the war was highly technical and very expensive – it still is. Upon first reading the uranium on board U-234 was stored in goldlined cylinders, this author tracked down Clarence Larsen, former director of the leading uranium enrichment process at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the Manhattan Project’s uranium enrichment facilities were housed. In a telephone conversation I asked Mr. Larsen what, if anything, would be the purpose of shipping uranium in gold-lined containers.14 Mr. He explained that, because uranium enrichment was a very costly process, enriched uranium needed to be protected jealously; but because it is very corrosive, it is easily invaded by any but the most stable materials, and would then become contaminated.

To prevent loss to contamination of the invaluable enriched uranium, gold was used. Gold is one of the most stable substances on earth. While expensive, Mr. Larsen explained, the cost of gold was a drop in the bucket compared to the value of enriched uranium. Would natural uranium, rather than enriched uranium, also be stored in gold containers? I asked. Not likely, Mr. Larsen responded. The value of natural uranium is, and was at the time, inconsequential compared to the cost of gold. Assuming the Germans invested roughly the same amount of money as the Manhattan Project to enrich their uranium, which it appears they did,15 the cost of the U²³⁵ on board the submarine was somewhere in the neighborhood of $100, 000 an ounce – in 1945 dollars – by far the most expensive substance on earth. The fact the enriched uranium had the capacity to deliver world dominance to the first country that processed and used it made it priceless. A long voyage with the U²³⁵ stowed in anything but gold could have cost the German/Japanese atomic bomb program dearly in contaminated enriched uranium. Further inquiries revealed gold was not only good for withstanding the corrosive characteristics of uranium but added a secondary benefit as a logical choice for protection from a nuclear chain reaction within the enriched uranium, as well.16 While not the greatest of insulators from a chain reaction, gold absorbs neutrons at a relatively efficient rate. This is helpful especially for chain reaction-prone thermal neutrons that are often created when a neutron passes through water – a constant occurrence in the open mine tubes of a submarine, which is where the uranium tubes were stored. Neutrons passing freely through the cylinders could potentially have started a nuclear reaction. So besides shielding the uranium from contamination, the gold shield would also have helped insulate it from going critical. In addition to the gold-lined shipping containers corroborating Hirschfeld’s identification of the uranium as U²³⁵ , the description for handling the cargo and of the uranium’s characteristics when its containers were opened also indicates the uranium was enriched and not natural uranium. Uranium of all kinds is not only corrosive, but it is toxic if swallowed. In its natural state, however, which is 99.3 percent U²³⁸ , the substance poses little threat to man as long as he does not eat it.

The stock of natural uranium eventually was processed by the Manhattan Project originally had been stored in steel drums and was sitting in the open at a Staten Island storage facility.17 Much of the German natural uranium discovered in salt mines at the end of the war also was stored in steel drums, many of them broken open. The material was loaded into heavy paper sacks and carried from the storage area to waiting trucks by apparently unprotected G.I.s.18 Since then, more precautions have been taken in handling natural uranium, but at the time, caution was minimal and natural uranium was considered to be relatively safe.19 For the Navy, therefore, to note the uranium would become “sensitive and dangerous” when the containers were opened, and should be “handled like crude TNT,” is another indicator the uranium was, in fact, enriched. Uranium enriched significantly in U²³⁵ produces a much higher level of alpha radiation than natural uranium. Alpha radiation alone, however, is not harmful; it is barely powerful enough to penetrate the dead layer of skin all humans carry. This, in and of itself, poses no threat. Opening multiple containers each holding sub-critical amounts of enriched uranium in close proximity to one another, therefore, could raise the quantity of free neutrons available from the combined U²³⁵ to approach a critical state, and possibly initiate a slow chain reaction and the gamma radiation that would be released with it. Preventing such a potential health hazard would be handled with appropriate caution, such as warning against opening the containers, and that the contents would be “sensitive and dangerous” when opened, as the communiqué described. Detractors to the suggestion the uranium on board U-234 was enriched argue that warning the uranium was “sensitive and dangerous” referred to it being pyrophoric, not radioactive. Pyrophoria describes substances that have the capacity of self combusting. The phenomenon occurs when uranium has been reduced to its metal form and then ground or otherwise converted to a fine grain, then exposed to oxygen. The Manhattan Project intentionally converted its enriched uranium from tetraflouride form – its condition when processed through the beta calutrons – to tri-oxide for the express purpose of putting it in a stable ceramic state. The process is simple enough and certainly one the Germans would follow given the potential for disaster had they not.

It is absurd to think they would ship 560 kilos of highly pyrophoric material of any kind anywhere, much less highly-valued uranium on a submarine loaded with near priceless cargo and intellectual capital in the form of important human beings, when this condition could be simply and inexpensively overcome. This is borne out by the fact literally every other reference to German uranium available – whether in the Salzburg mines, pitchblende from Joachimsthal or barrels bought from Union Miniére, states it was in oxide form. Detractors to the enriched uranium idea forward other arguments against it, as well, such as if the uranium was highly enriched the gold lining in the cylinders would have melted. They assume this because of assumptions made in turn by Wolfgang Hirschfeld that the uranium was gamma radioactive.20 Hirschfeld reported witnessing high radiation readings when the tubes were checked with Geiger counters. He reasoned the uranium was highly radioactive because it was exposed in a reactor, creating gamma radiation. Those who have tried to negate his testimony have nevertheless adopted his erroneous reasoning – and a resulting non sequitur. They denounce the high levels of radiation report by citing the fact Germany had no reactors, which is true, and therefore there could be no high radiation levels, which is untrue. “That the gold would melt if enriched uranium was stored in it is a croc,” responded Dr. Delmar Bergen, retired director of the Nuclear Weapons Program at Los Alamos. He explained that his program used highly neutron-absorbing cadmium, which is 40 times more efficient absorbing neutrons than gold, but that it did not produce enough heat to cause the cadmium to melt. “Gold would be even less prone to melt,” assured Dr. Bergen. But just as salient, there is no reason whatever the enriched uranium would have been exposed in a reactor. The two technologies are totally independent of one another. Although fueling a reactor with enriched uranium allows engineers to design a reactor that is much less complicated, a reactor will function without enriched uranium. On the other hand, reactors are not used in any way to create enriched uranium, and the fact Germany had no operating reactors is immaterial to the discussion. The traditionalists also forward the charge Germany had no production-level uranium enrichment plants, but, as shall be seen in a future chapter, this is also proven to be false.

In any case, while some gamma radiation results from natural alpha decay, this would not be life threatening and would not need shielding. On the other hand, risk of an inadvertent chain reaction is the key danger. Gold was a reasonable insulator to help shield neutrons, being 100 times more efficient at capturing thermal neutrons than lead. And turning the tables, a question for the detractors is, if the uranium was not enriched, why use gold-lined cylinders in the first place? Detractors always avoid a reasonable explanation of their own for the gold, while trying to explain away the most logical conclusion made from it – that the uranium was enriched. The reference to handling the containers of uranium in the same way TNT should be handled is apropos, as well. One of the basic rules for handling packaged TNT is to ensure large quantities are not stored in close proximity to one another, in order to avoid an accidental explosion of one batch igniting additional batches, and thus creating a catastrophic event. This aligns with one of the basic rules of handling enriched uranium, which requires that quantities approaching critical mass are not stored in close proximity to one another, in order to avoid creating a chain reaction – either causing irradiation or explosion. Other handling precautions for both substances have similar correlations. Lieut. Comdr. Karl B Reese USNR, Lieut ( JG) Edward P McDermott USNR and Major John E Vance CE USA will report to commandant May 30^(th) Wednesday in connection with cargo U-234. It is contemplated that shipment will be made by ship to ordnance investigation laboratory NAVPOWFAC Indian Head Maryland if this is feasible.22 The order, dispatched by the commander of naval operations, is revealing if not outright startling for the selection of one member of its three-man team. Including Major Vance of the Army Corps of Engineers – and ultimately, if certain documents to be shared momentarily prove Major Vance to be a member of the Manhattan Project’s intelligence team – in what was otherwise an all Navy operation, seems a telling selection.

The transcript is of a conversation between Manhattan Project intelligence officers Smith and Traynor and was recorded two weeks after “Major Vance” was assigned to the team responsible for unloading the material captured on U-234. Smith: I just got a shipment in of captured material and there were 39 drums and 70 wooden barrels and all of that is liquid. What I need is a test to see what the concentration is and a set of recommendations as to disposal.

U-234’s cargo manifest reveals that, besides its uranium, among its cargo were 10 “bales” of drums and 50 “bales” of barrels. The barrels are noted in the manifest to have contained benzyl cellulose, a very stable substance24 that may have been used as a biological shield from radiation or as a coolant or moderator in a liquid reactor. 25 The manifest lists the drums as containing “confidential material.” As surprising as it may seem, this secret substance appears to have been the “water” Major Smith noted in his discussion with Major Traynor, for nowhere on the German manifest is water listed. Why would water be described as “confidential material?” Why would Major Smith want the water tested?

Why would water be described as “confidential material?” Why would Major Smith want the water tested? And what did he mean when he said that its concentration ranged “from 10 to 85 percent and we want to know which and what”? The leaders of the German project to breed plutonium had decided to use heavy water, or deuterium oxide, as the moderator for a plutonium-breeding liquid reactor. The procedure of creating heavy water results in regular water molecules picking up an additional hydrogen atom. The percentage of water molecules with the extra hydrogen represents the level of concentration of the heavy water. Thus Major Smith’s seemingly overzealous concern about water and his question about concentration is predictable, and even expected, if Smith suspected the material was intended for a nuclear reactor. In using heavy water as a major element of their plutonium breeding reactor project, it is easy to see why the Germans labeled the drums “confidential material.” The evidence indicates that U-234 – if the captured cargo being tested by “Vance” was from U-234, which seems very probable given all of the details – carried components for making not only a uranium bomb, but a plutonium bomb, also. Further corroborating the connection of the barrels and drums as those taken from U-234 is a handwritten note found in the United States’ Southeast national archives held at East Point, Georgia.26 Dated 16 June 1945, two days after Smith’s and Traynor’s telephone conversation, the note described how 109 barrels and drums – the exact total given in the Smith/Traynor transcript – were to be tested with Geiger counters to determine if they were radioactive. The note also included instructions that an “intelligence agent cross out any markings on drums and bbls. and number them serially from 1 to 109 and make note of what was crossed out.” The note goes on to say this recommendation was given to and approved by Lt. Colonel Parsons, General Groves’ right-hand man on the military side of the Manhattan Project. And lastly, the writer of the note had called Major Smith, apparently to report back to him, leading one to believe the note’s author might have been Major Traynor. Was the captured cargo discussed by Smith and Traynor from U-234? The presence of a Mr. “Vance” who was in charge of ^(ω)U powder,” almost certainly proves so.

Using the letter “U” as an abbreviation for uranium was widespread throughout the Manhattan Project. That there could have been another “Vance” who was working with uranium powder – especially “captured” uranium powder – is improbable. And the fact the contents of the barrels listed on the U-boat manifest were identified as containing a substance likely to be used in a nuclear reactor, benzyl cellulose, and the barrels in the Smith/Traynor transcript and the untitled note – as well as the drums – were tested for radioactivity by Geiger counter, certainly links the “captured” materials to no other source than U-234. Besides linking the “captured” uranium on board U-234 to the Manhattan Project through Major Vance, another striking and important detail is revealed in the Smith/Traynor telephone transcript. The uranium is spoken of as being in “about 80 cases.” Assuming these are the same containers the uranium was shipped in, and there is good reason to believe they are, those cases would have been the same gold-lined cylinders mentioned in Navy secret cable #262151 , referred to earlier. To have distributed up to 560 kilograms of natural uranium into 80 cases – whether as stowed on U-234 by the Germans or after offloading by the Americans – does not make sound economic sense. In terms of monetary cost or in terms of space, which was at a desperately high premium inside U-234, such a distribution is perplexing. The logical option would have been to transport natural uranium in as large a quantity as reasonable for lifting and stowage, saving space and cost. To have divided 560 kilograms into 80 cases means each case weighed about seven kilograms (15.5 lbs.), not an efficient volume for shipping and handling at all. But if the uranium was enriched there would be a requirement to keep the powder separated into sub-critical quantities to avoid creating a critical mass – and the devastating nuclear chain reaction that would follow. In optimum conditions, critical mass was 15 kilograms. Stowing half of critical mass in each container, about seven kilograms – which just happens to be the amount of 560 kilos divided into 80 cases – would be a safe, and logical, quantity. But in the U-boat, due to space constraints, the containers of enriched uranium would be packed in close proximity to one another, still supporting a critical scenario. The solution: make the containers cylindrical so when tightly packed the walls would not touch on all surfaces, breaking up the mass and reducing the chance of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:30:53711b55cf7c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5113, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "about seven kilograms – which just happens to be the amount of 560 kilos divided into 80 cases – would be a safe, and logical, quantity.

The solution: make the containers cylindrical so when tightly packed the walls would not touch on all surfaces, breaking up the mass and reducing the chance of a reaction. The new-found evidence taken en mass demonstrates that, despite the traditional history, the uranium captured from U-234 was enriched uranium that was commandeered into the Manhattan Project more than a month before the final uranium slugs were assembled for the uranium bomb. The Oak Ridge records of its chief uranium enrichment effort – the magnetic isotope separators known as calutrons – show that a week after Smith’s and Traynor’s 14 June conversation, the enriched uranium output at Oak Ridge nearly doubled – after six months of straight-line output.27 Edward Hammel, a metallurgist who worked at the Chicago Met Lab and Los Alamos, where the enriched uranium was fabricated into the bomb slugs, corroborated this report of late-arriving enriched uranium. Mr. Hammel told the author very little enriched uranium was received at the laboratory until just two or three weeks – certainly less than a month – before the bomb was dropped.28 1 Wolfgang Hirschfeld and Geoffrey Brooks, Hirschfeld: The Story of A U-boat NCO 1940- 1946, pp. 198,199 2 US National Archives, Northeast Region, Waltham, Massachusetts, Navy secret dispatch #292045, U-234, Cargo Information, 30 May 1945, RG181, box 531 3 US National Archives Southeast Region, East Point, Georgia, telephone transcript titled Telephone Conversation Between Major Smith, WLO and Major Traynor, 14 June, 1945 4 US National Archives II, extract of intercepted transmission sent from Chief Inspector in Germany to Bureau of Military Operations and Military Affairs, #165, 15 April, 1945, RG 38 – 370 01/04/07 box 113 5 Wolfgang Hirschfeld and Geoffrey Brooks, Hirschfeld: The Story of A U-boat NCO 1940- 1946, pp. 198,199 6 Wolfgang Hirschfeld and Geoffrey Brooks, Hirschfeld: The Story of A U-boat NCO 1940- 1946, Appendix 7 US National Archives, Northeast Region, Waltham, Massachusetts, Navy confidential dispatch #131509, Interviewing of Prisoners, 13 May 1945, RG 181, box 531 8 US National Archives II, Navy secret dispatch #151716, (no title/subject given), 15 May 1945, RG 38 – 370 15/09/04 box 13 9 U.S. National Archives, Northeast Region, Waltham, Massachusetts, Navy Secret dispatch #151942, Disposition of U-234 Prisoners, May 15, 1945, RG 181, box 531, (the exact same text in handwritten form, dated 16 May 1945, noting “this reenciphers COMINCH’S 151942,” can be found at U.S. National Archives II, RG 38 – 370 15/09/04 box 13 US National Archives, Northeast Region, Waltham, Massachusetts, Log of Public Relations – Restricted, by Commander N.R.

He had purchased vast tracts of land in Washington state, Tennessee, New Mexico and elsewhere, engulfing hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of acres. On these reservations he built huge factories that contained the most advanced technology on the face of Earth. He made multi-million dollar deals with many of the globe’s top companies – companies like DuPont, Westinghouse, and Raytheon. To support these contracts and newly constructed facilities, he built whole towns, complete with roads, schools, postal services, banks, unions and everything else necessary to maintain a community. And he manned these municipalities with hundreds of thousands of workers and their families, including many of the greatest intellects alive. No fewer than thirteen of the physicists and chemists involved in the Manhattan Project either had already won, or later would go on to win, the Nobel Prize. The construction of an atomic bomb requires two things: enough fissile material to achieve critical mass and explode, and a trigger to start the explosion. Despite the immense investment, progress was remarkably slow on both requirements. Contrary to presently accepted history, by mid-May of 1945, neither requirement had been obtained. According to recently uncovered information from contemporaneous Manhattan Project documents – enriched uranium production charts and memos on metallurgical progress – and other never-before-revealed sources, including first-hand information revealed to the author during interviews with Manhattan Project personnel, the objectives still had not been achieved. And Groves had a third requirement that was about to make the other two points moot. Time was a factor, and it was running out.

U-234 had not been the only U-boat scheduled to voyage to Japan.4 At least one other vessel, possibly more, apparently also carried in its belly enriched uranium intended for Tokyo. Apparently, the race for the atomic bomb was much closer than most would have supposed – possibly even closer than Groves thought. After all, the General had spy Paul Rosbaud, code named “Griffin,” keeping the Allies informed of German progress and possibly even of shipments to the Island Nation. There seems to have been no such counterpart in Japan to serve Groves as a conduit. If uranium had been sent to Japan, as appears probable, Groves most likely knew through Rosbaud, but what was happening to it once it arrived there, he could only guess. Groves was not pressured by this threat alone, he also had to worry about the fact that, should the Allies’ war effort survive the German/ Japanese conspiracy, in July, Truman, Churchill and Stalin were scheduled to meet in Potsdam to partition the remnants of Europe that the Third Reich had left behind. The result of the Potsdam Conference would go a long way toward deciding the balance of power in the post-World War Two Era.5 Additionally, in the Yalta Conference held earlier in February, Stalin had already declared his intent to go to war with Japan as soon as he became unencumbered in Europe, a promise he kept in mid-August.6 Tokyo, would be powerless to stop them. “To the victor go the spoils,” and so the entire Asian landmass with all its people, resources, industry, and commerce, as well as Eastern Europe, would fall into the hands of the Soviet Union. The United States would be relegated, once again, to “also ran,” but in a much more precarious position. A demonstration of the power of “the bomb” to end the war with Japan – while circumventing Stalin’s plans in Asia and displaying to the rest of the world the United States possessed this awful weapon – would establish America as the military leader of all nations. And it would certainly impact any negotiations and the resulting geo-political complexion of the modern age.

Despite massive, sometimes reckless, always all-out spending; despite playing all the odds, even those with the slimmest chance of winning; despite assembling the greatest braintrust ever brought together in the United States; and even despite Groves’ own expansive experience and unquestioned self-confidence, the gamble appeared to be a bust. Almost $2 billion to produce just over 100 pounds of fissile material for the uranium bomb and about 30 pounds for the plutonium bomb, and a way to detonate them, had not bought enough brainpower to meet the deadline. The cost, had the effort been successful, equaled almost $100, 000 per ounce of enriched uranium – in 1945 dollars. Although the great effort had been successful enriching uranium and reducing it to its explosive metallic form, it appears over half of the hardearned material never saw a uranium bomb; it was secretly being used to fuel the huge plutonium-breeding reactors at Hanford, Washington. The reactors, fueled by the enriched uranium, would produce several orders of magnitude of more explosive plutonium than the enriched uranium they consumed, promising quicker, easier, less expensive bombs. And many more plutonium bombs could be produced than the single uranium bomb that could have been produced with the amount of enriched uranium consumed in the reactors. Jette’s calculations correspond almost precisely with and are validated by information supplied in Richard Rhodes’ book The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, in which Rhodes sets the amount of enriched uranium metal available for a uranium bomb by April 1945 as “a near critical assembly.”9 According to Rhodes’ calculations, which are based on information recorded at the time by James Bryant Conant, one of the scientific advisors on the Manhattan Project and president of Harvard University, 42 kilograms, or 92.4 pounds, of enriched uranium is equal to 2.8 critical masses. 10 One critical mass therefore, the amount barely available in mid-April with only three months of production time left, is exactly 15 kilograms, or 33 pounds, the amount Jette predicted would be available by 1 May and which Rhodes validates. In theory, one critical mass was all that was needed to make a bomb; but in reality, due to inefficiencies caused by impurities still mixed throughout the enriched uranium, the bomb actually required over three critical masses in order to achieve the level of explosion desired. Robert Serber, who wrote The Los Alamos Primer, gives the total figure for the uranium bomb at “about 50 kilograms,”11 over three times critical mass.

The American strategy for defeating Japan was to avoid facing Japan at her strongpoints where she had amassed huge armies to overrun and occupy important countries throughout the Pacific Rim. She held China, Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia. The United States instead had followed the strategy of island hopping to the Japanese homeland. This gamble avoided facing Japanese strength on Japanese terms, and instead allowed the Americans to fight smaller – but still costly – and still important strategic battles on her own terms at places like Midway, Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, and Guam as it made its way back across the Pacific to eventually attack Honshu, the Japanese main island. Honshu contained Tokyo, the Japanese government, and the greatest population of Japanese people. When Honshu was taken, the war against the Japanese would be won. But if the Soviets entered the war with Japan, they potentially could move their four million-man army across Asia on the Trans-Siberian Railroad and force a single, overwhelming attack on Honshu, jumping just a few hundred miles from Soviet soil across the Sea of Japan onto the main island. United States troops would have looked on helpless from Tinian and Guam and the other, now irrelevant, rocks they held throughout the Pacific, still over a thousand miles away, as the entire Asia/Pacific Rim and all its riches and resources fell into Soviet hands. Had this happened, the post-war world would have been a decidedly different place than we know it. The Cold War, which had left Russia consigned to controlling a few Eastern European countries – with the specter of nuclear retaliation from the United States hanging over its head if it tried to expand from there – would instead have been much more chilling for Americans and the democratic world in general. Without a demonstrated nuclear deterrent to stop them, with the United States an ocean away, it is probable the African Continent would have fallen without a struggle. The question is what would have happened to the remaining Allies in Western Europe – Britain, France and some of the smaller countries? It seems probable, with these exhausted countries already spent from their efforts in the war, with the American public tired of the war as well and unwilling to come to their aid again from across the Atlantic, they would quickly have fallen under Russian influence, too.

To sit on the sidelines of international influence, when America was just coming into its own; to allow fascist, communist or imperialistic governments to control the destiny of the world – especially of the free nations – was inconceivable. The wager was essential no matter how small the chance of winning.

Thus the United States entered the war for a chance to play the nuclear game. Now the deck almost had been played out and the clear winner was going to be its greatest future opponent. Groves from the very beginning when he took over the Manhattan Project from Colonel J.C. Marshall in September of 1942, 13 despite all his later efforts, had given the improbable scheme a small chance of success.14 Marshall had been the Manhattan, New York district engineer for the Army Corps of Engineers. He was assigned to the project shortly after Roosevelt, in late 1939¹⁵ , received the famous letter written by Albert Einstein that explained the destructive realities of nuclear energy and that the Germans were working feverishly on its unleashing. Einstein had written the letter at the behest of two renowned Hungarian physicist émigrés, Eugene Wigner and Leo Szilard. The letter was delivered personally to the president by economist and Roosevelt confidant Alexander Sachs, who read it to the president aloud in the Oval Office. But despite Roosevelt’s quick reflexes, the work moved slowly. Responding to a report by aide Vannevar Bush two years later, in the early Spring of 1942, Roosevelt – who seemed to understand the urgency of the atomic initiative better than most of his nuclear advisors – wrote emphatically, “The whole thing should be pushed not only in regard to development, but also with due regard to time. This is very much of the essence.”16 The President seems to have been the only one who understood the full gravity of the circumstances. The colonel who in the early part of the decade had overseen the construction of the great symbol of United States military might, The Pentagon, had been made a brigadier general responsible for the development of the weapon ultimately destined to guarantee that power.

Groves’ response to learning the project for which he was being recruited could single-handedly win the war speaks volumes about the size of his ego and the extent to which his experience building the Pentagon and handling a $10 billion budget as the number two man in the Corps of Engineers had alienated him from feelings of mere human dimensions. He said simply: “Oh.”18 The one thing Roosevelt did not need to worry about with Groves was wasted time. The general went to work immediately, criss-crossing the country to familiarize himself with the theory and processes and all of the research and development programs presently in progress. What he found was discouraging. First, uranium, at least at the time, was relatively rare. Experts in the United States knew of only a few light deposits of the very heavy element but were doing little to mine it. Up to that point, there had not been a lot of use for uranium except in ceramic glazes. To get what it needed, the Manhattan Project would have to go outside of the sovereign borders of the United States, or so it seemed. In a quirk of circumstance, over 1,000 tons of raw uranium ore had been sent to New York and was sitting in open steel drums in a warehouse on Staten Island. 19 The uranium had come from what Groves later identified, wrongly, as the richest uranium reserves in the world – those of the Belgian Congo – by way of Belgium and the Brussels-based company that owned the mines, Union Miniére. Union Miniére had provided rare-earth minerals for radiation studies performed by the famous French Curie family. Groves’ misstatement that the Belgian Congo held the richest uranium reserves is the leadoff in a long litany of hidden or half-truths, shaded assertions and outright lies later employed to paint a public picture decidedly different than the events that actually transpired. The details of this deception will be outlined later. Simply put, the mischaracterization is a single brushstroke – among a multitude – that makes up part of a larger picture created after-the-fact to hide the evidence that the Third Reich already had in its possession far more raw uranium than it would ever need for its purposes. The Reich held within its hands total control of the largest and most high-grade uranium ore deposit in the world, that at Joachimsthal, Czechoslovakia. The president of Union Miniére, M. Edgar Sengier, having been approached previously by agents of the German government to buy the valuable mineral stocks, carefully", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:37:2500d4129d69", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5120, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 38, "text": "of a larger picture created after-the-fact to hide the evidence that the Third Reich already had in its possession far more raw uranium than it would ever need for its purposes.

Edgar Sengier, having been approached previously by agents of the German government to buy the valuable mineral stocks, carefully avoided closing a deal with the German emissaries. Sengier knew of uranium’s ultimate possibilities. Through his dealings with the Curies he had been invited by Frederic Joliot-Curie in 1939 to help build an atomic bomb in the Sahara desert, according to General Groves’s book, Now It Can Be Told. 20 Such a fascinating revelation from Groves demands a question: Build an atomic bomb for whom? Certainly Joliot-Curie was not planning it for personal world dominion. He must have known such a project could only be accomplished at enormous cost and effort, if it was possible at all. Given later accusations regarding Joliot-Curie that show every indication of having been true, and despite his reported membership in the French resistance, it is possible he planned on consorting with the Germans. At any rate, Sengier appears to have declined that offer, as he presently did the agents’ bid for the bulk uranium stores. Instead, right under the Germans’ noses, he shipped the uranium to the United States for safekeeping. Once having made such a prudent and noble move at the potential cost of the loss of great profit for himself and his company, not to mention the threat to his physical safety that defying the Nazis could mean, he tried to make a deal with the United States to cover his lost investment. But the old Manhattan Project regime, for whatever reason, had not responded. Groves now snapped it up. Over twelve hundred tons of uranium might be enough to harvest the 110 pounds of U²³⁵ needed to make a bomb. But raw uranium ore is only the basest form of uranium. From the ore, full of a variety of polluting elements and minerals, pure uranium must be refined; a considerable process in and of itself. Then the real challenge begins: Uranium atoms, like most elements, exist in various versions called isotopes. These different versions of the atom contain the same numbers of protons and electrons, which define the element and create its characteristics, but have a different number of neutrons, which, while not changing the element’s characteristics, alter the atom’s structure and weight. The vast majority of uranium is the more stable isotope identified as U²³⁸ (U for uranium, 238 for this particular isotope’s atomic weight), which constitutes 99.3 percent of all of the uranium on earth. The remaining less-than-one percent is mostly U²³⁵ – the fissile form of uranium.

The remaining less-than-one percent is mostly U²³⁵ – the fissile form of uranium. When a U²³⁵ nucleus absorbs a passing neutron energy is absorbed, offsetting to a degree the nuclear binding power and causing the nucleus to become unstable. Often the nucleus will fracture and divide, leaving two sub-uranic elements behind. At the same time, it releases additional neutrons along with a portion of the energy that had kept the uranium nucleus bound together. This nuclear energy is by far the strongest force known to man. Although because of each atom’s minuscule measurements the energy released on a per atom basis seems like an infinitesimal force, actually, the power discharged is proportionally enormous. To appreciate the truly diminutive size of an atom, journalist Chapman Pincher has given the following scale against which the minuteness of atoms can be measured. Envision a straight pin magnified so large that its head lay in London, England and its point terminates in the country of Bangladesh, on the far side of India – a distance covering approximately one-third the circumference of the earth. The atoms of such a needle would be the size of golf balls.21 Yet according to real-world examples cited in Richard Rhodes’ book, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, the strength of the nuclear force in a single atom contains enough energy to make a grain of sand jump, a mass hundreds of thousands if not millions of times greater than that of the atom. Rhodes adds that there is enough power in one cubic meter of uranium to lift one million million kilograms (or 2.2 million million pounds) 27 miles into the air. Put another way, one pound of uranium can produce nine million kilowatt hours, for which New York City would pay about $1.2 million. Almost as soon as the first atom was split, physicists the world over realized if these great forces could be systematically released and controlled in large quantities of atoms, an enormous source of energy would be made available. On the heels of this realization came the revelation that if this energy could all be released in an instant, a super powerful explosion would occur, the likes of which had not been experienced on earth. Calculations and experiments soon proved that in properly prepared uranium, for each neutron that split a nucleus, of the many neutrons that would be released an average of two-and-a-half would hit and split other nuclei, which would split yet two more each, and so", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:39:eb2bfab7ad19", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5122, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 40, "text": "On the heels of this realization came the revelation that if this energy could all be released in an instant, a super powerful explosion would occur, the likes of which had not been experienced on earth.

In reality, the heat generated from the reactions expands the assembly until the chain reaction is broken – but not before huge amounts of energy are released. The knowledge the atom was split, along with the fact Nazi Germany was the first to uncover these cosmic secrets, is what caused Einstein, Szilard and Teller to write their famous letter of warning to Roosevelt. The great challenge of this task for all warring factions was in accumulating enough uranium that was predominantly pure U²³⁵ , and whose atoms were closely enough positioned together, so released neutrons could reach the surrounding U²³⁵ atoms and create a chain reaction. A method had to be found to virtually pluck U²³⁵ atoms one at a time from the average of 140U²³⁸ atoms surrounding each one of them and gather them together in a single body of U²³⁵ . Given the acutely minute, super-submicroscopic media to be meddled with and the overwhelming ratio of U²³⁸ to U²³⁵ , the prospects were surely daunting. For starters, almost no one in the United States had been able to technically devise how to separate U²³⁵ from raw uranium. Thus far everything was theory – with one small exception. Nobel Laureate Dr. Ernest Lawrence at the University of California in Berkeley was just in the process of developing an electro-magnetic mass separator that, using mammoth-sized magnets and hundreds of thousands of volts to power them, could separate U²³⁵ from U²³⁸ to at least a nominal degree of enrichment. Groves presumably was encouraged when he heard about the breakthrough. Traveling to Berkeley, the General entered Lawrence’s laboratory and was brought to where he could see the enriched uranium product – he was led to a microscope. Undoubtedly dumbfounded and disappointed, Groves bent over the lens to see a spec of uranium that measured 75mi - crograms of only 30 percent enriched uranium.22 For comparison, a dime weighs 2.5 million micrograms. He knew by this time the amount needed for a bomb was still a matter of theory. But estimates ranged anywhere from five pounds to 600 pounds (Manhattan Project scientists would ultimately conclude the bomb would need to be about 110 pounds) of from 80 to 90 percent enriched material.

Compared against the meager offering he was staring at through the microscope lens, the chances of producing the roughly calculated critical quantities in bulk production amounts, and in a usable time frame, were so astronomical as to be meaningless. Despite Groves’ disappointment, the perennially optimistic Lawrence assured the General what he had seen represented great strides, and that from this feeble foundation he could build a device capable of separating uranium in mass production quantities – tens of grams at a time. Groves was nonplused. They were still talking in fractions of ounces. But Lawrence’s process was the best chance he had – for everyone else so far, any kind of serious isotope separation had been impossible.23 While in Berkeley, the new-formed cradle of American nuclear research, the General also took the time to visit several other researchers, experimenters and theoreticians, and this proved to be fortuitous. He met J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man Groves would choose to direct the laboratory that would develop the United States atomic bomb. Robert Serber, a close friend and co-worker of Oppenheimer’s, in his preface to the post-war version of The Los Alamos Primer, which he originally published during the war at Oppenheimer’s request to orient newly arriving Manhattan Project personnel into the program, described Groves’ ego-emanating entrance the first time they met.24 Apparently Groves had no more than entered the room when he removed his jacket and handed it to a colonel he had “in tow,” and curtly ordered the high-ranking officer to find a laundry and get his tunic cleaned. Oppenheimer, on the other hand, was quite a different personality. He was young, ascetic, wealthy, and seemingly frail, although later events would prove him to have a great capacity for bearing physical, psychological, emotional and intellectual abuse. Oppy, as he was affectionately known by friends, was scientifically and clinically critical while at the same time embracing Far Eastern metaphysical mysticism. The paradox made him an astonishing choice for project director. The greater half of the astonishment was that Oppy was a theoretician, not an experimentalist. The new laboratory was, of necessity, going to be nothing if not overwhelmingly experimental. Oppenheimer’s lack of experimental experience caused many who coveted the position, or who otherwise had what appeared to be legitimate concerns, to cry foul. Groves would have none of it.

He had quietly grasped Oppenheimer’s unique genius, his brilliantly quick analytical and intuitive facility and a talent for exciting people about the work, and was not about to let him go. What concerned Groves more was the future lab director’s leftist connections. Not that Groves felt they were much of a hindrance to Oppy’s doing the job. But security checks had to be performed and they soon revealed that not only had Oppenheimer once been a registered member of the American Communist Party, but his wife, brother and ex-fiancé, as well, were presently members or had been members at one time. The endless pursuit by military security to rectify this apparent security breach kept Groves almost continually in a position of having to protect his chief deputy. His willingness to do so is surely a strong endorsement of Groves’ belief and confidence not only in Oppenheimer but also in his own extraordinary ability as a judge of people. The results Oppenheimer brought forth stand as an undeniable testament to the General’s ability to measure a man. What is most remarkable is that although he had considered others, Groves was 99 percent decided Oppy was his man after only one or two meetings. A month later, in November 1942, Groves and Oppenheimer, with a handful of others, were at a boys’ ranch standing atop a 7,200-foot-high plateau in New Mexico. Oppenheimer, who owned property in New Mexico and loved the vast, scenic expanses, had suggested the location over several rivals, some close by, others as far away as Utah and Washington State. As they stood under the cottonwood trees – for whose Spanish appellation the boys’ school had been named, Los Alamos – Groves consented to purchase the property as the sight for America’s new atomic bomb laboratory.25 A full four months after that, in the end of March 1943,26 the small group would finally return, accompanied by a nucleus of scientists that would ultimately grow to be one of the greatest collections of intellects ever concentrated on one task. Enrico Fermi, Emilio Segré, Hans Bethe, Otto Frisch and many others, all Los Alamos personnel during the war, were just a few of several scientists at the project who had already won or would go on to win the Nobel Prize and other top awards of science. Along with them they brought equipment commandeered from laboratories across the United States27 and a support force of almost 5000 people, many with their families.

Despite the thin chance the American effort could achieve making a bomb General Groves made an early and full commitment to the project. Before he had pinned the new general’s star on his collar (an inducement to get him to accept the Manhattan Project assignment over his preference to serve in a theater of war), before he even ran to Berkeley to find what level of scientific talent was available, Groves signed the directive that began the purchase of 59,000 acres of mostly undeveloped land in Eastern Tennessee. The complex built there would soon come to be known as Oak Ridge, and it would house most of the technologies to enrich production quantities of bomb-grade uranium28 – many of which would fail or only achieve nominal success during the war. On the site eventually would be established a gaseous diffusion isotope separation plant that would utilize hundreds of thousands of stacks of pipes in an all-but-failed effort to enrich uranium before the war was over. This plant would enclose almost 42 acres under a single roof and cost one-half billion dollars, the greatest single expenditure of the wartime program. A liquid thermal diffusion plant under the operation of the Navy would be constructed as well. By far the most successful form of isotope separation would be the electro-magnetic isotope separators pioneered by Ernest Lawrence. Groves would one day brag that every gram of U²³⁵ produced for the Manhattan Project had been processed through Oak Ridge’s magnetic isotope separators – called calutrons, after the California State University (Cal. U.) at Berkeley, where it was developed. But even with the calutrons, none of these processes were close to being viable at production-level quantities at the end of 1943. And the famous claim that all of the uranium enriched passed through the celebrated calutrons during that process has now become doubtful, based on recently discovered information. Five days less than a year after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, on 2 December 1942, Italian émigré physicist Enrico Fermi and his research team, working in an old squash court under the University of Chicago’s Stagg Field grandstand, opened another door leading to an atomic bomb. They produced the first man-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.29 The experimental reactor pile, built of over 400 tons of graphite and uranium, proved that a slow chain reaction could be achieved and controlled.

The reactor also provided the means to learn more about uranium bombarded by neutrons and how it morphs into the new element plutonium. Plutonium, as created in a reactor, fissions more readily than U²³⁵ . The bomb makers at first counted this a blessing. And plutonium had chemical characteristics that were different from other substances.30 By finding these differentiating properties, the plutonium could be separated from its parent, uranium, by chemical means, a far less expensive and comparatively easy process than the impossibly demanding physical separation procedures required to harvest one atom at a time, as was necessary to enrich uranium. There was now a second, much better option for developing an atomic bomb. Hopes were high. Everyone from Groves and Oppenheimer to Fermi and Lawrence enthused over the plutonium prospect.31 In fact, the whole object of creating a reactor pile changed from creating heat to make steam for industrial power to breeding plutonium for a bomb. Groves immediately went to work establishing a plutonium-breeding pilot reactor at Oak Ridge for experimentation, as well as beginning the procurement of property in the state of Washington for the purpose of constructing a series of plutonium breeding production reactors. The scientists, however, soon found problems with the plutonium option. Previous plutonium breeding experiments had been performed in a cyclotron that could bombard target uranium with only very small amounts of neutrons. The result was the expected transmutation of U²³⁸ to plutonium 239 (Pu²³⁹) . The comparative flood of neutrons released in a chain reacting pile needed to produce bomb-size volumes of plutonium, however, placed the parent U²³⁸ awash in free neutrons. Because of the much greater density of free neutrons, there was a small percentage, perhaps as much as 10 percent of the final product, that morphed the next step to plutonium 240 (Pu²⁴⁰) . The much faster fission rate of Pu²⁴⁰ − 100 million times faster than that of U²³⁵ or Pu²³⁹ – made the triggering mechanism of the uranium bomb impractical for the plutonium weapon. The latter two isotopes fission slowly enough that to assemble a critical mass one needed simply shoot one sub-critical piece of material into another piece with a high-velocity cannon. The pieces would come together to achieve critical mass at about 3,000 feet per second. The result, a nuclear explosion.

Appropriately, given later physics history – or perhaps inevitably – Klaproth was German. In the century and a half between Klaproth’s discovery and the splitting of the first atom – a uranium atom – little happened with the element. In the small amounts it could be found, uranium was considered relatively rare, although it has since been discovered in varying quantities in almost all geographic regions on earth. Prior to the effort to build a bomb, however, uranium was used almost exclusively as a pigment in ceramic glazes; no one could devise any other practical use for it. But when the first atom was split at the end of 1938, the whole world changed. Advances in physics, particularly the effort to understand the makeup of the atom, had physicists and radiochemists across the globe experimenting with uranium, the natural world’s largest atom. As a result, the first atom was split, quite by accident, by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, two Germans at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physics in Berlin. Hahn and Strassmann – both radiochemists not physicists – did not immediately realize what they had achieved. They had been bombarding uranium with slow neutrons expecting its transmutation to other isotopes of uranium or other heavy elements. But the result of their experiment showed, along with isotopes of uranium, of which U²³⁸ is the most common, evidence of traces of barium were present as well, which has an atomic mass slightly larger than half of uranium’s mass. At first neither scientist could reckon how the atomic weight had been cut in half. The cleaving of an atom, with its powerful internal force holding it together, was considered impossible and splitting the atom had never crossed their minds. The pair assumed they had not carried out their experiments correctly; but careful checks using control samples they knew were pure proved they had not contaminated the experiment with material already containing barium. Only then did they consider the impossible may have happened.

Only then did they consider the impossible may have happened. Hahn wrote his former co-worker, Lise Meitner, an Austrian-born Jew who, now in her 60s, had over 40 years experience in radiochemistry and a native genius for diagnosing chemical and nuclear puzzles. On Christmas Eve, while contemplating during a holiday at the seaside in Sweden the remarkable events described in Hahn’s letter, her nephew and fellow researcher Otto Frisch visited Meitner. Frisch would later be the one who coined the term “fission”1 – borrowed from the microbiology lexicon and which describes the dividing of living cells – as the moniker for the splitting of atoms. He would also shortly immigrate to the United States and perform the famous, and very dangerous, critical mass experimental studies on uranium at Los Alamos known as “tickling the tail of the dragon.” Meitner and Frisch discussed how it could be possible barium should come from uranium. In the course of considering several possibilities, they contemplated the puzzle in the light of Niels Bohr’s new model of the nucleus – not a collection of tightly bound neutrons and protons, but “freely” bound neutrons and protons. They reasoned that, although the nuclear force holding these components together is undoubtedly the strongest on earth – even though active for extremely small distances only – each proton in the nucleus contains a small electrical force of its own that counters, to a degree, that nuclear force. As the nucleus of each element in ascending order contains one or more additional protons than the previous element, by the time uranium – the natural element with the most protons of all, at 92 – is reached, the countering force of the cumulative protons is barely less than the total nuclear force. The scientists realized this would explain why there are no more natural elements beyond uranium – because the accumulated electrical force of the extra protons in an atom larger than uranium would counter the atomic force to a point where the nucleus is no longer able to hold itself together. Any elements beyond uranium must have disintegrated to other elements earlier in earth’s history. But the uranium nucleus holds together barely, the opposing forces causing the sub-nuclear particles to float “loosely” around one another in a fluid form.

The unstable geometric construction of a U²³⁵ atom, particularly, when struck by the energy of a neutron, theoretically starts the nucleus “wobbling,” becoming narrower in the middle. The nuclear force in each of the two outer lobes immediately takes control and parses off the lobes into independent, non-uranic spheres of their own – one of them barium. Thus Meitner and Frisch explained, and therefore validated, Hahn’s and Strassmann’s discovery – and set in motion with their explanation the fearful, surreal absurdity that would become man’s future. For Meitner also calculated the nuclear reaction after the split, caused by the repulsion of the protons in each nucleus pushing away from each other at one-thirtieth the speed of light, would generate about 200 million electron volts of energy per atom.2 In comparison, the strongest of chemical reactions such as a dynamite explosion, produces a very paltry five electron volts. Hahn had written not only Lise Meitner on that fateful December night, he had also contacted Paul Rosbaud, the editor of Germany’s foremost scientific publication, Naturwissenschaften. 3 Rosbaud would soon come to be known in Allied intelligence circles as The Griffin, the codename assigned him upon joining the ranks of Germans spying for the Allies. Those he spied upon almost certainly included two unheralded scientists, Baron Manfred von Ardenne and Fritz Houtermans. Ardenne and Houtermans later would develop a uranium enrichment process that, by all accounts, was superior to the Manhattan Project’s calutrons and was surely the basis for Germany’s successful uranium enrichment efforts. Rosbaud was particularly close to Houtermans. Many of Rosbaud’s activities are recorded in Arnold Kramisch’s excellent book, The Griffin. But despite Rosbaud’s close friendship with Houtermans’, in his book he never mentions Ardenne – or Houtermans’ multi-year employment at Ardenne’s laboratory – which certainly seems telling considering what the two men accomplished. Presumably, General Groves received Rosbaud’s reports through the United States/British intelligence master, Sir William Stephenson, and therefore known on an ongoing basis what was the condition of his nemesis’ program. Statements the General made during the war indicating he often thought the enemy was a year or two ahead of the United States’ program can, therefore, probably be considered accurate. If they were, assertions made by General Groves after the war indicating he had been wrong in this conclusion were surely designed to divert attention from the German isotope separation program.

This would appear to demonstrate the Germans had failed and the Americans alone succeeded in the nuclear race. At any rate, on Hahn’s request, Rosbaud had agreed to hold space in the next issue of his journal for an upcoming paper Hahn promised to prepare by print time. The article not only ran in early January 1939, quickly spreading the news throughout the global scientific community, but Frisch returned to work with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen after his Christmas holiday with Meitner and told “The Great Dane,” as he was affectionately called, of their theory.4 Bohr responded before Frisch had hardly finished explaining, gasping, “Oh what idiots we have all been! Oh but this is wonderful! This is just as it must be.” The Great Dane left Denmark within a week of this revelation on a previously planned trip to the United States to work for a short period at the Institute for Advanced Study. Once there, he was instrumental in disseminating the news to the rest of the world. Then the new discovery’s ultimate outcome was calculated – that a nuclear chain reaction might be created. Szilard and Teller, quickly recognizing the unthinkable possibilities, contacted Einstein, who wrote his famous letter to Roosevelt in response to such a prospect. The taking of one life would have been a small matter and a futile action, however. The nuclear door had been opened and could never be closed again. Despite later and persistent claims that Germany put little effort – and that erring – into the development of an atomic bomb, quite the opposite actually occurred. As a nation with a disciplined, precise and loyal nationalistic character and a tradition of cultivating the ultimate in technology, under the rule of a dictator with a fetish for innovative armaments and a commitment to using them, Germany was already on the verge of waging war using the most technically-advanced fighting machine ever. The airplanes, tanks and submarines of Blitzkrieg were unsurpassed and it would be years before the Allies equaled the armaments of the Third Reich. During the course of the war, Hitler added rocketry, silent electric torpedoes and jets to his arsenal, none of which were matched by any other belligerent nation during the course of the conflict.

In truth, on the whole, German weaponry was probably never equaled during the war. Many experts maintain Germany lost World War Two directly because of strategic blunders committed by Adolf Hitler and little else. With a superior technical culture, a lead on the field, and many of the best scientists available – all at the behest of a madman well-established to have a penchant for ingenious and decisive weaponry – it certainly would be expected that Germany would run hard in the nuclear arms race and would break out of the gate first. The idea accepted wholesale in the traditional history, that German efforts to produce the deciding weapon of the war, an atomic bomb, were vapid, poorly executed, uninspired projects, runs wholly counter to the character of the regime and the Germanic race and culture. To this day, in a world of global technological parity, Germany is still looked up to as a scientific and technical leader of the world. According to author/historian David Irving, in his book, The German Atomic Bomb, the post-war criticism of Germany’s supposedly insipid effort to create an atomic bomb is both inaccurate and unwarranted.6 Irving cites some 50 German scientists7 toiled night and day throughout the war, in both plutonium breeding and uranium separation efforts, many of which achieved high levels of success. And Irving adds that those who spread the misinformation about these scientific efforts should have known better; they knew the story and had all of the documentation. This contrasts with the official history stating only a handful of half-hearted German scientists working on an impotent reactor pile intended, but failed, to breed plutonium. Such is the story promoted by General Groves and the Manhattan Project’s intelligence arm, Alsos (Greek for “grove,” Alsos was the codename given the Manhattan Project’s enemy information gathering function). By the summer of 1939, scant months after Hahn’s and Strassmann’s discovery had been published, the German Army had established a uranium project in Gottow, near Berlin, with Dr. Kurt Diebner at its head.8 By the time war broke out a few months later, Germany was the only country studying the use of atomic power for military means, and it pushed forward with vigor. By contrast, the United States’ efforts stalled and were not to be purposefully pursued until General Groves was appointed head of the program almost two and one-half years later, near the end of 1942.

A first secret conference on atomic power was held in Berlin on September 16, 1939.9 Most of the Reich’s top nuclear scientists soon afterward were inducted into the army – an action Groves would later seriously consider for the American program but was convinced otherwise by Oppenheimer – and assigned to laboratories throughout the Fatherland to study nuclear fission for military uses. The first laboratory, in Dahlem, near Berlin, was established and called “The Virus House,”10 a name concocted as a ruse to cultivate an atmosphere of fear around the facility and thus drive off unwanted observers. Despite later assertions, the Third Reich very soon had on hand copious amounts of raw, as well as very highly refined, uranium, and controlled a great deal more – almost a limitless supply for its needs. The first ton of “extremely pure” uranium oxide was delivered in the first weeks of 1940.11 This had already been refined from the raw uranium ore and was, for all intents and purposes, ready to be used for experimentation – or for enriching to bomb grade as soon as the technology could be developed. As early as the Summer of 1941, according to historian Margaret Gowing, Germany had already refined 600 tons of uranium to its oxide form, the form required for ionizing the material into a gas, in which form the uranium isotopes could then be magnetically or thermally separated or the oxide could be reduced to metal for a reactor pile. In fact, Professor Dr. Riehl, who was responsible for all uranium throughout Germany during the course of the war, says the figure was actually much higher, which it proved to be. In addition, the Nazi program was extracting one ton per month of uranium oxide from separate ore stocks left over from a commercial venture following a previous extraction of radium to be used in German toothpaste! To create either a uranium or a plutonium bomb, at some point uranium must be reduced to metal. In the case of plutonium, U²³⁸ is metalicized; for a uranium bomb, U²³⁵ is metalicized. Because of uranium’s difficult characteristics, however, this metallurgical process is a tricky one. The United States struggled with the problem early and still was not successful reducing uranium to its metallic form in large production quantities until late in 1942. The German technicians, however, true to their whiz-kid reputations, by the end of 1940 had already processed 280.6 kilograms of uranium into metal, over a quarter of a ton.

The German technicians, however, true to their whiz-kid reputations, by the end of 1940 had already processed 280.6 kilograms of uranium into metal, over a quarter of a ton. From June of 1940 to the end of the war, Germany seized 3,500 tons of uranium compounds from Belgium – almost three times the amount Groves had purchased from Union Miniére – and stored it in salt mines in Stassfurt, Germany.12 Groves brags that on 17 April 1945, as the war was winding down, Alsos recovered some 1,100 tons of uranium ore from Stassfurt and an additional 31 tons in Toulouse, France, as well as eight tons of refined oxide from the Stassfurt mines.13 And he claims the amount recovered was all Germany had ever held; asserting, therefore, that Germany had never had enough raw material to process the uranium either for a plutonium reactor pile or through isotope separation techniques. If Stassfurt once held 3,500 tons and only 1,130 were recovered, however, some 2,370 tons of uranium ore was unaccounted for. Thus twice the amount the Manhattan Project possessed and is assumed to have used throughout its entire wartime effort – and a quantity certainly far in excess of the amount Germany would have used for experimental needs – was unaccounted for. This has been borne out in spades by the history-shattering discovery in the summer of 2011 of more than 126,000 barrels of Nazi spent uranium – the used uranium left over from an enrichment process – announced by Germany’s ASSE regulatory commission.14 Not even mentioned in the U.S. press, the news caused major headlines throughout Germany as its Greenpeace counterpart raised the concern of nuclear contamination. The uranium resides over 2,000 feet deep in an abandoned and “crumbling” salt mine outside of Hanover. One gallon of uranium weighs approximately 150 pounds. If each barrel was 40 gallons, a logical size to assume, each barrel of uranium would weigh about 6,000 pounds. Multiplied by 126,000 barrels, the store reasonably contains 756,000,000 – yes, million – pounds of spent uranium equaling 378,000 tons. It also blasts the long-asserted proclamation the Nazi program never enriched production quantities of uranium. And with the other revelations revealed herein, even while historians try to claim it cannot be true because “everyone knows” the Nazis had no means of enriching uranium, it proves the chief assertion of Critical Mass, that the Nazis provided enriched uranium for the United States’ Atomic Bomb.

Dr. Werner Heisenberg headed the plutonium bomb effort for Germany. As with the United States program, the Germans early realized the benefits of a plutonium bomb over a uranium explosive.15 They knew plutonium could be bred from uranium and separated chemically much easier, faster and less costly than the isotopes of uranium could be separated from one another. In addition, because the plutonium fission process was three times more powerful than uranium’s, theoretically, to make an equal-size bomb only one-third the amount of plutonium was required. Heisenberg’s efforts ran into a roadblock, however, when, in 1940, his co-worker Dr. Walther Bothe seriously miscalculated the neutron absorption rate of graphite, 16 which the researchers thought to use as a moderator to prevent any experimental chain reaction from becoming ungovernable and causing a meltdown. The error proved to have a profound impact on the success of the German plutonium project. In want of an alternate moderator, the scientists turned to deuterium oxide17 – heavy water – an isotope of common water but with an additional neutron. The new requirement for heavy water, a rare substance not found in nature but requiring long amounts of time to process, would ultimately resign the German plutonium effort to – not failure, a chain reaction was eventually achieved – but to second place behind the American plutonium project.18 The carbon miscalculation combined with the shortage of heavy water constituted the failure of the Germans to build a plutonium bomb, which proved later to be the perfect screen behind which General Groves hid Germany’s other atomic bomb effort, uranium isotope separation. As seems to have happened at almost every serious juncture, the two nations’ programs followed parallel thinking and parallel processes. But General Groves and others – for reasons probably necessary at the time – have buried the history of the German uranium enrichment effort. Desiring after the war to destroy the evidence of German uranium isotope separation, for reasons to be reviewed later, the General de-emphasized the Nazi uranium enrichment effort until its historic profile was small enough to be hidden safely behind the failed plutonium picture. General Groves does not appear to be the only person after the war to distort the facts of this episode to suit his purposes. Professor Heisenberg and others, purportedly desiring to divest themselves of what they said was the undeserved stigma of working on an atomic bomb for the Nazis, but in reality desiring to hide their failure to build a nuclear reactor despite great and earnest efforts, decided to inculcate the fantasy, as", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:53:9e553b1ec7d4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5136, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 54, "text": "safely behind the failed plutonium picture.

Professor Heisenberg and others, purportedly desiring to divest themselves of what they said was the undeserved stigma of working on an atomic bomb for the Nazis, but in reality desiring to hide their failure to build a nuclear reactor despite great and earnest efforts, decided to inculcate the fantasy, as well – and successfully did so, possibly in collusion with Groves. Heisenberg later contended he and others of his staff had innocuously but bravely resisted their fascist government. He insisted he did not believe at the time the making of an atomic bomb to be a possibility at all, but had acted as though it were in order to keep the Nazis happy and distracted.19 The professor assured those who would listen he had been resisting and subverting the objectives of the Nazi regime by monopolizing the invaluable services of some of the Reich’s greatest men of science, who might otherwise have been forced to put their efforts to use for Hitler in projects more productive to the Fuehrer’s purposes. In reality Heisenberg, like most scientists of his bent and professional stature, not only could not resist the pursuit of his science for the sheer inducement of discovering what lay around the next cosmic corner, but he did indeed believe a nuclear blast initiated by man was possible. He had admitted to Manfred von Ardenne20 and to Niels Bohr, before the latter had escaped Denmark upon its occupation by the Nazis, that he thought an atomic bomb was possible21 – even though Bohr, himself, at this time, did not believe such an explosion would ever be achieved. Heisenberg tried to explain away this statement after the war as having been misunderstood by the Danish Nobel Laureate; but the Great Dane was certainly convinced he had understood correctly what had been said. And the fact Heisenberg had asserted the same thing to Ardenne supports Bohr’s claim. Developers of the American plutonium project realized relatively latein-the-game they had a problem with triggering the plutonium bomb. Up to that time, they had given the plutonium program their prime effort and resources. On the other hand, serious doubts about the success of the German plutonium program came early because of the heavy water crisis, forcing the Nazis from almost the very beginning to concentrate their efforts, resources and expectations on isotope separation to enrich uranium. By virtue of this fact alone, one would expect the German isotope separation program demanded more focus and would have been more successful than the plutonium effort, and would not have been left completely unpursued, as is asserted.

Conant, one of the civilian administrators of the Manhattan Project and a personal confidant of Roosevelt, reported to the president the Germans “might be ahead of us by as much as a year.”24 Considering British spy Paul Rosbaud’s position in the midst of the German effort, one can assume Conant got this estimate from good sources. In fact, the estimate may have understated Germany’s lead. By this time, Germany already had at least five, and possibly as many as seven, serious isotope separation development programs underway. From among these devices, three very innovative technologies were being pioneered, beginning with Dr. Erich Bagge’s “isotope sluice” and a similar machine constructed by a Dr. Korsching. Before the middle of 1944, Bagge’s isotope sluice would enrich uranium on a single pass to four times that achieved in the United States using gaseous diffusion, 25 which is alleged to be the United States’ saving technology. While earlier Ernest Lawrence’s experimental cyclotron at the University of California in Berkley produced only 100 micrograms of “partially separated” uranium,26 Bagge’s experimental isotope sluice had yielded 2.5 grams of “much enriched” uranium.27 More than likely, the German program was well ahead of the Manhattan Project’s efforts. Had the Germans actually enriched uranium on a large-scale basis, and there now is ample evidence they did, they may have used a multi-stage technique, as the Americans had. The American effort used a procedure that passed already-enriched uranium through enrichment processes a second or third time to further increase the level of U235 concentration to levels up in the high eighty and low ninety percentiles required for a bomb. In America, gaseous diffusion and thermal diffusion are supposed to have saved the bomb enrichment program in the waning days of the separation effort by providing those needed, partially enriched feedstocks to Lawrence’s beta calutrons in the final hour. Oak Ridge records discovered by the author and reviewed later in this book, however, contradict this assertion; although the calutron process did run product through the system multiple times. One may assume the German effort followed a similar obvious path, as so often happened between the two programs, and that the product of the isotope sluice – or any of the other separation technologies – might therefore have been used as feedstocks for one of the other four separation techniques the Germans were refining. The isotope sluice was not the strongest of the Nazis’ separation efforts.

The isotope sluice was not the strongest of the Nazis’ separation efforts. A stronger performer was the centrifuge, and then its progeny, the ultracentrifuge. A special alloy called “Bondur” had already been developed in 1941 specifically designed to handle the harsh, corrosive uranium compounds used in the ultracentrifuge.28 The United States’ isotope separation effort, on the other hand, struggled to find a similar material that would serve well against the corrosive uranium gases. By May 1944, the American production efforts operating at their highest efficiency resulted in enriching uranium from its raw state of .7 percent to about 10 to 12 percent on the first pass. By comparison, the first German experimental ultracentrifuge trials resulted in enriching the material to seven percent.29 The experimental result was less than American production efforts and what had been predicted by its German inventors, but it was a good showing for its first experimental outing compared to what the Manhattan Project produced from its already-tweaked production model calutrons. Ultracentrifuge initial output was so impressive, in fact, that following its very first experimental run funding and authority were established to build ten production model ultracentrifuges in Kandern, a town in the southwest of Germany far from the fighting. When Allied bombing became continuous in the north, many separation processes had been moved south; Bagge’s isotope sluice went to Hechingen and the 10 ultracentrifuges went to Kandern, located near the juncture of the borders of Germany, Switzerland and France. The Nazis were now committed in a big way to ultracentrifuge production – and therefore to enriching uranium. True to his objectives, however, after the war Groves once again warped the truth, downplaying the production plants by mentioning only that “U235 separation experiments” were being conducted in Celle and Freiburg30 – never anything of the success of those experiments or of the ten ultracentrifuge production plants or of Ardenne’s efforts at Lichterfelde. Despite such subjugation of the truth, David Irving in his book The German Atomic Bomb, identifies what, at least for a time, were thought by the Allies to be fourteen isotope separating facilities being built in the region.31 Groves himself admitted concern these plants were being erected to enrich uranium. According to Groves, he saw patterns similar to Oak Ridge in these plants; but quick intelligence analysis suggested the facilities were crude and inefficient factories for synthetically converting shale to oil. Such a revelation hints at their actually being a cover for nuclear weapons activity.

Such a revelation hints at their actually being a cover for nuclear weapons activity. After all, synthetic processing was the cover given the “buna plant” at Auschwitz that actually appears to have been electro-magnetically enriching uranium. And there existed a “gentlemen’s agreement” between I.G. Farben and Allied forces32 not to bomb synthetic processing plants. Despite the “shale oil” plants’ seeming inconsequence as ultimately described by Groves, compared to the important schedule of non-nuclear strategic targets needing attention, Allied bombers were diverted from some of their important missions to destroy the chain of plants. Surely the bombing was counter to the “gentlemen’s agreement” unless there was something that justified their destruction beyond the fact they were allegedly synthetic processing plants. The converting of shale to oil is a synthetic gasification process pioneered by I.G. Farben and its technology is in many ways similar to that of producing synthetic rubber, also called buna. Given events related later in this chapter and elsewhere, it would not be surprising to find these plants had, indeed, been enriching uranium. Even the impressive successes of the ultracentrifuge do not match up to the “most far reaching” achievements attained in isotope separation by Baron Manfred von Ardenne. Ardenne and his associate, Fritz Houtermans, as early as 1941, had already calculated the critical mass33 of U²³⁵ and had begun construction of “a magnificent laboratory” underground – safe from the bombing of Allied airplanes – in Berlin Lichterfelde. 34 The laboratory contained a two million-volt electrostatic generator and a cyclotron – at the time there was only one other cyclotron throughout the Reich, that of the Curies, which had been commandeered in France. By April 1942, Ardenne also had in his laboratory a completed magnetic isotope separator35 not unlike the calutrons of Ernest Lawrence, which General Groves would not deploy at Oak Ridge for another year-and-ahalf. Ardenne had designed the separator in 1940, barely on the heels of the discovery of a possible fission explosion. And so, supplied with his million-volt generator to provide the copious amounts of power needed to operate the magnetic isotope separator, Ardenne seems to have been ahead of everybody else in the field of uranium enrichment. In addition, the ion plasma source Ardenne had designed for his isotope separator to sublime the uranium compound was far superior to that provided for the calutrons – a profound distinction considering the calutron’s sublimation process was one of its key weaknesses. Calutron efficiency for sublimation ran up to 75 percent at best. 36 Ardenne’s invention apparently was much more efficient – and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:57:d279d71484cc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5140, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 58, "text": "isotope separator, Ardenne seems to have been ahead of everybody else in the field of uranium enrichment.

Calutron efficiency for sublimation ran up to 75 percent at best. 36 Ardenne’s invention apparently was much more efficient – and has come to be the premiere source world-wide for emitting particle rays; and is known to this day as “The Ardenne Source.” One other important distinction separated Ardenne’s and Houtermans’ work from the other German efforts. All of the other programs were under the direction and were part of the German Army, supplied by and accountable to the military. By contrast, all of Ardenne’s facilities – the bomb-proof lab, the million-volt generator, the cyclotron, and the magnetic isotope separators themselves – were provided by, and ongoing funding made available through, the patronage of one man, Reich Minister of Posts and member of the Reich President’s Research Council on Nuclear Affairs, Wilhem Ohnesorge. Like the Manhattan Project scientists, Ardenne and Houtermans worked within the more intellectually free environment of a civilian, not military, organization. Production for the German isotope enrichment projects, once the experimental and design work were completed by Ardenne and the others, appears to have been undertaken by the I.G. Farben company under orders of the Nazi Party. The company was directed to construct at Auschwitz a buna factory,37 allegedly for making synthetic rubber. Following the war, the Farben board of directors bitterly complained that no buna was ever produced despite the plant being under construction for four-and-a-half years; the employment of 25,000 workers from the concentration camp, of whom it makes note the workers were especially well-treated and well fed; and the utilization of 12,000 skilled German scientists and technicians from Farben. Farben also invested 900 million reichsmarks (equal to approximately $2 billion of today’s dollars) in the facility. The plant used more electrical power than the entire city of Berlin yet it never made any buna, the substance it was “intended” to produce. Landry went on to explain that while some types of buna are made by heating, which requires using relatively large amounts of energy, this energy is invariably supplied by burning coal. Coal was plentiful and wellmined in the area and was a key reason for locating the plant at Auschwitz when it was still intended to be a buna facility.39 The heating-of-buna process, to Landry’s knowledge, was never attempted using electricity, nor could he envision why it would have been. Landry totally dismissed the possibility a buna plant, had it tried an electric option, would ever use more electricity than a large city, as was described by the Farben directors.

Landry totally dismissed the possibility a buna plant, had it tried an electric option, would ever use more electricity than a large city, as was described by the Farben directors. And the investment of $2 billion is, “A hell of a lot of money for a buna plant” even these days, according to Mr. Landry. The probability of the Farben plant having been completed to make buna appears to be slim to none. The facility had all the characteristics of a uranium enrichment plant, however, which undoubtedly it would never have been identified as. Instead, it would be given an appropriate cover story to camouflage it – such as it being a buna plant. In fact, buna was an excellent cover because of the high level and similar types of technology involved in both buna production and uranium enrichment. Indeed, as has been noted previously, General Groves and his intelligence analysts had already mistakenly identified as possible enrichment plants what he later alleged were production facilities for a synthetic process similar to buna. And do not forget the protection provided by the gentlemen’s agreement, which forbade the Allied bombing of Farben synthetic rubber plants – another great reason to use the buna cover. The various components of the German isotope separation efforts easily could have been implemented with a high degree of secrecy, even from other high-level Nazis, given Bormann’s close-knit relationships with Ohnesorge; Schmitz, who was the chief of I.G. Farben; Hoess, the commandant of Auschwitz; and Heinrich Mueller, who, among his many other duties as head of the Gestapo, oversaw the supplying of forced laborers to Auschwitz.40 1 Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, p. 263 2 Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, p. 259 3 Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, p. 253 4 Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, p. 261 5 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 45 6 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 302 7 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 179 8 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, pp. 41,42 9 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 44 10 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 56 11 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 51 12 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 71 13 Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, pp. 607 - 610 14 Allen Hall, Mail Online, 13 July 2011 15 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 222 16 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 85 17 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 58; Leona", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:59:3ad320cedd3a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5142, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 60, "text": "Atomic Bomb, p. 44 10 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 56 11 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 51 12 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 71 13 Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, pp. 607 - 610 14 Allen Hall, Mail Online, 13 July 2011 15 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 222 16 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 85 17 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 58; Leona Libby, The Uranium People, pp. 73, 74 18 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 211 19 McGeorge Bundy, Danger and Survival: Choices About The Bomb In The First Fifty Years, pp. 15 - 18 20 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 77 21 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 102 22 Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, pp. 402, 403 23 Albert Speer, Inside The Third Reich, p. 21 24 Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, p. 406 25 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. pp. 89, 90 and 284 26 Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, p. 487 27 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 234 28 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 91 29 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, pp. 91, 173, 229 30 Leslie R.

The English and Americans were closing in from the west and south; the Wehrmacht was in shreds in front of them and falling back. The Russians were just outside Berlin and closing from the east; in three weeks the German capital would be surrounded. The Luftwaffe was decimated; it could barely get aircraft off the ground. Germany had all but lost. Yet Hitler stood before his soldiers and announced, “we still have things that need to be finished, and when they are finished, they will turn the tide.”3 Their Fuehrer was intent on buying time until he could thrust his newest, most secret weapon into battle.4 Scores of later observers and historians would attribute his “miracle weapon” rhetoric to dementia that had set in under the influence of drugs and duress. Or they suggested it was a vain and empty promise meant to buttress German military resolve to buy time while the Fuehrer tried to negotiate with the Allies – or break them up, depending on to whom one listens. But Hitler’s visionary prediction now appears to have been more than war-wearied wishing or drug-induced hallucinations. In fact, according to Albert Speer, Martin Bormann, Hitler’s top lieutenant and in all things the consummate realist, believed Hitler was neither wishing nor hallucinating. With the end of the war closing in, Bormann had told Gauleiter Hellmuth that a secret weapon soon would be forthcoming even as Germany was being defeated.5 Party bigwigs were being told by Bormann, and firmly believed, that a most-secret miracle weapon was about to be unleashed,6 wrote Bormann biographer Jochen von Lang. SS General Karl Wolff, who at the end of the war secretly negotiated with the OSS to surrender all of Italy – Germany’s southern front – revealed in postwar interrogations that he had spoken privately with Hitler about the secret weapon.7 Wolff was in position to know about such a weapon. Before his assignment in Italy he had been a key link between Himmler and his SS, I.G. Farben and its plant at Auschwitz, and Bormann and the rest of Hitler’s headquarters (see Chapter Sixteen). According to Lang, Bormann focused “all his energy” on making sure the miracle weapon would happen.8 Bormann insisted a miracle weapon was coming because, in all likelihood, Bormann had seen it – or at least he had seen its most integral and difficult-to-obtain component – while touring with Hitler the laboratory where it was created. As was his fashion, Bormann followed Hitler almost everywhere and had his clerks write down on small white cards almost every word that fell from Hitler’s lips and nearly all his comings and goings. From", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:61:3ab6b12c82d6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5144, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 62, "text": "sure the miracle weapon would happen.8 Bormann insisted a miracle weapon was coming because, in all likelihood, Bormann had seen it – or at least he had seen its most integral and difficult-to-obtain component – while touring with Hitler the laboratory where it was created. As was his fashion, Bormann followed Hitler almost everywhere and had his clerks write down on small white cards almost every word that fell from Hitler’s lips and nearly all his comings and goings. From these references Dr. Henry Picker wrote his book Hitler’s Tabletalk. Using those references, Picker confirms that Hitler (probably accompanied by Bormann – author’s note) made a habit of visiting the private laboratory of nuclear physicist Manfred von Ardenne. Such singular attention by the leader of the Third Reich, whose time was in great demand and who during this period thought and worked only on important issues relating to the war, bespeaks a man fully supporting a program he perceived was integral to Germany’s ability to win the war. Hitler by these repeated visits, despite later assertions otherwise, appears to have understood the importance of the Ardenne nuclear program in the worldwide military/political arena. His visits to the laboratory show Hitler was aware, knowledgeable, involved and supportive of nuclear weapons and that, interpreting the reason for his successive visits, the program must have been progressing. So if Hitler believed a miracle weapon was forthcoming when he addressed the Ninth Army, having been an eyewitness to Ardenne’s developments, he probably had good reason for that conviction, as did Bormann. Armaments Minister Albert Speer’s attempts to induct almost 15,000 scientists and technicians into the military – 5,000 who had already been inducted were released – so they could continue their research efforts on weapons development. Among them were several atomic scientists saved from conscription into Bormann’s own Volksturm Army. Bormann then issued a decree that protected all scientific personnel from any future combat assignments other than as required for defensive operations in the regions of their own homes. But evidence exists Martin Bormann had a more direct connection to nuclear development than establishing and enforcing broad policies about scientific personnel and their relationships with the military, and irregular tours through nuclear laboratories. In his book Inside the Third Reich, Albert Speer related how Hitler received an update about the development of nuclear weapons from Bormann’s old friend Dr. Wilhelm Ohnesorge. Speer gives a brief accounting of Ohnesorge and his chief physicist, the young Manfred von Ardenne. 11 Bormann, under Hitler’s instructions, had assigned Dr. Ohnesorge, the mathematician and physicist who was Minister of Posts, the task of capturing and deciphering intercepted messages between Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. And Bormann had arbitrated a deal between the postal ministry and Hitler on the usage of Hitler’s likeness.

And Bormann had arbitrated a deal between the postal ministry and Hitler on the usage of Hitler’s likeness. Now Ohnesorge was in Hitler’s presence again reporting on the nuclear program, an achievement not possible without Bormann’s approval at the very least, and most probable only with his wholehearted support. Given the many references to Bormann’s efforts to move forward the miracle weapon, the possibility seems worth considering that Bormann was not only Ohnesorge’s champion and intermediary in Hitler’s court, based on their previous success decrypting the Roosevelt-Churchill hotline and the fact that almost nothing was presented to Hitler without having received Bormann’s support first, but Bormann appears to have been involved with a nuclear program at a high level, as well. Whenever the miracle weapon was mentioned, Bormann’s name was always tied to it, as Speer reported in the case of Gauleiter Hellmuth having been told about the weapon by Bormann, and Jochen von Lang documented that “Bormann’s commissars” revealed the existence of the weapon. The miracle weapon program, in its entirety, also follows what had long been the pattern and had all the earmarks of a Bormann program: it was a shadow program composed of people strongly aligned with Bormann – ill-regarded, perceived quasi-experts who performed their tasks outside of the orthodox structures one would expect people in those functions to work within. Ohnesorge and Ardenne, and to a degree Houtermans, were looked down upon by their more orthodox counterparts as less-than-capable scientists: Ohnesorge because he was bastardizing his training in mathematics and physics by mixing the beloved disciplines with the bureaucracy of the postal ministry, Ardenne because he was not a credentialed physicist, and Houtermans because he had a somewhat checkered past. Speer, without mentioning Bormann by name, complained about amateurism and “Sunday-supplement” reporting of the program, a complaint he often threw at Bormann but at few others. The production component of the project also appears to have been assembled and controlled by a web of close Bormann cronies at I.G. Farben, Auschwitz and in the Gestapo and SS. Many of Hitler’s most powerful leaders, led by Speer, resisted the miracle weapon enterprise but were unable to bring it down, a strong sign Bormann was involved and used his power with Hitler and elsewhere to maintain the program. Speer usually had his way with the Fuehrer on most subjects; except those Bormann contested.

Additional evidence suggests Ardenne achieved far more success in nuclear energy development than any other German research team – including and far surpassing Dr. Werner Heisenberg and his followers, who in the traditional history are summarily held forth as Germany’s nuclear leaders. At his villa in Berlin Lichterfelde, supported by Ohnesorge’s massive funding, Ardenne had built his own first-rate underground laboratory safe from the intermittent bombings delivered by Allied airplanes.12 Contrary to efforts during and after the war to minimize Ardenne’s achievements, he actually succeeded by mid-war in developing an isotope separation technology that “had clear similarities to the tracks at Oak Ridge.”13 “The Ardenne Source,” as the most critical component of the device came to be known, was, in fact, better than those at Oak Ridge and continued to be the ion plasma source of choice globally for decades after the war.14 Ardenne conceived the idea of his magnetic isotope separator in early 1940, at the beginning of the war, well early enough to be of service to the German program, despite the opposite often being inferred in the traditional history. In fact, development of Ardenne’s technology occurred at the same time Ernest Lawrence first began toying with the idea of converting his cyclotron into a similar type of device. By then, Ardenne had already drawn up plans for his own isotope separator.15 Before the year was out, Ohnesorge had underwritten Ardenne’s effort and the equipment for the great laboratory had been purchased. By mid-1942, at the same time the modification of Lawrence’s experimental cyclotron in America16 was completed, Ardenne’s isotope separator had been completed as well,17 construction having begun in 1941.18 Ardenne’s work during the war has been described as “the most far-reaching work on isotope separation.”19 Based on reports of the success of the Ardenne ion source, his isotope separator appears to have been superior – possibly substantially superior – to the American calutrons. In essence, at mid-war, Ardenne was at least neck and neck with America’s leading electro-magnetic isotope separation bomb program and probably ahead of it – especially when considering the superiority of his technology – something neither Heisenberg nor any of his German cohorts could ever claim.

It is a fact never openly admitted by the United States at that time or during the years since. When calutrons technology had been proven in the American uranium enrichment program, it was handed over to the big industrial combines for transitioning into production models and methods. Subsequently, uranium enrichment production on an industrial scale was begun. Because such a course of research and development and then production was, and still is, the normal and expected paradigm of technology development; and because the two nation’s programs so closely resembled each other in so many other facets, it seems probable the Germans went into development of a production phase of Ardenne’s technology no later than the United States’ program started building commercial calutrons, and probably earlier. There is no indication that German separation technology development was disrupted at this stage. Once the technology had been created by Ardenne and his team, it would not have been necessary for the developers to participate in its adaptation to industrial production processes, although it certainly would have been helpful. The assumption that Ardenne’s device went into production development can be made because there remains the important questions of what were Ardenne and his program doing between mid-1942, when his machine was successfully enriching uranium, and the end of the war; and what happened to any enriched uranium that may have been produced at Ardenne’s laboratory or in any resulting production facilities? At the end of the war, nearly 2,400 tons of German uranium was missing and unaccounted for (see Chapter Three), almost certainly because it had been enriched down to the 1/140th of its mass that was U235. At that ratio, seventeen tons of enriched uranium could have been produced from the missing material. This does not include the massive discovery of approximately 375,000 tons of spent uranium discovered in salt mines in 2011, covered earlier in this text, documented as having come from the Nazi atomic bomb program. The point is, Ardenne’s program had been moving with great momentum right up until the moment no more was heard about it, by then the program had already been advanced enough to go into production development and a facility most likely was under construction at Auschwitz. Besides, Ardenne repaired the isotope separator quickly after the bombing and it appears reasonable to believe additional experimentation could have continued right up to the end of the war. The questions of whether Ardenne continued to operate and improve his enrichment process, and what happened to any enriched product created as a result of it, are unanswered by the traditional history.

Critical Mass proposes answers to these mysteries. Despite his achievements, significant effort has been made to discredit Ardenne’s wartime work21 and, in fact, to hide it whenever possible, including by Ardenne himself. Ardenne, who was essentially self-taught in physics and mathematics but whose zeal for the subject matter and his personal connections allowed him to make great strides with his unconventional projects, was belittled personally and professionally by many of his counterparts for not being a true academic, most especially by Heisenberg and another leading German theoretician Carl-Friedrich von Weizsacker. Because of them the animosity from Albert Speer grew.2 Ardenne was supposedly, in turn, misled by Heisenberg and Weizsacker into thinking a bomb was not possible for technical reasons, even though Heisenberg, along with Hahn, was one of the theoreticians who had revealed to Ardenne the estimated critical mass of an atom bomb.23 Despite Heisenberg’s later alleged disinformation to Ardenne regarding the technical unfeasibility of a weapon, Ardenne, using Heisenberg’s previous argument for a bomb, secured Ohnesorge’s funding for his project, who in turn used the argument to gain his audience with Hitler – almost certainly through Bormann. Ardenne’s practical application of physics was not without the direction of a strong theoretical mind that kept him current and gave him guidance in his quest to unleash the atom. He had hired Professor Fritz Houtermans, a fascinating and brilliant Austrian who while still a student in Germany, like Oppenheimer in America, had worked out the thermonuclear theory of solar energy; that is, what fuels the stars – and hydrogen bombs. In fact it is Houtermans and astronomer Robert Atkinson who, together, are given credit for first deciphering and articulating the thermonuclear theory; so named because of the immense heat inside the stars that is released when hydrogen atoms collide and fuse together to form helium.24 Thus an atom bomb is the result of energy released by the fission, or splitting of atoms, while a thermonuclear warhead – or hydrogen bomb – is the result of energy released by the combining, or fusion, of atoms. Houtermans’ genius was not limited to astrophysics. As early as 1932, the same year the nucleus of the atom was discovered and six years before the atom was first split, Houtermans was the first to recognize and champion the potential for nuclear power from atomic chain reactions.25 When Houtermans’ hated Austrian compatriot Hitler came to power in Germany, Houtermans immigrated to the Soviet Union.

While there he advanced the theory, in 1937,26 of neutron absorption, which would eventually be used to create plutonium, another first. Before the war had even begun, Houtermans’ powerful and imaginative mind in Stalin’s hands could have placed the Soviet Union as front-runner among the nations in the race for an atomic bomb, had the Russian leaders paid more attention to the unusual physicist. By not doing so they committed a serious error. For having thus jumped out of Hitler’s frying pan and into Stalin’s fire, Houtermans was arrested in one of Stalin’s paranoia-driven purges in 1937. Houtermans’ wife and children escaped to the United States but Houtermans was imprisoned for two years, constantly at threat of death, and tortured in an effort to gain a confession of having been a saboteur. In one 72-hour session all of his teeth were knocked out. In a following interrogation, Houtermans falsely admitted to having spied for Germany by ascertaining Russian aircraft speeds using a device he had “invented.”27 The torture stopped while his “invention” was reviewed. The contrivance turned out to be wholly invalid on scientific grounds, as Houtermans planned it would, and higher officials correctly deduced his confession had been coerced from him by “unscientific” means, all according to Houtermans’ plan. While Houtermans awaited review of his case in 1939, Hitler negotiated what would be a short-lived peace with Stalin and Houtermans was turned over to the Gestapo as part of a general prisoner exchange. Heinrich Mueller’s police force locked him up again for a short time, then freed him on request of Nobel laureate Dr. Max von Laue, with the proviso Houtermans was under Gestapo supervision and the understanding he would not be allowed to work for any state agencies or universities.28 Soon he was employed in the private laboratory, funded by the Postal Service, a state agency, of the unorthodox Baron Manfred von Ardenne. The renowned theoretical and experimental mastery of Houtermans – who despite his proven theoretical leadership was actually degreed as an experimental physicist – certainly provided significant contributions to the unappreciated but substantial enthusiasm and experimental genius of Ardenne. For example, Ardenne had been told by Heisenberg and Hahn the required critical mass of a uranium bomb was estimated to be “only a few kilos.”29 Houtermans actually performed the exact calculations for critical mass, however, while working for Ardenne in 1941,30 thus providing a crucial piece of information.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:67:031a70bbd834", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5150, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 68, "text": "Houtermans – who despite his proven theoretical leadership was actually degreed as an experimental physicist – certainly provided significant contributions to the unappreciated but substantial enthusiasm and experimental genius of Ardenne.

For comparison, the United States’ program did not deduce its final figure for the amount of enriched uranium needed for a bomb until four years later, in April 1945. Houtermans also had calculated not only the cross sections of a fast, or exploding, chain reaction, but the cost of various isotope separation methods, as well. In addition, while in Ardenne’s employ Houtermans performed serious research on development of a nuclear reactor. Much has been made in previous histories of Houtermans’ covert resistance to the Nazis waging war using the fruits of his mind and the infinite powers of the universe it discovered; and undoubtedly much, if not all, of what is reported about his opposition to Hitler is true. For Houtermans appears to have been a man of quality conscience. This fact and his contributions to a German bomb as listed above, notwithstanding, history suggests his main obstruction to the Nazis co-opting his marvelous mind came in the form of steering Ardenne and others away from a bomb and toward the development of nuclear reactors for creating energy for industrial purposes. Besides Houtermans’ research into reactors, there is evidence Ardenne’s laboratory was, in fact, actually building a reactor as well as the magnetic isotope separator. 31 The fact, however, both Ardenne and Ohnesorge understood and promoted the development of a bomb before Houtermans arrived on the scene and that they continued to pursue one after his employment indicates Houtermans’ politics had little effect upon the purposes of the laboratory or upon its achieving those objectives. In addition, given the Gestapo’s close control of Houtermans, it can hardly be expected he would have effectively tried to thwart Ardenne’s, and by extension Ohnesorge’s, efforts toward a bomb. Although all German scientists were watched closely, because of his history none had his actions so carefully scrutinized as Fritz Houtermans. In fact, it is entirely possible Houtermans’ working at Ardenne’s laboratory was the result of Gestapo Mueller having informed his mentor, Bormann, that the eminent physicist was in Gestapo hands following the prisoner exchange with the Soviets. Upon hearing this, Bormann, in an effort to expand his own nuclear program, may have manipulated his bureaucratic strings, steering Houtermans into “his” program run by Ohnesorge and Ardenne, knowing they could use Houtermans’ substantial capabilities.

Considering the Gestapo’s order for Houtermans not to work at any state program, and then Houtermans ultimately working for a state agency that was under Bormann’s control, such a course seems likely. For working at Ardenne’s facility, which though private was funded by a major government branch that performed important war research on the most secret weapon of all, would almost certainly have been considered a breach of the Gestapo directive. Only with the Gestapo’s blessing, and by extension Bormann’s, is it likely Houtermans would have been allowed to work on the Postal Ministry’s nuclear bomb project. The Gestapo’s directive ordering Houtermans to stay out of government nuclear programs may have been a device to keep the scientist out of the control of competitors to Bormann’s nuclear bomb program, as well. Fritz Houtermans had been the “guest” of one too many state police organizations not to know what was expected of him if he wanted to survive. But he was a physicist at heart – to not pursue his work was the same as not breathing. On the smoky, ash-covered banks of the Vistula River hulked the miserable Polish town of Oswiecim. The cause of its wretchedness surrounded it: To the southwest one kilometer stood a concentration camp established by the occupying Germans who had overrun Poland. To the west two kilometers stood another, much larger camp with an even more nefarious purpose. From its smokestacks the constant snow of human ash settled upon the town. Between the stacks and the town stood the train station through which humans, like ignoble beasts of the field, were trundled to these abject camps. To the east six or seven kilometers was a third camp, reserved for prisoners of conscience who dared defy the Nazi regime, as compared to most of those in the other camps who just happened to be unlucky and were born across the wrong boundary line or of arbitrary parentage. A few kilometers north of that stood yet another camp, where the “lucky” prisoners were starved more slowly on slightly higher rations while their military masters in the SS sold their 18-hoursa-day labor for a pittance but kept all of the earnings for themselves. The town had even been severed from using its own Polish appellation and was forced to use the Teutonic version of its name: Auschwitz.

To slap wicked insult on cutting injury, 12,000 residents of the town had been thrown out of their homes and German scientists, technicians and factory workers, all employees or contract workers of the world’s largest chemical cartel, Hermann Schmitz’s I.G. Farben, moved in.32 From then until the end of the war nothing would be held back in the effort to erect and put into operation what would be one of the most, if not the most, technically advanced processing plants in the world, according to authors Peter Hayes and Richard Sasuly, who wrote Industry and Ideology and I.G. Farben, respectively. The site had been carefully selected for its purpose: it was outside of Germany and far from Allied bombing and the watchful eyes of American and English reconnaissance operations; it was next to a major railroad center allowing easy access for moving equipment and materials from around Europe to and from the site; it had a nearly inexhaustible supply of manual labor from the death camps for building the fences, barracks, offices and other non-technical structures required and for operating equipment that might otherwise be deemed too dangerous for individuals whose lives were valued; and it had quick and ready access to vast stores of coal from the Brzeszcze-Jawiszowice coal mine. 33 The purpose of the plant appears to have been hidden behind an illusory wall carefully crafted to camouflage the truth from the world. So much of what went into building and operating the plant, and the paucity of product it was reportedly constructed to produce – no product whatsoever was made – is not congruent with the history of the company that owned and operated it or its alleged purpose: the making of synthetic gasoline and synthetic rubber, known as buna. First, and most telling, the plant consumed more electricity than the entire city of Berlin.34 Considering the installation never made a pound of buna, never even went into production, and is alleged to be the biggest failure in the history of I.G. Farben because of that fact, such electrical consumption is incredible if not entirely unbelievable. That such huge quantities of power were required to build the facility – not run it – is inconceivable. Certainly Berlin, the eighth-largest city in the world at the time, constantly bombed by the Allies and continually rebuilt to keep the war machine going, had many construction and re-construction projects within its boundaries that individually matched or exceeded the electrical demands of a single buna plant under construction, not to mention the total consumption of all of Berlin’s construction projects combined.

Add to these the electrical consumption of the hundreds of thousands of businesses and residences throughout the sizable city, and the electrical consumption of the buna installation is massive and unexplainable in comparison. Even had the plant been completed and making buna, but it was kept secret after the war for some unexplained reason, the electrical consumption described still would have been astronomical given the buna manufacturing process, far exceeding any power usage that could have been expected for the facility. The only explanation had the plant been making buna that could begin to explain such a high level of electrical consumption, although this even stretches the bounds of plausibility, is the plant was designed to be powered totally by electricity, including heating the buna directly with electrical power. But such an approach would have been extremely inefficient because burning coal created electricity at Auschwitz. Normally, the burning of coal heats water to create steam, which would then efficiently be used for the buna heating processes. To burn coal to create steam to create electricity, which was and is the conventional way to create electricity, which would then be used to heat buna, adds an extra step – and cost, time and vulnerability – to the heating process while losing considerable energy, which is fundamentally very inefficient. There is no conceivable reason to have done such a thing. Ed Landry, President and General Manager of Keystone Polymers, Inc. of Houston, Texas at the time he was interviewed, and an expert on synthetic rubber production, when told about the electrical consumption of the buna plant, responded, “that was not a rubber plant – you can bet your bottom dollar on that.” Based on other information provided, as well, Landry believes it is hardly conceivable that the so-called “buna” plant at Auschwitz was primarily designed to make synthetic rubber. When the author contacted George Ladzun, another leading expert on buna production and a senior manager with over 35 years of experience building and operating at least three buna plants from the 1960s through the 1990s, Mr. Ladzun supported Mr. Landry’s assessment completely.

Second, the plant had cost over 900 million reichsmarks, over 250mil - lion³⁵1945 United States dollars based on the initial currency exchange of marks for dollars following the war. The value of the mark, however, had already begun spiraling before the end of the war. Using the conservative $250 million figure adjusted for inflation to today’s dollars, the buna plant would have cost $2 billion.36 The average buna plant that produces 150,000 tons of buna annually cost approximately $80 million to build in 1999 dollars, the timeframe in which these calculations were made. That is $10.5 million adjusted down to 1945 dollars. The expenditure of $250 million 1945 dollars reported to build the buna plant at Auschwitz is not just twice the amount expected, or even three or four times the sum one would anticipate the plant would have cost, but twenty-five times that of the average buna plant of the day. And today’s costs are greatly inflated in comparison with 1945, in order to meet the higher costs of environmental protections that doing business in the 21st Century entails. In addition, a plant that produces 150,000 tons of buna per year is producing the same amount of buna the Auschwitz plant and the two other existing plants of the time at Schopau and Huens, Germany37 and one additional plant equal to that at Auschwitz were all intended to produce, combined. 38 This being the case, in essence the alleged buna plant at Auschwitz should have cost only half as much to build as the 1945 : S10.5 : mil⋅ - lion estimate; in other words, $5.25 million – about one-fiftieth the cost of the Auschwitz construction. Upon careful consideration, it is hard to conceive of a buna plant being built that cost 50 times more than existing buna facilities. Some critics have decried a comparison of calculations between marks and dollars adjusted for inflation rates, saying the extensions can allow no fair correlation between the German and American spending. While admittedly such calculations are not exact, they nonetheless reflect spending differences showing many times the order of magnitude of spending that would be expected in such comparisons. These differences – at ratios of anywhere from 1:25 to 1:50 – are so large as to suggest there is no correlation between the values of dollars and marks at all, if the critics are correct, which obviously is inconceivable.

But for the sake of argument, we will use another comparison that may be more satisfactory to these critics. Instead let’s compare the buna construction costs with something of near-equal uniqueness, technical requirements and importance within Germany’s own sphere of economic influence, the V-2 rocket program. Germany spent $120 million to build the entire V-2 complex, according to Brian Ford in Germany’s Secret Weapons. 39 At a 1945 exchange rate of three marks to the dollar, the V-2 plant cost 360 million marks, compared to 900 million marks for the buna plant. In other words, the famed pioneering, high tech rocket facilities at Peenemunde cost only one-third the cost of the buna plant at Auschwitz. This despite the fact buna technology had already been around for two decades and its processes were already well established and at least two other plants had already been built, while the V-2 represented the development of technology that no other nation at the time even considered possible. Third, the suggestion that I.G. Farben in the four years between the beginning of construction of the plant in early 1941 and the plant’s shutdown at the end of 1944, completed only one installation in the buna plant and was still unable to produce buna40 runs counter to the commission given to Farben regarding the construction of the plant; counter to the priority given to the building of the plant by both the Nazis and Farben; and counter to the history of the company and its experience building buna facilities and its proven capabilities as the largest chemical concern on earth. Considering its great investment,41 the 25,000 inmates and 12,000 German employees and contractors who worked on the project;42 and the intense interest and pressure put on the project by Hitler and his SS, it seems doubtful if not inconceivable I.G. Farben would have come up empty on such an important venture. Especially since buna product was allegedly needed so badly and buna technology had already been developed two decades earlier and therefore required little, if any, experimentation or research and development time. I.G. Farben’s reputation had been made on technological achievements. The forerunner to the I.G. Farben company was BASF, whose founder, Carl Bosch, had been one half of the two-man team that first developed synthetic nitrates for fertilizers and explosives43 – called the Haber-Bosch process.

The new process, with another Farben-developed technology, the Bergius synthetic oil and rubber process with which buna is made, was the first production-level technology that required extremely high pressures;44 a challenge Bosch met with great success and for which he was the first engineer to earn the Nobel Prize. In 1921, BASF’s synthetic nitrate plant in Oppau, Germany exploded, killing 600 and wounding 2,000.45 BASF needed to rebuild the facility fast but required 10,000 skilled workers to do so. The problem was solved by hiring entire companies, paying them so well that they dropped all other business and went to work concentrating only on Oppau’s reconstruction and operation. As a result the plant, previously estimated to require a year in reconstruction, was rebuilt and operating within three months; a testament to the acumen and boldness of Carl Krauch, who had been assigned by BASF’s Hermann Schmitz, to rebuild Oppau. Twenty years later, Krauch, now wearing the duel hats of chief operations officer of I.G. Farben and plenipotentiary general for special chemical production for the Third Reich,46 had been assigned, once again by Martin Bormann’s old business buddy Hermann Schmitz, to a task that required similar handling, the buna plant at Auschwitz. “In the new arrangement of priority stages ordered by Field Marshal Keitel, your building project [the buna plant] has first priority,” wrote Krauch to Otto Ambros, who headed the day-to-day building of the buna facility.47 General Keitel, with whom Krauch liaised, was Hitler’s chief military advisor, and eventual co-chairman with Martin Bormann on what would come to be known as the highest seat of Nazi power, subservient only to Adolf Hitler himself – the Committee of Three. Ambros was an interesting choice for the assignment. He was considered the leader in the field of high-pressure and synthetic rubber technology and he was the man who oversaw the construction and operation of BASF’s first large-scale buna plant at Schopau in 1935.48 He was also, oddly, Farben’s leading expert on poison gas. Ambros dabbled in physics as well, having pioneered theory in magnetic tape technology in 1932; and he studied under Nobel Prize-winning organic biologist Richard Willstaeter.

On all fronts, Ambros had special qualities for the special project at Auschwitz. Given Farben’s experience with the Oppau reconstruction and the priority placed by the highest powers in the land – political, commercial and military – on building the buna plant, there appears to be little reason for the installation’s construction having taken four years and yet to not have been completed at all. The buna process had been invented two decades earlier49 and was, by now, old hat so to speak; two large production plants were already built and operating successfully. Manpower, both skilled and unskilled, was massively available at Auschwitz. Even though efforts were supposedly being made to update buna technology, there seems to have been little to hinder Farben from repeating Krauch’s success at Oppau when constructing the buna plant at Auschwitz. Given the directive of high priority and the quick results the directive demanded,50 certainly the buna plant would have come to fruition within four years had buna been the project’s true objective. But after four years in construction, at the end of 1944 when it was dismantled and carried away in the face of the approaching Soviet Army, the buna plant at Auschwitz still had not produced a drop of buna. A compilation of the three central and readily known facts just outlined – electrical consumption, construction costs, and I.G. Farben’s previous record – does not easily form a picture that a buna processing plant was the type of project being constructed at Auschwitz. Such a compilation does sketch a picture, however, of another important wartime production process being developed, though very secret at the time. The process is uranium enrichment. First, while buna requires almost no electrical consumption to produce, electro-magnetic isotope separation requires staggering amounts of electricity to power the immense magnets used to separate the ionized uranium particles. As already documented, the buna plant at Auschwitz devoured as much electricity as the entire city of Berlin, the eighth-largest city in the world in the 1940s. Few things, even today, consume as much energy as the buna plant did given its small relative size. The fact I.G. Farben had built an electrical plant next to the buna operation, a very rare occurrence in those days of inexpensive electricity,51 especially given buna production used little electricity, is stark testimony of the plant’s voracious appetite for voltage. Second, although at least 25 times the construction cost of a buna installation, the cost of construction of the Auschwitz plant is strikingly in line with what one would expect to see for an isotope separation plant. For comparison, the United States calutrons program at Oak Ridge spent $20 million on research, $6 million on engineering, $204 million on construction, and $10 million on operations, for a total of $240 million, according to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:75:7c6eb1ec212d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5158, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 76, "text": "of the plant’s voracious appetite for voltage.

For comparison, the United States calutrons program at Oak Ridge spent $20 million on research, $6 million on engineering, $204 million on construction, and $10 million on operations, for a total of $240 million, according to General Groves’ own figures.52 This compares to $250 million for the “buna” plant at Auschwitz. The harmony of the German and American figures is striking if not compelling. If that correlation is ignored, one must believe the buna plant actually cost more to construct than the Oak Ridge calutrons plant. Third, while Farben had a strong reputation for quick construction of its priority projects, the delays of the “buna” facility and the problems that caused those delays mirrored to a significant degree the chief difficulties experienced at Oak Ridge. The buna plant enjoyed top-priority status over all other projects in the Reich, “even at the expense of other important building projects or plans which are essential to the war economy,”53 Krauch had declared. Thus, priority-wise, the “buna” plant held a position roughly equal to that enjoyed by the Manhattan Project in the United States. But even early in the war, before shortages became prevalent, the “buna” plant at Auschwitz suffered continual delays caused by malfunctioning equipment and material shortages.54 Such setbacks were totally out of character for the technically advanced and highly efficient (even for a German company) I.G. Farben that was supposed to be installing buna technology already well-developed; and that was supposedly being led by managers who were the leading experts in their fields, and, personally, had already successfully overseen similar projects. In addition, due to the vast numbers of people required for the installation, there were difficulties providing housing and transportation as well as the other essentials of daily life, again paralleling similar challenges within the Manhattan Project.55 The most obvious characteristics and history of the facility strongly indicate an isotope separation installation rather than a buna processing plant. Add to this the requirement for absolute secrecy about uranium enrichment during wartime and the fact isotope separation was such a unique and costly process at the time, unlike any other, and it becomes hard to imagine the so-called buna installation being anything but a cover for a uranium enrichment facility. Other clues, while not conclusive individually, dovetail so strikingly with the premise that the alleged buna plant was actually a uranium enrichment facility as to place a collective exclamation mark after the conclusion.

A few examples: First, despite reported drastic and ongoing setbacks, the I.G. Farben leaders, Nazi bigwigs and the SS command at Auschwitz appear not only to have worked amicably hand-in-hand throughout construction to resolve the problems, but they even cordially wined and dined one another throughout the duration of the project, without allowing their supposedly dismal failures to interfere with their personal relationships.56 Such relaxed accord could not have been expected within the Nazi regime – nor, indeed, within many other regimes – with this project as high-priority, essential, beyond schedule and over-budget while at the same time being such a familiar construction process as the alleged buna plant. If the challenge, however, was pioneering unknown science with the hope of creating a decisive miracle weapon, certainly an atmosphere of teamwork and esprit d’corps would have prevailed, as was the case within the Manhattan Project, and as seems to have been the case within the leadership at Auschwitz. Second, I.G. Farben, traditionally known as a chemical concern, on the heels of developing synthetic nitrates shortly after the turn of the century actually had built an explosives empire unequaled in Europe by gaining controlling interests of the other major munitions manufacturers on the continent. Farben then aligned the operations to create Europe’s largest broad-based vertical explosives manufacturing empire, causing Joseph Borkin to write that Farben “had focused a portion of its strategy on the waging of war.”57 Wouldn’t it have been the natural next step in that strategy to be the manufacturer of the next generation of weapons – nuclear weapons? And wouldn’t it have been the Nazi’s most logical next step to ask the leading munitions provider to undertake this endeavor; especially when the relationship was as close as that of I.G. Farben and the Nazi Party? Once again, the German and American nuclear programs appear to have followed similar paths on this front; chemical companies led the key industrial concerns that produced the American atomic bombs, DuPont and Tennessee Eastman among the largest. Such institutions were the only organizations that worked with the high-pressure and high temperature technologies that most closely resembled nuclear technologies. Even combined, however, America’s largest four chemical companies did not equal the size, stature, capabilities or expertise of I.G. Farben. And at least one such American company, DuPont, participated only for the sake of patriotism and to ensure the conservation of democracy. The leaders of DuPont not only intentionally precluded nuclear weapons development from its business strategy, but they accepted only one dollar over and above its expenses for the entire wartime project, as a showing of their refusal", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:77:4861304b31e3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5160, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 78, "text": "technologies.

The leaders of DuPont not only intentionally precluded nuclear weapons development from its business strategy, but they accepted only one dollar over and above its expenses for the entire wartime project, as a showing of their refusal to profit from war. After the war, DuPont withdrew from nuclear weapons development altogether. Presumably, a company like Farben that had integrated war production into its business plan as a basic strategy of its growth would be the first to jump on such a potentially profitable market as nuclear weapons. Third, even the backgrounds of the chief men involved at Farben all appear, to one degree or another, to lend themselves to atomic involvement. Ambros’ association and apparent willingness to lead the development of weapons of indiscriminate mass-destruction, as illustrated by his expertise with poisonous gases; combined with his interest and knowledge of theoretical and experimental physics, as shown by his pioneering work with magnetic tape technology; and his ultimate vocation as the chief high-pressure expert and construction project manager at Farben, combine to provide a man singularly prepared to be the chief architect of a uranium enrichment mass-production facility. Martin Bormann’s relationship with Schmitz, and through Schmitz control of Krauch and Ambros, as well as Bormann’s relationship with General Keitel, who has already been connected militarily with the alleged buna plant, and Auschwitz commandant Hoess, SS Reichsleiter Heinrich Himmler, and even Himmler’s adjutant and liaison with both Hitler and I.G. Farben, SS General Karl Wolff, can all be connected – through Bormann – to the German atomic bomb. Wolff, in fact, had been Himmler’s liaison to the buna plant as well. Fourth, construction on the plant had started some time during or shortly after February 1941. The time frame is salient because it was a year after Ohnesorge’s first atomic conference with Hitler and about the same time Ardenne started building his isotope separation machine. German and United States atomic programs often paralleled each other. Both the Oak Ridge and the Hanford facilities’ construction were begun while the technologies for each were still in developmental stages. Probably Germany mirrored the United States’ policy of starting to build facilities for technologies that were still on the drawing board, in order to gain an advantage in time. As in America, time constraints were a chief issue, and with the risks of failure being geo-political and economic inferiority and military oblivion, it seems reasonable Germany would also begin construction before the technology had been proven. To fail to initiate concurrent design, engineering and construction would have consumed additional months, or even years, when time was of the essence.

To fail to initiate concurrent design, engineering and construction would have consumed additional months, or even years, when time was of the essence. Alternatively, perhaps the installation was in fact originally intended to be a buna facility and its design was modified to enrich uranium only after the project was begun. Albert Speer in his recounting of history, perhaps believing a nuclear program under Bormann never could have succeeded, holds the post-war party line that Germany had not pursued a nuclear initiative with any conviction; a claim employed to hide the fact Germany had indeed vigorously pursued an atomic bomb but hid that effort, with help from the Americans after the war. Speer castigates Ohnesorge’s and Ardenne’s efforts and minimizes Hitler’s conviction to nuclear weapons and even his ability to comprehend their usefulness. Speer stated in a bizarre sort of argument, that Hitler resisted development of a bomb out of a moral sense. He then falls back on the work of Dr. Heisenberg as the unquestioned leader in German nuclear physics to substantiate his position that Germany never gave atomic weapons serious consideration. But in his diatribe Speer totally fails to address the idea that it was common political wisdom by then – even if the potential for a bomb was known only within very high national leadership and scientific circles – that whoever obtained the bomb first would control the world, which was the essence of Adolf Hitler’s life, the Nazi cause, and the reason Hitler had begun the war. Roosevelt, Churchill, Hirohito and Stalin all understood this precept. To think Hitler did not is ludicrous, causing one to question whether Speer was stating his actual perceptions or intentionally disseminating disinformation. If an enemy achieved nuclear weapons before Germany, Hitler would have lost his life’s task by default whether he liked the idea of having or using a bomb or not. His “moral sense” did not stop him from committing a plethora of the most heinous atrocities experienced in this world. Hitler could do nothing to prevent his enemies from creating a nuclear weapon. Therefore, the only possibility he had to counter their efforts was to develop and use an atomic bomb first. Can anyone really believe that, based on moral grounds, the man who introduced to the world Blitzkrieg, terror bombing, Auschwitz and the “scorched earth” policy, so gallantly rejected a nuclear weapon at the cost of his own life’s work and his nation’s final fulfillment of what he believed to be its supreme purpose?

Speer’s argument that the Fuehrer was too dull to understand the abstract physics of a nuclear bomb seems most strained, too. Hitler had been capable of understanding and visualizing the benefits of such cutting edge technology as jet propulsion and rocketry, both of which Germany first introduced to the battlefield, not to mention some of the politically ingenious advances he executed in his rise to power and European domination. It sounds a hollow claim that Hitler did not have the intellect to “grasp the revolutionary nature of nuclear physics,” as Speer suggested. The time frame of Speer’s reference to the Ohnesorge report is mid-1942, the middle of the war. Ohnesorge had first approached the Fuehrer eighteen months earlier, at the end of 1940, with his nuclear proposal.58 Hitler is said to have scoffed at the suggestion at that time, and joked that while his other leaders “were worrying about how to win the war, it was his Minister of Posts who had to bring him the solution.”59 One must ask if following the first meeting and Hitler’s reputed rejection, Ohnesorge would have gone forward with nuclear weapons research in the face of Hitler’s supposed jeering? Possibly. But if he had, he probably would not have done it openly and with disregard for the Fuehrer’s feelings about it. One did not expect to be smiled upon by Hitler if one were openly questioning, by his own actions, the Fuehrer’s judgment. So why would Ohnesorge expose himself to Hitler’s reproach, as Speer’s later account suggests, by giving him an update on the project, especially if it showed the lack of promise Speer insinuates, which would have confirmed Hitler’s supposed reservations about nuclear weapons? The fact Ohnesorge was discussing nuclear arms with the Fuehrer again and Hitler was intermittently visiting Ardenne’s laboratory, probably means either Ohnesorge and Ardenne had in fact achieved a significant level of success that validated the program, or at the very least Hitler was not actually averse to the program in the first place, as so many interpretations of history, including and often based on Speer’s assertions, have tried to make us believe. 1 Dr. Henry Picker, Hitler’s Tabletalk, (as quoted by Brooks, Hirschfeld in Hirschfeld: The Story of a U-Boat NCO, 1940-1946 p. 230 2 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 235 3 Jochen von Lang, The Secretary, p. 316 4 Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi In Exile, p. 113 5 Albert Speer, Inside The Third Reich,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:80:982df30332d1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5163, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 81, "text": "program in the first place, as so many interpretations of history, including and often based on Speer’s assertions, have tried to make us believe. 1 Dr. Henry Picker, Hitler’s Tabletalk, (as quoted by Brooks, Hirschfeld in Hirschfeld: The Story of a U-Boat NCO, 1940-1946 p. 230 2 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 235 3 Jochen von Lang, The Secretary, p. 316 4 Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi In Exile, p. 113 5 Albert Speer, Inside The Third Reich, p. 531 6 Jochen von Lang, The Secretary, p. 313 7 U.S. National Archives II, War Crimes Records, Interrogation Summary #4476, 1 December, 1947, RG 238 M1019, Roll 80; also Interrogation Summary #4453, 16 December, 1947, RG 238 M1019, Roll 80 8 Jochen von Lang, The Secretary, p. 315 9 Dr. Henry Picker, Hitler’s Tabletalk, (as quoted by Brooks, Hirschfeld in Hirschfeld: The Story of a U-Boat NCO, 1940-1946 p. 230 10 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, pp. 256, 258 11 Albert Speer, Inside The Third Reich, p. 271 12 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, pp. 78, 290 13 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 235 14 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 235 15 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, pp. 77, 116; Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, p. 360 16 Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, p. 488 17 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 76 - 78, 116; Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, p. 487 18 Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, p. 371 19 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 235 20 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 290 21 Brooks and Wolfgang Hirschfeld in Hirschfeld: The Story of a U-Boat NCO, 1940-1946 p. 230 22 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 78 23 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 77 24 Robert Jungk, Brighter Than A Thousand Suns, pp. 27, 28, 93; Richard Rhodes, The Making Of The Atomic Bomb, p. 370 25 Robert Jungk, Brighter Than A Thousand Suns, pp. 48, 94 26 Robert Jungk, Brighter Than A Thousand Suns, p. 94 27 Robert Jungk, Brighter Than A Thousand Suns, p. 93, 94 28 Robert Jungk, Brighter Than A Thousand Suns, p. 94 29 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 77 30 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 92 31 Brooks and Wolfgang Hirschfeld in Hirschfeld: The Story of a U-Boat NCO, 1940-1946 p. 32 Peter Hayes, Industry and Ideology, p. 349 33 Peter Hayes, Industry and Ideology, p. 349; Yisrael Gutman and Michael Berenbaum, Anat omy of the Auschwitz Death Camp, p. 38 34 Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi In Exile, p. 153; Joseph Borkin, The Crime and Punish ment of I.G.

From the very beginning, the demands of time did not allow for this. Huge investments were made of time, money and effort, sometimes speciously, justified only on a tremulous belief technologies could and would be created, the need for which had not yet been conceived much less the technologies themselves envisaged. Groves had faith required answers would be found before they were needed, and that all risks were justified by the global imperatives reflected in the war itself, even if it was all lost in the end. In Germany in April 1942, Baron Manfred von Ardenne already had completed an operational magnetic isotope separator in his laboratory in Berlin Lichterfelde, his associate Fritz Houtermans having correctly calculated the critical mass of U²³⁵ the previous year. Manhattan Project scientists, too, had tried to calculate the critical mass of enriched uranium but came up with a surprising range of values. The MAUD Committee, the British group that liaised with the Manhattan Project providing technical support and personnel, calculated the critical mass of U²³⁵ to be 25 pounds. Physicists Frisch and Peierls had at different times predicted the baneful number to be either eight kilograms (17.6 pounds) or five kilograms (11 pounds).2 Robert Oppenheimer himself, before joining the project, had estimated critical mass at about 100 kilograms (220 pounds). His theoretical group at Berkeley quickly upped that by three times to 300 kilograms (660 pounds).3 As late as August 1943, when theorists at Los Alamos provided a critical mass estimate of 40 kilograms (88 pounds), the United States’ target number for enriched uranium production was still unknown. And while Ardenne was already proving the effectiveness of his isotope separator, the United States program at the end of April 1942 was still trying to complete development of its calutrons. 4 Despite this and other setbacks, in the United States electro-magnetic separation was unrealistically anticipated to begin enriching uranium by the summer of 1943.5 Suffering from choking fits and starts, the program would not actually begin any kind of serious production until over a full year later, in the summer of 1944.

The challenges and uncertainty being clear, Groves supported other forms of uranium enrichment – as had the Germans – along with electro-magnetic separation, including gaseous diffusion, a method of separating the lighter isotope of uranium from the heavier ones by vaporizing the uranium and forcing its atoms through a series of “filter” barriers. The Lewis Committee, the select scientific/political review board responsible for oversight of nuclear development at the time, during the winter of 1942 had approved gaseous diffusion as the most likely method to achieve success.8 The committee made this prediction despite the fact gaseous diffusion was calculated to require one hundred thousand barriers and the vessels in which to contain them, and several months of processing, to enrich enough uranium for a bomb.9 In fact, at the time, the technology was totally unproved. Groves also had supported an effort initiated at the University of Virginia to study isotope separation by centrifuge. 10 Outside of the Manhattan Project, the United States Navy was developing a liquid thermal diffusion process for producing enriched uranium to power its warships. Roosevelt had given strict instructions to the Manhattan Project not to co-mingle its efforts with the Navy technology,11 which pumped liquid uranium through concentric tubes of differing temperatures to separate the lighter from heavier isotopes. Liquid diffusion allowed one more avenue of success for making the bomb, and was alleged to eventually have been utilized despite the President’s orders. The development of the atomic bomb depended on the disparate programs moving along parallel and often unrelated tracks. As the laboratories hopefully started providing accurate answers and technologies began yielding usable results, General Groves would then try to cobble them together to produce a viable program from this eclectic assemblage of science. Realizing it was critical each step was accomplished at the earliest possible moment, during his first week as chief Groves signed the approval to purchase 59,000 acres in Tennessee to house uranium enrichment efforts. He also quickly approved a $100 million expenditure to begin construction of the gaseous diffusion plant – the plant was code named K-25 – before the technology had even been proven.12 K-25 would eventually consume half a billion dollars13 of the Manhattan Project’s $2 billion war-time outlay but, despite the traditional history if recently declassified records are believed,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:84:cb3ef708c30c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5167, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 85, "text": "moment, during his first week as chief Groves signed the approval to purchase 59,000 acres in Tennessee to house uranium enrichment efforts.

Gaseous diffusion did, however, produce enriched uranium that was important in the design of the post-war nuclear generation of weapons – the hydrogen bombs. K-25 would stand for many years as the world’s largest totally enclosed single building, and was twice the size of the calutrons’ electro-magnetic isotope separation facility,14 which became known as Y-12. But Y-12 would be the one and only United States plant through which, Groves claimed, every gram of American-made bomb-grade enriched uranium was processed.15 Despite the Lewis Committee’s recommendation for gaseous diffusion, the calutrons was still the only technology that had successfully enriched uranium and it remained the method of choice for the Manhattan Project. 16 The original calculations of calutrons requirements were nearly as dizzying as those for K-25. Experiments indicated that 2,000 uranium ionization sources and collectors were required to yield 100 grams – only three and one-half ounces – of enriched uranium per day.17 Such a rate would require 455 days, one and one-quarter years, to produce enough enriched product for the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. Another humbling fact was, the first production calutrons contained only two,19 not two thousand, sources and collectors. Ground had been broken on 18 February 1943 for the first “track,” as it was called – because its oval shape resembled that of a racetrack – and it went into operation for the first time 1 August 1943. But the device ran so poorly due to mechanical and technical shortcomings that it still had not been tested by September. Stone and Webster, the engineering contractor hired to run the operation, finished repairs and final installation in October and “powered up” the machine again in November20 – to experience a similar failure. An engineering flaw required the apparatus be completely disassembled and shipped back to its manufacturer in Milwaukee to be cleaned and rebuilt. The entire year passed with so little uranium enriched it could not be counted as production material but only as experimental stock.21 Also, the enrichment rate was nominal, having raised the level of U²³⁵ from .7 percent to 10 percent.

There was still a long way to go. Despite the setbacks, Groves not only approved a second track to be built, with more sources and collectors, but he added plans for a third, with a new wrinkle. The newest track would be used to run already-enriched product, the end result being bomb-grade enrichment resulting from using the “seeded” slightly enriched feedstock. The two different types of track were designated “Alpha” and “Beta” tracks. Alpha tracks consumed natural uranium and produced 10 percent-enriched uranium. Beta tracks consumed the 10 percent-enriched feedstocks and produced bomb-grade uranium. At about the same time, the General decided to reduce the number of planned tracks from 2000 to 500, trusting that technology would become more efficient and bridge the wide chasm between political/military requirements and uranium’s realities.22 The second Alpha track was in operation by mid-January 1944²³ and the first, dismantled, Alpha track was returned to Oak Ridge, reinstalled and placed back in operation by March.24 But problems persisted. To make matters worse, spare parts were non-existent and operators ruefully inexperienced. There was no track record to guide them; no experience base upon which to rely. And the Beta tracks were suffering much the same setbacks. In the spring of 1944, with only a year left to achieve success – and estimates requiring a year of enrichment to produce just one bomb – no enriched uranium had been produced in anything close to production quantities.25 Still, Groves and his gargantuan and dubious enterprise pressed on. By the end of June, five Alpha tracks and two Beta tracks were operating, but with very poor performance levels. The ionization sources in the calutrons that converted the uranium feedstocks to be “sublimed” in order to separate the atoms, only converted up to 75 percent of the feedstocks. The condition remained prevalent to the end of the war, leaving anywhere from 25 to 40 percent of the material with enrichment potential sitting useless in the “feed can” at the beginning of the process.26 All of this had to be cleaned out, reclaimed chemically, and reprocessed before it could be rerun – to the same result. In addition, losses of sublimed material accumulated throughout the mechanical system of the calutrons, 27 leaving partially-enriched uranium embedded in equipment surfaces and linings within the device.

The enriched material, even in microgram quantities, was so valuable that following each run the tracks were disassembled and thoroughly cleaned using Geiger-counters to locate each small particle, and appropriate chemicals and special technologies in order to reclaim every scintilla of enriched uranium. Calutrons operators’ clothing was specially laundered each day as well, to ensure every microgram that may have been captured in their clothing was recovered. The sum total of all of these efforts, on all of these machines that were operated and supported by tens of thousands of people, was still an enriched uranium average daily yield of 11.5 grams per day throughout the month of July28 – not even half an ounce. More calutrons were installed to increase production levels. By November, nine Alpha tracks and three Beta tracks – most of them with a full contingent of 96 sources and collectors each – were operating to only slightly better efficiency performance than their predecessors, but the additional machines put production on the rise. Daily output in the first week of November averaged 45 grams (1.6 ounces). In the second week it was 57 grams (2 ounces). The third week production dropped slightly to 50 grams, but in the fourth week of November production climbed to 81 grams (2.84 ounces) per day.29 The increase was significant but it was still a rate that would require 620 days, a full one and two-thirds years, to accumulate enough enriched uranium to fuel the bomb that must be used within eight short months. Otherwise the United States would forever lose the politico/ military nuclear initiative it stood on the cusp of grasping. Despite the fact output had not yet reached required levels, the enriched material that had been produced was many times more valuable than any other commodity present on earth at the time – if a price could be set on it at all. The potential this material held to change the world made it, in many ways, valuable beyond the mere computation of costto-produce versus volume-of-grams.

The embankment that framed the picturesque homestead harbored a submerged bunker made of reinforced concrete buried under the escarpment’s leafy foliage. Inside the invincible bunker a vault stood, surrounded on all sides by yet another cadre of watchful guards.30 Inside the vault were a few ounces of enriched uranium waiting for the weekly courier to whisk it away to a mountaintop in New Mexico. Gaseous diffusion at K-25 was just beginning to receive working barriers for filtering the atoms, but only a few at a time.31 As they arrived, the barriers were installed in the headmost possible stage and tested for integrity, the plan being to allow the first-stage of “converter” vessels to begin the long diffusion process before the numerous ensuing stages had even been completed. In other words, K-25 was making excruciatingly slow headway and had still not produced an atom of enriched uranium. To crank overall production to a higher level, General Groves either ignored, circumvented or had otherwise persuaded President Roosevelt to belay his presidential order refusing Navy involvement in the atomic bomb project, and Groves adopted as his own the liquid thermal diffusion technology the Navy had been devising. Within K-25, besides the massive gaseous diffusion apparatus, stood a 100-column liquid thermal diffusion pilot plant that Groves had ordered constructed in January 1944 and that had been completed in July of the same year.32 The plant was soon expanded and began production, according to Groves, at the end of October, and, he claims, it reached peak production in June 1945.33 Herbert Childs, author of An American Genius, differs from Groves in his account of events, stating liquid thermal diffusion production output actually began on 1 March 1945, four months after Grove’s assertion. Careful review of charts based on daily Beta calutrons production output, however, shows no hint whatsoever of an increase of production in March or any other time between the beginning of the year and the middle of June. In fact, charted average daily output is so consistent throughout the first six months of the year as to form an almost straight line, with the lone exception being a small dip in production during the third week of January. This fact not only draws into question Mr. Childs’ statement regarding when the thermal diffusion plant began operating, but General Groves’ implication, as well, that liquid thermal diffusion continuously rose in productivity until it peaked in June.

The record shows a significant upward production curve from mid-November 1944 to the end of the year, corroborating Groves’ version of when thermal diffusion production began and the remaining calutrons were put into operation. But by the beginning of the new year, daily production had reached a plateau, consistently producing about 240 grams (8.4 ounces) per day, with no further increase in daily productivity until late June 1945.34 Production did take a significant upward turn the fourth week of June 1945, but this advance certainly is related more to other influences than to continuously improving liquid thermal diffusion processes. Groves tried to account for the significant, immediate, and otherwise anomalous increase of Beta production in mid-June, nonetheless, by crediting the increase to the thermal diffusion process. Later, he credited the gaseous diffusion process with the same production expansion,35 although gaseous diffusion is reported to have first gone into operation less than three months after thermal diffusion did, on 20 January 1945.36 While the process would not have borne an immediate impact on output, since it is a cumulative process that requires several weeks for end-product to be available, it undoubtedly would have begun producing enriched material long before the six-month time period reflected between the January start-up and the June surge. And this does not take into account the fact product was already being partially processed as the gaseous diffusion tubes were being added, effectively reducing time-to-product after the Figure 3: The three angled lines at the top represent, from upper to lower, 1) complete output including contaminants, 2) all uranium, 3) level of U235.

With or without the June 1945 spike in enriched uranium output, Manhattan Project isotope separation appeared to be successful. Enough calutrons were working well enough that output was finally on track to produce 50 kilograms of enriched uranium by early August – the amount used in the Hiroshima bomb.38 And even better, the critical mass for U²³⁵ finally had been determined to be only 15 kilograms, only one-third the amount of enriched uranium that would be available when it came time to start fabricating bombs. If desired, at the present rate of production, the United States would be able to assemble as many as three uranium bombs in early August. Despite all the difficult challenges, success appeared to be just around the corner. 1 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 488 2 David Irving, The German Atomic Bomb, p. 69, 95 3 Herbert Childs, An American Genius, pp. 321, 344 4 Robert Serber, The Los Alamos Primer, p. xxix 5 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 406 6 Leslie Groves, Now It Can Be Told, p. 96 7 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 365 8 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 489 9 Leona Libby, The Uranium People, p.53 10 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 550 11 Leslie Groves, Now It Can Be Told, p. 22; Herbert Childs, An American Genius, p. 350 12 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 493 13 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 496 14 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, pp. 494, 495 15 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 601 16 Herbert Childs, An American Genius, p. 333 17 Herbert Childs, An American Genius, p. 341; Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 488 18 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 488 19 Herbert Childs, An American Genius, p. 341 20 Herbert Childs, An American Genius, p. 346; Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 491 21 Leslie Groves, Now It Can Be Told, p. 110 22 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 489 23 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 492 24 Herbert Childs, An American Genius, p. 349 25 Stephen Groueff, The Manhattan Project, p. 312", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:90:f5f0f4e452fa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5173, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 91, "text": "of the Atomic Bomb, p. 488 19 Herbert Childs, An American Genius, p. 341 20 Herbert Childs, An American Genius, p. 346; Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 491 21 Leslie Groves, Now It Can Be Told, p. 110 22 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 489 23 Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, p. 492 24 Herbert Childs, An American Genius, p. 349 25 Stephen Groueff, The Manhattan Project, p. 312 26 Jerry Rice, Y-12 Beta shift supervisor, interview via telephone with the author (date not recorded) 27 Herbert Childs, An American Genius, p. 350 28 US National Archives, Southeast Region, East Point, Georgia, P.B.O.

Manhattan Project physicist Luis Alvarez was credited with, at the last minute, solving the plutonium bomb’s multiple fusses firing simultaneously. Uranium does not appear to be the only component aboardU-234 capable of being used in an atomic bomb. There werethe steel drums and wooden barrels full of fluids noted in Chapter One, which Manhattan Project personnel tested, apparently to see if the materials had been, or could be, part of a plutonium breeder reactor. 3 And there were tons of lead, possibly for gamma radiation shielding; mercury, possibly for very fast mercury switches; and infrared proximity fuses. The infrared fuses were discovered within five days of U-234’s landing at Portsmouth, apparently as the result of Dr. Heinz Schlicke’s interrogation. A memorandum written by Jack H. Alberti dated 24 May 1945⁴ stated, “Dr. Schlicke knows about the infrared proximity fuses which are contained in some of these packages.… Dr. Schlicke knows how to handle them and is willing to do so.” According to the following transmission, at noon the very next day Schlicke was placed on an airplane with a threeman escort and flown back to Portsmouth for the sole purpose of retrieving the proximity fuses.

He noted in his interrogation the intent of many of these meetings was for him to receive the transfer of their technologies and to later disseminate them in Japan, and to serve as the listed scientists’ liaison and advisor with Japan.8 Much of the technology accompanying Schlicke to his destination was the product of this group of 54 obviously very high-level scientists. Among the scientists with whom he had coordinated, which he listed for American interrogators, were Professor Dr. Esau and Professor Gerlach, 9 both of whom, at one time or another, were important members of Germany’s atomic research programs.10 Dr. Esau had served as head of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and was a member of the Reich Research Council. That Schlicke was personally and almost immediately flown back to U-234 specifically to retrieve the infrared fuses, from among all the technology for which he was responsible and all the other technology on the U-boat, seems revealing. The infrared fuses were of immediate interest to the United States, apparently, not just as the booty of war, as were all of the other technologies on the boat, but expediting retrieval of the fuses seems to have been driven by a need to have them immediately available for some purpose. We may see a hint of that purpose revealed in the notes of a meeting at the Office of Naval Intelligence held on 19 July 1945. A portion of the transcribed introduction of Dr. Schlicke bears an innocuous clue to the possible purpose of the infrared fuses. “After Dr. Schlicke completes his lecture he will be available for questions that people ask. But we will kindly ask you not to ask any questions during the lecture and after the lecture Mr. Alvarez [italics added] will sit at the table and the person who wishes to ask a question is asked to come forward so that we can get in the microphone and keep a record of all the questions and answers.”11 After Dr Schlicke completes his lecture ne will be available for questions that people ask.But we will kindly gsk you not to ask any questions during tne lecture and after tie lecture Mr Alvareg will s1t at tne table and tne person who wisnes to ask a question is asked to com forward so that we can get in the micropnone and keep a record of all the questions and answers.Thank you.

The presence of a “Mr. Alvarez” as Dr. Schlicke’s apparent host or “handler” may be a singular indicator regarding the importance of the infrared fuses. The reference to Mr. Alvarez was not the first to be made from among U-234’s passengers and crew. Three weeks earlier, General Kessler had written a letter regarding missing personal items in which he identified a “Commander Alvarez” as having seen some of these items.12 The identification that Alvarez held the rank of commander appears on the face to indicate he was a Navy Officer; no other United States services maintain a rank of Commander except the Coast Guard, which is very unlikely to have been involved with the U-234 intelligence operation. U-234’s skipper, Lieutenant Captain Johann Heinrich Fehler, also identified Alvarez in a letter written decades after the war, but he identified Alvarez as a Lieutenant Commander.13 The distinction between whether Alvarez was a full Commander or a Lieutenant Commander would be minimal, except that it may be a moot point altogether. Alvarez may not have been a Navy officer at all. In parenthesis in his letter, Fehler, following his identification of Alvarez, noted that Alvarez is “probably not his real name.” Fehler seems to have sensed there was something disingenuous about Alvarez but assumed it was his name, not his rank, that was dubious. The name, in fact, may have been the counterfeit. There is no listing of any officer surnamed Alvarez in the Register of Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the United States Navy and Marine Corps for either July 1, 1943 or its publication two years later on July 1, 1945. When discussing this enigma with Dr. Alan Bath, a specialist in naval intelligence, Dr. Bath indicated ONI interrogators were often drawn from the naval reserves, which would not be listed in the rosters of full-time officers. This author twice tried to locate reserve rosters for the time period, but none were available. On the other hand, Dr. Bath admitted it was highly doubtful a first-level interrogator of POWs would be the handler of Schlicke at the high-level lecture given. Dr. Bath supposed there were two Alvarez’s, one an interrogator from naval reserves (who, by the way, was never mentioned in any interrogation reports) and the handler at the lecture, who Dr. Bath conceded may well have been Luis Alvarez. To Bath it was a mere coincidence they were both named Alvarez. At the time U-234 was escorted into Portsmouth Harbor, the Manhattan Project was near desperation.

To Bath it was a mere coincidence they were both named Alvarez. At the time U-234 was escorted into Portsmouth Harbor, the Manhattan Project was near desperation. Because Groves appears to have decided to use some of the already enriched uranium to fuel the plutonium reactors at Hanford, he was short of enriched uranium for the uranium bomb. On the other hand, the Manhattan Project scientists had not figured out a way to efficiently trigger the plutonium bomb. Therefore, at that point in time, neither bomb was viable. And the mid-August requirement for any kind of bomb was fast approaching. The plutonium bomb consisted of a solid sphere of plutonium the size of an orange. The key requirement to make the bomb explode – besides the creation of the requisite amount of plutonium – was to compress the plutonium sphere so it would reach critical mass. To achieve this compression, 32 redundant detonators – 64 in all – needed to be fired within 1/50, 000^(th) of a second or less, or the bomb would likely fail. The challenge was daunting. For a year-and-a-half, the Los Alamos scientists tried to develop a simultaneously firing detonation system. Just a month before U-234 landed, there was “more than a bare possibility that the detonators will be unsatisfactory”14 wrote Norris Bradbury, who headed the team responsible for triggering the explosion. Indeed, into late June and early July, just two weeks before the first atomic bomb test at Alamogordo, New Mexico, the detonator timing problem was still not resolved.15 [] d。J.R.Oppenheimer appointed & conmittee of three,L.V..Alvarez， K.r.Binbridge and Lt.Col。Lockridge,to consult on the prooure ment of detonators to insure that the designe are setisfactory to G-7 and to X-2。 Figure 5: Luis Alvarez was the first member of a three-man team personally assigned by Oppenheimer to resolve the detonator timing problem of the plutonium bomb. Alvarez is credited with getting 32 detonators to fire within 1/50,000th of a second of each other. Alvarez had begun his wartime work in the Radiation Lab at MIT, then worked on Ground Controlled Approach Radar, which allowed controllers to “talk down” a pilot whose vision was impaired.18 He then worked on Phased-array Radar, which allows a radar system to track an object electro-magnetically rather than steering the system by manual means. After the war, Alvarez went on to win the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1968 for his work on aeronautical navigation systems.

And he, with his son Walter and geologist Frank Asaro, were the first to forward the theory that Earth was struck by a meteorite that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. They based their theory on findings of high levels of iridium in concentrated locations on earth. At first scorned, the theory has become widely accepted. Luis Alvarez also became one of the great heroes of the atomic bomb story when he solved the plutonium bomb detonator timing problem in the last days before the Trinity Test. 19 In his own account of his work in the Manhattan Project, he wrote simply that he “cleaned up some loose ends in detonator design.”20 The understatement and lack of detail may be telling – especially if it was meant to hide how he “cleaned up” those details. Of all the Manhattan Project personnel whose name one would expect to see connected to Heinz Schlicke’s and U-234’s infrared proximity fuses, if there was a connection, Luis Alvarez’s name would be at the top of that list. The two scientists’ backgrounds were strikingly similar; both men were leaders in the field of high frequency light waves. When it came to science, they spoke the same language. If the Manhattan Project wanted somebody to debrief Schlicke, or anyone aboard U-234, about any category of atomic bomb development, Alvarez would have been the logical choice. By assignment and as a close confidant of Oppenheimer, he was one of the very few people who had a broad view and understanding of all the aspects of the Manhattan Project. By late spring 1945, when U-234 arrived on American shores with just two months left until the Trinity Test, the detonator problem was still unsolved and its resolution was now paramount to the success of the entire program. Alvarez, as the key man assigned to the problem, was in desperate need of a fusing system that could fire multiple detonators simultaneously. Schlicke had fuses that worked on the principles of light – presumably they worked at the speed of light. In fact, among the documents Schlicke was accompanying to Japan was a report on “the investigation of the usability of ultraviolet (invisible) light for transmitting messages or commands and particularly for the remote ignition of warhead fuses.”21 The report had been prepared based on research done from 1939 through 1941 by Hans Klumb and Bernard Koch. In suggesting that “the ultraviolet method permits the transmission of much more concentrated energy compared with the infrared method,” the inference is made that infrared was also being studied and was usable for similar purposes, though lower concentrations", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:96:d373b54ca3c3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5179, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 97, "text": "“the investigation of the usability of ultraviolet (invisible) light for transmitting messages or commands and particularly for the remote ignition of warhead fuses.”21 The report had been prepared based on research done from 1939 through 1941 by Hans Klumb and Bernard Koch. In suggesting that “the ultraviolet method permits the transmission of much more concentrated energy compared with the infrared method,” the inference is made that infrared was also being studied and was usable for similar purposes, though lower concentrations of energy made it problematic. Ultraviolet light, on the other hand, according to the same report, appears to have presented its own challenges to the task because it had a “stronger absorption rate.” Certainly nothing is proven regarding Schlicke’s fuses from this independent report, but the document appears to show the technology could be used for controlling the type of warhead detonation Luis Alvarez required for the plutonium bomb. The fact somebody named “Alvarez” was in contact with Schlicke and apparently involved in his and others of U-234’s passengers’ interrogations, seems to be more than a coincidence. And the fact “Commander Alvarez” was not actually perceived by Captain Fehler as being who he claimed to be, provides an interesting, if subjective, observation regarding Commander Alvarez. Fehler mentioned in his letter that Alvarez, who was his interrogating officer, “has always been correct, even when sometimes trying to press some knowledge out of me and to threaten me in a rather primitive way.” (sic) The statement that Alvarez was “always been correct, even when threatening in a primitive way” seems on the face of it to be incongruent. But if Alvarez, whoever he was, was not used to interrogating people – as Luis Alvarez surely would not have been – if he was doing his best without the interrogation skills required, would that not qualify as a primitive interrogation, too? Especially if the language in which you were describing the event – English – is your second language, as it was Fehler’s? But what about the identification of Alvarez as a Commander in the Navy? General Groves supplied military identities – uniforms, ranks and papers – to scientists Robert Furman and James Nolan, so they could escort the enriched uranium bomb cores to Tinian on board the USS Indianapolis without raising suspicion.22 Harlow Russ also recounted in his writings how a Major Vanna, an intelligence officer responsible for the technical crew of the plutonium bomb, always carried with him a cigar box full of rank insignias from every military service. He passed one to each of the team of civilian technicians to wear on their uniform-looking coveralls, so military personnel would not hinder them as they concluded their secret project.23 General Groves, himself, corroborated this story in his book Now It Can Be Told, when he recounted how each civilian in the 37-man team of the First Technical Service was required to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:97:ccaa3d874cbf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5180, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 98, "text": "the plutonium bomb, always carried with him a cigar box full of rank insignias from every military service.

First, according to Harlow Russ, who wrote in his book Project Alberta about his work on the team that assembled the plutonium bomb, two significant changes were made to the bomb design at the last minute. One was the development and inclusion in the plutonium bomb of “detonator chimneys”25 that were developed so late in the process they were not included in the first four shipments of equipment to Tinian, the Pacific airfield from which the bombs were dropped on Japan. The second design addition was a series of small-diameter stainless steel tubes called “hypodermics” that vented radiation from the plutonium core, according to Russ’s explanation, to allow the technicians to monitor activity at the core.26 Russ makes a point of stating both additions were new and just in time for the Trinity Test. These modifications suggest that very late before the plutonium bomb’s use, passages were being built into the bomb that, presumably, would allow the free flow of light waves throughout the device. Theoretically then, with these passages in place, once any one of Schlicke’s 64 repurposed infrared detonators was ignited in the bomb, the new system allowed waves – including infrared waves – to race at the speed of light through the “detonator chimneys” and “hypodermics” to the other infrared fuses to simultaneously ignite them all. Given the timing of the developments, from Alvarez’s arrival on the U-234 scene, to Schlicke’s special trip to retrieve the fuses, to Alvarez’s solving the timing problem so late in the process, and Russ receiving last-minute design changes apparently initiated to provide paths for the free movement of light waves within the bomb, such a scenario certainly seems viable. In an effort to substantiate or eliminate this theory, I tried to call Harlow Russ on the telephone at his home in Los Alamos to ask him about the detonator chimneys, venting tubes, and if in general, there were any significant changes to the actual detonators themselves. Unfortunately my call came too late; I was informed Mr. Russ had died in the few months between when I received from him his book and when I had developed the above scenario.

Dr. Delmar Bergen, retired director of the Nuclear Weapons Program at Los Alamos, is unconvinced of the idea the chimneys and hypodermics were used for the simultaneous flow of infrared light waves. His interpretation is they were used to vent heat generated by the radioactive plutonium core which, according to him, had the potential to heat and possibly sensitize the high-explosive, making it somewhat unstable and dangerous. This, of course, may be the case. It should be noted, however, that when I presented my findings during each of the four presentations I gave at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge about the infrared fuses and how I believed they were used, I was never challenged by any of the scientists or technicians that my interpretation was incorrect. I admit, however, that it may be. “The rapid and consistent release of electrical energy was a key part of the problem the (Los Alamos) scientists were experiencing triggering the detonators with the simultaneity necessary to achieve a clean spherical implosion,” explained Dr. Bergen. “The scientist Heinz Schlicke had knowledge of fast operating energy transfer systems…. There apparently is no written unclassified record available to provide us with what may have come from the debriefing of Heinz Schlicke but this we do know, over the summer months since his capture and the surrender of U-234 the confidence in the detonation system greatly improved….”27 The second factor suggesting the detonators used to fire the plutonium bomb came from or were assisted by Dr. Schlicke’s technology is indeed the striking success of the Trinity Test itself. Trinity was “successful beyond the most optimistic expectations of anyone,” wrote General Groves. 28 “Nearly everyone was surprised,”29 Robert Serber recorded. In his quintessential tome on the subject, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Richard Rhodes wrote that Trinity was four times its expected yield.30 What could have caused such a remarkable under-estimation by the experts? Those who knew the problems the system was experiencing in firing all of the detonators at once by mechanical means, but were unaware that fast-operating energy transfer systems from U-234 had become available, certainly would not have expected the profoundly superior results. The scientists were expecting a much less dramatic event. In fact expectations were so low, Dr. Bergen explained, a large cast iron containment vessel called a “pig” was created, inside of which they planned to detonate the bomb. The scientists were so unsure of the success of Trinity, they planned to capture the plutonium inside the pig if the test did not result in a nuclear explosion;", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:99:226d3c41147c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5182, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 100, "text": "U-234 had become available, certainly would not have expected the profoundly superior results.

The scientists were so unsure of the success of Trinity, they planned to capture the plutonium inside the pig if the test did not result in a nuclear explosion; which would have devoured the pig if it occurred, but the pig would have contained the plutonium if it did not. Just days before the event, it suddenly was decided the test was certain enough the pig would not be needed. Instead, the vast majority of those who witnessed the test were surprised by the power and efficiency of the explosion. That so many who knew what the outcome of the detonation should have been were so surprised by how efficient it actually was, tends to indicate Schlicke’s technology was used to compress the plutonium core at sufficient simultaneity to create a very powerful explosion.

More than a year after Glenn T. Seaborg, Joseph W. Kennedy and Arthur C. Wahl confirmed they had re-created an element2 heavier than uranium that had long ago disappeared from earth, Seaborg and his team, along with Italian physicist Emilio Segré, proved that the new substance would fission. The cleaving of this first man-made element allowed the great American nuclear braintrust a second, more sensible option than trying to pluck a small minority of nearly identical atoms from an otherwise homogenous body of matter, as was the requirement for enriching uranium. Plutonium was an element unto itself, with characteristics all its own.3 The difference was significant. Whereas separating uranium isotopes required devising methods to differentiate and take advantage of infinitesimal weight discrepancies between sub-microscopic atomic particles, plutonium was created by bombarding natural uranium with neutrons, morphing the uranium to plutonium as the neutron count increased. The plutonium then could be separated from the uranium simply by dissolving the mass and rinsing the solution with a chemical found to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:100:da37ec726a80", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5183, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 101, "text": "for enriching uranium.

The plutonium then could be separated from the uranium simply by dissolving the mass and rinsing the solution with a chemical found to bind with plutonium but not with uranium. As the “binder” later was separated away, the plutonium would be exposed for the taking. Such an explanation is a vast oversimplification but suitable for a basic understanding. The process was substantially simpler than enriching uranium. There still existed significant barriers to overcome, however; like, how could uranium be bombarded with enough neutrons to achieve production levels of plutonium? The cyclotron that Seaborg’s team used to create plutonium was far too small and neutron-anemic to produce anything but microscopic amounts of plutonium. And once the irradiated, plutonium-carrying slugs of uranium were ready to be dissolved, how could the task be accomplished without radiation poisoning the people assigned to work with the highly radioactive material? Plutonium, in theory, was a great solution, but its practical application would prove to be a prickly challenge in and of itself. The chemical differences, however, were not the only advantages plutonium held over enriched uranium. With U²³⁸ being 139 times more common in natural uranium than U²³⁵ , and plutonium being a product of neutron bombardment of U²³⁸ , it was possible to create much more plutonium out of an equal amount of uranium than would ever be possible to separate U²³⁵ from the mother substance.4 And conversely, even while more plutonium fissile material could be made faster and cheaper than enriched uranium, only one-third as much plutonium was needed for a bomb than enriched uranium because plutonium more readily fissions when exposed to thermal neutrons.5 More nuclear fuel, at higher quality, for less time and money – the advantages were obvious. Despite all of the time and effort and money being poured into uranium enrichment, pursuit of plutonium quickly became the primary objective of the Manhattan Project. The Manhattan Project’s scientific community rallied around the proposal. In fact, Ernest O. Lawrence, the father of the calutrons, plutonium’s “competitor,” led the charge in favor of plutonium with Oppenheimer’s blessing. ⁶In1941 , before isotope separation had been proven in the United States, Arthur Compton, Nobel laureate in physics and one of the original movers and shakers that made the bomb project possible, thought the plutonium alternative saved American bomb research altogether.7 Compton’s committee, in fact, recommended the creation of a central lab just to handle the development of a plutonium bomb. 8 Jewish-German war refugee Hans Bethe, whom one would have thought would jump at the slightest chance of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:101:76608a463c2d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5184, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 102, "text": "blessing. ⁶In1941 , before isotope separation had been proven in the United States, Arthur Compton, Nobel laureate in physics and one of the original movers and shakers that made the bomb project possible, thought the plutonium alternative saved American bomb research altogether.7 Compton’s committee, in fact, recommended the creation of a central lab just to handle the development of a plutonium bomb. 8 Jewish-German war refugee Hans Bethe, whom one would have thought would jump at the slightest chance of developing a successful bomb to be used against the Nazis – who had driven him from his home – had refused to join an atomic bomb research group. Bethe considered the creation of a bomb from enriched uranium impossible and therefore a waste of time. But when the plutonium option became available, he jumped into the project with both feet.9 General Groves, who received his assignment to lead the Manhattan Project in the midst of the plutonium option development, believed his best hope was to create a plutonium-fueled bomb10 and made it the number one priority of the entire program. All of this was well and good but plutonium research, though an excellent prospect, was “getting out of the blocks” late. Assessing a plutonium bomb’s legitimacy took time. An answer for the weak neutron bombardment problem caused by the cyclotron’s limitations was not found until almost the end of 1942. On 2 December of that year, Enrico Fermi’s research group successfully sustained the first man-made nuclear chain reaction during their famous experiment in a squash court under the bleachers of the University of Chicago’s football stadium. The astounding success meant neutrons could be released in unimaginable numbers, to be absorbed by U²³⁸ and thus transmute the uranium into plutonium. The success of Fermi’s plutonium breeding pile resulted in a major change of plans. While the original purchase of the property at Oak Ridge included plans to house plutonium development facilities, General Groves soon realized the risks of building production-size breeder reactors were too great for a highly populated area like Knoxville, which was close to Oak Ridge. A new reservation had to be found, far from large population centers and prying eyes. A site team was dispatched to locate such a property, visiting areas in California, Oregon, Idaho and Washington, and eventually returning to Groves with a recommendation – Hanford, on the barren, eastern plains of the state of Washington.11 Groves flew out to Washington and approved the site. But in February 1943, with barely two and one-half years left to successfully fulfill the future time objective (as yet unknown, since Russia was not showing any signs of declaring war on Japan) the property at Hanford was still in the process of being purchased.12 Construction on the site was officially begun 22 March, with a multitude of development, construction and research projects running concurrently, not only at Hanford, but at", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:102:d36bbe7ab2dd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5185, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 103, "text": "Groves flew out to Washington and approved the site.

By the end of 1943, however, the construction of the first reactor pile – so named because a reactor was simply a sophisticated pile of graphite blocks with uranium slugs and control devises inserted in holes drilled through the graphite – had not been started. Only eighteen months until the – then unknown – time objective, and still no production reactors were being built. Progress in the chemical process of plutonium separation was being made, with the proposal and eventual validation of bismuth phosphate as a plutonium binder to separate plutonium from uranium. Innovative methods in miniaturization and robotics, and to some degree television, which would lay the groundwork for the future high-tech industry and its resulting economy that would burst forth a quarter-century later, were being developed to perform the dirty, dangerous work of separating plutonium from its mother, natural uranium, without irradiating the people performing the tasks. And at Hanford, although reactor piles had not been started, great strides were already being made toward the construction of the mechanical aspects of the chemical separation facilities.14 The separation team had devised a semi-automated system where irradiated slugs would be dropped mechanically into a huge “trough” that contained the equipment and substances required to run the slugs through the series of steps necessary to dissolve the slugs and then to separate the different elements according to requirements. The trough was buried almost completely in the ground and was lined with huge cement walls and 20,000 tons of steel plate and cellulose, as well as 7,500,000 square feet of Masonite,15 all forms of biological shielding to protect operators from the dangers of radioactivity. At its peak, 42,400 construction workers plied their trades building the Hanford reservation.16 Even more than in the uranium enrichment program, everything was being thrown into the endeavor to make the plutonium bomb succeed. Still, the chance of producing more than just a few grams of plutonium in 1943, and not much more in 1944, even under the best of circumstances, was all they could hope for, according to General Groves. 17 Groves did not expect production levels of plutonium until 1945, and there were many doubts about that. The doubts were well-founded.

The doubts were well-founded. A year earlier, in the beginning of 1942, Seaborg had written that bombs were planned to be in production around the beginning of 1944.18 Obviously, that had not occurred. No plutonium was produced in 1943 at all at either Hanford or at the scaled-down experimental pilot reactor at Oak Ridge, which had been built as a working model to develop the Hanford technology. The Oak Ridge plant had been loaded with uranium fuel in early November, however, and went critical soon afterward. Los Alamos. But bomb-production quantities from Hanford would not be produced for almost another full year, beginning on 24 November 1944 (B reactor, the first to be fueled at Hanford, went critical 26 September 1944).20 Only eight months were left on the countdown to August 1945, at the time the first small quantity of production plutonium was created. Like the uranium enrichment effort, continual dilemmas and delays had slowed the plutonium program. A most serious problem, realized before production even started, was the low concentration of plutonium the initial pile design would produce.21 The difficulty, simply put, was that natural uranium contains so few U²³⁵ atoms, only one out of every 140 uranium atoms. These U²³⁵ atoms fission and release neutrons that in turn either fission more U²³⁵− continuing the chain reaction – or are absorbed into U²³⁸ atoms and thus transmute the uranium to plutonium, which is the desired end-product. But even after the maximum amount of fission occurred, after long weeks in the reactor when the U²³⁵ was finally spent, much more U²³⁸ remained that could have been transmuted to plutonium. Plutonium production, while better than enriched uranium output, was still woefully lean. Available records of the time appear to indicate the plutonium content of the initial Hanford discharge was so low the chemical separation process had to be further refined to optimize the product yield to an acceptable level.22 As early as 1941, however, Philip Abelson, a physicist for the United States Navy, had realized that using enriched uranium to fuel a reactor would make the reactor rich in free neutrons. The reactor would not only be more powerful, with a greatly reduced size requirement,23 but, most importantly, the modification would produce significantly more plutonium. From the beginning and throughout the Manhattan Project, all avenues to improve success were pursued. So it appears to be with efforts to increase plutonium yield.

Plutonium was the top priority for a bomb; and with a growing arsenal of newly developed technologies from which to draw, Groves and his advisory board appear to have made a logical and, one would think, obvious but very fateful, decision. Unknown to historians up until discovered by this author, they appear to have used the invaluable enriched uranium from Oak Ridge – which was fat in U²³⁵ that would provide the neutron flood needed to create significantly more plutonium per production run – to fuel the reactors at Hanford. The decision was not without risk and potential political fallout, however, and so its secrecy was vigilantly guarded at the time; and following later dubious developments, it appears to have remained carefully buried afterward, until now. The traditional history simply tells us that in early 1943, the Hanford reactors’ design was modified from helium-cooled piles to water-cooled piles.24 This was done to eliminate the need for building compressors and very technically demanding containment vessels for producing and using helium as a coolant. According to Dr. Bernard Wehring, Director of the J.J. Pickle Research Center for Nuclear Engineering at the University of Texas in Austin, 25 and Dr. Delmar Bergen, water cooling a pile would be used only to cool a reactor fueled by enriched uranium, not one fueled by natural uranium. Both scientists agree that water, while a great moderator to slow neutrons, also absorbs neutrons – as opposed to helium, which has no neutron absorption cross-section – and the water therefore is in competition for neutrons with both U²³⁵ and U²³⁸ . Therefore a natural uranium reactor cooled by water would produce less plutonium than would a helium-cooled pile, not more. The neutron-hungry water in the pile would consume the very neutrons needed to make plutonium. Fueling the reactor pile with uranium enriched in U²³⁵ , on the other hand, would increase the amount of free neutrons in the pile to a level that supported a high rate of fission, resulting in more neutrons for transmuting much greater quantities of U²³⁸ to plutonium, all the time feeding the cooling water’s appetite for neutrons as well. The water would be required to cool the more powerful enriched reactor, for which helium would be insufficient. The end result, depending on the level of uranium enrichment utilized, would be more plutonium per production run, and thus plutonium would be produced at a faster rate. Drs.

Wehring and Bergen both admit to not being historians of nuclear physics and that without knowing the full background of the Hanford reactors they could not declare with certainty the reactors were fueled by enriched uranium. But on theoretical grounds alone, neither of them could conceive of a case in which a natural uranium reactor would be cooled by water. The historical documentation does indicate, however, that natural uranium was used in the first run of a water-cooled Hanford pile. B-Reactor was energized on 26 September 1944 with 901 of its 2004 fuel tubes loaded with natural uranium metal slugs.26 Eventually, 2002 of its tubes would be loaded with fuel. Los Alamos scientist Eugene Wigner had calculated that a water-cooled, natural uranium-fueled reactor was viable if both the water and the graphite moderator were pure enough.27 Water cooling would alleviate the problem of constructing the very demanding helium-cooled system. Apparently the savings in time realized by building the water-cooled system would offset the more desirable non-neutron absorbing characteristics of the helium-cooled pile. But when the reactor first reached critical mass and was operated, within a day the chain reaction died.28 Reactivity did not cease directly because of the cooling fluid chosen, but because the reaction inside the pile had unexpectedly built up excess levels of xenon-133 and other fission poisoning elements that starved the reaction of neutrons, no doubt helped by the cooling water’s neutron appetite. As these daughter products degraded through the chain reaction process, the reaction began again in the pile; but as the technicians continued to load the reactor the xenon poisoning increased, continuing to reduce reactivity. The designers of the reactor realized the pile now needed higher levels of reactivity to overcome the fission poisoning. The original 1,500 fuel channels in the pile had been increased to 2004 in case of just such an emergency.29 Additional water-cooling channels now also had to be drilled to cool the extra fuel channels,30 adding again a higher neutron absorption factor. The process was becoming a careful balancing act between neutron absorbing elements and low-reactivity-yielding natural uranium. Would it not have been preferable to use a type of uranium that could overcome easily all of these reaction-stifling influences? Would it not be preferable to use U²³⁵ ? There is significant evidence that this is exactly what occurred. The first, very convincing piece of evidence that enriched uranium went into the plutonium program, is a memo written by J. Robert Oppenheimer on 28 July 1945.

The first, very convincing piece of evidence that enriched uranium went into the plutonium program, is a memo written by J. Robert Oppenheimer on 28 July 1945. In the document, Oppenheimer reports to the key leaders of the plutonium bomb project, Samuel K. Allison, Joseph W. Kennedy, and Robert F. Bacher, the delivery schedule of multi-kilogram-per-week – production level – quantities of 86.5 percent enriched uranium. 31 In it, Oppenheimer wrote: While the date of the report is too late for the shipments to have influenced the plutonium bomb dropped on Nagasaki, the fact that it proves enriched uranium was going into the plutonium bomb program in production quantities is evidence enriched uranium was used in reactors during the war. The huge quantities, from two to three-and-one-half kilograms per week, represent production-level amounts, not just experimental levels of enriched uranium. Additional documentation proves the experimentation required had been done long ago, but whether in experimental or production level quantities, either instance contradicts the traditional history. The tone of the communication also infers these deliveries were an expected and probably common event, and therefore had occurred in the past, as well. munications beginning in March 1944 between Samuel K. Allison, 32 once again, a co-discoverer of plutonium and one of the men listed in Oppenheimer’s memo above, and Oppenheimer clearly show that in the spring of 1944 the Oak Ridge reactor was being used to test enriched uranium as a reactor fuel. Apparently Phillip Abelson’s recommendations three years earlier were being explored. Allison’s plainly written communications reveal with certainty that experimentation using enriched uranium as a reactor fuel at the Oak Ridge pile was underway in March of 1944, over a year before the plutonium bomb was created and six months before the first Hanford reactor was loaded. By May, experiments had progressed to the point Oppenheimer, upon Allison’s request, asked General Groves to provide enriched uranium from production stocks for testing the build up of U²³⁶ in a pile using enriched uranium in the fuel.34 Have had request from Allison for one half gram of X of Y Twelve Alpha [Alpha was low-enriched uranium] product for experiment to be conducted at X [the Oak Ridge reactor].… We cannot supply this material from experimental stocks (period) We should be glad to provide it from production stocks but feel that we need your approval on this.35 history when it was being carefully studied and was so greatly needed.

Virtually all later reactors were fueled by enriched uranium or plutonium. Indeed, it is even documented that Hanford’s B Reactor was transitioned to enriched uranium fuel after the war, as the others certainly were, proving the modification could be done easily to the piles.36 With the need so great and the probability of success undoubtedly proven shortly after these early 1944 experiments, why would the decision to use enriched fuel be postponed until after the war, as the traditional history suggests? While Allison’s multiple references to irradiating enriched uranium in the Oak Ridge pile are the only direct documentation the author has found that expressly states enriched fuel was used in reactors during the war, the implication of a cover-up is seen in how this modification was later recorded for official history. H.D. Smyth, who wrote the first official history of the Manhattan Project, Atomic Energy For Military Purposes, 37 wrote that in the spring of 1944, “a change was made in the distribution of uranium” within the Oak Ridge reactor. Without mentioning enriched uranium, he goes on to describe how the uranium fuel channels were reconfigured with fewer uranium slugs in the middle so power could be increased without overheating the reactor pile. The result was reactor performance in June 1944 “considerably exceeded expectations.” To produce more plutonium with less uranium would have been highly unlikely, if not impossible, unless the uranium was enriched. And thus, it appears, is purposely hidden the real reason for the increased output – enriched uranium had apparently worked its magic. The timing of the reconfiguration of the pile in the spring not only coincided with Allison’s enriched uranium experiments, but the description coincides with a statement made by Dr. Wehring when such a reconfiguration was described to him. Dr. Wehring theorized that the core realignment would have been required to increase the size and/or number of cooling passages in order to control the additional heat created by the introduction of at least some enriched-uranium to the pile. In addition, although Smyth stated flatly the pile was run at higher power levels as a result of the reconfiguration, he never suggested the pile was expanded in size to achieve that increase. In fact, research shows no increase in the size of the reactor, leaving enrichment the only option. A third evidence that enriched uranium was used to fuel the Hanford reactors is the fact the fuel storage room and other fuel handling areas were marked with “Danger” signs.38 Natural uranium metal is not dangerous.

A third evidence that enriched uranium was used to fuel the Hanford reactors is the fact the fuel storage room and other fuel handling areas were marked with “Danger” signs.38 Natural uranium metal is not dangerous. Indeed, at the pilot reactor at Oak Ridge technicians worked very closely with the natural uranium fuel slugs, pushing the slugs into the fuel channels protected by nothing more than a cloth jumpsuit.39 Even enriched uranium metal is only radioactive to the extent that it is no more powerful than to burn the dead skin off a person’s hands. Hardly dangerous. But unlike the metal slugs made of natural uranium, if enough enriched slugs were assembled, the increased density of, and additional neutrons generated from, the U²³⁵ could instigate a chain reaction spontaneously. Since the word “radiation” was not allowed used openly at Hanford, “Danger Zone – Keep Out” was the prescribed signage that heralded radioactive threats.40 Placing a “Danger” sign, therefore, over the reactor fuel storage area certainly suggests more than natural uranium was being stockpiled as the reactor fuel. All of this information, the knowledge that the Hanford reactors were water-cooled; the revelation that six months before the first Hanford reactor was loaded, Oak Ridge was experimenting with enriched uranium as a reactor fuel; the memo from Oppenheimer to the heads of the plutonium bomb project apparently reporting multi-kilogram shipments of highly enriched uranium into the plutonium bomb project; and the documentation the fuel storage rooms at Hanford were protected with danger signs, all form a picture of enriched uranium being used as a fuel in the Hanford reactors. Other, less obvious, details of the Hanford reactors’ development support the probability the reactors were fueled by enriched uranium, as well. For example, the management of Hanford went to great expense and effort after the redesign of the reactor piles from helium- to water-cooled to remove an existing system designed to store radioactive waste by-products of the pile. In its place a system for extracting uranium from the effluent was installed.41 The reason given was to reduce the waste of uranium. But the cost of the modification probably far exceeded the value of the spent uranium salvaged – unless the uranium still contained residual amounts enriched in U²³⁵ . In that case, the inestimable value of the reclaimed uranium would have justified the expense of the reclamation project many times over. A similar reclamation process was already being used in the calutrons for the same reason. And shortly after the war ended, the system was discontinued, suggesting the successful plutonium bomb negated the need for the expense of reclaiming the entrained enriched uranium.

And shortly after the war ended, the system was discontinued, suggesting the successful plutonium bomb negated the need for the expense of reclaiming the entrained enriched uranium. Presumably, the reclamation system would not have been discontinued if the true reason was to reclaim spent uranium because of its value, as the traditional history insists. The spent uranium still would have been just as valuable. With a viable plutonium bomb, however, minute quantities of enriched uranium would not. Perhaps the reclamation system is yet another evidence the Hanford piles were fueled by enriched uranium. In April 1944 – again, note the time frame relative to Allison’s experiments in March of the same year – a purification system for Hanford’s reactors also was redesigned when “criticality requirements” were eased.42 The essence of using enriched uranium instead of natural uranium in the pile was to increase neutron activity to well above the level required to achieve criticality, for which natural uranium was just barely sufficient. Might a modification to the system allowing critical requirements to be eased herald a change regarding the type of fuel used? And lastly, just as when the Oak Ridge pile garnered an unexpected increase in plutonium output when apparently secretly using enriched uranium as a fuel, the chemical laboratory at Los Alamos experienced an unexpected increase in the output of plutonium received from Hanford also, straining the department’s resources.43 Estimates of plutonium product coming from Hanford should have been easy to calculate and reliable not to have drastically increased, unless something drastic had been done to increase plutonium output – something drastic, like fueling the reactors with enriched uranium. This unexpected upswing is particularly telling when one remembers the change to water cooling and the xenon-133 poisoning should have had an effect of reducing plutonium output of a natural uranium-fueled reactor, not increasing it. With so much evidence suggesting at least part of the calutrons-enriched uranium was sent to Hanford, it seemed logical the next step was to look for records of calutrons shipments of enriched uranium to the Hanford site. Reviewing the ‘documents findings lists’ I had copied during previous visits to the Southeast Regional Branch of the National Archives, where the records of Oak Ridge are maintained, I found the entry for a document or series of documents titled “Reactor Shipments.” The documents were listed to be in 67A1545, Record Group 326, Box 1.

I received a reply in July 1997 from archivist Charles Reeves, who said the referenced documents had disappeared from their file with no apparent explanation. This was the first of only two incidents during ten years of research within the National Archives and Library of Congress – reviewing thousands of formerly classified documents within a broad range of files and subjects – in which I came across records that were absent from their appointed place. I was stunned. How could such records be missing? Suspicious, but convincing myself to give the archive managers the benefit of the doubt, I chalked it up to an honest mistake of misplacing the documents, and thought no more about it. Until two years later, when another batch of missing records – to be summarized in a later chapter – were also missing. A batch that, like the “Reactor Shipments” file, suggest certain events and facts accepted by the traditional history may not be true. But the records required to prove it are now mysteriously gone. Not to be discouraged, and calculating that enriched uranium would have gone to Los Alamos for reduction into the reactor slugs before being sent to Hanford, I requested records from Los Alamos that would possibly identify the material reduced and transited. I was informed by Los Alamos archivist Roger Meade, that these records are still classified and clearance requires a Freedom of Information Act request and approval. Having spent almost one thousand dollars previously on a Freedom of Information Act request and receiving in return a large stack of papers with most of the information I was looking for still censored, by way of huge white blanks where strips of empty paper had been photocopied over the sections whose headings indicated they included the information for which I was looking, I chose not to pursue further. The next step would have been legal proceedings to force the archives to declassify the documents. The cost of such exercises is expensive and the results not guaranteed. I chose to save my money and my sanity. Perhaps someday, somebody with deeper pockets than I will pursue this trail.

Oppenheimer, 17 March 1944, A-84-019-16-8 he determination to use Y-12’s hard-won enriched uranium to power the Hanford reactors, like so many other decisions General Groves had to make in order to advance the program, must have been a fine ly balanced judgment, which is reflected in how he appears to have chosen to execute it. As has been outlined, only two options were scientifically feasible for creating an atomic weapon before the end of the war: a uranium bomb and a plutonium bomb. Technologies to create the bombs varied widely in some areas and were interchangeable in others but progress on all fronts was going forward. Research had shown that economically and technically, plu tonium was the better bet – faster, cheaper, easier. But the whole program was still a wager. Nothing was guaranteed. Even considering plutonium’s appreciable promise, Groves could not afford to put all his eggs in one basket. To cover all eventualities, the imperative still was to achieve independent success with each weapon. He simply must be careful allocating resources along the way – ensuring he had enough of the necessary materials to make at least one of each bomb – and then he could weight any surplus resources in favor of the preferred plutonium prospect. Such an intermingling of resources, however, could prove to be tricky. Enriching uranium came at a very high price in every form of currency, whether it was money, time, or the energy exerted to achieve the endeavor. It was the most valuable substance on earth.

Such an intermingling of resources, however, could prove to be tricky. Enriching uranium came at a very high price in every form of currency, whether it was money, time, or the energy exerted to achieve the endeavor. It was the most valuable substance on earth. Consuming the hardearned enriched uranium in an effort that failed, therefore, would be anathema to those powerful men who had invested so much into it and were counting so much upon it. Should the plutonium bomb fall short of success for whatever unknown reason, and the uranium program require more fissile material to produce multiple bombs – which was believed the requirement to achieve victory2 – the entire project could fail as a result of using the enriched uranium in reactors. The objectives of all involved would be thwarted. For Groves, the risks of taking enriched product originally intended for the uranium bomb and using it in the plutonium weapon must have seemed great, but worth taking; especially if the intermingling could be camouflaged from the eyes of those who had a vested interest in the success of the overall program. If no one knew that one program had been put at risk for the other, if either program failed it would be considered to have failed on its own deficiencies. While the brilliant brain-trust Groves had hired was ciphering the universe of factors and exponents, of calculus and algorithms, Groves’ decisions, though pressure-packed and frequently daunting, were usually solved using simple math and inspired resourcefulness. For example, each calutrons required a great amount of electro-magnetic energy, and there was a given number of calutrons at any one time; therefore, a huge amount of silver was required for the electro-magnet windings of the calutrons. Eventually, over 13,000 tons of silver was required for the calutrons3 (copper windings were not favored because silver conducts electricity more efficiently). Groves borrowed 13,540 tons of silver – normally measured in troy ounces, in this case 395 million troy ounces worth over $300 million – from the United States Treasury. A second, more logical, option took into account critical mass for the uranium bomb finally had been calculated at approximately 15ki− - lograms.5 He could have gauged the accumulation of enriched uranium so 15 kilograms, expected to be enough for one uranium bomb, would be on hand at a date early enough before the target drop date in August 1945.6 The bomb’s enriched uranium would need to be reduced to metal, fabricated into its sub-critical slugs, and the bomb assembled in time for use when required. And, of course, he would still need enough time to transport the weapon to the base of operations, from where it would be flown to its target for its", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:114:aa0eba5045af", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5197, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 115, "text": "expected to be enough for one uranium bomb, would be on hand at a date early enough before the target drop date in August 1945.6 The bomb’s enriched uranium would need to be reduced to metal, fabricated into its sub-critical slugs, and the bomb assembled in time for use when required. And, of course, he would still need enough time to transport the weapon to the base of operations, from where it would be flown to its target for its deadly delivery. Once he had made the calculations of how much enriched uranium per day would be required to accrue the 15-kilogram critical mass by, say, 1 May 1945, two months before the drop date objective, any surplus of the precious product could be invested in the favored plutonium-breeding reactors at Hanford. If everything went right, then in August General Groves could simply add the lone uranium bomb to his reserve of two or three plutonium bombs. Once the more prolific plutonium started being produced using the enriched uranium the cache would grow by one bomb every two to three weeks,7 compared to one uranium bomb every five months.8 He simply had to choose now to fuel the reactors with the surplus enriched uranium. Actually, both options fortuitously came to the same result. The rate of enriched uranium production as of the beginning of 1945 was setting a pace to be just at 30 kilograms around the beginning of May – 33 kilograms was actually achieved – according to the Beta Tubealloy Trioxide Transfer Report that documented bomb-grade enriched uranium production.9 If the plutonium bomb was granted half of the enriched uranium produced, by early May, 15 kilograms (33 pounds) could still be set aside for the uranium bomb – the amount needed for critical mass. Enough surplus enriched uranium would still be available for the plutonium project to receive 15 kilograms for feeding the Hanford reactors, providing a sizable boost to the more promising effort. First, based on assumptions recorded by James Bryant Conant at the beginning of 1945, Rhodes calculated the uranium bomb would eventually need “about 42 kilograms – 92.6 pounds,” which Rhodes then stated was approximately 2.8 critical masses. 10 In other words, critical mass can be calculated to be about 15 kilograms. At that time, nobody knew that three times that amount would actually be required for the uranium bomb, probably due to reduced efficiency due to contamination. Robert Serber, author of the quintessential textbook on Los Alamos, The Los Alamos Primer, which was the basis of all Los Alamos’ scientists’ orientation at the time, writes the amount actually used in the bomb was somewhat higher at approximately 50 kilograms.11 Serber also validates the 15-kilogram critical mass figure in a footnote.12 Rhodes stated later in his book that enriched uranium production achieved critical mass in mid-April 1945.13 One can therefore recap that critical mass was", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:115:a8b2dec680ea", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5198, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 116, "text": "due to contamination.

But Oak Ridge by then had enriched roughly 30 kilograms of uranium to bomb quality, according to the Beta Tubealloy Trioxide Transfer Report – twice the amount Rhodes records was reported as available at the time for the uranium bomb. In other words, half of the enriched material was gone and, outwardly at least, unaccounted for. Also suggesting Groves was dividing the enriched uranium between the uranium bomb and plutonium bomb projects is a document written at Los Alamos by Eric Jette, the chief metallurgist at the New Mexico laboratory. He wrote in a memo dated 28 December 1944, that “At the present rate we will have 10 kilos about February 7 and 15 kilos about 1 May.”14 Jette’s 15 kilograms estimate by 1 May falls almost perfectly in line with when the uranium bomb program reportedly achieved that milestone in mid-April. All documentation and predictions appear to agree on this point: only half of the enriched uranium processed was accounted for in the report stating that enough material for critical mass had been produced. But these discrepancies do not directly connect Hanford and Y-12. A document found at the National Archives and Records Administration Southeast Region in East Point, Georgia does. Proof that enriched uranium was shared between weapons programs lies in the memorandum (reviewed in Chapter Seven) written by J. Robert Oppenheimer to Cyril Smith, Joseph W. Kennedy, Samuel K. Allison and Robert F. Bacher. This document ties these plutonium program-dedicated personnel to the shipment of production quantities of enriched uranium. The memo, dated 28 July 1945, is four days too late to be discussing product used in the actual uranium bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The identities of the four men to whom it is addressed, the timing of the document, and its discussion of the amounts of enriched uranium being shipped, however, makes it relevant to this review. With the exception of metallurgist Smith, who helped fabricate both the uranium and the plutonium bombs, each man was in his own right a driving force in the field of plutonium bomb development, with little or no involvement in the uranium bomb.

Kennedy was a co-discoverer of plutonium and continued, with Emilio Segré, to research the radioactivity of the newfound element. Allison worked closely with Enrico Fermi on the first chain reacting pile in Chicago that made plutonium production a possibility, and continued the bulk of his research in the field of breeder reactors as it related to making a plutonium bomb. Remember, it was Allison who wrote to Oppenheimer identifying experiments using enriched uranium in the Clinton research pile and who requested additional production-level amounts of enriched uranium for further reactor experimentation. Although the memo was sent too late to be referencing material in the bombs dropped on Hiroshima or Nagasaki – the last shipment overseas had been sent four days earlier – the fact such large quantities of enriched uranium were being shipped at all is revealing, and begs certain questions. The favorability of the plutonium bomb had been proven two weeks earlier with the successful completion of the Trinity Test, eliminating the need for continuing the cumbersome and expensive uranium enrichment project. The plan almost since Groves took over was to focus all effort on plutonium, once it was proven. Why continue uranium enrichment if it was no longer needed and it was more expensive, inefficient to produce and a less powerful explosive? And what did they do with uranium that had been enriched in the time between when the first bomb’s needs were fulfilled and the successful Trinity Test? All that expensive enriched uranium had to be used somehow. Why not in the same way all other uranium was now being focused – in slugs to feed the plutonium breeding reactors, the enriched uranium providing significantly more productive output? In the memorandum, Oppenheimer reported the delivery schedule from Oak Ridge of uranium enriched to a level of 86.5 percent. There is no apparent reason for Oppenheimer to have reported enriched delivery schedules to these men unless enriched uranium was an important component of the plutonium bomb project. The memo appears a very direct validation of production quantities of highly enriched uranium being used in the plutonium bomb project. Metallurgical fabrication of uranium for both the uranium bomb itself and the uranium fuel slugs for the reactors was performed first at Chicago and then at Los Alamos. Given Smith’s inclusion with the others in the memorandum, for even Smith’s involvement was focused more on plutonium development than on the uranium bomb,15 it appears the enriched material referred to was intended for use in uranium slugs for the Hanford reactors.

Reactor fuel is not composed of bomb-grade enriched uranium but normally is enriched to only between one and five percent. The level of possible enrichment of the wartime Hanford reactors is unknown. Neither the Alpha nor the Beta calutrons, however, were so sophisticated at the time as to be able to control with any certainty their capacity to enrich uranium to a preset level. And considering the circumstances, it would have been risky and inefficient to produce anything but the highest enrichment possible. Instead, the managers of the calutrons must have found it most productive to make the highest-enriched product possible and then calculate the content of enriched versus natural uranium required in the reactor fuel to achieve the desired concentration, and mixed the two uranium stocks to suit the reactors. Such a controlled process, presumably, would have produced optimum results for plutonium output. As has been noted, sometime during the middle of April – Rhodes places the time between President Roosevelt’s death on the twelfth and his funeral on the fifteenth16 – Otto Frisch reported to Robert Oppenheimer the staggering fact that one critical mass, the amount just becoming available as the bombing target date was fast approaching, would not be enough to fuel a viable uranium weapon. No reason is given for the critical calculation adjustment but the culprit appears to be the purity of the enriched material. At its best the uranium was enriched to 90 percent, leaving ten percent either U²³⁸ or other, mostly non-fissile, elements, any of which would obstruct the efficiency of the chain reaction. To overpower the neutralizing effects of these contaminants and produce an explosion that justified the expense and reliance that had been placed in its potential, the bomb required significantly more than the 15 kilograms that was the minimum amount of pure U²³⁵ initially thought to be required. As has been noted, the quantity ultimately used according to Robert Serber and indirectly but roughly validated by Rhodes’ own calculations, was 50 kilograms – over three times critical mass.

While his historical references are extensively documented, footnoted and cross-referenced, he either fails to apply a similar standard for reconciling mathematical anomalies in his book; or he, like many other authors on the subject, chooses not to question unresolved discrepancies. Possibly he assumes any explanations for disparities are buried beyond the value of their pursuit, and the fact that history suggests they were resolved is explanation enough. Or, also understandably, he may have chosen not to pursue the incongruity as being outside the scope of his already massive work. Whatever the reason, the numbers, as has been demonstrated, do not add up. Oak Ridge, splitting its enriched uranium stocks between the uranium bomb and the Hanford reactors, had taken almost a year to provide the 15 kilograms available for the uranium bomb by May 1945. In an effort to produce the balance of the 50 kilograms needed, even at its top production capacity in that spring of 1945, the uranium enrichment program could only have produced seven or eight kilograms more between 1 May and 24 July. The twenty-fourth of July is the date General Groves, himself, gave as the last delivery date of enriched uranium to Los Alamos, 17 and this is corroborated elsewhere.18 Seven or eight kilograms added to the 15 kilograms already stockpiled was still less than half of the 50 kilograms actually used in the bomb. Even in a most drastic action, if contributions to the plutonium reactors had been discontinued and all enriched uranium produced from that time forward had been committed to the uranium bomb effort, the maximum possible enriched uranium available was just over five kilograms per month. Accumulated over the next three months of May, June and July, the total of another 15 kilograms added to the original 15 kilos would have made the material available for the bomb only 30 kilograms. The 50-kilogram uranium bomb still would have been short its enriched uranium needs by over fifty percent. A serious stumbling block had been dropped in the path of the uranium bomb. The second shoe dropped just a few days later. On 18 April, Norris Bradbury, the man assigned the responsibility of overseeing assembly and final testing of the plutonium bomb19 and who went on to become the post-war director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, reported in a memo that the program was experiencing serious problems with detonators.

The detonator problem had been a long-standing issue but those in charge thought it would have been overcome long before the spring of 1945. By now the faulty detonators as well as the delay of the Raytheon tests, combined with the shortage of enriched uranium, actually represented less the final shoe falling upon the program than one standing on the throat of the entire Manhattan Project. Test detonations almost never went right. Getting all 32 firing points to discharge at the same instant using clumsy electro-mechanical circuits of cables, wires and connectors proved to be almost impossible. If the timing was off by a mere fraction of a millisecond at any one of the 32 firing locations, the mass of plutonium at the center would be shot out of the undetonated hole, like a bullet out of a gun. The plutonium core would have been thrust out the low-pressure point caused by the failed detonator, driven by the shock wave of all the other detonator explosions that fired on cue. According to Luis Alvarez, even “the best detonators then available” were only achieving detonation waves spaced 10 to 20 feet apart, “rather than the required fraction of a millimeter.”21 This situation, so late in the game, was considered openly a crisis equal to the shortage of enriched uranium for the uranium bomb.22 Oppenheimer, back in October, had aggressively pursued a resolution to the problem and had assigned a three-man committee to “consult on the procurement of detonators to insure that the designs are satisfactory….”23 The first man listed on the committee was Oppenheimer’s old Berkeley buddy, physicist Luis Alvarez, who had transferred to the Manhattan Project from working on the development of radar and other high frequency wave applications. Two other key high-ranking members of the Manhattan Project staff, Kenneth B. Bainbridge and a Lieutenant Colonel Lockridge accompanied Alvarez on the team. Alvarez later would be credited with saving the plutonium bomb by developing a network of threadlike fuses that helped the 32 detonators instantly and evenly trigger the high explosives in near-perfect unison, compressing the core to critical mass and resulting in an atomic explosion.24 The “thread-like” description seems to parallel the network of “detonator chimneys” Harlow Russ described as being installed at the last minute to solve the fusing problem.

But for now, six months had passed since the creation of the detonator team – and only three months remained before the Trinity test – and clearly the detonators were still a serious obstacle to success. Alvarez and his team had thus far failed. And this, compared to the “Raytheon” dilemma, appeared to be only a secondary problem, although the two look to have been inseparably interconnected. According to General Groves, the main delay of the plutonium bomb resulted from the fact “the company manufacturing certain essential parts for a non-atomic assembly in the Fat Man (the code-name for the plutonium bomb) had been unable to meet delivery schedules.”25 Groves continued, explaining the delayed part hindered testing of the bomb “until a critically late date.” The unidentified component over which he lamented was the control unit for discharging the simultaneous firing signal for the detonators, known as “the X-unit.” Raytheon, the unnamed manufacturer mentioned by Groves but referenced by name in Bradbury’s memorandum above, was the maker of the X-unit. The device, which cost the equivalent of a Cadillac,26 was a sophisticated conglomeration of cables, switches, transformers, wires, condensers, capacitors and relays.27 The complexity of the instrument made it an engineer’s nightmare. It appears that X-unit manufacturing was delayed further and made even more complicated because, as the brains of the detonation system, it required that the type of detonators to be used be integrated into the X-unit’s design specifications, as seems is suggested in Bradbury’s memo. Surely in as precise a piece of instrumentation as the X-unit, detonator selection would be critical. But as late as three weeks before the Trinity test, the detonator to be used still had not been selected. As a result, modifications to the largely untested X-unit were expected to be made on-site just prior to the Trinity test.28 Whatever the case, the scientists struggled with the detonator and X-unit problem throughout the fall, winter and spring and still had not resolved it as the fateful summer of 1945 was unrolling. A raft of reports, memoranda and schedules, with addressees including Alvarez as well as those who received the enriched uranium schedule reviewed earlier, Bacher and Allison, flew from office to office as efforts were made to resolve the detonation problems.

The tests proved in early May, however, the detonators were still unsafe,30 with only two-and-a-half months left until the Trinity test. Finally, one-and-a-half months later, on 20 June, with less than a month until Trinity, X-units were scheduled to be delivered to Los Alamos for the Trinity test. But even these were not prepared for their final use. Apparently detonators finally had been obtained that could do the job, but for some unexplained reason modifications were still planned for the X-unit, even after delivery.31 In a memorandum written by George Kistiakowsky dated 6 June 1945, instructions were given that one X-unit was to be “modified, inspected, and made shippable to Trinity by 1 July. Two more units for Trinity should be on the Site (sic) by 1 July, and should be modified, and made shippable to Trinity by 7 July” (emphasis the author’s). Given Bradbury’s note regarding the interrelationship between detonators and the X-unit and the ongoing problems with the detonators right up to the end, which appear to be the reason for the X-unit’s delay, it is logical to conclude the modifications mentioned by Kistiakowsky were related to the new detonators. What was done to procure the new detonators is unknown, as are the last-minute modifications made to the X-units. But the timing of these important changes and the activities of Luis Alvarez during this same period may be very telling in regard to how the implosion-timing problem was resolved. Apparently, Luis Alvarez is the same Mr. Alvarez as the false “Commander Alvarez” who received Dr. Heinz Schlicke’s proximity fuses from U-234. As it also appears that the same enriched uranium so desperately needed to complete the uranium bomb was received from the gold encased stocks of uranium labeled ^(∞)U235^(′′) that Major Vance had taken from U-234. The facts appear to demonstrate that without the bomb materials surrendered with U-234, the United States’ atomic bomb effort to win the war by mid-August would have failed.

Besides the 63 members of her crew, U-234 carried twelve passengers, including a German air force general, two civilian specialized technicians, two Japanese officers who committed suicide when they realized U-234 would be surrendered, and a mysterious scientist, Dr. Heinz Schlicke . “I think it was about 14 April when I gave the captain a signal which read: ‘U-234.

The game went on all night; three times it was repeated”2 he fact U-234 arrived on American soil carrying 560 kilograms of uranium that was enriched and went on to be used in the bombs dropped on Japan can scarcely be argued any longer except by those who refuse to acknowledge the evidence. There also now exists a considerable case that infrared fuses – or other fast energy transfer sys tems – on board the U-boat were used in the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. But how did U-234 fall into American hands? Is it true the U-boat captain, Johann Heinrich Fehler, allowed two Japanese officers to kill themselves so he could surrender the U-boat, its contents and passengers to the United States rather than continue his mission to Japan? On what basis did he make such a deadly decision? Could U-234, in fact, have been surrendered as part of a higher level secret negotiation in which Captain Fehler, his crew, passengers and submarine were all simply pawns? There are numerous anomalies and inconsistencies in U-234’s voyage that suggest more was occurring than what is accepted in the existing history. On the other hand, there are references to escapes in U-boats and Allied tracking of enigmatic submersibles matching U-234’s description that deserve investigation. All of the evidence is circumstantial. None of it can prove anything conclusively about how U-234 came to be surrendered.

The following is a serious assessment of all that is known regarding U-234 and a surrender theory based on the evidence available. The conclusions cannot be certain until tied to explicit primary documentation, but the evidence is strong enough to suggest collusion at the highest levels between the United States and Nazi Germany governments – and that collusion extends down to those within U-234, its officers, crew and passengers – and has been maintained by powerful parties with vested interests on both sides of the Atlantic ever since. Laden with 240 tons of war materials, including, according to eyewitness reports and documentation, enriched uranium and infrared proximity fuses, U-234 was prepared for her maiden – and what would prove to be her only – mission. She had recently been equipped with a “snorkel,” Germany’s newest submarine device that under normal sailing conditions allowed its user to stealthily sail the Seven Seas without the necessity of ascending for air. The 24 mine-laying tubes on the boat had been remodeled as storage compartments. The outer keel plates had been removed and the keel duct was loaded with a cargo of mercury and optical glass before the plates were welded back into place. Two hundred forty tons of cargo destined for Japan was estimated by U-234’s officers to have been loaded onto the boat; and now it stood at the dock in Kiel waiting to make its desperate dash to safety. Fehler, like so many U-boat skippers, had begun his career fresh out of naval school on surface ships. He and his eventual first officer, Richard Bulla, brought a breadth of experience to U-234 that had been gained on one of the most famous war vessels – or infamous, depending on one’s point of view – in modern times; that of the German raider Atlantis. 3 In the early days of the war, the Atlantis4 had roamed the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans disguised as a ship neutral or friendly to Allied countries. Upon locating and approaching a vessel from one of these countries, Atlantis would unloose its six 150mm camouflaged guns and attack with torpedoes and its two deck attack planes, one of which was piloted by Bulla. 5 The ploy was usually so bold and unexpected the matter was over in moments and Fehler, who was the munitions officer onboard the ship and who had therefore earned the nickname “Dynamite,” would then apply charges that scuttled the captured vessel.

By such means Atlantis sunk or captured 22 Allied ships. The Allies eventually caught on to Atlantis’ tactics, however, and, its impact neutralized, the ship was forced to forego its actively belligerent role to be relegated to relieving other front boats with supplies and weapons. Even after Atlantis was converted from rogue warrior to surface supply ship, Fehler quietly carried within him all of those lessons of stealth and subterfuge learned in battle, to be used later while commanding U-234. Atlantis’ final foray has become legend. While tied to U-126 in the South Atlantic in a resupply maneuver on 22 November 1941, HMS Devonshire, a British cruiser, happened upon the boats. Dead still in the open water and intertwined in fuel lines, the two ships’ crews suddenly had to race to clear the umbilicals to have a chance at survival. Once free, U-126 dove to safety. With Devonshire bearing down on her, Atlantis was a sitting duck. To avoid capture of the ship according to standing orders, munitions officer Fehler, as he had done with so many enemy vessels before, scuttled his own ship, adding Atlantis6 to the list of vessels he had sent to the bottom of the sea. The 100 crew and officers who went into the life rafts were later found on the open sea by U-216, but there was no room in the U-boat for extra hands. Gross Admiral Karl Doenitz thought so highly of Atlantis and her crew, however, that he ordered two additional U-boats to aid the castaways and bring them home alive. The rafts were tied to these U-boats and the U-boats, traveling on the surface and moving excruciatingly slowly, sailed for France. The plan, should it be required by enemy attack, was to release the rafts upon approach of a hostile craft and allow them to float away, their occupants to be killed or captured, as the escorting U-boats dove for safety. Fortunately for Fehler and his 99 mates, the plan never had to be carried out. The three U-boats, the survivors of Atlantis in tow, successfully traversed thousands of miles of open ocean to ultimately reach France. The recovery of the Atlantis survivors now stands in the annals of naval history as one of the greatest maritime rescues of any military service.

To reduce the chance of being caught and bombed by enemy anti-submarine aircraft while vulnerable in the narrow, shallow waterway, U-234 sailed surfaced and at near-maximum speed down the narrow channel. Heading toward the entrance of the harbor, the submarine passed the towns of Laboe and Friedrichsort and then raced out into the open Baltic Sea, where a two-U-boat escort joined it. In Kiel, the loading of the boat had been completed and her massive hull sealed up for the journey. The crew of 63⁹ (25 percent larger than the average crew of a U-boat – even of this size) would eventually be joined by twelve passengers, including two Japanese officers, Genzo Shoji and Hideo Tomonaga, and enigmatic engineer Dr. Heinz Schlicke, as well as General Kessler and his retinue, according to the abstract of a secret U.S. intelligence report:10 Additional to our … [segment unreadable] shipped aboard [U-234]: a.

The presence of the important passengers, however, is unarguable. The message is one of several records, from both before and after U-234’s surrender, that details considerable information about the passengers – some of the data conflicting. Dr. Schlicke, for example, was dressed in a Luftwaffe (German Air Force) colonel’s uniform11 by some accounts. He was identified in other reports as both a naval officer12 (perhaps “honorary” according to Wolfgang Hirschfeld13), and as a civilian specialist in high-frequency and radar technology who was being transported to Japan.14 Although United States Navy records refer to him unambiguously as a member of the German Navy, with significant references to his involvement there, such references do not preclude the possibility that he actually worked for a different authority. According to U-234 head radioman Wolfgang Hirschfeld, Schlicke was aboard U-234 as an advisor/consultant for the U-boat’s radar system.15 Schlicke is documented as having shared his substantial intellectual services with Hirschfeld during the voyage. But he is also documented in many other capacities, as will be seen. Despite not knowing exactly who this man was, from all of the evidence available, his services extended far beyond submarine radar technology. As noted in the secret intelligence report, also on board was Kay Nieschling, who had been listed in the report as a naval squadron director. He was later discovered to be a Nazi bigwig and Naval Fleet Judge who, even as the Reich was falling down around him, was being sent halfway around the world on the now futile mission of trying traitors in the infamous case of the Richard Sorge spy ring.1 6 Richard Bulla, Fehler’s old mate during their daring Atlantis raids and rescue, was shortly removed from the passenger list and added to the crew as Fehler’s second-in-command. When the originally-assigned first watch officer, Alfred Klingenberg, was caught personally by Fehler in flagrante delictato with another crewmember, the Captain removed him from duty and assigned Bulla in his place.17 How Fehler’s old Atlantis mate Bulla came to be on the list of high priority passengers destined for Japan can only be speculated upon. Bulla had flown deck planes – short takeoff aircraft – off of Atlantis and had a wealth of experience earned on the raider during daring assaults on enemy targets on the high seas, and therefore was a valued and knowledgeable naval officer and flyer for such operations.

U-234 was full of jet aircraft and rockets – and nuclear bomb materials and technical experts of all kinds – destined for Japan. Japan was trying to find a way to deliver an offensive with teeth in the Pacific that could be successful turning the tide of the war in its favor, but the distances involved in island hopping to attack Allied bases were too great for round trip flights from its home islands. Allied air superiority also was keeping Japan’s less capable planes from having their way against them. At the same time, Germany was developing plans for its V rockets to carry atomic warheads,18 and to be launched from surface ships. And, according to General Kessler’s and Judge Nieschling’s later interrogations, Japan was modifying V-1 bombs with kamikaze pilot cockpits built into them, 19 and was quite possibly thinking of doing the same with V-2 and V4 rockets. Germany also had devised another plan for piggybacking a modified Messerschmidt 262 – the same type of jet that U-234 was transporting to Japan – as a bomber on a long-range Henkel aircraft for long-distance delivery of a bomb.20 Finally, plans for an airplane listed as the “stratosphere plane” were also aboard U-234, along with the plans and a fully assembled high-altitude pressurized pilot’s cockpit. Might Bulla’s naval piloting experience be valuable in devising a platform for launching ship-based German-made but Japanese-deployed atomic weapons toward Allied bases in the Pacific – part of what might have been a last-ditch but potentially unstoppable effort to win the war? Shortly after midnight, in the early morning hours of 26 March, U-234 and her two-U-boat escort joined three smaller Type XXIII U-boats and turned its course toward Norway. Her orders were to remain in the company of the three smaller boats until they reached the Norwegian coastal town of Kristiansand. The small flotilla traveled East below the island archipelago of Eastern Denmark, then North up the narrow neck of water between Denmark and Sweden. They passed Copenhagen while it was still dark and entered the wider body of water between upper Denmark and Sweden known as The Kattegat. Here the two-U-boat escort broke off and U-234 and her three smaller shadows crept up the Swedish coast, U-234 slowed by the 10 statute-mile-per-hour top speed of the Type XXIIIs.

At 3 : 00 p.m ., chief radioman Hirschfeld requested permission from the bridge to discontinue radar operations momentarily in order to change out a malfunctioning component. The bridge, after reconnoitering the surrounding sea and sky for enemy aircraft or warships, gave the all clear. The radar had been out of service barely 10 minutes when sirens screamed throughout the boat that enemy aircraft were approaching. Aware the newly installed component had a recommended 15 minute warm-up time, and not knowing whether the aircraft had spotted them yet, Hirschfeld turned to Dr. Schlicke, who had been observing the radioman’s installation procedure, and asked if it would be permissible to power up the radar system. Schlicke simply nodded. By the time the system was activated, the aircraft were within 5000me− ters, and by the time Hirschfeld sent word to the bridge, they had closed to 3000 meters. Fehler, who had already ordered the anti-aircraft guns manned, now gave the order to fire at will. Nobody responded. In the din of battle preparations the crew had not been able to hear the Captain’s command. As the air armada flew overhead 2000 meters to starboard, Fehler personally went to take control of the anti-aircraft guns for the return engagement. But the airplanes never came about; presumably, according to Hirschfeld, having never seen U-234 and its triple tail (which is doubtful since the radar of Allied aircraft flying at 10,000 feet could spot a normal sized – much less triple sized – surfaced U-boat as far away as 80miles²² ). The enemy air patrol may have been on a dedicated mission elsewhere and simply was not interested in the mini-armada. Or the aircraft may have been ordered only to reconnoiter the U-boats but not attack, an odd but plausible scenario given ensuing events. Whatever the case, the U-boats continued their course toward Norway. Just before midnight of the same day, the U-boat brigade passed behind a southbound convoy of German torpedo boats. Shortly afterward, those on the bridge of U-234 saw the convoy attacked by enemy aircraft and the resulting firefight was quite a spectacle. The screen of U-234’s radar glowed with swarming enemy aircraft attacking the small armada of surface ships. Fearful the planes would turn on them, and unable to dive because of the shallow, thickly mined waters, the crew of U-234 would have liked to race away; but obedience to the order to remain with the smaller, slower U-boats kept her at their sides. “I directed the radar beam directly on the attacker.

After thirty minutes there was another approach from the west, but … it disengaged at 3,300 yards.… The game went on all night; three times it was repeated”23 What could have caused the apparently willing and able assault aircraft to approach the small group of vulnerable U-boats but not attack? Under normal conditions any U-boat, but most particularly a group of U-boats, could expect a full confrontation in such circumstances. In addition, if Allied intelligence knew about the important passengers and cargo scheduled to travel on board U-234 – as the above-mentioned intelligence report and other intercepted radio transmissions make clear it did,24 – one would think every effort would have been made to sink U-234. There are examples. According to an article titled The Last Dive in the October 1999 issue of National Geographic Magazine, great efforts and risks had earlier been taken to sink a U-boat Allied intelligence had learned was traveling from Germany to Japan with a boatload of technology.25 Why not, then, also sink U-234, when its cargo and passengers were so important to Japan’s ability to continue to prosecute the war, and the British and Americans knew it? And when American forces in the Pacific intercepted a report of Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto traveling by aircraft near Bougainvilla, a squadron of fighters was sent to find his plane and shoot it down at all costs, which they successfully accomplished. Certainly if the purpose of U-234’s voyage – especially the transporting of General Kessler to Japan – was known by those controlling the attacking planes in Hirschfeld’s account, a similar attack to that on Yamamoto’s plane would have been made on U-234. That no effort was made to sink U-234, but several attacks appear, in fact, to have been suppressed, suggests that, instead of wanting the vessel and its contents and passengers destroyed, the U-boat was being monitored and its passage protected, for some unknown reason, at a high level within Allied command. Obviously, if U-234’s progress was being tracked and protected by the Allies, probably the crews of the attacking aircraft would not have known it. But if there were those in higher Allied circles who knew of and expected to obtain U-234’s uranium cargo, certainly they would have kept a close eye on its whereabouts and the conditions under which it was traveling – and had channels to the proper authorities necessary", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:130:01c9eab7fcee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5213, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 131, "text": "unknown reason, at a high level within Allied command.

But if there were those in higher Allied circles who knew of and expected to obtain U-234’s uranium cargo, certainly they would have kept a close eye on its whereabouts and the conditions under which it was traveling – and had channels to the proper authorities necessary to divert disaster if required. Without further information, one can only guess what those conditions were that caused the planes to approach at least three times – and apparently as many as five – and then cancel the golden opportunity to eliminate four enemy vessels at once. Fortunately, further information is available and will be reviewed later within these chapters. At any rate, U-234 was allowed to proceed, and the tiny armada slipped safely into Oslo Fjord just before sunrise of 27 March, and anchored at Horten, Norway. At Horten U-234 began trials of its newly installed snorkel device. Two days after arrival, during one of these trials the U-boat was accidentally rammed by another U-boat that was also undergoing testing. Both boats were slightly damaged. A dive tank and a fuel oil tank of U-234 were punctured but the boat was able to continue its testing for four more days, at the end of which Fehler steered his charge to Kristiansand in hopes of making repairs. A problem arose when it was realized placing the boat in dry-dock while it was so full of cargo may stress the heavily laden hull to the point of further damage. A resourceful solution was found. Since the damage was to the aft of U-234, the forward diving tanks were flooded, forcing the nose of the boat to submerge and the stern to rise out of the water. The innovative idea worked wonderfully and the necessary welding was completed without further problems. In the meantime, more passengers arrived in Kristiansand,26 including, according to Hirschfeld, General Kessler and his retinue, Colonel Fritz von Sandrart; Lieutenant Menzel, an airplane torpedo expert; and an engineer Klug. Including the two Japanese officers and other previously boarded guests, U-234 now contained 12 passengers and a crew of 63, a total of 75 people – almost 50 percent more than the average personnel load of the U-boat. Chief radio operator Wolfgang Hirschfeld reported that during the repair time in Kristiansand he personally traveled each day to pick up radio messages intended for U-234. During one of these visits he claimed to have received the following transmission: “U-234. Only sail on the orders of the highest level.

Fuehrer HQ_(↓)^(𝔫27) What occurred before and after receiving this cryptic correspondence, and what went through Hirschfeld’s mind as a result, he does not say, but certainly such a communication from the Fuehrer’s bunker directly to a specific U-boat, if true, is startling. Hirschfeld went on to write that when he returned to U-234 with the note and handed it to Fehler, the Captain’s immediate response, understandably, was to call for Kessler. The General perused the puzzling order and calmly predicted someone was coming from Berlin.28 “Probably the Fat One,” he lamented, immediately remarking that, if so, he (Kessler) would have to leave the boat. Hirschfeld, whether having heard it from Kessler’s lips or otherwise, suggested in his writing the allusion was probably to Hermann Goering, at that time Hitler’s heir apparent – though not for long. Kessler’s comment about disembarking U-234 if Goering was going to be along for the ride appears to validate the authenticity of Hirschfeld’s account of U-234, since it is a true, if little known, fact that Kessler and Goering disliked one another intensely.29 To put it bluntly, Goering was “out for” Kessler and, in fact, had demoted him five years previously from a diplomatic position to commander of an air wing during the attack on Poland. Traveling with Goering would have been a very unsatisfactory condition for the General, indeed, and one can be certain Kessler did not look forward to a voyage halfway around the world that would take months, stuck in tight submarine quarters with “The Fat One.” Still, Hirschfeld makes the unlikely but accurate statement regarding enmity between Kessler and his superior that validates what he has written. On that same afternoon, Hirschfeld and Second Watch Officer Karl Pfaff, who was responsible for loading the U-boat but otherwise seems an unlikely candidate to be requested to attend this meeting, were ordered to appear before the Flotilla Chief. After scavenging a pair of acceptable uniforms to wear before the Flotilla Commander, they made their appearance. The Commander placed a code green – top leadership frequency – transmission on the table before them and asked what the transmission was and how did it get on a tightly-controlled frequency. “Who is Bubbi?” asked the Flotilla Commander. Hirschfeld told the commander that Bubbi was “the head radio man of 10th Flotilla in Lorient, Bernhard Geissmann.” Apparently this was a lie intended to protect the identity of Bubbi.

For Hirschfeld then explained in his narrative that the U-boat base in Lorient, France had been captured by the Allies, and it would be impossible, he went on to explain, for the commander to verify who had actually sent the transmission and therefore determine who Bubbi really was. Such an explanation was strange and unnecessary if Geissmann truly was Bubbi. If Geissmann had been captured at Lorient, it would be a safe bet the occupying forces were not allowing German radiomen to send unscreened and/or personal messages on high-priority enemy frequencies. Considered in combination with Hirschfeld’s admittedly disingenuous explanation of the “Bubbi” message, however, and the day’s previous transmission received, as well as future transmissions yet to come, it seems more likely the message from Bubbi had a different purpose. Given the previous message from the Fuehrer’s headquarters and Hirschfeld’s odd explanation of the “Bubbi” message, it seems the two may have been connected. What was the origin of the cryptic communiqué? Arrangements may have been made prior to the U-boat leaving Kiel for any high-priority transmissions between U-234 and the Fuehrer bunker to be sent to a communications center at Kristiansand specially equipped to receive such high-level messages. Apparently these transmissions were sent to a specialized communications center the frequencies of which U-234 was incapable of receiving, or to keep the confidential communiqués from the knowledge of the regular U-boat command. Once the initial contact had been made, per plan, then Hirschfeld could inform the sender in the Fuehrer bunker of U-234’s location and provide contact information for future correspondence. In response, the mysterious messenger in the Fuehrer bunker could then define a plan for further confidential communications on more open channels, using a code name – Bubbi? – for verification without revealing the sender’s actual identity. Shortly thereafter, apparently still on the same day, Hirschfeld was called to return to the radio station for yet another message. This one read: “U-234 is to leave under my command only. After you have made your calculations, leave. BdU.”30 BdU was the personal command designation of none other than Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz, commander of the German U-boat navy. This transmission is documented not only by Hirschfeld, but in the United States National Archives by OSS records of intercepted German transmissions.31 Doenitz’s message alone makes clear a struggle for control of U-234 was taking place, for, as the supreme commander of the German Navy, why else would the Admiral have to remind one of his captains to depart only on his command?

In fact, Hirschfeld identified this struggle directly, commenting that Fehler remarked when he heard of the order, that Doenitz “doesn’t let himself be submitted to the top leaders’ orders.” Apparently, Doenitz by this time had become aware of the plan to use U-234 as an escape vehicle for very high-ranking Party officials at the Fuehrer’s headquarters. Possibly the communications center commander had seen through the inconsistencies in Hirschfeld’s story about the mysterious ‘Bubbi’ message and informed Doenitz. Whether Doenitz’s determination to keep control of the boat was an effort simply to maintain proper chain of command while still helping to implement an escape plan, or whether his efforts to control the U-boat were to obstruct the plan, is unknown. The latter is doubtful given later history. Ultimately, history records Martin Bormann from the besieged bunker in Berlin spent considerable attention on negotiations with Doenitz in order to affect his escape from the strangling city. And it records Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz, without political experience or, indeed, any political following, eventually and very unexpectedly replaced Hermann Goering – whom Bormann had succeeded in bringing down as Hitler’s successor – when Bormann notified Doenitz that the Admiral was to succeed Hitler as Chancellor of the Third Reich. 1 Geoffrey Brooks and Wolfgang Hirschfeld, Hirschfeld: The Story of a U-boat NCO 1940- 1946, p. 203; also see Wolfgang Hirschfeld, Feindfahrten, p. 357 2 Geoffrey Brooks and Wolfgang Hirschfeld, Hirschfeld: The Story of a U-boat NCO 1940- 1946, p. 202 3 U.S. National Archives II, Report On Interrogation Of The Crew Of U-234 Which Surrendered To The USS Sutton On 14 May, 1945 in Position 47°-07’N – 42^(∘) -25’W, RG 38 – 370 15/09/01 box 2 4 Robert K.

By the last days of April 1945, the Russians had pressed their advance to the outskirts of Berlin, almost completely surrounding it, and with the winking approval of the Americans and English had begun pummeling the symbolic center of Nazism under a steady, 24-hour-a-day barrage of artillery fire. The war-wearied, ghost-faced resident survivors huddled forlorn and resigned in the subway tunnels as the constant thunder of shells rattled whatever structure was left overhead that separated the destitute and despairing from destruction. The warren-like underground bunker that constituted the Fuehrer Headquarters seemed little more than a living tomb. To make matters worse, in the claustrophobic confines Hitler’s moods swung desperately between raging paranoiac psychopath and drugged derelict. Numb from the imposing reality of abysmal failure, exhausted by unremitting pressure, partially paralyzed from a minor stroke suffered while in the bunker, though still officially in command, the Fuehrer was far from the commanding figure he once had been. Holed up almost continuously in his private quarters inside the bunker, the inner sanctum of the warren – actually a cell within this self-induced prison – he alternately snarled at and viciously attacked what remained of his loyal commanders and staff, and drifted in and out of exhausted and drug-induced stupors. The former great ones – ministers, generals and admirals, territorial governors – shuttled in and out, putting on the faces of devout supporters sacrificing their all to sustain their leader. Actually, behind his back they were planning to flee the terminal tomb at the first opportunity and slide silently from the heinous history they had helped write into some foreign backwater where they would be forgotten. Those who remained were the ill-fated, lower-level staffers who shuffled quietly up and down the dimly lit concrete corridors in support of their beleaguered Fuehrer and a few of his closest high-ranking courtiers. Most of them were there under orders, but they were loyal to the last.

Most of them were there under orders, but they were loyal to the last. The atmosphere, emotionally as well as physically, was hardly breathable. News was never good. In the final stand for Nazism the old men, young boys, and walking wounded who defended the city were experiencing few successes but massive desertions. The city was being given up inch by inch at great cost – half a million people would die in the battle. Reports of Russian atrocities, rape and torture of the captured were legion. The inevitable – the unspeakable – was morosely moving toward these doomed dependents of Hitler and there was little one could do to halt the inescapable. Everyone despaired. Martin Bormann’s legacy is simply that he is a legend – in the truest, most nebulous sense of the word. Within a few short years, far fewer than your average myth, he became an apparition in history. He is no more, in many people’s minds, than the fearsome fantasy of conspiracy theorists and the lugubrious legend of Nazi hunters. To talk seriously about Martin Bormann with any earnest historian of World War Two is to learn that Bormann is persona non grata. Not that they contend he never lived, but since they cannot clearly define the limits of his life and power, despite volumes of hard evidence that he was, indeed, among us here on earth, and that he personally managed most of the Third Reich for Hitler, there is almost nothing identifying the palpable essence of the man, or the extent of his reach and power, or the limits of his life. Often the evidence that does exist holds Bormann in such rare circumstances and implausible activities as not to be credible at all, such as his financing, masterminding the development of, and building Berchtesgaden, Hitler’s matchless mountain retreat; or his clandestine control of such Reich royalty as Heinrich Himmler and Rudolf Hess; or his monetary manipulation of the Reich’s entire economy; or his oversight of one of Germany’s most innovative – and secret – research and development laboratories. But these are what is known about Bormann’s life. The differences between what was real but fantastic in Martin Bormann’s life, compared to what is believable but fantasy, are minimal and often interchanged. This is why present-day historians turn pale when Bormann is spoken of or written about in more than passing terms.

This is why present-day historians turn pale when Bormann is spoken of or written about in more than passing terms. What is less sure than the above, but for which there exists a considerable body of evidence not easily refuted, is the apparent extension of his life beyond his reported death – and the ensuing inculcation of his influence into areas many do not want to consider, much less admit. They can find few cold facts that cut through the quagmire of questions about his existence and the number and depth of the roles he played. Martin Bormann’s mystique over the years has been so widely nurtured and grown to such immense proportions that one must remind ones’ self the actual man named Martin Bormann did exist – not just as a mysterious motivating force during the war and a phantom fugitive after – but that he was, indeed, responsible for much of the Third Reich. His alleged escape at the end of the war, and the mystery that has since arisen around him and his ultimate fate, have grown to cast a shadow far bigger than the even larger-than-life man. His is a shadow that absorbs any light that present-day researchers try to shine into it – so, feeling foolish for trying, they choose not to. Perhaps that was the intent. Martin Bormann’s aura feels similar to, though greater and deeper than, those of other fugitives who floated through that Nazi netherworld before their elusive existence was drawn back into human form as they were drug, kicking and scratching, back to the real world – becoming once again flesh and blood. Adolf Eichmann, Klaus Barbi, Franz Stangl, even the “Angel of Death,” Dr. Joseph Mengele, now almost inexorably proven and universally believed to have survived his Holocaust role to live in Paraguay for many years after the war, all appeared from those mysterious mists to again take their human forms – dragged back by daring and persistent seekers of truth and justice. Will the efforts of such researchers as Paul Manning, Hugh Thomas and even Ladislas Farago – once castigated for having accepted fraudulent evidence, much of which recently has been proved to have merit1 and thus greatly rehabilitated post-humously Farago’s titan effort – be amalgamated at a future inflection point to bring Martin Bormann back to life, as well? During the last days of Nazism, this Machiavellian minister to the Fuehrer – hardly known outside the close cortège of Hitler’s inner circle at the time – with characteristic energy, focus and determination, in contrast to and quite unconcerned about those around him, was constantly sending and receiving radio transmissions from the bunker", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:137:c2e5e9878d07", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5220, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 138, "text": "have merit1 and thus greatly rehabilitated post-humously Farago’s titan effort – be amalgamated at a future inflection point to bring Martin Bormann back to life, as well?

True to Bormann’s pragmatic proclivities, in addition to, or as part of, working out his escape, he is known to have been undermining or negotiating with others of Hitler’s henchmen for control of the Reich – apparently confident there would be fragments of the Reich worth controlling after the war, despite the bleak outlook for Germany. Most students of these events have considered Bormann’s machinations as madness, given the Reich was in its death throes. But upon closer scrutiny of his actions and review of the evidence and outcomes, it appears Martin Bormann was working a master plan for a resurrection of Germany after the war, with Hitler’s consent – and within which U-234 played an important part. Understanding the low-profile but very powerful Martin Bormann in Hitler’s court is a vital key to understanding Hitler and his power over the masses, not to mention the Nazi Party and the Third Reich – and, more important, to understanding events at the end of the war. Bormann’s postwar activities – for the evidence is very strong that he did survive the war, with American help – and the impact they had on the Nuclear Age must be considered in the light of his prior behavior, so we can begin to pierce the shadows of his mystery. British historian Trevor Roper-Smith called Martin Bormann, “Hitler’s Mephistopheles,” his “alter ego,” his “evil genius.” Bormann was known in Hitler’s inner circle as “The Brown Eminence” behind the Fuehrer’s throne.2 The very fact this one-time farm supervisor should, with Hitler’s approval, climb to manage the barbarous Nazis’ affairs of state speaks volumes of the exceptional political and financial acumen this sinister Shylock possessed. Hitler eventually came to rely on and appreciate his most trusted lieutenant’s talents so much that Bormann – despite almost no military experience – was not only made an honorary major general of the SS but he was awarded SS number 555 – Hitler’s own original SS number.3 Bormann in return fawned on his Fuehrer embarrassingly yet unapologetically; writing nearly every word of Hitler’s on small white cards he carried at all times. He seldom took vacations or trips of any kind that would separate him from the Fuehrer for more than just a few days, for fear of losing court status. “Bormann stayed with Hitler night and day,” Hermann Goering later recounted,4 “and gradually brought him under his will", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:138:4f114f9a9e94", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5221, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 139, "text": "number 555 – Hitler’s own original SS number.3 Bormann in return fawned on his Fuehrer embarrassingly yet unapologetically; writing nearly every word of Hitler’s on small white cards he carried at all times. He seldom took vacations or trips of any kind that would separate him from the Fuehrer for more than just a few days, for fear of losing court status. “Bormann stayed with Hitler night and day,” Hermann Goering later recounted,4 “and gradually brought him under his will so that he ruled Hitler’s whole existence.” Even though serving as his master’s slavish lap dog – in fact, because of it – Bormann came to wield complete authority over the Reich. He accomplished this accumulation of power in a variety of ways, virtually all of them stemming from his position with Hitler. He had access to and kept copious files of evidence and materials aimed at exposing for some misdeed or another, if needed, almost every person of authority in the government, military or the party – including Hitler himself. He also discreetly distributed low-interest or no-interest loans from party coffers,5 some that did not require repayment, to those whom he felt it would be advantageous to have indebted to him, such as SS leader Heinrich Himmler, who accepted from Bormann millions of reichsmarks per year.6 The powerful group of 41 Gauleiters, the “governors” – actually virtual dictators – of the Reich’s various “states” or “provinces,” reported directly to Bormann as head of the Nazi Party. He cultivated and maintained a strong relationship with this group collectively and many of its most powerful members individually, throughout his tenure until the end of the war. Bormann’s position as Reichsleiter of the Nazi Party also made him, in theory at least, the second most powerful man in the Reich. At party rallies as early as 1934, Hitler had declared the party gave orders to the government, not the other way round.7 Later interrogations that were part of the Nuremberg Trials verified this relationship.8 The party, therefore, controlled the government, and Bormann controlled the party. The Reichsleiter underpinned his power-base by duplicating within the party almost every function required and operated by the viable government. In essence, Bormann created and held the strings to a very powerful “shadow bureaucracy,”9 complete with its own police force – the Gestapo – and its own army – the Wehrmacht SS – both under the direction of one of Bormann’s chief accomplices, Heinrich Himmler – and the 1 millionman-strong Volksturm. 10 Bormann was ruthless in his quest for power to the point that his one-time boss, Nazi Party Treasurer Schwartz, compared him to Joseph Stalin lurking behind Lenin, saying, “Bormann was the most pernicious egotist around…. He would kill, like Stalin.”11 Author William Stevenson echoed that sentiment in his book, The Bormann Brotherhood, also comparing Bormann to Stalin,12 as have many authors and historians since.13 In", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:139:dfc407b9fbf2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5222, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 140, "text": "of one of Bormann’s chief accomplices, Heinrich Himmler – and the 1 millionman-strong Volksturm. 10 Bormann was ruthless in his quest for power to the point that his one-time boss, Nazi Party Treasurer Schwartz, compared him to Joseph Stalin lurking behind Lenin, saying, “Bormann was the most pernicious egotist around….

Their personalities and psyches fully understood and intermeshed with one another across the complete spectrum of power-overthe-masses leadership they practiced – and recognized in each other the exceptional counterbalances of their strengths and weaknesses. Where Hitler’s highly effective political acumen and charisma failed, Bormann would use his web of intrigue and bureaucratic power to achieve the desired end, explains Bormann biographer Jochen von Lang. 14 Whether Bormann on his climb to the top astutely identified Hitler’s deficiencies and determined consciously to fill them himself, or whether the marriage was simply a fortuitous match of fate personality-wise, will probably never be known. Eventually this symbiotic compact – whether spoken or unspoken nobody knows, either – gave Bormann the confidence he needed to take the bold step of cordoning off the Fuehrer from all others, to be accessed only through him who would become “the dictator of the ante-room”15 – Bormann himself. In 1943, Bormann successfully convinced Hitler – based on their co-dependent relationship and the fact Hitler, who had appointed himself Supreme Commander of the Army and was spending all of his time and energy personally running the German war effort – to sign a decree appointing a Committee of Three, 16 composed of Bormann and two others, to oversee the everyday operations of the Reich and to screen the Fuehrer from unwanted distractions. All communications, reports and requests intended for Hitler had to pass through the Committee of Three first. In typical Bormann fashion, he then subjugated the other two committee members and controlled all information coming to and going from the Fuehrer. 17 Combined with his position as head of the Nazi Party, which was already operating in proxy for the federal government, which in turn was now nothing more than a shell, Martin Bormann had solidified his hold as the second most – some said the most – powerful man in The Third Reich. “I studied Bormann’s technique with Hitler and realized he controlled the Fuehrer!” recorded the chief of the Nazi foreign intelligence service Walter Schellenberg. 18 Bormann was “the secret master of a despot,” according to Hitler courtier Hans Frank. 19 “Everything had to be done through this sinister guttersnipe,” complained Hitler’s own General Chief of Staff Heinz Guderian. 20 While Martin Bormann’s name, position and the profound power he wielded in Nazi Germany", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:140:c4b43892d705", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5223, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 141, "text": "most – powerful man in The Third Reich. “I studied Bormann’s technique with Hitler and realized he controlled the Fuehrer!” recorded the chief of the Nazi foreign intelligence service Walter Schellenberg. 18 Bormann was “the secret master of a despot,” according to Hitler courtier Hans Frank. 19 “Everything had to be done through this sinister guttersnipe,” complained Hitler’s own General Chief of Staff Heinz Guderian. 20 While Martin Bormann’s name, position and the profound power he wielded in Nazi Germany are almost unknown to the average person – and such was the case even when Bormann was enjoying unequaled fraternity with Hitler as his Nazi Party chief, administrative right-hand man and personal paladin – those close to the Fuehrer at the time, to a man, understood that the key to Hitler during the mid- to late-war years, and possibly earlier, was clenched firmly in Bormann’s fist. To understand how Martin Bormann possessed the power at the end of the war to negotiate away Nazi Germany’s developing atomic arsenal in order to sustain himself and the Nazi cause after the war, one must understand this symbiotic relationship between him and Hitler. The defining elements of their lives, sometimes detailed in mirror-like reflections and then sometimes balanced by what seem like polar opposites, while at other times punctuated with bizarre and unequaled uniqueness, are as striking as the surprisingly complementary nature of their beings. That two men who were so well fitted for forwarding each others’ individually rare ambitions along with their mutual objectives found one another hardly seems probable. Yet the peculiarities they shared and the differences that filled the holes where each was lacking resulted in two remarkably compatible counterparts – although not psychologically healthy ones. Adolf was born – the result of a third marriage – who beat his son and wife, squandered the family money on alcohol, and taught through his actions that “right” is always in the hands of the most powerful. Adolf Hitler learned this lesson – and how to hate – from his father, for whom he grew great loathing and animosity. Martin Bormann was the son of a civil servant, too, a German postal worker.22 But while Hitler hated his father and had only one sister, younger than he, Bormann adored his father and paid homage to him, often to the point of heaping upon his memory blatant and unearned exaggeration of his achievements. Holding his father in such reverence was undoubtedly the result of Martin not really having known his father, who died when Martin was less than three years old.23 The elder Bormann had actually lived a simple, ordinary life, had been married once previous to his marriage to Martin’s mother and had sired three children (one died in infancy) from that early union.

Upon his death his widow, to support her two natural children and the two step-children she had inherited from her husband’s previous marriage, quickly remarried her own dead sister’s widowed husband. Bormann’s new stepfather brought five children of his own, Martin’s cousins, into the now hodgepodge family. Martin immediately disliked this intruder and his gaggle, whom he considered was trying to take his father’s place. The feeling was later exacerbated when, during the hardships caused to all Germans during World War One, rather than serving in the armed forces, his stepfather, the town banker, gloated over the money he was making from war lending. Martin’s enmity for the man and his unseemly behavior, however, did not keep Bormann during the next world war from indiscriminately emulating similar war profiteering conduct, but on a much grander scale. The two men remained distant throughout their lives. The lack of respected father figures, the eclectic and tangled family trees and the distorted relationships these conditions fostered must have been the source of much unusual and perverse psychological programming for young Adolf Hitler and Martin Bormann. Thus in the Petrie dish of dysfunctional families and flawed fatherhood were the psychotic psyches of these two men born. Both Hitler and Bormann, in a society that valued highly the Germanic ideals of education and intellectual achievement, dropped out of high school, neither one achieving consistently good performances in their matriculations but both showing flashes of real genius in the disciplines they personally enjoyed. Hitler, molded by the heavy hand of his abusive father, extended the unmitigated malice resulting from this excessive behavior to all authority figures he faced, which caused him trouble in the classroom. He was ejected from a catholic school for defying a no-smoking rule, overbearingly insisted on being the leader among his classmates despite any hint of trying to earn such a position or the respect that goes with it, and openly “sabotaged completely,” in his own words, any school endeavor not to his liking.24 He later vilified or otherwise repudiated as stupid or crazy educators in general, making exception only for Dr. Leopold Poetsch, a fervent German nationalist, among all the teachers of his childhood. German pre-World War One schools, most particularly in the Weimar region where Bormann grew up, were teaching a searing brand of nationalism, pan-Germanism and German cultural superiority, too.25 Like every other youngster in Germany at the time, Martin Bormann was steeped in this doctrine whose spirit swept the German nation right up and into the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:142:ff5b2a81d606", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5225, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 143, "text": "as stupid or crazy educators in general, making exception only for Dr. Leopold Poetsch, a fervent German nationalist, among all the teachers of his childhood.

Bormann absorbed the nationalistic fervor and carried it within him throughout his life, though in his case, as in Hitler’s, it would grow in a monstrous, mutated form. A patriotic appreciation, in whatever form and however important to his later life, was one of the few benefits Bormann would receive from his schooling. While later events proved he was anything but stupid, in the classroom, for whatever reason, he appears to have struggled. Using dates he later provided in government documents and applications, it appears Martin Bormann took eight years to complete seven grades, apparently also sabotaging his own education; and he exited high school without having graduated, as had Hitler before him, after the eleventh grade.26 Driven by visions of grandeur and a staunch belief in his own genius, at the age of eighteen years Hitler left his widowed, incurably ill mother in the town of his childhood and moved to Vienna to become an artist. He wandered the streets of the metropolitan city, painted, dreamed and starved. He was rejected for acceptance at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts when he failed the entrance examination, a rejection he never forgave, and for the next half-decade he wandered the streets, took small jobs, painted and sold his artwork in the streets when he could, and panhandled for food and shelter when he could not. His “genius” unrecognized and expectations of riding his talent to easy wealth and fame thus unfulfilled, Hitler looked outside himself for the reasons for his failure. The blame, he decided, lay in Germany’s weak parliamentary democracy, that, in his estimation, allowed Jews to control and therefore to own its economy and thus disenfranchise the rightful heirs of the fruits of that government, those of Germanic blood. Because so many Jews at the time supported Marxist ideals, he deduced the two parties were colluding on a grand scale to control the world. Communism joined Jewry and democracy as causes for his failings and, in his mind, the failings of the German race. Where his father taught him to hate, and disemboweled dreams magnified this malevolence, Hitler now had a focus upon which to aim his virulence.

On the crucible of the battlefield he found the vehicle to vent his rage – war. Serving in no less than forty-seven battles in a four-year span, Hitler was wounded twice, for which he spent several months in recuperation and earned the Iron Cross, both First and Second Classes.27 Although never rising above the rank of corporal during the four war years in which he served, he showed an inkling of the boldness for which he would later become known when he captured an enemy officer and fifteen of his men. During the war, a new vision began to form in Hitler’s fevered head. The images that once he placed on canvas were now being replaced with a skewed vision of how the world should be ordered. Soon his brushes, pencils and painter’s palette would be replaced by more formidable media – death and destruction: grenades and guns and tanks, with which he would paint a new and very real picture of what he thought the world should be. “Might is right!” Quitting school during the closing months of the war, Bormann joined the army and spent what few months remained of the already-lost conflict avoiding a useless death by serving as an officer’s orderly. Here he learned not only how to evade placing himself in harm’s way but, enamored with his proximity to important people – in fact, tutored by them – he began his lifelong avocation, which migrated into a vocation, of licking the boots of those higher than he in order to get ahead. The instinct was one that Hitler, who as a school boy had insisted all others follow him in the game of Follow the Leader, would later enthusiastically acknowledge was the most essential characteristic of his most valued and trusted lieutenant, Martin Bormann. One should not consider Bormann’s position that of weakness. The power that flowed through him from his master and protected him by virtue of his slavish alignment with his master’s wishes was unequivocal and untouchable by all others save the source of that power. As long as Bormann remained unquestionably attentive, the powerful host would continue to feed the parasite. And the parasite would continue to feed on the throng that was drawn to his master while at the same time forcing that throng to do their master’s bidding. Bormann’s parasitic behavior was toward the throng, not his master; the relationship with the master was symbiotic, each benefiting from the behavior of the other.

Bormann’s innate and infallible instincts for survival served him well after World War One. With the country in ruins, the economy in chaos and the populace impoverished and starving, Martin Bormann, revealing a latent predilection for always incisively cutting to the kernel of a problem, quickly divined that if lack of food was the problem he faced, going to the source of food was the solution. His instincts drove him not only to get work on a farm but also to achieve a position of control on the farm. Immediately upon being mustered out of the army he found work as an estate manager trainee in Meklemburg, North Germany. ²⁸He appears to have done well, for he recorded that less than two years later he had worked his way up to general manager of the von Treuenfels estates, which, combined, totaled almost 8,000 acres. Some historians question Bormann’s assertion he became general manager in two years based on the idea he could not have learned the entire farm business in 18 months, and the fact he was still a minor. But such a rise does not stretch the imagination given Bormann’s later proven and remarkable skills of administration – and the tell-tale lapdog relationship he quickly cultivated with the lady of the estate, Ehrengard von Treuenfels, the Baroness von Maltzahn. Indeed, the friendship was maintained at least until his escape from bombed-out Berlin a quarter-century later and his disappearance into the back alleys of history. Martin even named a daughter Ehrengard after the Baroness. In any case, Bormann honed and further integrated the skills of administration and vassalage into a potent power base while serving the Treuenfels’ at Mecklemburg. The experience of the victors of the war placing the reckoning of accounts at the vanquished’s door caught crosswise in both Hitler’s and Bormann’s throats. Consumed by hate and inspired by the power of carnage, Hitler took bitter umbrage to the mountainous war reparations despite the country’s then non-existent economy and starving population, which the Allies demanded of the German people. In the act of demanding such onerous reparations alone did the Allies incite World War Two. For had the reparations been less burdensome it is doubtful Hitler would have had the fuel he needed to ignite with his private rancor the fires of vengeance in the German people that would propel the Nazi cause.

Hitler for his part in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 that would serve as a catalyst to bring the Nazi party to power (he wrote Mein Kampf while in prison for the crime), and Bormann for his part in the murder of a man who had betrayed the nationalist cause. During his time as a land agent, Martin Bormann became involved in political activism. In 1923, the year of the Beer Hall Putsch, Bormann joined the Nazi’s predecessor and early competitor, the Freikorps Rossbach, where he quickly rose to become one of the leaders of the Mecklemburg chapter’s organization. While functioning in this position, Bormann was an accomplice in the murder of another member of the organization, Walther Kadow, a former elementary school teacher of his.29 Kadow had been suspected of betraying a third party member, the soon-to-be Nazi martyr Albert Leo Schlageter, to the French during the occupation of the Ruhr. Bormann and others recruited a gang to execute Kadow – a mob that included Rudolf Franz Hoess, the future commandant of Auschwitz. Kadow was dragged into a forest and beaten with clubs and heavy branches before having his throat cut and being shot twice.30 There is no evidence Bormann had a hand in the actual killing; the mob under his direction performed the deed. But Bormann was tried and condemned to a year in prison for providing the weapons and leadership for the act. Years later, Adolf Hitler would award Bormann the Blutorden (Blood Order) for his part in the murder and the time he paid in prison because of it.31 Hitler, too, was implicated for murder when he was a young man, long before he made cold-blooded killing a component of official government policy. Hitler’s suspected homicidal action, unlike Bormann’s calculated, pragmatic act, was alleged to be the result of jealous and unthinking rage. Depending upon who one believes, he appears to have viciously murdered his niece – with whom he was having an incestuous, turbid relationship – following a violent, jealousy-driven argument. The niece, Angela “Geli” Raubal, was trying to break off their relationship.32 She disclosed he had forced her to urinate on him and to perform other heinous obscenities.33 He also reportedly completed a number of erotic artistic renderings of Geli executed with questionable taste.

Bormann, or a cohort under his direction, is said to have later located all of these pictures and quietly bought them back to avoid future controversy. As Geli tried to extricate herself from the affair – she not only detested her relationship with Hitler but she was interested in another man – Hitler is thought to have confronted her in his apartment in Munich. Possibly she threatened to reveal his perverted predilections but it is not known for certain what led up to the killing or how it was committed. According to William Stevenson in The Bormann Brotherhood, there were witnesses to the crime – Gerhard Rossbach and Dr. Otto Strasser – but they were close Hitler cronies who refused to reveal what they knew. All that is known is Geli’s dead body was found naked on the floor, her nose allegedly broken, killed by a bullet from Adolf Hitler’s pistol.34 For Hitler, her death, whether murder or not, was a disaster about to be unleashed that would not only ruin his career but probably his life as well. While he had consolidated his position as leader of the Nazi Party, he was not yet a citizen of Germany much less its uncontested leader. Three more years would pass before he could protect his murderous madness with that shield. By now, September 1931, Bormann had been released from prison, joined the Nazi Party, and in six short years had burrowed his way into the party leadership and was looking for opportunities to demonstrate devotion to his demigod, Adolf Hitler. According to at least one chronicler, in the death of Geli Raubal Bormann recognized an opportunity to prove to his master his allegiance and his shrewd, if immoral, penchants. Author William Stevenson described how Munich’s intelligent, hard-working chief inspector, Heinrich Mueller, who up to that point had been working hard to eliminate the Nazi Party, had assigned one of his detectives to investigate the apparently open-and-shut case. Bormann stepped in. When he stepped back again, so the story goes, the chief inspector dropped the case, Hitler walked free, and Mueller was soon on a train to Moscow to learn from Stalin’s goons the black art and septic science of running a secret police department, all at Nazi Party expense.

Heinrich Mueller was installed on a career track that would propel him to the pinnacle of the German police state – the police state of all police states – as chief of the vaunted and feared Gestapo. In fact, Mueller would eventually carry to his grave the nickname “Gestapo” Mueller. And Martin Bormann would grasp Hitler’s attention and allegiance in a way that would create a mechanism for perpetual expansion of Bormann’s power base through the Master’s increasing trust and appreciation. Add to this the power that would later flow to Bormann from his co-opting of Heinrich Mueller and the massive intelligence and control mechanism that would soon be supplied to him through the Gestapo, and Bormann’s position had, indeed, increased by several orders of magnitude as a result of this single affair – if events did, indeed, happen as recounted. According to many Hitler biographers, the story of Hitler’s murder of Geli Raubal is anecdotal and has been proven to be false. Their account says Hitler had checked into a hotel two hours from Munich on the day Geli was killed and therefore could not have committed the crime. This, in fact, may be true. His signature is in the guest registration book and on a speeding ticket received while racing back to Munich after he was told about the death. But if Stevenson’s version that Bormann and Mueller ‘fixed’ the outcome of the investigation is correct, this evidence may be part of the cover-up rather than an accurate account of events. A full day passed between when Hitler left the scene of the murder where Geli was last seen alive, and when Geli’s body was found; plenty of time for him to drive the two-hour trip to the hotel and register. And it is well known that Hitler was being chauffeured almost everywhere at this time in his life. Why would he have received and signed the speeding violation rather than his driver, unless to create an alibi? And what of the reason officially given for Geli’s death – suicide? Would a young woman really kill herself while completely nude? The case for Hitler being innocent of Geli Raubal’s murder is far from conclusive. Perhaps whatever occurred will never be known.

During the six years between Bormann’s release from prison in 1925, when he joined the Nazi Party, and his alleged bold intercession on Hitler’s behalf in Geli Raubal’s death, Martin Bormann had already climbed a considerable distance within the Nazi party hierarchy. Presumably his stature was elevated upon his very entrance into the party as a result of his already-proven commitment to the ideals and operational methods of the Nazi Party as confirmed by time spent in prison for the Kadow murder. Within two years he was the regional press officer for the Nazi Party in Thuringia and the following year was elevated to chief business manager in the same regional party chapter, as well as being made Gauleiter (Nazi Party governor) of Thuringia.35 He was also promoted to the supreme command of the party’s military arm, the S.A. (Sturmabteilung). By the end of that same year, 1928, Bormann was working for Hitler’s personal secretary and right-hand man, Rudolf Hess. 36 Bormann had been referred to Hess by Nazi Party Treasurer Franz Xavier Schwartz, 37 who recognized in Bormann a shrewd and astute financial manager and efficient commissar who could bring the party’s business dealings into control, which Hess had been unable to accomplish. Because of Bormann’s penchant for working quietly in the background, throughout his career his versatile nature went largely unnoticed despite his latent genius for finance – magnified and unbridled by a complete lack of moral or ethical circumspection. His versatility revitalized party coffers. It made Hitler a rich man. And it made Bormann a rich man. With his new wife Gerda, Bormann began a family that would eventually include ten children and would, if possible, in some respects be even more perverse than the family in which he grew up. He openly and with Gerda’s blessing, and, in fact, with her assistance, carried on multiple sexual relationships simultaneously with a bevy of other women, despite universal agreement that Bormann, in the “looks” department, had little to offer the fairer sex. Physical attraction not withstanding, his oily charm and powerful position made him a desired coup to many ladies. Between these liaisons and his official duties he was seldom home, and when he was he ruled his wife and family with an iron fist. Yet he wrote Gerda lovingly almost every day, ensured she was always well taken care of, and, despite his otherwise secretive nature, he entrusted her in writing with his innermost thoughts", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:149:ebb739c382a7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5232, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 150, "text": "little to offer the fairer sex.

Yet he wrote Gerda lovingly almost every day, ensured she was always well taken care of, and, despite his otherwise secretive nature, he entrusted her in writing with his innermost thoughts and feelings on almost every subject. The Bormann’s relationship is an enigmatic paradox that makes a fascinating study in and of itself of the man and the manner in which he operated. Another endeavor that really made Hitler take notice was when Bormann negotiated with Wilhelm Ohnesorge, the Minister of Posts, a royalty to be paid to Hitler whenever the Fuehrer’s likeness was used – as it was on stamps.38 While the income per transaction was small (the cost of a stamp, after all, is minimal), the volume of transactions was huge. The resulting income from this clever contrivance alone made Hitler a wealthy man. More important, Bormann’s negotiations with Ohnesorge appears to have opened a long relationship between the two men that culminated in an alliance that contributed to the political fortunes of both; and that was central to Bormann’s later escape from Berlin and his post-war survival. Hitler, who enjoyed his new-found wealth but disliked the details of accumulating it, and who in fact, for political purposes carefully promoted an image of austerity, quickly recognized and appreciated Bormann’s astute perceptions; taciturn, confidential nature; and ‘fiscal’ talents. Bormann would go on to devise and execute a great many other schemes through the years, legal and otherwise, that lined the Fuehrer’s pockets as well as his own. Hitler soon appointed Bormann to be Hess’s chief of staff. The appointment came, no doubt, not only as a reward for Bormann’s assistance with the Geli Raubal incident and other past accomplishments, such as the Kadow murder, but because Bormann was also piling up a body of work that aided Hitler in a wide variety of other functions. In 1930, for example, recognizing party coffers were in dire straits, Bormann created the Hilfskasse, a compulsory ‘accident insurance’ fund for party members who were injured while brawling with communists.39 All party members had to pay into the fund. This capital not only supported the wounded but also generated a substantial surplus that allowed the party to fulfill significant financial obligations and still provide funding for future operations. Shortly after Hitler took office as chancellor, Bormann also founded the Adolf Hitler Endowment Fund of German Industry. 40 The endowment strong-armed companies that enjoyed success as a result of Hitler’s economic policies into making contributions to his government.

The funds were then hoarded in Hitler accounts managed by Bormann or dispersed according to Hitler’s and Bormann’s directions. By the end of 1934, Hitler had been in power a year, Bormann was serving as his personal secretary and business manager, and considerable advances had been made in Bormann’s efforts to weld himself to the man he could now, with the rest of the nation, call his Fuehrer. Bormann had become inseparable from the Fuehrer, following him night and day and writing nearly his every word on little white sheets of paper, to be acted upon immediately or to be treasured up for a future history he was certain would one day be chronicled in a tome that would glorify his Master.41 In 1935, leaning on his estate management experience, Martin Bormann initiated construction of and oversaw the management and building of the immense, now nearly mythical, multi-million reichsmark Bavarian complex at Berchtesgaden that Hitler would come to regard as his home and sanctuary from the demands and pressures of public office. In May 1941, Bormann’s position rose again when Rudolf Hess, Bormann’s direct superior, in an act that stunned the world, secretly flew his personal Messerschmidt airplane to Scotland. Hess’s self-appointed purpose – which he hoped would bring him back into the good graces of Hitler, with whom he felt a rift forming – ostensibly was to sue for peace and a united German/British front against Bolshevism. Hess was immediately rewarded with imprisonment in the United Kingdom. As a result, Bormann was given on a silver platter exactly what he was prepared to work – and conspire – hard for: the chancellorship of the Nazi Party. Some have suggested Bormann may have been responsible for inspiring Hess’s deranged attempt42 – may have, in fact, suggested it to his superior with foreknowledge of the probable results – in order to remove Hess from blocking Bormann’s path to greater power. Whether true or not, Bormann did ascend to the position of Nazi Party Chancellor by Hitler’s command, which was added to his responsibilities of personal secretary and manager to the Fuehrer that he had already held before Hess’s defection. Hitler also discovered in 1941, through one of the greatest spy coups ever, that Roosevelt and Churchill had established a secret transatlantic telephone connection.43 Charles Howard Ellis, possibly one of the Nazis most valued undercover agents as second-in-command to the remarkable Sir William Stephenson (who ran the combined intelligence efforts of Britain and the United States, reporting directly to Winston", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:151:55d07eb2057a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5234, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 152, "text": "added to his responsibilities of personal secretary and manager to the Fuehrer that he had already held before Hess’s defection.

Mueller was now, perhaps as a result of those negotiations and the path Bormann had put him on, the head of Germany’s feared secret police, the Gestapo. The Ministry of Posts, of all unlikely places, maintained a research and development institute that worked on an eclectic assortment of scientific problems. The work was well funded from the regular postal service. When, several months later Ohnesorge’s program successfully decrypted its first transatlantic conversation, Hitler was delighted, and, from then until the end of the war, he gleefully read the transcriptions of these conversations only hours after the words had been breathed from the mouths of his two great adversaries. The research institute of the Ministry of Posts was not working on cryptology only. Great amounts of reichsmarks were being invested in atomic bomb development,44 as well. Ohnesorge – who, as a doctor of physics and mathematics was on the Reich Research Presidential Council, 45 the organization that oversaw nuclear development for Hitler – was a great proponent of atomic bombs. At least twice Ohnesorge personally reported before Hitler the progress and merits of the German atomic bomb programs. That no one has asked why Ohnesorge made these reports rather than the traditional history’s nuclear leaders, Heisenberg, Hahn, Weizsacker or many others who were all working on the official German bomb project, seems compelling and telling regarding the real truth of the Nazi bomb’s development. Undoubtedly Bormann, as proxy head of the government in his Party Chancellor role, as Hitler’s secretary and personal manager, and later as his secret overseer, as well as through his relationship with Ohnesorge, was central to these events. True to his shrewd nature, Bormann must have divined the worth of the nuclear efforts. The men Bormann considered his competition for Hitler’s attention and as the Fuehrer’s possible eventual successor, Goering, Goebbels, Himmler, Speer, and at one time even Hess, were men, like Hitler, who championed the grand design of Nazism in overblown speeches, sweeping dramatic demonstrations of their power, and open adulation of their Fuehrer, for which they enjoyed in return the adulation of the crowds over which they", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:152:bfa62a3bdd1c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5235, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 153, "text": "to his shrewd nature, Bormann must have divined the worth of the nuclear efforts.

They echoed Hitler but, with the possible exception of Speer, added little to him and therefore they added little to their own potential as well. Bormann was an altogether different animal. Instead of assuming the voice of Hitler, which after all was Hitler’s greatest strength and needed little assistance, Bormann was Hitler’s hands and feet, his eyes and ears. He did the details and dirty work Hitler detested, with an eye dedicated to the same purposes the Fuehrer espoused. Bormann did the Fuehrer’s bidding, anticipating his wants and requirements without being told, and then fulfilling them with force and power without being directed, or restrained. Bormann served Hitler so loyally and completely that years later, when Bormann started to plant in Hitler’s mind his own ideas and then act upon them as Hitler’s orders, Hitler did not perceive the transition. As a result, Bormann to a large degree eventually became Hitler’s heart and mind as well as his eyes, ears, hands and feet; controlling him and the empire he governed without the master ever suspecting control had slipped from his hands. Bormann had positioned himself specifically for this task. Not only had he catered to Hitler slavishly to create an unbreakable bond of appreciation, trust, and dependence – it is important to note here that Bormann’s allegiance to the Fuehrer was always genuine and total – but Bormann continually cultivated and expanded his resources to forever widen his web of control on behalf of himself and the Fuehrer. According to biographer William Stevenson, Bormann’s great talent was a genius for “what really mattered in a bureaucracy.”46 Stevenson goes on to explain how Bormann dredged police, military and political organizations to form alliances, either by force or by finesse, that he would later manipulate to fill his purposes. Add to this his great propensity for navigating in and, in fact, forming, molding and operating bureaucracies, and one sees a master who controlled all the strings that ran the party and the government. His mind “thrived upon this kind of nutrition,”47 Stevenson wrote. “Where the Fuehrer’s genius and aura failed to work, (Bormann) would step in and exert power,”48 wrote Jochen von Lang in his biography of Bormann, The Secretary.

Bormann used the bureaucracies around him to consolidate his position and control the forces – pro and con – against and within which he had to operate. These bureaucracies were his source of all control through the currencies they commanded. Hard currencies such as the millions of reichsmarks stashed in his, Hitler’s and the party’s various accounts, funds and business operations; and soft currencies, like the personal intelligence collected on various leaders inside and outside the party and the country. The constitutional government of Germany controlled the country’s legal administration; in the early years of Hitler’s chancellorship the party, on paper, held little power. Bormann, as primarily a functionary of the party, therefore, could only administer in party matters, not government policy. To circumvent this inconvenience Bormann created and constantly grew his “shadow bureaucracy”49 over the ensuing years that duplicated each crucial government function and then allowed him to control the strings he desired to pull. The state police was shadowed by the Gestapo, with Bormann’s alleged protégé Mueller at its head. The province chiefs and mayors were shadowed by Nazi Party Gauleiters (district governors), and their administrative regional structures, who vied with the province chiefs and mayors for control of their jurisdictions. Bormann would usually side with the Gauleiters, or convince Hitler to do so, thus empowering them over their counterparts and expanding the influence of Bormann, leaving Gauleiters and other party officials in his debt.50 These party officials would eventually virtually run the country when Hitler later placed the Nazi Party in control. Bormann also placed large numbers of key officials under his bondage through bald-faced bribery, providing discrete distributions of loans from party coffers to whoever he deemed would be a valuable leader to own.51 “Almost all the top party functionaries received gifts from this fund,”52 wrote Speer, who added that such gift giving, though innocuous, had the very real effect of conferring more power upon Bormann than almost any other person in the land. Himmler approached Bormann for one such loan of 80,000 reichsmarks so he could buy a house near Berchtesgaden for his mistress and their illegitimate child.53 Bormann not only produced the loan but he encouraged Gerda to befriend Himmler’s mistress. The women would share cozy conversation and children’s clothing in the years ahead, until Bormann severed Himmler’s relationship with the Fuehrer in the waning days of the war.

But the Bormanns’ and Himmlers’ “pseudo-friendship,”54 and Bormann’s ongoing contributions to Himmler’s personal cache thereafter – totaling millions55 – was a valuable protection for Bormann later when the real extent of his power became apparent among Hitler’s coterie and envious courtiers tried to destroy him. “Again and again I have come to terms with Bormann although it is my duty really to get him out,”56 complained Himmler. Knowing Bormann had “the goods” on him, there was little Himmler could do to dethrone the Fuehrer’s Iago. In fact, it is doubtful Himmler really wanted to topple Bormann, since 30 to 40 percent of his personal income would be lost if Bormann fell.57 The official mantel of German domestic power now placed upon Bormann, as Nazi Party Chancellor, combined with the very real puissance he practiced through bureaucracy, blackmail and bribery, placed Bormann at the pinnacle of power. Only Goering, Goebbels and Himmler could hope to unseat him; and Himmler, as has been described, was in a poor position to do so. Bormann did not stop. He continued to increase and fortify his position throughout the next year. In the winter of 1942, the others distracted by the war and Hitler increasingly relying on Bormann to manage administrative affairs while he pontificated military strategy, Bormann slapped his fellow courtiers with a most direct, jolting and revealing blow that for the first time unveiled him openly as a contender for the throne. In an alliance with General Keitel, Hitler’s military second-in-charge, and Hans Heinrich Lammers, Chief of the Reich Chancery, in other words the government’s chief legal minister, Bormann created the Committee of Three through which all business directed for Hitler must pass, effectively cordoning off Hitler from all others.59 Hitler, appreciative as always that distracting details were being lifted from his busy schedule, supported the arrangement. Barely half a year later, in July 1943, Bormann again redefined his role as Party Chancellor and paladin to the Fuehrer, again with Hitler’s consent, by proclaiming himself the sole mediator between the government, the party and the Fuehrer, 60 thus eliminating even Keitel and Lammers from the picture. Bormann was now the sole link between Hitler and his chiefs. Speer noted with disgust how important issues and programs could not reach Hitler without first going through Bormann’s hands and first having his blessing before even being considered by the Fuehrer. 61 With Hitler insulated from opposing views on critical affairs, Bormann could now set and execute agendas, needing Hitler only to rubberstamp his plans.

Speer asserted that, as an important military minister, he was not among those excluded from Hitler’s presence, but in reality even Hitler’s most favored associates were dealt the indignities of having to crawl to Bormann for access to the Fuehrer. Often an audience was denied and Bormann responded alone. For example, it was Bormann, not Hitler, who answered in the negative Speer’s request of Hitler that he be awarded ultimate jurisdiction over the important V-1 and V-2 rocket projects and other research and development programs based at Peenemunde. 62 Bormann now controlled Hitler and guided from him the decisions that were running the Reich. According to biographer Paul Manning, “Martin Bormann was now the leader in fact of Germany.”64 William Stevenson agreed that Bormann covertly governed the Third Reich, adding that historians have consistently misunderstood both “Bormann’s role and his character.” Bormann was not interested in the fame and glory the rest of Hitler’s courtiers desired, according to Stevenson, he craved the real power.65 Jochen von Lang, another of Bormann’s biographers, asserted, “Bormann now considered himself the actual heir of the Third Reich,”66 if not the one so stated in Hitler’s will. Bormann at last was looking down from the top of the heap, and carefully watching his quibbling cohorts. “Those who were Bormann’s rivals and even enemies always underestimated his abilities,”67 lamented one of those enemies, Walter Schellenberg. “They spoke about (Bormann), calling him a bootlicker and often a pig,” described Hitler Youth Leader Baldur von Schirach, continuing, “If cartoonists had drawn his picture, his shape, bulk, short legs, mug – it actually would have turned out to be a pig.”68 Schellenberg, too, likened him to a wild pig digging for potatoes.69 Most of Hitler’s retinue simply called him “Hitler’s evil spirit,”70 or “The Brown Eminence”71 – behind his back, of course. By now Bormann was a general in the SS commanding a 1 million man army; he controlled vast sums of money that he used freely for his own legal and illegal purposes; he had at his fingertips enough information to pull down any party or government leader in the Reich; and he held in his hands the strings that controlled Adolf Hitler. At the end of the war, nobody in Nazi Germany held more power than Martin Bormann.

While the air battle over London was an important German defeat that allowed Britain to fight on – alone at the time – other than as a moral victory, taking the islands of the United Kingdom would have had little strategic value to Germany before the United States joined the conflict. And by the time Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of northern France, the tide of war had already turned against the Nazi horde. D-Day, while imperative and impressive, was actually the beginning of massive mop-up operations. During the autumn and winter of 1942, Germany suffered the most pivotal defeat of the war at the Battle of Stalingrad. From that day on, the outcome of the war was almost fixed. And almost everybody knew it. Until the moment when Hitler looked up from the strategic objective he was pursuing in the Soviet Union, the oilfields and refineries of Ukraine to fuel his war machine, Germany was winning the war. But the Fuehrer could not resist the moral victory that taking “Stalin’s City,” now so close, would be. Planning a quick campaign that would take mere weeks, he swung his Sixth Army from its course southward toward the oilfields and refineries, and instead turned them to the northeast and attacked. The bold move was at first successful and Stalingrad was captured. But in the frozen winter of 1942-43, a four million-man Russian army surrounded the 330,000-man force of Field Marshal Friederich von Paulus. The Soviets laid siege. They starved the Germans. They ran them out of ammunition. They ran them over on the rock-hard frozen snow under the treads of their heavy tanks, the Wehrmacht infantry unable to dig foxholes into the steely ice to avoid being crushed. By the time Paulus surrendered, SS forces had barely been able to break through and rescue only 5,000 survivors. The rest were force-marched to Siberia and most never heard from again. After the moral loss at Stalingrad and the loss of oil to feed the hungry Nazi war machine, ultimate surrender for Germany was just a matter of time, barring an unforeseen miracle.

Martin Bormann, true to his proven, pragmatic ways, was uniquely prepared to deal with the former eventuality, and possibly capable of providing the latter. Through his old friend at the Reichspost, Wilhelm Ohnesorge, he was supporting a program that could furnish the miracle needed – Manfred von Ardenne’s uranium enrichment program. The program just required enough time to be successful. On the other hand, if time should run out, the last thing Martin Bormann would allow his Fatherland to endure was another rapacious war reparations assessment like that forced upon it after World War One. The Allies could kill the people, plunder the land, rape the women, and level the cities, but in his shrewdly insightful way, Bormann knew that they could not own Germany itself if they did not own Germany’s wealth. In the spring of 1943, Bormann began to look for ways to conserve the Reich’s riches if the war was lost. He started with Aktion Feuerland, ‘Operation Fireland.’ As German forces had overrun country after country, storm troopers followed behind advance waves and plundered each nation’s valuables3 while the Gestapo gathered its Jews into ghettos and concentration camps and relieved them of every gram of valuable property they owned; including the gold and platinum in their teeth. The treasure consisted of hundreds of millions of reichsmarks; boxes and boxes of gold and platinum, pearls and diamonds; crates full of the priceless art of Europe; and billionaire bundles of stocks and other securities.4 The loot was amassed in a series of bank safes and underground vaults throughout the Reich – until Martin Bormann was made aware of its existence by one of his many internal intelligence conduits. In late 1943, he took control of much, though not all, of this booty and informed Hitler of its existence and a plan he had formulated for its conservation. “Bury your treasure, for you will need it to begin a Fourth Reich,” Hitler had responded. With this blessing, Bormann took control of as many as six U-boats,5 some of them unmarked, from Gross Admiral Karl Doenitz, and garnered the support of Generalisimo Francisco Franco to headquarter the U-boats in the Spanish port cities of Cadiz and Vigo. The U-boats for the next two years, supplied by cargo planes from Germany that transported the treasures to the coastal towns on the Atlantic, began a non-stop circuit transporting the treasure to the far southern reaches of Argentina – the region known as Tierra del Fuego, or Land of Fire. At their destinations they were unloaded by Bormann’s mysterious minions and deposited into a variety of international bank", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:159:a019d2644ddb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5242, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 160, "text": "headquarter the U-boats in the Spanish port cities of Cadiz and Vigo.

At their destinations they were unloaded by Bormann’s mysterious minions and deposited into a variety of international bank accounts controlled by a cryptic cabal of Bormann partners. This was Operation Fireland. But Bormann was not satisfied just to rob the SS of the treasure trove it had stolen from murdered Jews, plundered citizens and overrun countries. Earlier in 1943, he had recognized for himself the value of masterpieces hung in museums and those owned by Catholic and other churches and held in cathedrals, monasteries and convents throughout the Reich. He initiated a program to collect all that could be gathered and even ordered high-ranking members of the party who had already assimilated such artwork into their own collections to turn them over to the Party Chancellery.6 From this time to the end of the war, one-third of Italy’s great art treasures, and much of the rest of Europe’s masterworks collections, were lost to the Nazis; a fair share of it going into Bormann’s South American hideaway. Bormann appears to have laundered some questionable treasures of his own through Operation Fireland, as well. For example, in 1942 Bormann started heading a Nazi project designed to weaken the British war economy while providing currency to pay for German armaments production. The British currency-counterfeiting program overseen by Bormann was printing 400,000 notes a month, which eventually totaled $600 million.7 Bormann deposited the money into foreign banks through his mysterious partners. Later, he exchanged the funds into a more stable currency, often dollars, and then, instead of using the funds for the munitions for which they were intended, he would often hold them in one of his “ghost” accounts for his own future use. Of the $600 million of counterfeit currency processed, approximately $300 million has never been accounted for, presumably lost to Bormann’s enigmatic interchange. Bormann also generated huge sums of money through a vehicle that he had already utilized at least twice before to the benefit of the Fuehrer and the party – the creation of a fund designed to finance a specific task and to which all able Germans were compelled to contribute. In this case, the “Winterfund” was established ostensibly for the welfare of the soldiers and civilians impoverished by the war.8 Besides mandatory donations, the fund was also supported by wealthy industrialists who were wined and dined at concerts they were expected to attend, all the while being coerced into contributing huge amounts of money, sometimes as much as 100,000 reichsmarks in a single donation.9 Eventually the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:160:a409c46b7feb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5243, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 161, "text": "finance a specific task and to which all able Germans were compelled to contribute.

Presumably, at least part, if not a great percentage, of these funds may have been included in Operation Fireland. Estimates of the value of Operation Fireland range from the unbelievably low $17 million, considering the sheer volume of non-stop transport voyages of the six U-boats over two years, and subsequent value of the treasures, into the more probable hundreds of millions and possibly even billions of dollars. But Operation Fireland was small change compared to the blockbuster business venture Bormann would soon unveil. As the Thousand Year Reich began to crumble barely a decade after its inception, memories of Germany’s World War One failure were still fresh in Martin Bormann’s mind. A devastated citizenry impoverished by the war had been saddled with yet even more hefty burdens than what the country had already lost in the conflict. From the scant assets that had survived, the Germans were forced to pay the costs of the losses of the victors, as well; to replace their burnt out cities and towns, the sunken ships and shot down airplanes, their industries and lost revenues. Because the conquered had so few resources left that there were insufficient assets with which to make recompense, their futures were mortgaged – a whole generation was indignantly indentured to its mortal enemy of yesterday. While the fighting had ended, the war smoldered on in the angry hearts of the vanquished, to erupt again two decades later in World War Two. Now the pattern was repeating itself. But the bitter gall of the last defeat was not going to be repeated in this one. Not while Martin Bormann had a hand in the outcome. Reichminister Hermann Goering was responsible for the Reich’s economic Four-year Plan and, as a result, the economic heads of all the occupied countries (and surreptitiously, many of the neutral nations, also) reported to him. These countries included France, Belgium, Holland, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Norway, Yugoslavia, Austria, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Portugal, Finland, Bulgaria, and Romania – virtually all of Europe except Russia – and also included many Latin American countries.

What is little known, however, according to Martin Bormann: Nazi In Exile author Paul Manning, is that Martin Bormann was the Party Minister of Economics10 and therefore he oversaw all economic issues for the entire Reich, even outranking Hitler’s then-chosen heir, Goering, in financial matters. In this role, on the heels of the Stalingrad defeat, Bormann had already begun to plan for the economic protection and resurgence of Germany following the war. Wall Street Journal reporter Greg Steinmetz writes of how top Nazis prepared for German post-war emergence by calling together a meeting of the leaders of many of Germany’s top companies in August 1944. The meeting, held in a hotel in Strasbourg, France, was convened expressly “to discuss financing plans for the Fourth Reich,”11 according to Steinmetz. Steinmetz’s article also included information about Operation Fireland. By the time the Steinmetz article ran in April 1997, however, it was very old news. Decades before, Bormann biographers Paul Manning, William Stevenson and Ladislas Farago had already written in detail about Nazi exporting of plundered treasure and the secret economic summit in Strasbourg. What was new was the fact no rebuff of Steinmetz or the Journal appears to have followed for revealing the information. In the past, accounts printed about Operation Fireland and the Strasbourg Conference had been squashed, quickly debunked or ridiculed into historical oblivion. For example, when this author initially proposed Critical Mass to a publisher using only Operation Fireland documentation cited by Farago in his book Aftermath, I was told Farago had forged and planted the documents within the top secret files of foreign governments in order to support his “fictitious” claims. Apparently there had been quite an international row in the publishing world over this deception, which occurred when I was too young to have taken notice. At any rate, Farago and his book had been publicly and acrimoniously denounced and Farago died unvindicated a few years later. The publisher’s initial assertions convinced me of the correctness of the dismissal of Farago’s claims, thus stopping me from pursuing this book further – at least for a time. I later came across Paul Manning’s treatise of the despoiled Nazi loot and the Strasbourg meeting in his book, Martin Bormann: Nazi In Exile and again in William Stevenson’s book, The Bormann Brotherhood. The same events that Farago had revealed in his book were proven in these accounts, as well as some very important new information, but in many cases using different documentation.

I contacted a member of the intelligence community with whom I had connections and whom I was told had researched the subject matter of these Nazi business dealings. Without mentioning Manning or Stevenson by name, he asserted that what they had written about Nazi involvement in post-war international business preparations was true and that United States government intelligence agencies – he mentioned the CIA and its predecessor the OSS by name – had conducted a full inquiry into the issue. He asserted these agencies had identified all of the relevant business dealings, had broken up the German cartels and stripped the Nazi owners of their financial properties and placed those instruments in the hands of the United States Alien Property Custodian program. He “shared” this information with me in the spirit of proving that, while certain German businessmen and high-ranking Nazis – he mentioned Bormann specifically – tried to survive the war supported by Nazi funds invested by clandestine means, the United States had found and uprooted the deception. Therefore, he insisted, there was no story and no need for me to research further. But if what Paul Manning and William Stevenson had written about Nazi international business activity was true, as he said it was, then the same assertions that Ladislas Farago had earlier written about it are likewise true, as is other very essential information about who they all agreed initiated the Strasbourg Conference. The effort to vilify Farago, therefore, was probably a smokescreen. With the knowledge my original premise was intact and there was now an effort being put forth to fog the truth, I put forth, more carefully, once again on this book. The fact the Nazi scheme had supposedly been put down was of no account to me; the confirmation that the Strasbourg plan was made and initially carried out is the cogent point for this volume. In later research I discovered, however, that the story about the financial properties being expropriated once and for all by the United States government, while true in form, was not true in reality. It was yet another effort to create a fog behind which the truth could be hidden.

Perhaps the reason the article ran unassailed was the irreproachable reputation for integrity of the Wall Street Journal and its sheer stature in the world of journalism. Perhaps the article was allowed to run because it was triggered by a United States Senate investigation initiated in response to Nazi victims who are now United States citizens trying to retrieve personal property originally looted from them by the Nazis. Probably both reasons are true to some degree. But likely the most important reason the Steinmetz article was allowed to run uncontested was that it still hid the issues at heart – issues some elements of the United States government want protected. What are these issues? The first is that Martin Bormann was the central player in the Strasbourg Conference. The second is that Bormann escaped Germany at the end of the war and lived for many years rebuilding and controlling the economy of West Germany and much of Europe and Latin America, and that he did this all with the protection, support and collusion of the United States government. While Steinmetz’s article does not say so, Manning’s and Stevenson’s stories both have a central point in common regarding the Strasbourg Conference; and Farago’s work, illustrated by other events, although not detailed in the specifics of the conference itself, supports the point: Martin Bormann initiated the conference, controlled it and oversaw its results for many years following the war. Bormann’s yet unborn Fourth Reich, by war’s end, had already ratholed $800 million plus 95 tons of gold.12 And that was just by war’s end. The Strasbourg Conference where Bormann introduced a new economic initiative was convened under the highest secrecy and security in August 1944. The purpose was to discuss post-war preparations between the Nazi government and the major German industrialists,13 strengthening a partnership that had grown increasingly stronger since the end of World War One and particularly strong since the Nazi Party had gained control of the government. Bormann assigned Lieutenant General Sheid to conduct the conference in his behalf,14 along while Dr. Bosse, of the Ministry of Armaments. What Bormann then proposed was devious, conspiratorial and illegal within Nazi Germany. To avoid security breaches, therefore, he ensured in every possible way that the strictest secrecy was maintained. The meeting was held in a hotel conference room insulated from visual or audio surveillance by having rented all of the rooms above, below and on all sides of the chamber. All attendees and their personal possessions were thoroughly inspected physically and electronically by SS technicians.16 High-ranking industrialists from a spectrum of German firms listened intently to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:164:14a1e12cccf7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5247, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 165, "text": "conspiratorial and illegal within Nazi Germany.

The meeting was held in a hotel conference room insulated from visual or audio surveillance by having rented all of the rooms above, below and on all sides of the chamber. All attendees and their personal possessions were thoroughly inspected physically and electronically by SS technicians.16 High-ranking industrialists from a spectrum of German firms listened intently to the amazing proposal: All companies that agreed with Bormann’s plan to conserve their businesses for post-war operations and to share postwar revenues with selected underground Nazi operations would, until such time as the Third Reich failed, be protected by Bormann from the “Treason Against the Nation” law.17 This law required death for all those who subverted currency regulations, traded in foreign currency or concealed ownership of foreign currency. The law also precluded firms from being involved in almost any type of partnership, joint venture or licensing agreement with any country outside of the Reich or the boundaries of its allies. In reality, many of Germany’s largest companies were already engaged in relationships with businesses neutral to or hostile to the Reich, including Germany’s largest conglomerate, I.G. Farben. But the government had been turning a blind eye in order to keep the huge amount of capital rolling in that these companies generated. The waiver of the Treason Against the Nation law proposed at Strasbourg was therefore not only an incentive to those German companies that desired to survive the war but were not yet participating in such activities, but it was a veiled threat to those that were already circumventing the law. To them Bormann was saying, in essence, if you do not share the wealth you are already gaining, we will have your heads by enforcing the law. The Strasbourg announcement, for these companies, amounted to a form of blackmail; which they were glad to pay not only to save themselves but to save their companies from the post-war commercial blood bath that was sure to come. According to Dr. Bosse, participating companies’ funds were to be invested in foreign financial institutions while the Party maintained access to them, “in order that a strong German empire can be created after defeat.”18 Bosse went on to explain: “Industrialists with government assistance will export as much of their capital as possible, capital meaning money, bonds, patents, scientists and administrators.”19 While hard currency was valuable, the currency with real potential was the ‘soft capital’ the industrialist firms held: the trade agreements, patents and braintrusts that generated colossal revenues in perpetuity. The potential income of such intellectual and proprietary properties as international licenses sold to use the patents on stainless steel, synthetic fuels and rubbers and other commercial advances, and control of the braintrusts who created them, was huge, generating millions, possible tens or", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:165:617318f94fd3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5248, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 166, "text": "meaning money, bonds, patents, scientists and administrators.”19 While hard currency was valuable, the currency with real potential was the ‘soft capital’ the industrialist firms held: the trade agreements, patents and braintrusts that generated colossal revenues in perpetuity. The potential income of such intellectual and proprietary properties as international licenses sold to use the patents on stainless steel, synthetic fuels and rubbers and other commercial advances, and control of the braintrusts who created them, was huge, generating millions, possible tens or hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Many international companies, such as Bayer, Winthrop Chemical, AGFA-ANSCO, Hoescht and DuPont to a large degree owed their existence and continuing prosperity to exclusive use of I.G. Farben patents and licenses alone.20 In addition to exporting technologies, the German firms were directed to borrow against these and other assets to obtain more hard capital and thus be able to more quickly export additional hard currency21 into what was now being called Bormann’s Flight Capital program. Technical and business bureaus were to be established for each industry and in each foreign office of each company, with a covert Nazi liaison officer in each office to oversee and, where possible, personally manage the operations.22 From among these liaisons German economic specialists successfully penetrated eleven nations’ economies, in addition to Germany’s, and eventually controlled them in the post-war period.23 Bosse reported to Bormann after the meeting that the terms of the Strasbourg conference had been agreed to by all involved and therefore the new Flight Capital Program had been successfully initiated.24 Bormann in turn established 750 camouflaged corporations under the names of companies or individuals for which he held power of attorney, and therefore over which he had total control,25 as vehicles for managing the income of the Flight Capital Program. These businesses were scattered across countries throughout Europe, the Mid-east and Latin America. Holdings were even kept in bank accounts in the United States of America,26 some of which eventually were in Martin Bormann’s own name, including accounts with Manufacturers Hanover Trust, The Chase Manhattan Bank, and First National City Bank, according to author Paul Manning. Although not listed as a company represented at the Strasbourg conference, Germany’s largest industrial cartel, the chemical concern I.G. Farben, was active in the Flight Capital Program as well. In fact, it had not been necessary for Farben representatives to attend the program’s introduction at all because its leader, chairman, and president, Hermann Schmitz, had been integral to creating the Flight Capital Program. I.G. Farben had supported the Nazi cause from the beginning of its climb to power, having donated generously through Farben’s intelligence, propaganda and political economic operations, known as I.G.

NW7.27 In his Wall Street Journal article, Steinmetz unwittingly hints at this involvement – and particularly at the Flight Capital Program – in a portion of the article that reviews reports that Germany’s Bosch A.G. company during the war allied with the wealthy Wallenberg family of Sweden to camouflage German funds. Robert Bosch, the founder of Bosch A.G., was the uncle of Carl Bosch, 28 the founder of I.G. Farben. Close relationships were maintained between the companies. Before taking Carl Bosch’s place at the head of I.G. Farben, Schmitz had been Bosch’s top lieutenant and handpicked successor.29 He had overseen all of I.G. Farben’s international business, and, between the wars, was responsible for concealing Farben’s huge global income from German tax administrators through the use of foreign “blinds” he had created. These camouflage devices operated remarkably like the alleged arrangement between Bosch A.G. and the Wallenberg’s.30 Before the war, Schmitz took over the helm of I.G. Farben and had become a close “confidant and advisor to Martin Bormann,”31 writes Paul Manning in his book Martin Bormann: Nazi In Exile. Manning added that Bormann was a student in a sort of personal, and confidential, tutelage under Schmitz.32 Bormann, in fact, surreptitiously gave the title of “Secret Councilor to the Nazi Party and Martin Bormann,” to Hermann Schmitz,33 in return for the latter’s intellectual contributions and mentoring. Under Schmitz’s direction and with the complicity of Bormann, I.G. Farben looted the chemical properties of the nations Germany had conquered: Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway and France.34 By the end of the war, Farben had interests in over 700 companies, not including operations within its own corporate structure that stretched across 93 countries.35 In all, Schmitz, in league with Bormann, who cleared the path of government constraints, expanded Farben’s foreign investment to at least 7 billion reichsmarks during the war.36 As the two men wove their web they made many pacts; among them one that ensured all Farben leaders overseas were Nazi Party members accountable to Martin Bormann – a precursor to the Flight Capital Program. Working together, the two men expanded this relationship to other German firms in the form of the Flight Capital Program. The objective of the Flight Capital Program was not to make money in and of itself. The objective – Bormann’s master plan – was to save and protect Germany’s industries and economy from being looted at the hands of the conquerors as had happened at the end of the First World War.

After the war, the Flight Capital Program would control and direct not only the German economy, but also other economies linked to the underground Fatherland, in an effort to produce a quick German rebirth and eventual European economic domination by Germany. Bormann and Schmitz met on multiple occasions while developing the Flight Capital Program.37 So thoroughly did Bormann capture all of the funds transferred out of the Reich that when Hermann Schmitz died in 1960, at the age of 79, he was nearly a pauper.38 “To this day no one has been able to explain what happened to his fortune. Few who knew him can believe it doesn’t exist,” wrote Joseph Borkin, author of The Crime and Punishment of I.G. Farben. Strategies for covertly redeploying the economy included the implementation of a “foreign trade offensive,” according to Peter Hayes’ book Industry and Technology: I.G. Farben in the Nazi Era. 39 They also included a “‘European economic community’” that positioned Germany as the hub and “flag bearer” of a confederated Europe that would “predominate by ‘elastic political methods’… not with brutal force.” These elements are certainly recognizable in the history of post-war Europe as it actually unfolded, and, in fact, Germany continues with a high profile in the European economic model of today – which is named the “European Economic Community.” The evidence reflects that the Flight Capital Program and Bormann’s partnership with I.G. Farben not only paid off as planned, but it set the foundation for the Europe we know today, and by extension all of the world. But in April 1945, with Berlin succumbing to the Russian siege, a hysterical Hitler visibly crumbling in front of him, and the Reich reeling in its death throes, Bormann, true to his brutish, realistic, pragmatic nature and leaning heavily on his incomparable bureaucratic proclivities, was focused on escaping. Bormann was willing, able and self-authorized to negotiate any agreement that secured his – and presumably, at one time, the Fuehrer’s – escape. Signals from “The Brown Eminence’s” radios bounced to and from various German generals authorized to negotiate with Russian and United States military leaders. The Allies, in complete control and determined to achieve nothing but total and unconditional surrender – outwardly at least – would not negotiate. Escape was the only option. 10 Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi In Exile, p. 114 11 Greg Steinmetz, The Wall Street Journal, 28 April, 1997 12 William Stevenson, The Bormann Brotherhood, p. 66 13 Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi In Exile, p. 23; William Stevenson, The Bormann Brotherhood, p.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:168:08ffa1b2b307", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5251, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 169, "text": "negotiate with Russian and United States military leaders.

Over that nearly-three-quarters-of-a-century, so many accounts of his last days in Berlin have been generated, fabricated, amended, modified, denied, rebutted, investigated, expunged, reborn, reshaped and abridged that nothing is certain but a black mist of confusion and suspicion that hangs over the whole affair like a thick pall. Indeed, the truth may never be known. Not just because the evidence supporting any outcome is inconclusive, but because there seems to be few participants who were or are objective on the matter, and therefore the testimony and evidence they provide must, of prudence, be viewed with varying degrees of skepticism. What is known, despite the bleak picture that is always painted of these events, is that 90 percent of those who were in the bunker at the end of the war survived.3 The only “eyewitnesses” to Bormann’s death did not actually verify either that they were certain they saw him die, or that they were sure they saw him in death. All eyewitnesses were avowed Nazis headquartered in the bunker and therefore may have had vested and agreed upon interests in the world thinking Bormann was dead. And therefore, the argument goes, they may have provided misinformation in evidence of his death. Additional “proofs” of Bormann’s demise beyond the eyewitness accounts did not surface until decades later. The veracity of their provenance has been effectively argued pro and con since. Those who argue for his death, most notably the German government and, in a more innocuous manner, certain United States agencies, almost invariably have important interests of their own to protect. Many of those who say he survived seem to have their reasons for maintaining his ongoing existence, as well, sometimes based on only the flimsiest evidence to support their claims, but often with substantially more confirmation. Frankly, this book falls in the latter category. The evidence, in fact, is significant in support of both theories and, despite claims of certainty by both camps, a detailed study of all the data available tends to muddy the already shadowy history beyond ever finding certain resolution.

Indeed, there is strong evidence the waters were muddied intentionally by those who merely had to make his fate questionable, in order to win their objective of invalidating any reference to Martin Bormann in post-war history. But by filtering all of the available information through two criteria, one may possibly gain, if not a crystal clear understanding of the outcome of events, at least the most probable outcome of Bormann’s last days in Berlin. One of these criteria is to look at disassociated stories surrounding these events and see what parallels might verify each other to validate details. The more numerous and specific the evidentiary pieces paralleled, the more probable they are true – assuming they are not totally invalidated by known facts. The other criteria is that of judiciously weighing the evidence against who presented and/or supports it – and why – in an effort to identify and properly interpret political and other influences that may have colored the information presented. By combining these two methods of analyzing the information, a more coherent and believable – in fact, this author believes, probable, though disturbing – case for Bormann’s survival is formed, rather than the accepted scenario of his death. Let it be noted here, however, that this author does not believe this evidence is conclusive. I believe only that the evidence is significant and superior for Bormann’s survival over evidence of his demise in Berlin. And that evidence shows U-234 was related to his escape and, therefore, additional research should be completed. According to reports later provided by occupants of the bunker, in the late hours of 1 May 1945, the small gaggle of survivors still burrowed in the Fuehrer Bunker after Hitler’s suicide separated into a few small groups and, at intervals, sneaked out of the ground and into the frightful night. Artillery and tank shells were falling indiscriminately around them. A few hundred meters away, the sounds of gunfire could be heard as firefights occurred in the darkness, splashing the acrid, smoky air with bursts of red and streaks of light. Each group was responsible to find its own way to safety. In one of these pathetic patrols reportedly stalked the potbellied, shortlegged, bull-necked profile of Martin Bormann, commander of the Nazi party and Hitler’s closest confidant.

Walking the rails in the dark subway tunnels, the silent group made its way north, where it again surfaced to find means to cross the Spree River. At Weidendammer Bridge the group ran into heavy fighting between German tanks and Russian forces. One story asserts that Bormann tried to cross the bridge under cover of a German tank navigating the narrow span. The tank was shelled by a bazooka and exploded in a violent burst of flame, killing Bormann4 according to “eyewitness” Erich Kempka, Hitler’s chauffer and a member of the Fuehrer Bunker escape party. Kempka admitted during his Nuremberg testimony at Bormann’s in absentia trial, that he did not approach the body to confirm Bormann had been killed but was certain from the extent of the violent blast and the manner in which Bormann’s body was seen “flying away,”5 that the Reichsleiter was dead. At least four others of Hitler’s trusted insiders reported seeing virtually the same event, but again, none had inspected the body or could declare with certainty he was dead, though all were convinced of it. 6 Not to worry, a sixth eyewitness later claimed to have observed the events at Weidendammer Bridge also, and to be able to verify Bormann was killed by the tank blast. Except this witness, the Spaniard Juan Roca-Pinar, who, as an avowed Nazi was fighting near the bridge as part of a small SS unit defending the bunker, later reported that Bormann was not at the side of the tank but riding inside the tank when it was hit by the bazooka shell.7 Roca-Pinar reported that he was ordered to board the tank and save Bormann, but when he opened the hatch to rescue survivors, he found Bormann dead from the blast, though easily identifiable. He reported that he pulled Bormann’s corpse from the tank before being forced to abandon it in the street under pressure of enemy fire. The conflicting stories, while containing significant discrepancies, at least agreed, with the exception of Mengerhausen, that Bormann died during a tank explosion on Weidendammer Bridge. But other accounts soon spun these similar scenarios on their heads. Artur Axmann, the onearmed leader of the Hitler Youth, claimed to have run into Bormann after the Weidendammer Bridge catastrophe and asserted that Bormann was alive, well and completely unharmed.9 In fact, the two men, in company of others, tried for some time to escape together before later separating to search for their own passages to freedom. Axmann headed west, but, finding the way blocked, subsequently retraced his steps and claims to have again come across Bormann and Dr. Stumpfegger,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:172:336262f05364", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5255, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 173, "text": "Artur Axmann, the onearmed leader of the Hitler Youth, claimed to have run into Bormann after the Weidendammer Bridge catastrophe and asserted that Bormann was alive, well and completely unharmed.9 In fact, the two men, in company of others, tried for some time to escape together before later separating to search for their own passages to freedom. Axmann headed west, but, finding the way blocked, subsequently retraced his steps and claims to have again come across Bormann and Dr. Stumpfegger, one of Hitler’s physicians, on a railroad trestle at the Lehrter Fairgrounds train station. Bormann and Stumpfegger were lying side by side on the bridge and appeared to be dead. Axmann leaned close to Bormann’s body to check for breathing and could discern none. He later would not swear with certainty, however, that the Reichsleiter had expired. Indeed their “deaths,” if they were dead, were strange. According to Axmann, neither corpse showed any indication of being wounded or injured or showed any signs of violence – quite out of line with the reports from Weidendammer Bridge, even if Bormann had survived the tank blast, and further mystifying given their deaths having taken place during a heavy battle. They lay calmly next to each other in peaceful repose, their arms resting casually at their sides, as if they had quietly laid down on their own, or somebody had laid them there. Axmann wondered if they had been poisoned or poisoned themselves, but could think of no reason why they should do so, except perhaps that they had lost hope of escape and preferred not to be captured. He left the bodies where he found them and eventually escaped to the Tyrol to command a small band of Hitler Youth determined to keep fighting after the war. American forces captured him there. And so the semi-official version of Bormann’s demise is dubiously documented in a melee of misaligned explanations and seemingly unexplainable inconsistencies. The picture would get further obscured. A rash of post-war Bormann sightings across Europe began to be reported. He was in Sweden, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, even as far away as Argentina. Many sightings were explained away as misidentifications. Others went unexplained. Stalin was sure he was alive and accused the United States of hiding him.10 The evidence for his death was so uncertain that a year after his reported demise, the Nuremberg court convened by the Allies to bring war criminals to justice, tried and convicted Bormann in absentia, thinking from the evidence it was probable Bormann had survived the war. With so many sightings and so many unanswered questions, people – and government agencies – began the quest to answer the controversy over Bormann’s fate.

Or in some instances, it seems the goal was to ensure the question was unanswerable. Articles and books flooded the media arguing that Bormann died – and arguing that Bormann lived. Searches began for evidence that proved either case. The sightings continued, some by those who knew Bormann and were very convincing, but almost no hard evidence was found, though much was claimed. New theories and additions to the existing stories began to appear, and then even to be reversed; such as that asserted by Simon Wiesenthal. After firmly assuring the world for many years that Bormann had survived – and strongly hinting that he knew where the fugitive resided11 – Wiesenthal abruptly reversed himself and asserted that Bormann had committed suicide that night in Berlin when he realized escape was not possible.12 Historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, considered by many to be the leading expert on Bormann’s fate, reported he was dead, then alive, then dead, then alive again. What caused these sweeping reversals is hard to keep track of, but they illustrate the high state of confusion and uncertainty surrounding Bormann’s fate. Journalist Paul Manning, for his part, reported that Bormann was alive, thanks to the help of Gestapo Chief Heinrich Mueller, who had searched for, and found in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, a man who could serve as a “double” for Bormann. While the claim of a double for Bormann initially seems far-fetched, one must understand it was Mueller who found, arranged and prepared the well-known double for Hitler, presumably under Bormann’s orders since Bormann held ultimate responsibility for Hitler’s security. The Fuehrer’s bodyguard, and even his pilots, were in reporting structures that ended at Bormann. Mueller’s assistance with Bormann’s double may be attributed to the fact that he not only may have owed his position to Bormann, but Hitler had ordered Bormann to serve as a go-between for Mueller and his direct superior Heinrich Himmler, 13 whom Mueller hated. According to Manning, in the months prior to Mueller’s and Bormann’s anticipated escapes – both men felt Germany’s surrender was a probability that ought to be prepared for – Mueller ordered that the double be coached to behave like Bormann and that his dental work be redone to match that of the Reichsleiter’s.14 Manning explained that he was provided the initial information about Bormann’s double from a highly placed British intelligence source. He received confirmation of the incredible story from one of General Reinhard Gehlen’s top aides.15 Manning subsequently treated the account as accurate and never questioned the story.

Indeed, the suggestion that a double actually “stood in” for Martin Bormann during the last known day of his life resolves many anomalies about Bormann’s widely noted “un-Bormann-like” behavior during the events of 1 May 1945, as well as other historical inconsistencies. General Gehlen was Hitler’s chief intelligence officer for Eastern Europe before the German surrender, at which time Gehlen became the Central European expert for the OSS and then the CIA, and eventually head of the secret service in the Federal Republic of Germany.16 He was, nonetheless, still financed by American money and thus provided America with East-bloc intelligence.17 According to Manning, the Bormann post-war story was at one point even further convoluted when Gehlen was forced by the CIA to write in his memoirs that Bormann was a Soviet spy who had died in Russia in 1969. It was one of the agency’s many efforts to obfuscate the facts around Bormann’s fate, to make any clear exploration impossible. Gehlen later retracted the claim. More than two decades passed before the first physical evidence suggesting Bormann’s fate surfaced. At that time, a report was uncovered that was written shortly after Bormann disappeared. The report declared the Russians had found Bormann’s and Dr. Stumpfegger’s bodies where Axmann had said they were, on the Lehrter Station Bridge, and the Russians had the corpses buried a few meters away in the Lehrter fairgrounds just days after the city’s surrender.18 They identified the body from a journal of Bormann’s that was found in the pocket of the dead man’s overcoat.19 On this point accounts parted, however, for according to author and forensics expert Hugh Thomas, as noted in his book Dopplegangers, the Soviets had determined neither the body, nor the overcoat on the body, were Bormann’s.20 The Russians quickly surmised that the diary had been placed in the overcoat pocket to lead investigators off of Bormann’s trail. If so, the report of the dead man’s body being Bormann’s must, from the outset, be regarded with skepticism. Bolstering this position is a report that Frau Stumpfegger, the giant doctor’s wife, received a letter on 14 August 1945 from the postmaster at Lehrter Station, who had been responsible under Soviet orders for burying the many bodies in the area. The letter stated her husband’s remains had been found and buried, and conveyed the sad news and appropriate condolences.21 Thomas then writes that no such letter was ever sent to Bormann’s family, automatically suggesting that Bormann’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:175:17dfa4ddb5d8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5258, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 176, "text": "regarded with skepticism.

To put an exclamation point on this, the 14 February 1964 edition of the German magazine, Der Spiegel reported on their investigation of events, concluding, “In actual fact…, the corpse of Stumpfegger was found. But of Bormann, who was said to be lying alongside, there was no trace.”22 In the mid-1960s, the German State of Hesse asked that the area where the bodies were reportedly buried be dug up in search of clues, but when excessive digging came up empty, the quest was abandoned.23 Then in December 1972, just as two separate series of articles by Ladislas Farago and Paul Manning began being published that convincingly argued Bormann had escaped Berlin,24 a construction crew “accidentally,” and under suspicious conditions, unearthed two skulls and some bones twenty yards from the location previously dug up by the official Bormann search party.25 The discovery was suspicious because there was a report of a former Hitler Youth member offering a $100, 000 deutschmark bounty to any workmen who found the relics.26 The skulls were examined to see if one was Bormann’s but there was a problem: no records of Bormann’s dentistry or any other identification marks existed that could be compared against the skeletal remains. The only record available was a sketch drawn from memory by Bormann’s bythen-deceased dentist, Dr. Hugo Blaschke, who drew the sketches during interrogations for the Nuremberg trials.27 The accuracy of the chart was attested to by Fritz Echtmann, a dental technician who had never actually seen Bormann’s teeth, but who had built a dental bridge for a patient he “assumed” was Bormann, based on data given by Dr. Blaschke. Using this data, the pathologists in the case compared the sketch with the unearthed skulls and proclaimed a match with one. The riddle of the fate of Martin Bormann had been solved: Martin Bormann had died on Lehrter Bridge in Berlin on 2 May 1945, as Artur Axmann had asserted. All of the stories regarding his survival, therefore, were false. The version was made semi-official with a press conference, although it was not certified or recognized at that time by a court of law, therefore disallowing any recovery of Bormann’s assets by his family,28 who, in any case, refused to believe their father was dead despite the vast fortune his legal expiration would", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:176:01f9bb5806fb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5259, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 177, "text": "Bormann had died on Lehrter Bridge in Berlin on 2 May 1945, as Artur Axmann had asserted.

One of the great unanswered mysteries of World War Two now was solved. Except the skull may not have been Bormann’s. Or if it was Bormann’s, it was not the man’s who had been buried next to Dr. Stumpfegger in May 1945. In 1953, almost 20 years before the skull was found and eight years after it was supposed to have been buried, CIA agent James McGovern was working an investigation in Berlin with the assignment of verifying for his agency what had happened to Bormann. He later wrote that in discussions on the matter with the KGB, the CIA had learned a body supposedly Bormann’s had been identified by means of the diary found in the pocket of the corpse’s overcoat. Within days of its burial at Lehrter Station, Moscow had ordered the body be disinterred.30 The corpse was dug up and removed – presumably to conduct forensic testing to see if it was, indeed, Martin Bormann’s remains. The remnants were subsequently reburied elsewhere in East Germany, without any report of whose remains they were, thus explaining why the Bormann family received no letter of his demise – apparently it was not him – and why Der Spiegel concluded Bormann was not found next to the dead degenerate doctor. If the Soviet report that Bormann’s body was buried somewhere outside of Berlin is true, whether it was Bormann’s remains or his double’s, it seems highly probable Bormann’s remains would not have been at Lehrter Station when the skull was dug up by workmen. Therefore, one would assume, the skull found there could not have been Bormann’s and the identification of the skull as his, was, at best, a serious mistake of inefficiency and sloppiness, and at worst, a fraud. Indeed, Ladislas Farago documents the skull actually went through four iterations,31 each succeeding cranium becoming more and more aligned with the dental sketch of Dr. Blaschke as succeeding complaints came in about obvious inconsistencies. In fact, writes Farago, Professor Reider F. Sognnaes, a specialist in oral biology and anatomy who had positively identified Hitler’s burnt corpse from its dental records, while initially vouching for the identification of the skull as Bormann’s being correct, was later so uncertain of the positive identification that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:177:5546b5e531e2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5260, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 178, "text": "Farago documents the skull actually went through four iterations,31 each succeeding cranium becoming more and more aligned with the dental sketch of Dr. Blaschke as succeeding complaints came in about obvious inconsistencies.

Sognnaes, a specialist in oral biology and anatomy who had positively identified Hitler’s burnt corpse from its dental records, while initially vouching for the identification of the skull as Bormann’s being correct, was later so uncertain of the positive identification that he wrote a letter of concern to West German Chancellor Willy Brandt. Sognnaes later stated, according to Farago “that he did not believe that the skull found … was the skull of Bormann.”32 Manning confirms this evidence regarding the skull, writing that one of General Gehlen’s aides – one of three independent sources refuting the claims about the skull – confided to him that “the skull is a fraud.”33 Forensics expert and author Hugh Thomas agreed the skull was a fraud, but disagreed that it was not Bormann’s. After carefully studying the forensic dental evidence available and the evidence surrounding the provenance of the skull, Dr. Thomas concluded the skull may be Martin Bormann’s – provided for the construction diggers to unearth after his real death.34 According to Dr. Thomas’s forensic analysis and accompanying research, Bormann’s death probably occurred in Paraguay in 1959. Dr. Thomas’s clarifications are compelling in that only one of two conclusions can explain the forensic evidence – both forms of fraud. The dental work of the skull, while clearly matching in many aspects that of Bormann’s, contained small but often unexplainable anomalies, and additional, in some cases major, dentition not performed on Bormann prior to his disappearance in May 1945. One explanation for the discrepancies would be that an existing person with dental characteristics of his own was fraudulently fitted with additional dental elements in an effort to fit Bormann’s dental profile, per Paul Manning’s description of Bormann’s double. It would be nearly impossible to find a man of Bormann’s age to serve as his double who had not already received dental work of his own. The second explanation would be Bormann actually did survive his Berlin adventure and subsequently had necessary additional dental work done to keep his teeth healthy in the intervening years between his escape and final demise. In either case, it is easy to see why the eminent Dr. Sognnaes, not imagining the latter explanation, could have at first confirmed the identification, and upon further consideration had reservations and reversed his findings. In the latest development regarding the skull, DNA tests were begun in May 1997 and a positive identification of Bormann was announced in May 1998, though no specific results have been made public.35 Such a finding would be the final word on the matter if the provenance of the skull was impeccable and the disposition of those who controlled the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:178:bf041b320674", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5261, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 179, "text": "the latter explanation, could have at first confirmed the identification, and upon further consideration had reservations and reversed his findings.

But, as has been shown, the confusion regarding the skull’s whereabouts for almost two decades, the inconsistencies between the dubious dental records and the new-found skull itself, the 50-odd years that had transpired since Bormann’s disappearance at age 45 – meaning Bormann almost certainly had died by 1997 and easily could have died in 1959, as reported, and his handlers may have supplied his skull in 1972 or submitted samples from his actual skull for DNA testing thereafter – and the fact he was not even in the grave to begin with, if the Soviet report is true, all combine to cast more than reasonable doubt, not so much upon the authenticity of the DNA tests, which, as demonstrated, could have gone either way, but upon whether they have any relevance in the matter at all. One last possibility is worth mentioning, however, regarding DNA testing of the skull. If the Soviet report is wrong and the skull tested for DNA was actually that of the person buried in Lehrter Station with Dr. Stumpfegger, it may well have been that of Bormann’s double. Mueller had successfully found a double for Hitler in one of the Fuehrer’s distant cousins. Might he have done the same for Bormann when developing Bormann’s double? James O’Donnell, author of The Bunker, noticed on a personal visit to Bormann’s hometown that a large percentage of the people there looked like Bormann, and were possible relations.36 If the body was that of a Bormann relative, DNA tests quite possibly would have shown similar markers with the DNA provided by the source relative, without the skull actually being that of Martin Bormann. Without full disclosure of the DNA tests, and without ensuring all appropriate testing was completed to isolate Martin Bormann as the individual in question, as opposed to the remains simply being those of someone related to Bormann, the DNA testing proves, once again, less than meaningful.

Mysterious persons were on board the submarine….38 Stalin continuously reiterated this belief, claiming Bormann was being harbored by the United States government in his escape and continued freedom. The Allies, led by the United States, refused to give this story credence and ignored Stalin’s demands for an explanation, and, in fact, began claiming in defense that the Soviets held Bormann – a claim they supported with Gehlen’s extorted account of Bormann living in Russia. But Stalin insisted until his death that his was the correct account of Martin Bormann’s fate. Why would Stalin make such a claim? What did he stand to gain if it was a lie? What did he stand to loose if it was true? And if it was true, why would the United States discount it out of hand? These seem to be the obvious questions concerning the matter, and will be answered later. But more important for proving the case, though much less glaring, are the small questions – the questions about the innocuous details that make up the fabric of Stalin’s very specific, though unlikely, story. If Stalin was not telling the truth, why did he include such unique, improbable and seemingly contestable details as the fact the airplane carried four people when the only two airplanes capable of using the ad hoc runway – the Fieseler Storch and the Arado – were designed, respectively, to carry three and two people. Depending on which witness tells the story, both the Fieseler Storch and the Arado are said to have been the escape airplane. A series of totally independent facts and accounts, however, corroborate Stalin’s very specific story. First, a makeshift runway is now well known to have been operating on the Tiergarten to service the Fuehrer Bunker during the last days of the war,40 although at the time of Stalin’s comment that knowledge was not widespread. Albert Speer, Hitler’s Munitions Minister, described flying into the stop-gap landing strip on the occasion of Hitler’s fifty-sixth birthday – celebrated a week before Bormann’s mysterious escape – when the Russians were still at the outskirts of Berlin.41 According to Speer, as an airplane prepared to land or take off, a detachment of SS soldiers would light a series of lanterns placed along both sides of the wide avenue that stretched from the Brandenburg Gate to the Reichs Chancellery. The airplane would use the strip and then the lanterns quickly would be extinguished again.

The airplane would use the strip and then the lanterns quickly would be extinguished again. Second, the great German aviatrix, Hanna Reitsch, a contemporary of Amelia Earhart’s and close friend of Adolf Hitler, had flown into Berlin only a few days previous to the mysterious escape flight.42 Reitsch had in the past received personally from Hitler, who adored her, the Iron Cross (the only woman to do so) both first and second class,43 for bravely test piloting the flying capabilities of a V-1 rocket that had been modified with a cockpit. She was also the first person to successfully fly a helicopter inside a building. Now, she had accompanied her lover Luftwaffe General Robert Ritter von Greim to Berlin so Hitler could make him the overall commander of the Luftwaffe in place of the recently dethroned Goering. During the flight into Berlin, Greim, who was piloting the Fieseler Storch, was injured by enemy anti-aircraft shrapnel. According to her own account, Reitsch reached over the General and landed the Fieseler. After landing, Reitsch and Greim were harbored in the bunker for a few days while Greim lay in bed recuperating before attempting the exit flight. Reitsch reported in a 5 December 1945 press interview44 that she, with a heavily bandaged General von Greim, flew out of Berlin from the Tiergarten at dawn on 30 April, exactly the same time Stalin reported Bormann’s mysterious escape flight took off. Later she recorded in her memoirs an odd justification for this event. Instead of flying straight to Austria, their ultimate destination, Reitsch wrote how they flew 400 dangerous miles, partly over enemy territory, with the badly injured and very important General von Greim, to Ploen, Admiral Doenitz’s headquarters.45 She gave the reason for this detour, depending upon which account one reads, as fulfilling an order from the Fuehrer to deliver an important package, or else the desire to wish the Admiral a fond farewell. Such a detour for such a superfluous reason as bidding farewell seems remarkably improbable given the desperate state of affairs on the military front and the injuries to General von Greim.

To be sure, other reasons were later given for the strange flight deviation, but, despite their seeming veracity, when subjected to even minimal scrutiny they seem almost as hollow as Reitsch’s “farewell” flight. The chief of these later assertions is that Greim was flown to Ploen after Hitler had concluded Himmler was a traitor who had begun separate surrender negotiations with the West. Supposedly Greim was sent to arrest Himmler.46 But the Fuehrer Bunker was in radio contact with Doenitz many times a day and could have had Doenitz make the arrest at any time. The wounded Greim, with his one-woman retinue, was in far less able condition to arrest Himmler than the healthy Doenitz with his considerable military cortege. Doenitz was a strict and efficient military professional with a strong reputation for carrying out his command. If Doenitz was not willing to fulfill the order, however, to send the injured Greim to enforce the order over Doenitz’s head and in his own headquarters, surrounded by the Admiral’s full retinue and in the face of Himmler’s substantial SS bodyguard, seems laughable. And if they had, in fact, flown to Doenitz for this purpose, why would not Reitsch have stated so in her memoirs, written many years later? The order for Himmler’s arrest was never a secret – not even at the time it was issued, much less decades later when she wrote her book. And in the end, when Greim met Himmler, he only told the Reichsfuehrer SS that Hitler had denounced him,47 further suggesting Greim was not really sent to Ploen to arrest the SS chief. In short, on the surface, there seems to be no viable official reason why Reitsch and Greim had flown to Ploen. There is a reason for the huge flight deviation, however, if they were not alone. The traditional history documents well Bormann’s intense efforts to make his way to Admiral Doenitz during this time.48 Bormann had told his family they would be escaping on a U-boat to Japan;49 and some of Bormann’s closest associates, including Gauleiter Erich Koch and others, expected to escape by U-boat as well, with Bormann’s help.50 So strong was Bormann’s effort to reach Doenitz that by 3:30 the morning of 30 April, Bormann had convinced Hitler to issue an order to his pilot, Hans Baur, to fly Bormann to Doenitz.51 With Bormann and Baur both aware General von Greim and Hanna Reitsch were preparing to fly out of Berlin within hours after Hitler gave the order, it seems highly", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:182:2250a54ae04d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5265, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 183, "text": "associates, including Gauleiter Erich Koch and others, expected to escape by U-boat as well, with Bormann’s help.50 So strong was Bormann’s effort to reach Doenitz that by 3:30 the morning of 30 April, Bormann had convinced Hitler to issue an order to his pilot, Hans Baur, to fly Bormann to Doenitz.51 With Bormann and Baur both aware General von Greim and Hanna Reitsch were preparing to fly out of Berlin within hours after Hitler gave the order, it seems highly probable they would take advantage of this opportunity. In fact, it seems especially so considering Reitsch did, in fact, fly to Doenitz’s headquarters, although there seems to be no viable reason for her to have gone there – as noted above – and there were many reasons for her not to go to Doenitz. Was Bormann the “important package” intended for the Grand Admiral? Possible validation of this phantom flight is provided in another flight supposedly made from the Tiergarten, which was reported to have occurred late on the night of 29 April 1945. The provenance of this account is suspect, but if it is true, it certainly adds to the argument Bormann and Gestapo Chief Heinrich Mueller may have escaped together by airplane. In 1996, author Gregory Douglas published the first of three volumes titled The 1949 Interrogation of Gestapo Chief Heinrich Mueller. The books are claimed to have been written from Mueller’s own records as provided to Douglas by the Mueller family. Douglas has done a considerable job of proving the information in the documents is true, even if the documents themselves may be suspect. Details of such a limited nature that few people would know them are included in the book, and they have been reviewed by Robert Wolf, who worked for many years as an archivist specializing in World War Two for the United States National Archives and Records Administration. In a telephone interview with this author, Mr. Wolf, though obviously finding his comments personally disheartening, if not distasteful, admitted that all of the details he could find independent, objective reference to that were claimed in Douglas’s account proved to be true. The records are purported to be a post-war interrogation of Heinrich Mueller by the OSS, forerunner of the CIA, when the agency was considering hiring Mueller and the substantial spy apparatus that the former Gestapo Chief operated throughout the Soviet Union and elsewhere. During the alleged interrogation, Mueller described his escape from Berlin on the night of 29 April, just before or around the same time Reitsch claims to have escaped, in a Fieseler Storch airplane,52 the same type of aircraft Reitsch claims to have flown. In his account, Mueller is flown out alone, with a male pilot the only other person in the airplane. Instead of flying to Ploen, Mueller contended the Fieseler Storch was flown south to the Austrian/Swiss border, the approximate", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:183:cbdcf4c1a76d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5266, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 184, "text": "the alleged interrogation, Mueller described his escape from Berlin on the night of 29 April, just before or around the same time Reitsch claims to have escaped, in a Fieseler Storch airplane,52 the same type of aircraft Reitsch claims to have flown. In his account, Mueller is flown out alone, with a male pilot the only other person in the airplane. Instead of flying to Ploen, Mueller contended the Fieseler Storch was flown south to the Austrian/Swiss border, the approximate location Hanna Reitsch described as her and General von Greim’s final destination following their detour to Doenitz’s headquarters. There are obvious inconsistencies in this tale compared to Reitsch’s – besides the fact that it may not even be true. But the discrepancies may be easily explained if the base assertion is true. First, if Bormann and Mueller did escape secretly in company of Reitsch and Greim, it would seem that as joint conspirators and protectors of the post-war Nazi cause they all would have agreed to eliminate each other’s escapes when reciting their own cover stories. For this reason, Reitsch would not have identified Bormann or Mueller as having been on the flight she piloted to Doenitz. Under the same agreement, Mueller would not have identified any of his flying mates either; therefore he reported he flew alone. As regards the connotation of time differences of the flights, it is logical to assume that he considered the pre-dawn hours of 30 April as part of the “late night” of 29 April, a very common conclusion many people would make. Second, Mueller would not have wanted to reveal the flight to Doenitz was tied to U-234 – considering the inferences of collusion that could later be made from that connection. At the time of his OSS interview, no one knew as well as Mueller how compartmentalized governments, and intelligence agencies in particular, are when it comes to maintaining state secrets. He could not assume the OSS officer interrogating him was aware of a possible Bormann/U-234 deal with the United States; and he would have known that that information was available within the agency on a “need to know” basis only. Since there was no need for his interrogators to know of the U-234 deal – in fact, there were good personal and United States national security reasons for them not to know of it – Mueller simply excluded any reference to it from the interrogation. Those in the know within the OSS/CIA would have expected him to do so, and he knew it. Third, Mueller was not with Reitsch and Greim when they landed in the Tyrol, but claims, instead, to have landed in a vacant area and to have crossed the frontier from there on foot. Again, this portion of the cover story served his, and Reitsch’s and Greim’s, purposes of keeping their stories separate.

Again, this portion of the cover story served his, and Reitsch’s and Greim’s, purposes of keeping their stories separate. One last set of observations may be made concerning Mueller’s reputed flight. While it was possible to fly in and out of the Tiergarten, it was not an easy thing to do and it was quite dangerous – as illustrated by General von Greim’s injuries a few days earlier. Such flights were even more risky during the last two days of April when the Reichs Chancellery was almost entirely surrounded by Soviet forces. The more flights that flew in and out of the makeshift airstrip, the more likely they would draw attention of Russian air or artillery reconnaissance. The Russians would then be more able to locate the airstrip itself, and, as a result, identify the general area of Hitler’s bunker. Given these considerations, it seems unlikely several flights per night were permitted. To suggest two, and possibly three, flights may have lifted off from the airstrip on the night of 29-30 April – Mueller’s flight, Reitsch’s flight, and the one Stalin claimed – while Hitler was still inside the bunker, seems risky, and therefore improbable, if not out of the question. The chances of multiple flights being allowed to depart seem even less likely when considering Reitsch’s and Mueller’s flights were supposedly both destined for approximately the same location on the Austrio-Swiss border; and likewise, Reitsch’s and Bormann’s flights both had a supposed destination of Ploen. Surely Hitler’s headquarters staff would have consolidated flights when possible, rather than let several take off and increase the risk of exposure. The trouble involved in lighting, dousing and relighting the airstrip multiple times and in keeping available a number of the rare airplanes capable of using the short landing strip also would have discouraged such activity. Even without the questionable Mueller account, using only Reitsch’s memoirs, Stalin’s story of the mysterious flight appears to have a strong basis in fact. Bormann and Mueller are known to have spent considerable time, energy and resources together prior to and in the bunker making escape plans.53 If Bormann and Mueller were in the Fieseler Storch with Hanna Reitsch and General von Greim, Stalin’s description of four people flying out of Berlin together, one of them Bormann and one a woman, would have been accurate to the tee. In addition, the description of the small party escaping in a large U-boat identifies itself particularly well with U-234, which, it will be remembered, had received at least one – and possibly two", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:185:04c17049fa5f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5268, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 186, "text": "in the bunker making escape plans.53 If Bormann and Mueller were in the Fieseler Storch with Hanna Reitsch and General von Greim, Stalin’s description of four people flying out of Berlin together, one of them Bormann and one a woman, would have been accurate to the tee. In addition, the description of the small party escaping in a large U-boat identifies itself particularly well with U-234, which, it will be remembered, had received at least one – and possibly two – radio transmissions from Hitler’s headquarters; and which led General Kessler to anticipate an important passenger coming from Berlin. And as will be reviewed in future chapters, Captain Fehler appears to have taken U-234 on a convoluted voyage, with each successive twist and turn apparently intended, at first, to keep U-234 within a few days proximity to Germany, and later, to hide the U-boat’s movements and activities as it tried to surrender only to the United States. U-234 was originally built as a mine-laying Type XB U-boat. These double-hulled, triple-sized U-boats were designed to seed strategically chosen bodies of water with high-explosive mines. The Allies became so adept at detecting and eradicating these mines before any harm was caused, however, that the Type XB quickly became obsolete.54 There was but a handful of Type XBs ever built: U-116 through U-119, U-219, U-220, U-233 and U-234.55 When the Type XB proved not to have the impact for which it was designed, the boats were refitted as supply vessels for the “Wolfpack” boats sinking Allied convoys on the battlefront in the Atlantic. Compared to the Wolfpack boats, however, Type XB U-boats were huge, more than 2100 tons displacement, while the ubiquitous Type VII U-boats that constituted 75 percent56 of Germany’s submersible fleet, were just over 700 tons – one-third the size of a Type XB. The other popular U-boat, the Type IX, was larger than the Type VII at anywhere from 900 to 1400 tons. But the Type XB was 50 percent larger than even these more common front boats that, combined with the smaller Type VII, constituted almost the entire remaining U-boat fleet. Russian agents reporting on U-boats were accustomed to both the Type VII and the Type IX and probably would not have differentiated them by size as out of the ordinary, as opposed to the probability of identifying U-234 as a large U-boat. Type XBs were comparatively very large and almost unknown. As noted, there had been only eight of them made. U-116 through U-220, with the exception of U-219, were all sunk in the year between the first of October 1942 and the end of October 1943.57 U-219 had fortuitously avoided this fate by being stationed in the Pacific immediately upon commissioning.58 In the South Pacific it was far away from Europe and Bormann and the fierce Atlantic fighting when the war in Europe ended.

When Germany surrendered, U-219, still in the Pacific, was turned over to the Japanese Imperial Navy to continue the war under the flag of the Rising Sun.59 U-233 had been sunk before commissioning, leaving U-234 as the only remaining “large” Type XB U-boat available in Europe that fit the description of Bormann’s alleged escape. The Type XIV U-boat was the only other U-boat larger than the popular Type IX and comparable in size to the Type XB. Like the XB, few of these boats were made – only ten – which were all built and operational by the end of 1942.60 Unlike the Type XB, none survived to the end of the war. They were designed and used as a refueling boat for the Wolfpack vessels, and, as a result, like the XB, had a very high mortality rate. The sinking of a single Type XIV shortened the combat patrols of approximately twelve fighting U-boats, so Allied anti-submarine hunters concentrated on what the German U-boaters affectionately called their “Milk Cows.” The process of refueling was dangerous, requiring the Type XIV fuel supply boat and its recipient lie still in the water for hours on end during the fuel transfer process. During this time, both boats were vulnerable to attack, which happened often, at which the panicked crews would quickly detach the umbilicals and both boats would execute emergency dives. The smaller fighting boat, with its more compact size, greater maneuverability, and with its more disciplined, battle-seasoned crew, would invariably be the first to maneuver out of harm’s way, leaving the clumsy behemoth Type XIV at the mercy of the enemy. It was an easy target. Of the 39,000 German sailors who fought on U-boats during the war, 28,962 were killed and an additional 4,000 captured. A total of over five out of every six U-boaters, therefore, was lost in the war. Remarkably, despite these numbers, Germany’s U-boat service was the only one of its military services that had more volunteers than it could use throughout the entire duration of the war.61 Type XIV U-boats had an abnormally high mortality rate compared to even these chilling statistics, making it apparent survival of a Type XIV U-boat for even a few months was miraculous.

U-234, therefore, was the only “large” U-boat left in the Reich’s fleet that would most closely fit Joseph Stalin’s escape boat description. And, as already mentioned, it is known that U-234 had received at least one radio transmission directly from the Fuehrer Bunker, and quite possibly more; and that Bormann, apparently, had some connection or even control over the U-boat. Apparently, the “wild pig routing for a potato” had dug up the morsel that would save his life. 1 James McGovern, Martin Bormann: 100,000 Marks Reward, p. 127 2 William Stevenson, The Bormann Brotherhood, p. 164 3 James P.

Had Bormann, from Hitler’s headquarters, set the final attack on Berlin as the automatic signal for Fehler to stealthily set to sea, from where he would await further orders? On the morning of 22 April, Bormann radiogrammed Helmut von Hummel, his top aide who was now working in Obersalzberg, “agree to proposed overseas transfer south.” Convoluted efforts have been made to suggest this message was actually code for Hummel, who was in possession of much of Bormann’s records and personal effects, to take the cache and “get out of town” over the south Tyrol and dispose of the goods in a safe place in southern Germany, Austria or northern Italy. The Soviet Bormann expert Lev Besymenski, however, interpreted this message to refer to a prearranged escape to South America, which seems far more probable given the “overseas” aspect of the message.3 If that was the case, it is one more piece of evidence Bormann was planning to escape by U-boat, the most probable method for a high-ranking Nazi leader to make an escape to South America. In Berlin, the Russians were daily tightening their noose around the beleaguered city and the core of Hitler’s remaining leaders huddled in the bunker under the Reich Chancellery.

During the final three days of April, virtually all Bormann experts agree, Bormann struggled mightily to escape the strangle-hold of Berlin and make his way to the commander of all submarines, Admiral Doenitz. At the same time, he held conference with Heinrich Mueller as they tried to execute their escape plan and finalize the details of fleeing Berlin.4 On the night of 28-29 April, when Hitler ordered Hanna Reitsch to fly out of Berlin with new Luftwaffe commander General Robert Ritter von Greim, the opportunity Bormann and Mueller were looking for had arrived. Even the traditional history concedes that at just this time Bormann succeeded in getting Hitler to order that he be flown to Doenitz. 5 Hitler had married Eva Braun and then composed his last will and testament and a political manifesto urging the continuation of Nazism and his legacy. These acts demonstrated he expected Nazism to carry on despite its dismal condition and his absence, for he had already declared he would commit suicide rather than leave a defeated Berlin while still alive.6 Bormann had waited anxiously for this moment. But up until then, the Fuehrer had not given the Reichsleiter final permission to forever leave his service. Bormann, loyal to the end, would not dream of deserting Hitler if he knew his master might need him yet. At 3:30 a.m. 30 April, the Fuehrer had concluded his baneful business on earth and all but ended his life. He would kill himself 12 hours later, but not before he had given the order to his pilot, Hans Baur, in no uncertain terms, to make sure Bormann got to Doenitz to deliver The Fuehrer’s last will and testament and political manifesto, which Bormann would hand carry and personally deliver to the Admiral.7 “Bormann has been given several orders which he must take to Doenitz in person.… It is most important that Bormann gets to Doenitz,” Hitler told Baur. Bormann’s uncanny influence over Hitler had worked one last time. According to author James P. O’Donnell, Bormann was simply substituted for Hitler in an escape plan Hitler’s pilot, Hans Baur, had prepared.8 O’Donnell reported the original plan, which according to Baur was never completed, was for Baur to fly Hitler out of Berlin, not for Hanna Reitsch to fly the substituted Bormann. Reitsch’s and Greim’s impending departure, however, and Hitler’s refusal to leave, provided a fortuitous opportunity to fulfill Hitler’s order of getting Bormann to Doenitz by implementing Baur’s plan, with Bormann and Mueller as the escapees instead of the Fuehrer, and Reitsch as the pilot instead of Baur.

Baur was extremely loyal to Hitler and he was a staunch Nazi9 to his dying day, and he reported directly to Bormann. 10 Given Hitler’s order to get Bormann to Doenitz, Bormann’s mission to preserve Nazism and the Fuehrer’s legacy, and Baur’s loyalty to the cause and subservience to Bormann, Baur would have done everything in his power to fulfill the order, despite the traditional history’s later ignoring the whole affair. At dawn of the same day as Hitler’s order to fly Bormann to Doenitz, 30 April 1945, Martin Bormann and Heinrich Mueller most likely departed with Hanna Reitsch and General von Greim toward Admiral Doenitz’s headquarters in Ploen. Bormann’s double remained to play unwittingly his farewell role in a final fraud performance. Given the convergence of so many disparate details – Bormann’s and Mueller’s escape preparations on the night of 28-29 April, which coincided with the timing of Hitler’s order that Bormann be flown to Doenitz during that exact timeframe; the report that Mueller had flown out to freedom at that time, as well; Reitsch’s admission that she flew a small plane to Doenitz the morning of 30 April to deliver an “important package;” and, again, Stalin’s insistence that Bormann escaped in a small plane at exactly the same time – the fact of all this disparate evidence converging despite such unlikelihood, seems far too compelling to be overlooked in favor of the historically entrenched but seriously conflicting versions of what occurred in the bunker, and of Bormann’s fate. Bormann’s and Mueller’s detailed plans at first worked. Indeed, five staunch Fuehrer bunker Nazis all testified they saw Bormann killed on Weidendammer Bridge, an assertion now considered by even hardened traditionalist ‘Bormann died’ evangelists to be a conspiratorial lie. And other would-be observers provided slightly different versions of the same story. The death-by-tank-explosion alibi, designed to end later searches, would insist Bormann and Mueller escaped Hitler’s headquarters with the others in the bunker the night of the breakout. Upon exiting the bomb shelter, the alibi went, Mueller and Bormann were separated and Bormann made his way to a location; possibly Weidendammer Bridge had already been selected. Possibly it was left to the vagaries of the fluid condition of the battle for that to be decided.

Both Paul Manning and James O’Donnell site accounts of a tank having been pre-arranged specifically to be at the bridge at the fateful moment to complete the illusion.11 Manning believed the story, O’Donnell did not. To further validate the death, Bormann’s double would be taken to the bridge and killed, to later be found with Bormann’s diary placed in the unfortunate corpse’s pocket.12 The journal would make identification of the body as Bormann’s easy, and conclude the illusion – much as Hitler’s double had been killed in the bunker and stuffed in a water cistern to throw investigators off of finding, exhuming and violating the Fuehrer’s remains. The “Bormann” body would validate the “eyewitness” reports of the Reich Minister’s demise: Bormann’s death would be assured and he would fade into the shadows of history. Once the machinations had been put in place to conclude the alibi and the story was disseminated to Hitler’s remaining top aids for post-surrender circulation, Bormann and Mueller flew with Reitsch and Greim to Hamburg, where U-234 would pick up Bormann just as Stalin insisted he had been gathered by a “large U-boat.” Reitsch, Greim and Mueller then flew on to Ploen to report to Doenitz, and then finally made their way to the Tyrol. If the above is true, the most probable scenario is that upon disembarking Hamburg, the U-boat took Bormann, under protection of the watchful eyes of the Allies – remember the planes that did not attack – through the English Channel to a prearranged rendezvous point in the Bay of Biscay. There he boarded another vessel and was ferried to the north coast of Spain, where OSS reports say he stayed with one “Leon DeGrelle.”13 In Spain, Bormann quietly completed his European business affairs behind the scenes and under the protection of Spain and, by secret extension, the United States’ watchful eyes, as he consolidated the underground economy that would soon reinvent Europe. The plan was a good one, detailed and well thought out considering all of the possibilities. But the unpredictability of battle, the serendipitous nature of fate, and the persistence of people who refused to let justice go undone, undid it. First, the integrity of the cover story was not kept after the key bearers of the alibi were captured.

Erich Kempka, Hitler’s chauffer; Hans Baur, Hitler’s pilot; Heinz Linge, Hitler’s valet; Johann Rattenhuber, chief of Hitler’s detective bodyguard; and Otto Gunsche, Hitler’s SS adjutant, were the survivors of Berlin who were closest to Hitler and Bormann during the final days in the bunker. They all asserted they saw Bormann die in the tank explosion on Weidendammer Bridge. As the keepers of the cover story, this was what they were expected to say. But others swore to different events, both on the bridge and off. As noted in the previous chapter, Roca-Pinar and Harry Mengerhausen testified to very significant variances in the Weidendammer Bridge episode. These versions possibly were the result of junior soldiers trying to support the prescribed alibi but either not having all of the details or taking some liberties in order to carve themselves a small niche in history. The later identification by Axmann of the dead Bormann on the Lehrter Station Bridge, not the Weidendammer Bridge, further undid Bormann’s and Mueller’s caper. Axmann may not have been lying, despite the bizarre details, when he told his odd story of calm corpses lying uninjured in the midst of the great battle. The peculiar circumstances of these deaths amidst the heavy action actually seem too strange to be fictitious, especially if one were trying to create a convincing alibi. Axmann probably had, in fact, checked the breathing of the poisoned body not of Bormann, but of Bormann’s double lying peacefully next to that of Dr. Stumpfegger. Stumpfegger’s presence may be a central clue in what happened, for it was Dr. Stumpfegger who had poisoned the Goebbels children and Hitler’s dog, Blondi. Here we have a man killing innocent victims left and right. Presumably, Stumpfegger was in on the phony Bormann escape scenario and it was his task to poison Bormann’s double – as he had poisoned the Goebbels children – to conclude the desired illusion.14 With the Russians already in control of Weidendammer Bridge, where the cover story was supposed to take place, Stumpfegger may have decided to “do in” the counterfeit Bormann on Lehrter Station Bridge instead. The Doctor probably calculated the Lehrter trestle was as close as he was going to get to fulfilling the details of the cover story and so committed the execution there. Once the deed was done, seeing he was on his own and devoid of hope of escaping the tightening Soviet ring himself, Stumpfegger concluded his grotesque killing spree by taking his own despicable life as well; following Hitler, Goebbels, General Burgdorf and others, in suicide.

Or possibly he knew too much and was done in by others. The skull later claimed to be his was missing a considerable portion of the top of it – it having been surgically removed – suggesting, according to forensic expert Dr. Hugh Thomas, that Stumpfegger was shot and the skull altered to remove the evidence.15 This point does not jive, however, with how Axmann reported he found Bormann – or actually Bormann’s double – and Dr. Stumpfegger lying dead, peacefully reclined side by side on Lehrter Station Bridge but otherwise unmarked. Bormann was supposed to have been escaping Berlin primarily to deliver Hitler’s will and political manifesto, which he was personally carrying to Admiral Doenitz. 16 The body found by the Russians was initially identified as Bormann’s when the Reichsleiter’s personal journal was found in its overcoat pocket. Hitler’s last will and testament and his political manifesto were never mentioned as having been found on the body, however, despite the obviously detailed scrutiny the Russians visited upon the remains – proving the Russians did not, in fact, have Bormann’s actual body, as they quickly surmised they did not. The second series of scenario-crippling conclusions to the traditional history came when additional facts began to arise. For instance, although the disappearance of Heinrich Mueller was lost on many in the confusion surrounding the escape attempt, a grave reportedly containing his remains was later identified in the Kreuzberg garrison cemetery in Berlin.17 Supposedly, he had been killed in street fighting during the escape. After that, each year for 18 years, flowers were placed lovingly at his headstone – presumably by family members. Later reports were received, however, suggesting that possibly the Gestapo Chief ’s remains were not in the coffin under the headstone bearing his name and at which flowers were regularly being placed. By order of the West Berlin District Attorney’s office, the remains were exhumed and forensics tests performed. The findings showed that bits and pieces of three men shared the grizzly grave, but none of them was Heinrich Mueller.18 The depth and breadth of the escape plan was beginning to become clear. Had Bormann and Mueller made plans so complete, so airtight, that they included detailed, carefully prepared camouflaging tactics to conceal the escapes, and carried out macabre charades for decades after to ensure their safety?

The answer, viewed against the conflicting testimonies and cryptic anomalies linked to the supposed demise of Martin Bormann, caused those who suspected Bormann might not have died in Berlin to look even closer at the evidence. Especially interested were those investigators, such as Paul Manning, 1 Ladislas Farago, 20 and William Stevenson, 21 who believed Bormann and Mueller together carefully worked out their escapes. Manning quoted an unnamed Bormann expert as saying “Bormann planned this flight with extreme care and part of the grand design was a scheme to lead future forensic and dental specialists astray.”22 The journalist later sited Mueller’s skill and considerable professionalism at such endeavors,23 which was evidenced by Hitler’s convincing double and the phony grave Mueller had had created for himself. Even Jochen von Lang, who ultimately insisted Bormann died in Berlin, intimated Bormann and Mueller worked on their escape plans together.24 If Mueller and Bormann went to such pains as Mueller’s fake grave to hide the escape, the investigators started asking, what had they done to prepare for it? As the investigators found and started pulling on loose threads, the carefully constructed tapestry began to unravel. Many will assert it was impossible for Bormann to have escaped Berlin because the testimony of witnesses who were with him and the long litany of radio transmissions he authored to Doenitz from the Fuehrer Bunker prove he was intact in Hitler’s headquarters until just hours before the escape attempt. A careful, chronological review of the messages and of his actions, however, reveals some interesting irregularities that demonstrate Bormann was not participating in events that were under his responsibility but that he almost assuredly would have been controlling had he been in the bunker. By deduction, therefore, they subtly suggest he was not in the bunker at all. Up until the night of 29 April, the historical record seems fairly unassailable except for one large, perplexing fact. The record shows Bormann was paying particular attention to keeping Admiral Doenitz informed of events in Berlin. Bormann’s constant contact with Doenitz is now accepted thoughtlessly, seventy years later, and is unquestioned. But in its contemporary political context, such activity on Bormann’s behalf is bewildering. Interface with Doenitz on the military situation in Berlin was undoubtedly needed, but it would have been a military matter and should have been carried out through Hitler’s military chain of command – which was still intact – not through a civilian office, which was Bormann’s domain.

Instead of Bormann in constant contact with Doenitz, it would have been expected, just as easy, and more efficient and appropriate for the Supreme Command to keep the ranking naval officer in the loop. Why Bormann, of all people, was in contact with Doenitz is an interesting question. Hitler had not yet announced his unexpected appointment of Doenitz as his successor, so it was too early for Bormann to initiate government business with the Admiral. Despite all Bormann’s machinations in the past, through which he at times had influenced military matters, Hitler had never allowed Bormann to participate directly in military affairs. And Bormann seldom showed more than passing interest in doing so. Despite these conditions, Bormann, for some reason, now was in regular contact with the U-boat supreme commander, constantly updating him on the state of the battle. On 29 April, the Reichsleiter wired Doenitz, “Situation very serious.… Those ordered to rescue the Fuehrer are keeping silent.… Disloyalty seems to gain the upper hand everywhere.… The Reichs Chancellery a rubble heap…. We are staying on.”25 Other than the incongruous chain of command, such an update, though abnormal, would not have – and has not – been considered remarkable. But considered in its full political context and in light of later developments, such communications appear to have been part of a more specific agenda, rather than a simple update on the state of affairs. Earlier that night, the last gasps of Hitler’s Thousand Year Reich had begun in earnest. The Fuehrer married, concluded all his worldly affairs, and began his last day on earth awaiting the moment to ignominiously end his life. Shortly before midnight on the 28^(th) or in the early morning hours of the 29^(th) , he asked his old friend Hanna Reitsch to fly General von Greim out of Berlin.26 While it is fairly certain Hitler gave the order for the flight on the night of the 28^(th) , historical accounts vary as to when the flight actually occurred. Some, such as General Koller in his account of events, claim the flight took place on the night of the 28^(th) . 27 His conclusion was possibly based on the assumption Hitler’s order was fulfilled on the night it was given. Such a supposition is probably in error, however, since it was already late night when the order was given and it would still take planning and logistical effort to arrange the flight.

Such a supposition is probably in error, however, since it was already late night when the order was given and it would still take planning and logistical effort to arrange the flight. Whether that could be accomplished in the hours of darkness that remained in the night of the 28^(th)/29^(th) is questionable. If time was not available, it would have been necessary to wait for the following night, in order to use the cover of darkness for the plane’s escape. Other witnesses claimed the flight occurred the following night, on the 29^(th) , which seems logical given the argument above. Hanna Reitsch herself stated in a news report that she and Greim flew out at dawn on the morning of the 30^(th) . 28 As has been noted already, it is a common conclusion to include all the dark hours of a single night as the night of the previous day. Thus it is reasonable to conclude that a flight whose passengers left for the airstrip, and that was prepared to leave in the pre-dawn hours, and then took off at the crack of dawn on the 30^(th) , would have been considered to have departed on the night of the 29^(th) . At about 1 a.m. the morning of the 29^(th) , Hitler married Eva Braun in a short civil ceremony witnessed by Bormann and Goebbels and attended by a few others.29 He then sequestered himself with a secretary and dictated his last will and testament and political manifesto, which he completed and signed about 4 a.m. A few moments later, at 4 : 17 a.m .,30 Bormann sent his message to Doenitz informing the Admiral of the dire state of the military situation in Berlin and of the Reichs Chancellery being “a rubble heap,” but that they were determined to “stay on.” He mentioned nothing of Hitler’s marriage or preparations for his death, although Hitler had already made his absolute decision to die in Berlin, as attested by granting Eva Braun her last wish of marriage to him and preparing his will. Despite this decision, later the same day Bormann sent another message to Doenitz challenging him to prove his loyalty by immediately relieving the Fuehrer. 31 What this meant is uncertain. Doenitz had already sent two divisions32 and a contingent of sea cadet trainees33 – most of whom were slaughtered – to defend Berlin.

Knowing Hitler vehemently had refused days earlier to escape to Bavaria, and that he had now determined and started the preparations to die in Berlin,34 it seems improbable Bormann was encouraging Doenitz to invest more men in yet another massive military rescue attempt of the Fuehrer, undefined as that may be. Hitler had determined his only acceptable rescue would be if German troops could win the Battle of Berlin and save him while he heroically led the battle from his hopelessly surrounded position. Otherwise, the Fuehrer did not want to continue his life. But winning the battle was unthinkable with the forces at Doenitz’s disposal and both Bormann and Doenitz knew it. The message to the Admiral, therefore, implying that Doenitz could somehow rescue the Fuehrer, seems to be the beginning of a series of deceptions Bormann would play against Doenitz for some mysterious end. The next 24 hours in the bunker must have felt hopelessly macabre for the subterranean survivors, with the final hours interminably passing and the incessant rumbling of heavy guns and artillery constantly jarring the earth overhead. Hitler’s generals sent communiqués far and wide, continually trying to save the desperate, gradually growing hopeless, situation. But Soviet forces were too strong and held a stranglehold on the city. At 3:15 a.m. 30 April, approximately one half-hour before Reitsch’s mysterious flight out of Berlin with her unknown passengers, and within hours following Hitler’s command to fly Bormann to Doenitz, Martin Bormann sent the Admiral another message.35 He described briefly how the Wehrmacht’s rescuers were “stubbing their toes,” inferring that a rescue by them was doubtful, and then added a postscript of sorts: “Addition from Berlin. Attempts will probably be made to jam radio transmissions. Do not let it upset you. Future communication will be forwarded to Ploen.” The message appears to be instructions to expect communications from Bormann to come from different transmission centers than from the bunker itself, or possibly by a different manner of communication altogether. At dawn a half-hour to an hour later,36 depending on which account one chooses to believe,37 Hanna Reitsch and General Robert Ritter von Greim flew out of the Tiergarten in a small aircraft, probably accompanied by Martin Bormann and Heinrich Mueller. Despite the plane’s short takeoff capacity – it was designed to be airborne in only 60 meters38 – and the fact the section of the Tiergarten being used as a runway was 750 meters long, the airplane barely cleared the statuary atop the Brandenburg Gate at the end of the take-off strip.39 The reason given for the dangerous near miss was the aircraft had taken", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:198:204565642828", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5281, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 199, "text": "of the Tiergarten in a small aircraft, probably accompanied by Martin Bormann and Heinrich Mueller.

Perhaps so. But perhaps the aircraft, which was designed to carry only two people, was carrying four people and whatever important baggage they could squeeze in. Such a scenario would explain the over-long takeoff and would certainly add credence to Stalin’s determined assertion that three men and a woman took off in a small airplane at the same time and place as this flight. Twelve hours later, around 3:30 in the afternoon of the same day, Adolf and Eva Hitler killed themselves. Two hours after that, Bormann informed Doenitz that the Admiral had been chosen the Fuehrer’s successor, but, mystifyingly, he did not tell the Admiral that Hitler was dead.40 Doenitz asked Bormann for verification from witnesses, apparently suspecting Bormann might be playing him for a dupe, as Bormann had played Goering. 41 Bormann made no effort to provide the requested witnesses – probably because he was no longer in the bunker to receive and fulfill the request; nor had he been for almost 12 hours. This may be the reason, in fact, that Bormann failed to tell Doenitz that Hitler was dead – he may not yet have known the suicide had occurred. But even if he did know the Fuehrer was dead, Bormann would have feared that witnesses would tell Doenitz, which would have ruined his plan. Fourteen hours after that, at 7 : 40a.m . on 1 May, Bormann again contacted Doenitz, this time to tell him Hitler’s testament was in force, but once again he did not share that the Fuehrer was dead.42 The Reichsleiter then recommended to Doenitz that he not publish this information; probably a cover to keep others from finding out Doenitz was in the dark and then informing him of the Fuehrer’s death, which would have undone Bormann’s plans. Historians for over seventy years have tried to explain in the context of the traditional history Bormann’s strange, outwardly unnecessary and seemingly meaningless efforts to not tell Doenitz of the Fuehrer’s suicide. In the context of the traditional history, regardless of the tortuous and convoluted explanations, Bormann’s messages seem to make little sense, though many writers have strained to read meaning into them. But against the background of the earlier reported radio signals to U-234 from the Fuehrer Bunker compared to Doenitz’s struggle to maintain command of the U-boat, Bormann’s strange convolutions begin to be clear.

The Reichsleiter, as only he could, appears to be playing a game of catand-mouse with the Admiral. There is evidence Doenitz was concerned Bormann was manipulating him, such as Doenitz’s request for witnesses to his being Hitler’s successor. Indeed, later Doenitz issued an arrest order for Bormann should he make it to Ploen.43 Apparently anticipating this, Bormann felt it necessary to manipulate the U-boat service commander, convincing him to commit to help Hitler’s escape – even though he, Bormann, would be the one escaping. Presumably, Doenitz’s thinking he was helping Hitler escape kept him from barring Bormann’s break out. Once U-234 was on its way back to Germany, Bormann appears to have kept Doenitz “on the string” by hanging the bait of being post-war leader of Germany in front of the Admiral, which Doenitz was guaranteed when Hitler named him his successor. But with everything lost, the real reason Bormann convinced Hitler to appoint Doenitz was so Bormann could manipulate the Admiral’s cooperation to affect his escape. Bormann needed that U-boat. With Doenitz feeling he was on the verge of leading the nation, Bormann knew the Admiral would be careful not to step outside of protocol, especially if he thought Hitler was still alive and had heard how the Fuehrer dealt with Goering and Himmler upon learning of their separate bids for control. But once Doenitz knew Hitler was dead, the Admiral’s command would be law and Bormann would be one of the first of Hitler’s paladins he would seek to bring down, and Bormann knew it. Until Doenitz became aware of Hitler’s death, however, Bormann would have the upper hand. So Bormann kept the death a secret. He flew out of Berlin, not to Ploen, as he told Hitler he would, but to Hamburg, where he waited for “a large U-boat” to land, while Mueller, Greim and Reitsch went on to Doenitz. At Spm . on 30 April, Bormann probably was hidden safely away not in the besieged bunker in Berlin but in Hamburg, awaiting the arrival of U-234, when he sent the message informing the Admiral that he had been chosen Hitler’s successor. Doenitz would not have been surprised if the message was identified as coming from Hamburg, or any other point for that matter, since Bormann, in anticipation of his escape requirements, had warned the Admiral to expect communications to come from almost anywhere because of possible signal jamming.

Doenitz would not have been surprised if the message was identified as coming from Hamburg, or any other point for that matter, since Bormann, in anticipation of his escape requirements, had warned the Admiral to expect communications to come from almost anywhere because of possible signal jamming. Bormann sent his last message to Doenitz on 1 May, informing the Admiral the testament was officially in force, while Bormann was safely ensconced in Hamburg but Doenitz thought he was in Berlin. Bormann was still careful not to let the Admiral know of the Fuehrer’s demise. As already mentioned, possibly Bormann did not know of Hitler’s death himself since he had not been in the bunker for hours before the suicide. In any case, Bormann appears to have tried to make Doenitz think he was in the Admiral’s control: “Testament in force. Will join you as soon as possible. Advise delay publication until then.” With that sketchy information, Doenitz would be careful not to overstep his bounds and would wait patiently for an explanation when Bormann arrived – and then he would arrest him. But Bormann never showed. The suggestion he was coming to Doenitz was a ruse, not just to neutralize Doenitz while Bormann waited for the U-boat at Hamburg, but it would work as well to camouflage his escape when investigators later pursued his whereabouts. While Doenitz later was told Bormann had been killed in the street fighting, actually Bormann set out to sea on the U-boat, which by then Doenitz thought was well on its way to Japan. Champions of the traditional history will assert there are serious flaws in these conclusions. They will ask, how could Bormann be in Hamburg waiting for the U-boat while he is known to have been participating in Hitler’s death and burial and the unsuccessful surrender negotiations with the Soviets during the early morning hours of 1 May? Or they will state Bormann’s alleged signing, with Goebbels, of the message later informing Doenitz that Hitler was dead, sent some time between 2:15 and 3 : 15p.m . 1 May, long after Bormann would have been in Hamburg waiting for the U-boat, according to the thesis of this book. The serious flaws in these accounts are actually in the traditional history. For despite assertions Bormann oversaw the Soviet surrender negotiations, General Krebs, who was sent to the Soviets to parlay, stated he could not agree to the Soviet demand for unconditional surrender because he did not have Goebbels’ authorization to do so.44 He never mentioned Bormann in this context, even though Bormann signed the authorization to initiate negotiations.45 Bormann probably signed the negotiation release, and any other anticipated documents, before leaving the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:201:4b93db7d3781", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5284, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 202, "text": "in these accounts are actually in the traditional history.

As the signatory of the release, Bormann almost certainly would have been expected to provide approval of the negotiations, too, had he still been present. And although the traditional history insists Goebbels forced Bormann to sign the document notifying Admiral Doenitz of Hitler’s death that afternoon,46 a photograph of the actual document as shown in Dollinger’s The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan shows Goebbels alone signed the communiqué to Doenitz – Bormann’s signature is not on it.47 This is an important and very telling discrepancy, since up until then all Fuehrer bunker communications with Doenitz had gone through Bormann. The telephone exchange of the bunker was also under Bormann’s direct command up until 30 April, after which Goebbels took control of the system48 – an event not likely to have been allowed by Bormann had he still been there. Apparently, judging from the evidence, the Reichsleiter seems to have left the premises. Bormann still had a presence in the bunker, though – in the form of his Gestapo-supplied double, who would soon be sacrificed on Lehrter Bridge. Undoubtedly those who did not know any better continued to account for the Reichsleiter in this inconsequential counterfeit. But those who knew Bormann was gone gave the double no consideration. That is why Krebs and Goebbels failed to take him into account in their dealings with the Soviets and Doenitz. 49 Many witnesses who were still present in the bunker later reported Bormann’s attitude changed profoundly, from overbearing to feckless, after Hitler’s death.50 Researchers have explained this as Bormann’s survival reaction to the loss of his protector, Hitler. But such a behavior swing seems out of character with the persona of the man, as illustrated by his radiogram sent after Hitler’s death in which Bormann, while informing Doenitz he was Hitler’s successor, was still forceful and confident in his position. This confidence does not square with the description of the man in the bunker at the time. The aberrant behavior of the ‘Bormann’ observed in the bunker, however, could be expected of a common man thrown into such bizarre circumstances as playing the role of a very important international leader during the catastrophic collapse of the empire that leader served.

Admittedly, the scenario above assumes much in certain areas of the account. No direct proof has surfaced that Bormann and Doenitz ever actually communicated specifically about U-234 or that any of the transmissions from Bormann to Doenitz originated from any other location than the Fuehrer Bunker. Nor is there any infallible documentary evidence that U-234 was part of an escape plan or that Bormann was ever aboard her. But the preponderance of circumstantial evidence – especially when viewed through the two filters of comparing disparate stories to find specific similarities and patterns, and of weighing evidence, or lack of it, against the possible vested interests of its sources – certainly tends to validate this scenario above the traditional history. Had the traditional history not been ingrained in the psyches of today, but instead was introduced objectively, side by side, compared against all the details above, as if in a court of law, the author believes the above scenario must be chosen, of the two, as the more likely course of events. And the explanations for the conflicts and incongruities of this scenario are much less strained than those leaps of faith presently accepted in the traditional history. Is it really more credible that Bormann was blown up inside a tank, or next to a tank that exploded so violently that his body went flying, and then he walked away without a mark before deciding to just give up and lay down and peacefully poisoned himself, even though 90 percent of his cohorts in the bunker survived, many of them much less survival committed than he? Is this the result of the elaborate and detailed plans Bormann and Mueller are known to have made for their escape? Or is it likely the Soviets would have found Bormann’s body, hauled it away for forensic investigation, but not found several large documents sewn into his clothing? Would the Soviets then have gone to the trouble of hauling the body back to its original makeshift grave and reburied it, rather than inter it in a location convenient to the forensic location? Stalin’s report of the flight from Berlin and Bormann’s boarding a U-boat in Hamburg, the Hanna Reitsch flight and Bormann’s determination to get to Doenitz, and Hitler’s order that Bormann be taken to Doenitz, all combine to present the most credible, compelling account for Bormann’s escape.

It is hard to believe Hanna Reitsch departed to fly to Doenitz at the same time Bormann was trying to get to the Admiral, by order of Hitler, and yet Bormann was not on that airplane. There appears to have been little reason for Stalin to lie about such an episode, for what could he have hoped to gain from it? If he had made it up, the Western Allies would have paid little attention to him, which is what they did, so such a concoction would be of little value. If it were true, however, especially considering the implications to the Soviet Union of the cargo U-234 carried, if Stalin knew about it, then Stalin would be upset and insist the mystery be resolved. Even if he did not know about the U-boat’s contents, but only that the United States helped with Bormann’s escape and in later harboring the fugitive, he could be expected to never let the subject die, which he did not during his lifetime.51 Certainly to protect its advantage gained by a Bormann deal for U-234, the United States would deny and minimize any such accusation – which it did and has done ever since. In fact, the United States threw the same complaint of harboring Bormann into the Soviet’s face – with the help of General Gehlen – in order to belittle the accusations against it, and confuse and defuse the public mind regarding Stalin’s claim. If Stalin was telling the truth about the flight from Berlin, as the details he included tend to demonstrate he was when compared against other, separate accounts, then why not about the large U-boat, as well? British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery was reported in early September 1945 to have said British Intelligence received a report of Bormann in Hamburg the night of 1May,⁵² apparently verifying Stalin’s assertion Bormann had been flown to Hamburg. That Bormann flew to Hamburg and escaped in a submarine is further supported by an episode Ladislas Farago described when he asked British Intelligence about a report that Bormann escaped in a U-boat. He was told by one of Britain’s highest ranking intelligence officers that they had investigated the report immediately after the war, but that the inquiry was more interested in the U-boat he escaped in than in the missing Reichsleiter himself.53 Two points are of interest in this response. The first is there was no denial Bormann had escaped by U-boat.

The first is there was no denial Bormann had escaped by U-boat. On the contrary, the connotation drawn from the response is that the report was true and there seemed to be additional specific knowledge about the escape and the escape vehicle, which would tend to validate the U-boat escape story. The contact noted that the investigation was later dropped, which is quite possibly a telling event, as well. The investigation would have been dropped once it was discovered the U-boat wound up in American hands, and probably not until then or until the safe disposition of the wayward U-boat and Bormann had been determined. The second point is almost all German U-boats had surrendered by this time, and, with the war over, held little more value than as surplus submarines for the Allied navies. Most were sunk as target practice shortly after the war. On the other hand, the Allies knew by then Bormann controlled all of Hitler’s vast wealth as well as the Nazi Party’s massive funds and properties and several colossal government accounts. In addition, he had untold knowledge about the workings of the Third Reich, its intelligence services and what they knew about the Soviet Union, which would be valuable in the upcoming Cold War; and international business dealings that were worth tens of billions of dollars. These were the spoils of war, and under the guise of reparations the Allies were intent on claiming them, if they could identify them. For that, it would be most helpful to have Bormann. What Bormann controlled, therefore, was far more valuable than a single submarine. Certainly Hitler’s missing lieutenant would take top billing over any single U-boat and its cargo, which British intelligence seemed so interested in – with the possible exception of the world-molding critical cargo of U-234. That cargo held a political premium unequalled at that time, or since. The mysterious activities of U-234 – which will be reviewed in the next chapter – overwhelmingly support the idea Bormann was picked up by the U-boat in Hamburg. Indeed, William Stevenson noted a direct link between Bormann and U-234 when he described how Bormann “had at his fingertips all the details required for … moving special cargoes like the dismantled rockets shipped by U-boat to Japan”54 as well as the scientists who developed Germany’s atomic bomb.55 1 Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi In Exile, p. 45 2 Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi In Exile, p. 185 3 Jochen von Lang, The Secretary, p. 332 4 William Stevenson, The Bormann Brotherhood, pp. 175, 290; Ladislas Farago, Aftermath, p. 158; Jochen von Lang, The Secretary, p. 290 5 James", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:205:271322c4bba1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5288, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 206, "text": "fingertips all the details required for … moving special cargoes like the dismantled rockets shipped by U-boat to Japan”54 as well as the scientists who developed Germany’s atomic bomb.55 1 Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi In Exile, p. 45 2 Paul Manning, Martin Bormann: Nazi In Exile, p. 185 3 Jochen von Lang, The Secretary, p. 332 4 William Stevenson, The Bormann Brotherhood, pp. 175, 290; Ladislas Farago, Aftermath, p. 158; Jochen von Lang, The Secretary, p. 290 5 James P.

The whereabouts of U-234 from 16 April until 12 May 1945, almost a month, is a mystery hidden by a series of riddles, to the point of almost being a conundrum – an unsolvable puzzle. Review of the U-boat’s logbook itself reveals a perplexing collection of contradictions when compared against intercepted radio transmissions, other accounts of the voyage, and even other information within the same logbook, suggesting at least part of its record is falsified. In fact, even a cursory glance at what are purported to be various pages of the war log reveals astounding inconsistencies in the physical nature of the book and the handwriting therein, leading to questions and doubt regarding its very provenance. In addition, the few apparently clear facts provided by the war log reveal a bizarre and unexpected travel routine for a fleeing U-boat. And the actions taken by the U-boat commander in the final days prior to its surrender are duplicitous and deceitful – and apparently in coordination with United States Navy activities. In short, the evidence suggests U-234 may not have left Norway under the conditions reported, probably did not cruise the course across the Atlantic it was claimed to have traveled, and definitely did not surrender when, where and to whom it was ordered to capitulate. Instead, in almost every case its commander, Captain Lieutenant Johann Heinrich Fehler, appears to have been intent on achieving a different, unknown end. Even before the U-boat cast off from the pier at Kristiansand, its presence was generating considerable interest – both in Germany and across the Atlantic in the United States. A captured German Enigma radio encoder/decoder had allowed the Allies to decode U-boat transmissions describing U-234’s secret mission and other aspects of its operations. As noted in Chapter Nine, U-234 had received important radio transmissions that indicated a struggle was taking place over chain-of-command of the U-boat between Hitler’s headquarters and U-boat Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz. There is some interesting additional information that reveals the level of effort later made to hide the truth about what really happened on U-234. Hirschfeld had written two accounts of his experiences on U-234. The first book, Feindfahrten, was written in German and contained several cogent details that are not included in his second account, Hirschfeld, The Story of a U-boat NCO – 1940-1946, written in English several years later with Geoffrey Brooks as co-author.

Ensuing claims were made that Hirschfeld had, in fact, falsely elaborated his account of events. Such after-the-fact editing seems suspect, however, given the proven veracity of many other elements of Hirschfeld’s accounts – which will be pointed out as our narrative continues – and the chain of anomalies and enigmas unrelated to Hirschfeld, but unexplainable except in the context Hirschfeld’s account provides. As noted before, in Hirschfeld’s early version Kessler surmised Berlin was sending another passenger to travel in the U-boat and he guessed the unexpected traveler would be Hermann Goering. Fehler was horrified when Kessler called him “The Fat One.” But Kessler went on to explain that Goering’s presence in the U-boat was unacceptable to him because he and Goering had had a falling out and so he was not prepared to spend several months confined in small U-boat quarters with the Luftwaffe Reich Marshal. Shortly after receiving the message from Hitler’s headquarters about a secret passenger en route to U-234, according to Hirschfeld’s German account, the second dispatch came through the flotilla communications center from “Bubbi.” Hirschfeld’s later English version of events once again excludes any mention of this transmission. Hirschfeld claimed in his first book, however, the communiqué again was sent on a leadership-dedicated frequency just as the first had been. Although no back-up documentation is available to validate the “Bubbi” message claim, this dispatch, too, I believe may be taken at face value because Hirschfeld so consistently provided accurate details as the enmity between Kessler and Goering, and the OSS documentation validating the struggle for control of the U-boat3 in virtually every other episode he shared that can be documented. Upon receiving Doenitz’s order to follow only his command and to leave port when ready, according to Hirschfeld, Fehler openly acknowledged the clash over chain-of-command of the U-boat by joking about Doenitz’s willingness to take on the top brass – a direct confirmation of the struggle over control of U-234 at the highest levels. But this put Fehler in a tight spot. How could he execute conflicting orders from both the supreme commander of the U-boat navy and from the Fuehrer’s headquarters itself? Should he fail to do either, the personal consequences promised to be catastrophic. Certainly, at the very least, an order directly from the Fuehrer’s headquarters to Fehler had to have a profound influence personally on U-234’s commander.

Fehler would need to work magic to squeeze out of this, his very first pickle as the U-boat’s captain – and he had not even left friendly shores! Yet he seems to have worked some effective sleight of hand, for radio transmission intercepts record that U-234 apparently fulfilled both orders!

In this report the U-boat departed 16 April. Figure 2: The second intercepted report of U-234 leaving its Norwegian port, this time on 18 April. By this time, according to U-234’s logbook, the U-boat was already 200 miles north of its port of departure and had been sailing for two days. Here is the second of our circular puzzles. The intercepts record U-234 had “put out of Kristiansand south” on 16 April, according to one transmission. But the other transmission states clearly it was in process of leaving port two days later, on 18 April. How could the U-boat have left port on the 16^(th) and still be leaving Kristiansand two days later on the 18^(th) ? Possibly Fehler had changed plans and returned. According to U-234’s “official” log, however, on 18 April the U-boat was already approximately 200 miles away, heading north in the opposite direction reported on the 16th, and was then in the latitudes around Bergen, Norway.7 Apparently the U-boat had not changed plans or been called back, if the log is correct. But then, we shall see that the log, itself, is suspect. For it ends abruptly on 18 April,8 the very day of the second report of U-234 exiting port.

The strange contradiction of the two messages regarding U-234 leaving port twice may be answered once again by radioman Hirschfeld, in another of his cryptic, abstruse passages that shines a wavering light on these mysterious movements. In both of his accounts of the journey he writes that, once U-234 was clear of Kristiansand, U-boat Commander North Captain Hans Rosing sailed to and boarded the U-boat from a “communications launch” [italics added]. As a researcher this event perplexed me because, although Hirschfeld inferred it occurred off of Kristiansand, I knew Rosing was headquartered in Bergen. True, he may have been visiting Kristiansand on official or personal business. The U-boat base was certainly within his jurisdiction. But why would he wait for U-234 to leave Kristiansand and then chase it down in a small craft rather than address its crew at the pier, safely ensconced in the U-boat bunker, which was the much more common, efficient, time saving and far safer practice for both the high-ranking officer and the U-boat? After reviewing Hirschfeld’s writings and the intercepted “second exit from port” message, combined with the evidence of the strangely truncated logbook on the one hand, and the position of U-234 near Bergen, as posted in that logbook on the other hand, it seemed to me U-234 secretly had detoured to Bergen for an unknown purpose. If this was the case and the detour was supposed to be kept secret, it would explain the mystery of one logbook having been discontinued abruptly on that very day, rather than record the fact of the Bergen visit. A “mock” or replacement logbook would then have to have been created – possibly right away, possibly at a later date – to hide the clandestine detour and future deceptive events. Hirschfeld’s description of the meeting with Rosing strongly supports the idea U-234 visited Bergen. According to Herbert Werner, author of the classic U-boat account Iron Coffins, and himself a U-boat commander serving in Norway at the time, Rosing was, in fact, in Bergen during 16 through 19 April, 1945.9 Rosing himself asserted he did not remember his whereabouts at the time,10 although the event seems so singular one would expect the key details to remain in his mind. Whether at Kristiansand or Bergen, almost certainly Rosing and Fehler did not risk their one-of-a-kind U-boat, priceless cargo and important passengers and crew sitting openly in the dangerous waters off port – where British submarines and anti-submarine aircraft regularly prowled to interdict U-boat activities – just so Rosing could give three cheers for captain and crew.

One can only speculate what the purpose of the detour might have been. The few small clues Hirschfeld provided, and knowing Fehler was caught in the middle of a perilous game of cat-and-mouse between Doenitz and the Fuehrer’s Headquarters, surely must be considered as a context for any masquerade. There must have been an important operational reason for this secret side trip. Probably that reason is revealed in Hirschfeld’s description of the boat that brought Rosing to U-234’s side – he described it as a communications launch [italics added]. Apparently certain communications were of such high importance or of such a secret nature they were encrypted at sophistication levels where their decryption was possible only at properly equipped high-level communications centers, and not on the average U-boat. At least, such seems to be the case here. Possibly Rosing was hand delivering one of the special-frequency dispatches from the Fuehrer Bunker that U-234 was not equipped to receive; so this detour was U-234’s “at sea” version of Hirschfeld’s visits to the Kristiansand communications center on land. We may speculate such a message most likely was operational orders for U-234, possibly resolving the struggle between Doenitz and Berlin over who would control the U-boat, or perhaps giving instructions on how to deploy until time to pick up its secret guest from Berlin. Or the communications launch itself may have been sent to transfer to U-234 the equipment required to receive the special-frequency messages from Berlin. This is conjecture, but certainly not outside the realm of possibility. Hirschfeld makes it clear in his writings the radio components of the boat were modular and easily changed in and out of the console;11 and that the boat was equipped with the very latest instrumentation and every possible technical advantage. Rosing’s final words to captain and crew may be telling about what he knew of the mission of U-234. He said, “Comrades, when you return from this mission, we will have our final victory.” Given the desperate situation for Germany – it would fall within two weeks – the crew rightfully, though quietly, questioned his sanity. But given the purpose of U-234’s mission, if there was hope of victory at all for the Third Reich, it was in the success of this mysterious made-over minelayer – and, tellingly, Rosing knew it.

But what of the strangely truncated logbook – which leads to our third puzzle? Why does one logbook end abruptly and its supposed sequel not jive with the rest of the evidence regarding U-234’s movements? When I first requested a copy of the captured war log of U-234 from United States archives at the beginning of my research, I was told by an archivist the logbook had been thrown into the sea by U-234’s captain. He asserted Fehler got rid of the journal prior to the U-boat’s surrender to avoid compromising the document and the boat’s movements. But U-234 carried Nazi Germany’s greatest secret weapons, I reasoned, including the V-4 rocket, the Messerschmidt 262 jet fighter, all of the plans and documents required to manufacture them, atomic bomb components and presumably plans to build those weapons, as well. If Fehler did not know the important details about his freight, which seems improbable despite his later claims, he at least knew the basic reason for and deep importance of his cargo, passengers and mission, and yet he surrendered them all intact. I reasoned this was a significant incongruity. Had Captain Fehler surrendered the valuable Nazi secrets and personnel, supposedly with little more than a second thought, but had refused to surrender his comparatively trivial logbook? The journal, presumably, simply reported the course he cruised prior to surrender. What could be damning about that if the story was as simple as suggested? No, the logbook itself apparently held important secrets Fehler did not want revealed, and thus Fehler had indeed consigned it to the deep and we would never know U-234’s whereabouts between 16 April and 12 May 1945. Or, possibly, the book was intact but held damning evidence, and thus was being kept in some separate archive out of circulation from prying eyes. When during a research session in Washington in 1997, I was told the Library of Congress held a collection of captured German documents, I raced over to the venerable old building in hopes of locating the missing log. I was informed the captured documents did indeed contain a journal from U-234, but that all the documents had been microfilmed and returned to Germany to be archived there. Satisfied with the opportunity to read the microfilm rolls, I began searching for traces of a logbook from U-234. Microfilm roll 18 held what I was looking for – almost.

A logbook identified as that of U-234 began on 24 March 1945, the day before the U-boat’s departure from Kiel to Kristiansand. As noted previously, it ended abruptly on, of all days, 18 April 1945 – the same day of U-234’s mysterious “second exit” from port. I use the word “abruptly” because, while the U-boat’s activities were meticulously detailed throughout the days and weeks leading up to and through 17 April, including leaving Kristiansand on 16 April – corroborating the first intercepted message of it leaving port on that day – the heading “18 April” is written in longhand halfway down the page, but the rest of the page is empty, as if it was then forgotten about. There are no entries in the half-page underneath the date. No course coordinates, no weather reports, no times, no bearings. The remaining halfpage is just blank. And there are no entries for the 19^(th) or 20^(th) – the microfilmed portion of the log does not pick up again until 12 May, the day U-234 first transmitted its intent to surrender to Allied forces.12 Baffled by the inconsistencies and the gargantuan gap in the record, I approached a Library of Congress archivist, who informed me the original logbook, of which I now had access only to a microfilm copy, had been sent to the Bundesarchiv in Germany. He suggested perhaps I could get the missing portion of the record from there. I faxed the Bundesarchiv, requesting a copy of the missing portion of the log, if they had it. In return I was mailed a photocopy of record RM 98/676, with the words “Uboot U234^(′′) written in blue fountain pen ink on the front cover. Nowhere throughout the entire document is U-234 identified as an organic, photocopied part of the journal as the U-boat of record. The copy of the log begins on 19 April, per my request (I now wish I had requested it from 24 March, when U-234 left Kiel. I wonder if the record would have started then or abruptly on 18 April?) and ends on 12 May, the day Fehler radioed his intent to surrender. by Allied radio direction-finding coordinates, and as substantiated by Hirschfeld and even Fehler himself, during later accounts of events. And the Bundesarchiv logbook is neither the same printed layout nor are its entries written in the same handwriting as that of the logbook microfilmed by the Library of Congress, of which the Bundesarchiv copy was supposed to be part and parcel.

And the Bundesarchiv logbook is neither the same printed layout nor are its entries written in the same handwriting as that of the logbook microfilmed by the Library of Congress, of which the Bundesarchiv copy was supposed to be part and parcel. In fact, when I had Captain Carl Triebes, USN (Ret), an experienced submariner and navigator, chart U-234’s course from the information given in the Bundesarchiv logbook, Captain Triebes stated he did not think the document was a working logbook at all – the handwriting and layout of the log were just too nicely done. He felt someone had copied it over from an actual log to make it more presentable. I had not told him about the project I was working on or what I expected him to find, so this volunteered observation seems a compelling indication that perhaps the logbook was “doctored.” Since both the intercepted transmissions and the Bundesarchiv logbook are primary evidence – authoritative, contemporaneous and organic to the events under study – these conflicts are significant. The inconsistencies in the evidence suggest gross negligence or willful deceit in completing one or both of the records. Radio intercepts are and were dispassionately dated intelligence for the purpose of tracking important events, and there seems to be no reason why anyone would manipulate these particular records. On the other hand, that there are major inconsistencies between the physical and informative aspects of the Library of Congress and Bundesarchiv logbooks when compared to each other, or to the external, objective, solid data collected elsewhere, casts considerable doubt on the logbooks’ veracity, in the opinion of this researcher. The data recorded in the Bundesarchiv logbook in many cases does not fit either the official account or unofficial recollections given of U-234’s journey; and on another level, in fact, the entries appear to try to hide the U-boat’s actual movements. One can make a long list of details within the Bundesarchiv logbook that conflict with other data in the log or with other substantive evidence regarding the movements of U-234, or that is incongruous with the U-boat’s stated mission and the rest of its activities. Thus all the information together suggests an organized effort to camouflage U-234’s movements. For example, according to its daily noon-time coordinates postings, the fleeing U-boat – specially equipped to sail submerged at eight to ten miles-per-hour, and almost 20 miles-per-hour surfaced,13 was hardly moving throughout most of the voyage, traveling at between one and two-and-a-half miles per hour – just enough speed to maintain steerage. The average man walks between two and two and-a-half miles-per-hour.

Despite his reference to “economic underwater speed,” the boat was not running submerged at night, nor was it planned to sail to Japan without refueling, although it had the capability. While Fehler later explained this slow pace by suggesting it was the most economic speed for such a long mission,14 intercepted transmissions show U-234 planned to refuel in Indonesia, 15 even though it had enough fuel to make Japan sailing under normal conditions.16 Considered against this information and the nature of the mission, the special capabilities of the U-boat, and reports it later sailed submerged for six days, apparently unnecessarily – using much more fuel than sailing surfaced would have required – the slow speed recorded in the log seems to suggest Fehler was marking time in an effort to remain close to home. Another example of deceit? There are other sizeable and apparently unexplainable discrepancies between where the U-boat was at a given time as recorded in the logbook according to celestial or electronic navigation coordinates, and where it was plotted to be according to reckoning by distance and compass direction. Records of both techniques were kept in the log. Small disparities between these two forms of navigation are to be expected as they are used to crosscheck one another. But the errors recorded in the case of U-234 occur too often and are too large – off by as much as 200 percent or more in speed and almost 90 degrees in direction in a single day’s travel. In short, while certain details seem to be accounted for in the log, like a near-miss with a steamer and an electrical fire, which are both recorded in Hirschfeld’s account as well, the general plotting in the logbook appears to be patently and inexplicably sloppy and inaccurate. The gross disparities in the record suggest someone was completing the logbook very quickly and without caring where U-234 actually was when the entries were being made. In fact, completion of the log seems to have been done with little concern for ensuring the two forms of navigation would validate one another at all! And as the journey progressed, the errors became greater.

In fact, completion of the log seems to have been done with little concern for ensuring the two forms of navigation would validate one another at all! And as the journey progressed, the errors became greater. For example, in the opening hours of 1 May – about the same time Martin Bormann was trying to make it to a rendezvous with a giant U-boat in Hamburg, according to Stalin’s report – U-234 broke from its planned journey and turned due east, back toward the North Sea, from a southwesterly course. The logbook records this diversion lasted only one hour. Review of the events leading up to and after this strange change of course, however, may be revealing. Beginning in the early morning hours of 30 April, about the time Bormann was concluding a series of deceptive dispatches to Doenitz to arrange the final details of his escape from Berlin, a series of changes in U-234’s operation were entered in the log. First, and perhaps most telling, the logbook records that Fehler now chose to run submerged in the Atlantic for six days straight, even though the U-boat was now breaking into safer open water; whereas the Bundesarchiv log and Hirschfeld both agree that previous to this time, but after the near miss with the steamer, U-234 had run surfaced almost every night, despite being in the much more dangerous Iceland/Farroe Island narrows.17 According to the logbook, U-234 sailed submerged continuously without surfacing from the early hours of 30 April until late 5 May – the same crucial time span between Bormann’s disappearance from Berlin starting on 30 April, to Doenitz’s capitulation on 5 May. If true, running for almost six full days either fully submerged or at snorkel depth was a rare event for any U-boat, much less one running free and undiscovered in the open sea. [] Figure 6: The page for 1 May 1945 from U-234’s second logbook. Page shows the first of five full days recording the U-boat ran submerged continuously, either with or without snorkel. The U-boat was alledgedly now in the open sea with little need to run submerged, especially at night. This is the timeframe that Martin Bormann, Hitler’s top lieutenant, was picked up in Hamburg by a “large submarine.” Even Fehler identified the logbook is only partially true when he later wrote that on the first two nights after passing through the strait his efforts to surface were thwarted by unidentified aircraft on his radar.19 He affirms, however, that on the third night the U-boat was able to remain surfaced “for several hours.” This is in direct conflict with the logbook. He gives no account of the fourth, fifth and sixth nights.

He gives no account of the fourth, fifth and sixth nights. Hirschfeld’s account of these critical first days in the Atlantic, while brief, differs markedly from Fehler’s. He states “during the first night we were obliged to dive twice because of aircraft,”20 the connotation being that during the rest of the first night and on the remaining nights, the boat ran surfaced, not submerged as the log reported. Later analysis of Fehler’s account will prove even greater disparity between what was written in the logbook and what appears to have actually occurred. In trying to decide which record is true, Fehler’s, Hirschfeld’s or the seemingly faulty logbook, the operational situation of the U-boat must be considered. Fehler was now on the open Atlantic where U-boat interdiction was considerably leaner than on the North Sea and where he had much more room to maneuver, whether surfaced or submerged with thousands of feet of water beneath his keel, and the benefit of the best radar. Additionally, in this part of the Atlantic where it was more difficult to support antisubmarine activity from land bases, U-boat detection by the enemy was usually made only when a U-boat attacked an enemy ship. Therefore a U-boat that did not attack was all but safe from detection. Fehler admitted as much in an undated letter written to Harry Cooper, president of Sharkhunters, 21 in which the captain stated he was little concerned about being discovered; he had no intention whatever of attacking anything. In fact, he intended to steer clear of all contact. These accounts also document the superior protection provided by the special radar with which the U-boat was equipped; which could search the ocean and skies for miles in all directions within a split second without giving away the U-boat’s location.22 The cutting-edge radar system had already saved the U-boat from serious incident once, having early in the voyage detected anti-submarine airplanes, allowing Fehler to evade danger long before the planes could get a fix on the U-boat.23 Considering his superior radar and all of these favorable conditions and the greatly improved fuel economy and speed of running surfaced as opposed to snorkeling, Fehler had comparatively good reason to run surfaced, at the very least during the dark of night, as he had done in the much more dangerous North Sea.

He even wrote in his letter to Cooper, “Later on in the open ocean, staying submerged during daytime offeres (sic) a fair chance to pass through undetected,” [italics added for emphasis]. He thus inversely infers that he did, indeed, sail surfaced at night during this time, despite the logbook’s entries that he was submerged, and again corroborating Hirschfeld’s account.24 Perplexing and contradictory as it seems, however, the logbook does, apparently deceitfully, record that Fehler had, in essence, “gone to ground” and remained submerged for the entirety of those six days. Considered against the U-boat’s operations in the Iceland/Farroe Island Narrows, its superior radar equipment, Fehler’s supposed concern for fuel economy, and other conditions as have been outlined, sailing submerged in the open Atlantic for six days straight seems unlikely. A second set of telling data regarding such a detour arises from conflicts within the Bundesarchiv logbook itself, and between the logbook and another record, as well. During the voyage, General Kessler was entering in his diary the U-boat’s position coordinates taken at noon each day.25 His postings match exactly those of the logbook until 30 April – the very day U-234’s mysterious movements begin – when Kessler, for the first time during the journey, failed to post coordinates. On that day, the Bundesarchiv logbook showed coordinates at noon of 61º 58’ N, 14º 49.5 W, a distance from the previous coordinates that roughly represented the U-boat’s average speed thus far. The following day, Kessler posted the exact same coordinates for 1 May that the logbook showed for 30 April – 61º 58’ N, 14º 49.5 W. For 1 May, the logbook in its turn showed 61^(∘)14^(′)N , 16^(∘)08^(′)W, , indicating U-234 had traveled the average daily distance again. Up to this point, because the logbook entries remain consistent with daily distances covered, one would assume the logbook is correct and Kessler had just made a mistake. That Kessler’s diary exactly matched the coordinates in the logbook until 30 April and then, even when it differed, it showed only an apparent error in transcription of being off by one day, supports this idea. Perhaps Kessler was receiving his data secondhand as provided by the sophisticated radio navigation system U-234 deployed. But Kessler never corrected his 1 May entry, even though it obviously would have been wrong when he updated his diary the following day, on 2 May. Reviewing the coordinates given in the Bundesarchiv log beginning the very next day, however, on noon of 1 May and again on noon of the following day, shows the U-boat traveled barely half of its already slow average", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:219:d0094aae9029", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5302, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 220, "text": "was receiving his data secondhand as provided by the sophisticated radio navigation system U-234 deployed.

Reviewing the coordinates given in the Bundesarchiv log beginning the very next day, however, on noon of 1 May and again on noon of the following day, shows the U-boat traveled barely half of its already slow average daily distance. Such an adjustment considered with Kessler’s erratic entries of the days prior may suggest a correction of some sort was made in the log instead. This suggestion becomes more plausible when one considers that the distance traveled for the same 24-hour period, as directly written in the log, is over 60 statute miles – five statute miles above the daily average, not half of it, as the distance between coordinates show for that day. One minor course change recorded during that period would hardly have impacted the overall distance traveled and therefore could not be accountable as a mistake for the discrepancy between the two entries. The record therefore suggests uncertainty about where U-234 was, beginning on 30 April. The stream of conflicts within the logbook consistently increased from this point forward. A second inaccuracy occurred two days later, between 3 and 4 May, when the posted coordinates recorded the U-boat again moved only a handful of miles, certainly fewer than ten. But the logbook stated 54.7 statute miles had been traveled with no course changes significant enough to account for the difference. Perhaps tellingly, General Kessler’s diary on 3 May fails for the second time to record any daily coordinates at all. This herky-jerky motion of the U-boat from day to day as recorded in the logbook, which is out of phase with Kessler’s also herky-jerky data, but which Kessler seems to try to account for, seems on the face of it to indicate uncertainty as to where the submarine actually was after 30 April. It is almost as if someone after the fact went back through the log and, ignoring the direct reckoning recorded as direction and speed, entered the series of coordinates they wanted reported regardless of what actually occurred. A third conflict that continues the fantasy – the largest of the three – occurs in the 24 hours between 5 and 6 May. The coordinates posted show distance traveled of about half of the 55-statute mile daily average, for a total travel distance of about 30 statute miles. But the actual distance reported records a whopping 99 miles – close to twice the average daily distance and three times that calculated by the coordinates reported! This is the furthest distance in a single day U-234 traveled, by far, recorded to that point in the journal.

This is the furthest distance in a single day U-234 traveled, by far, recorded to that point in the journal. What compounds this truly significant and very obvious discrepancy is that course bearings given throughout the 24-hour period are almost consistently 220^(∘) , a straight line west-southwest. But the end coordinates show U-234’s position was about 30 miles southeast of its position 24 hours prior. In other words, both the distance and the direction traveled are in serious discrepancy within the log itself! The distance traveled, as entered directly in the logbook, differs not only by about 60 miles, or three times the distance calculated from the coordinates, but the logbook is off by almost 90^(o) in direction, or one-quarter the arc of the compass, as well. As noted earlier, marginal differences in a course tracked by coordinates compared against a course tracked by bearings and distance are to be expected. Winds, currents and human error of just fractions of a degree will create variances in position when navigating a submarine. But the size and number of the discrepancies listed above are hardly explainable by anything but the most profound errors, which were very unlikely; suggesting instead that someone recorded a duel record in the same pages. The variance between the coordinate positions posted on 5 and 6 May and the direction and distance plotted are so extreme, if one does not believe U-234 actually sailed southeast – per the coordinates posted – but rather sailed according to the dead reckoning information, or vice versa – an entire day is lost. This is relevant given General Kessler’s trying to account for one. But there is nothing in the document to suggest a correction was made for a lost day. In our scenario of U-234 making a secret side trip, unaccounted for days are central to understanding what the U-boat may actually have been doing during this time. The only other answer for the ‘lost day’ would be if the U-boat came to a complete standstill for 24 hours, which runs counter to all accounts. But even if it had, why would Fehler have recorded U-234 was traveling in two directions at once? The prize crew of the USS Sutton prepares to raise the U.S. flag over U-234, with Lt.

Obviously, U-234 could not sail in two directions at once, as in-dicated in the conflicting dead reckoning entries versus the co-ordinates posted in the Bundesarchiv logbook. And U-234 did not stand still either – quite the opposite. A last, and also substantial, series of conflicts between the Bundesarchiv logbook and other sources occurs on 11 through 12May_(;) , which included the final 24-hour period recorded in the log – which ended on the 12^(th) , when Fehler first radioed his intent to surrender. The final coordinates entered in the logbook – 49º 20’ N, 31º 51 W – were for noon 12 May. This is perfectly aligned with the south south-westerly course plotted from 7 through 12 May, which adhered to an average bearing of 220^(∘) , or south southwest. Surprisingly, however, according to the logbook actual bearings on the 11^(th) and 12^(th) swung widely, from 180º, or straight south – a course reportedly pursued throughout most of 11 May – to a course change to 260º, almost due west, which turn occurred at 2 : 35 a.m . on the morning of the 12th . The distance covered during 7 through 10May , as calculated from the daily coordinates, was about 60 to 70 miles per day, again about the average. But on the 11^(th) , the coordinates showed a doubling of distance to about 120 miles. The total distance sailed entered in the logbook for 12 May is 201 statute miles, which, while a great increase in speed, given the drive south then dogleg west, calculates closely enough to match the 120 miles represented by a straight line from start coordinate to end point. At the outset these entries appear to be accurate, although, as noted, representing a great, and unexplained, increase in U-234’s speed as well as an unexplained an illogical course stretching south, followed by a turn west, to bearing 260º. A straight run south southwest would have been consistent with its reported previous path and much more efficient. There is no reason given within the explanations of the traditional history for the doubling of speed, nor for the huge dogleg other than a general desire not to be captured before getting the U-boat positioned for surrender to the United States, despite already transmitting surrender intentions.

[] Figure 3: U-234’s movements 12 May 1945, the day it signaled surrender intentions. The log coordinates (penciled line with small circles) falsely show it was on a course consistent with its planned route to Japan. Allied direction finders show it was steering a much more westerly course, however, at twice the speed reported. The χ^(′′) marks the false position Fehler reported during the 4:15 a.m. transmission. The falsified log and Fehler’s admittedly intentional false position report appear intended to hide U-234’s actual movements. Transcripts of radio transmissions from U-234 to Halifax show Canadian direction-finding locations of the submersible that record the actual locations of U-234 at the time it sent the messages. The direction finder in this case revealed locations that corroborated the U-boat was sailing toward 260^(∘) on the compass. The direction-finder also showed, however, that on the morning of 12 May U-234 was actually at a position 70 to 80 miles north, and more importantly, 150 miles east of the position calculated from the times and bearings recorded in the logbook. At 4:15 a.m. on 12May_(Ω) , the intercept’s direction-finder coordinates put the U-boat at 51^(∘)00^(′)N , 27^(∘) : 00^(′) W. The U-boat’s position as extrapolated from the logbook’s speeds and bearings, however, indicate it should have been at 49^(∘)20^(′) N , 31^(∘) 00^(′)W, give or take a few miles. Therefore, as noted, it was trailing about 150 miles east-northeast of the position recorded in the logbook. Fehler further complicated things – apparently with a plan in mind – by falsely transmitting during that same 4 : 15 a.m . radio message that U-234’s position was 50^(∘) 00^(′) N_(ℓ) , 30^(∘) 00^(′) W, significantly differing both from the direction-finder coordinates and from the calculations made from the logbook data. So we have three considerably different positions given for U-234 at 4:15 a.m. 12 May: One from the direction-finder of the intercepted transmission, one calculated from the Bundesarchiv logbook, and one that Fehler reported to Halifax. The direction-finder location is by far the most likely to be accurate, since it is the only objective source. Drawing a line on a map with one end touching the point marking the direction- finder coordinates for 4:15 that morning and the other end the point marking the logbook position posted for noon later that day, shows that Fehler’s radioed false position falls almost on the line between the two points and almost at its center.

In the 4 : 15 a.m . transmission he also gave his speed as 8 knots, but he was actually sailing 16 knots according to calculations made from the intercepted transmissions as well as Fehler’s own later admission.1 From U-234’s actual position as revealed by the direction-finder, at the 16-knot speed it was sailing, U-234 would make the position falsely recorded in the logbook just about noon – the time of the daily logbook posting. Doing so would bring it in conformance with the fabricated logbook scenario that suggested U-234, generally, was continuing on its southerly course. Thus Fehler would continue an illusion he had created that U-234 was sailing a conventional course to Japan on the Great Circle. Fehler was caught in the lie, however, when a Canadian plane discovered U-234 out of its reported position.2 To cover the deception, Fehler then entered the dogleg in the speeds-and-course portion of the logbook, making it look as though both the course steered and the coordinates posted were in accord. Thus the lie was tied up in a neat little bow. Why? Possibly because Fehler’s deceptive first transmission to Allied forces reported a false position not only calculated to camouflage his movements, but those coordinates would show U-234 proceeding on a course that passed exactly through the intersection of the boundaries of Allied naval control of the Atlantic Ocean. East of this point was the jurisdiction of the British and French, which he was trying to escape but had not, quite yet. West and north of it was the jurisdiction of Canada; and west and south of it was the jurisdiction of the United States. At 4:15 a.m. – probably the soonest Fehler felt with confidence he could reach the desired coordinates by noon – he falsely radioed the information to the Allies, implicitly reporting he was at that moment breaking into the American-controlled sector of the Atlantic. He would be expecting to capitulate to the United States and surrender his boat, passengers and deadly cargo, and then his mission would be over. Instead of the United States responding to Fehler’s surrender message, however, Canada’s Halifax station first hailed the U-boat and commanded it to sail for Nova Scotia. Canadian forces seem to have uncovered the fact, either by direction-finder or by air observation – Hirschfeld references that some time during the surrender phase an airplane located and circled the U-boat just prior to Canada signaling to Fehler that he was acting deceitfully3", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:224:14b967816c46", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5307, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 225, "text": "and deadly cargo, and then his mission would be over.

Canadian forces seem to have uncovered the fact, either by direction-finder or by air observation – Hirschfeld references that some time during the surrender phase an airplane located and circled the U-boat just prior to Canada signaling to Fehler that he was acting deceitfully3 – that Fehler was still in their territory. For Fehler, surrender to Canada, apparently, was unacceptable; demonstrated by the fact he began or continued a series of activities designed to avoid Canadian capture, which he later admitted to, and which Hirschfeld chronicled. From this point on, following only the logbook information, it becomes difficult to know exactly where U-234 was located at any given time. The direction-finder information on the 12^(th) offers the last dependable location. We know the coordinates listed in the logbook during this time were patently false so we can’t depend on them. And if one uses only the dead reckoning data in the logbook, the U-boat was already over 150 miles beyond where the direction-finder located it, and, according to Fehler’s and Hirschfeld’s later accounts, would travel at top speed another 200 to 300 miles in the following two days, placing it several hundred miles from the surrender point on the evening of the 14^(th) , the day it surrendered, unless it traveled a ridiculously convoluted path. But given Fehler’s and Hirschfeld’s report of traveling at near top speed throughout the night of the 12^(th) , and possibly the 13^(th). , and knowing the U-boat’s 12 May locations as provided by the direction-finders, as well as knowing the direction it was headed and its location at surrender, the only truly plausible answer for U-234’s location during this time was that it continued on a dead run westward, not southward as reported. Realizing general knowledge of his duplicitous maneuvers would reveal a hidden agenda and invalidate the decoy – though disturbingly disparate – logbook he had created, Fehler concluded he should leave no record at all henceforward. Thus Fehler discontinued his semi-fictional second logbook on 12 May. Beyond this point, he probably realized it would be more difficult to create a viable cover story for the convoluted logbook, than to explain his reasons for failing to complete the diary. He could easily say the war was over for his boat, passengers, and crew and so there was no need for further entries. At 9 : 45 p.m.12 May, Fehler again reported U-234’s position, 50^(∘)00^(′) N, 30^(∘)00^(′) W, the same position he claimed to hold at 4:15 that morning even though he also reported a speed of eight knots in both dispatches, inferring the U-boat was on the move the entire time.

The direction-finding coordinates for this second transmission, however, placed the U-boat at 50^(∘)00^(′)N , 34^(∘) : 00^(′) W. He had now moved from being well east of his reported position, as indicated in the morning transmission, to well west of that same position, now reported in the late evening. According to calculations from the morning and evening direction-finder coordinates, U-234 had traveled approximately 200 miles in 18 hours – or at least three times the average speed recorded in the logbook. The U-boat was running at over 16 miles-per-hour, as noted earlier, or at over 90 percent of its top surfaced speed. Captain Fehler admitted to making this mad dash over the Atlantic at “16 or 16%^(′′) knots on “the night of 12 or 13 May” in his letter to Sharkhunters already mentioned. Hirschfeld confirmed, as well, that Fehler had ordered him to report false speeds and directions to Halifax, 4 which the direction finder data verifies. Thus, once again, the Bundesarchiv logbook and Fehler’s uncoded transmissions are proven to be lies. It seems certain, therefore, the dubiously-marked Bundesarchiv logbook now can be accepted virtually as a ruse to cover covert activities. Fehler had an explanation for these mysterious machinations, though. In his letter to Sharkhunters, which is a response to Sharkhunters President Harry Cooper’s own suspicions about the activities of U-234, the Captain described how he met with his officers and German passengers after hearing about the Reich’s capitulation on 8 May to discuss what he should do about surrendering. While many opinions were openly voiced in this meeting, according to radio chief Wolfgang Hirschfeld, Fehler never divulged his own opinions or intentions.5 General Kessler independently confirmed this in a post-war interrogation.6 But Fehler later reported in the Sharkhunters letter that he and General Kessler had decided prior to leaving Norway that if capitulation was necessary he would not surrender to British forces, allegedly because the food, conditions and treatment of POWs would not be as good as in the United States. As a result, according to the letter, Fehler had determined to get out of the British quadrant of the Atlantic and so was racing toward the setting western sun in the direction of America. Nothing in any review of General Kessler’s statements and interrogations, however, supports this claim. Quite the opposite.

Besides never mentioning such a meeting with Fehler, Kessler consistently held to his opinion and his version of events that he felt the U-boat should continue its voyage to Japan or sail to Argentina. Fehler’s explanation of U-234’s desperate dash does not hold up under close scrutiny, either. He asserted in his Sharkhunters letter that on the night of 12 or 13 May, when Tomonaga and Shoji, the Japanese officers on board, heard the high revolutions of the propeller shafts, that they deduced Fehler had decided to surrender the U-boat.7 According to Fehler, rather than be captured alive, which would be disgraceful for the two Samurais, the Emperor’s officers committed suicide by each taking an overdose of Luminal, a sleeping drug. They were left to this substitute for hara kari because Fehler had confiscated all of the passengers’ weapons when they boarded the U-boat in Kiel. Tomonaga’s ceremonial samurai sword had, in fact, been turned over to the Captain by Ambassador Oshima at the departure ceremony.8 Fehler stated in the letter he sent to Cooper that he planned, had the Japanese not taken their lives, to drop the officers either on the Spanish or Portuguese coast or on the Canary Islands. The discrepancies in this prevarication are obvious and two fold. First, the radio intercepts of 12 May are in plain text, they are not coded messages, indicating Fehler’s intent with the messages was to open communications with the Allies – albeit either very cautiously or with a hidden agenda in mind, as indicated by his false coordinates. Regardless of his agenda, with the German capitulation having already occurred, Fehler knew better than to think he could open communications with the Allies and then just sail about the sea wherever he pleased. He knew the Allies would demand a swift capitulation of U-234, which they did. And second, Fehler freely admitted that at the time the Japanese poisoned themselves, U-234 was headed west at high speed, and direction finder data shows it had been doing so for about 200 miles – supposedly since 2:35 the morning of the 12^(th) according to the logbook, but certainly since 4 : 15 a.m . that day. He added that his reason for this run was to escape the area of British control. But the three locations Fehler claimed he planned to drop off the Japanese – Spain, Portugal or the Canary Islands – were in very different directions than the one he was racing toward, and they all required crossing vast expanses of Allied jurisdiction.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:227:9611ea32f621", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5310, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 228, "text": "since 2:35 the morning of the 12^(th) according to the logbook, but certainly since 4 : 15 a.m . that day.

The fact he was racing west at the time the boat’s doctor told him the Japanese had taken the poison contradicts his explanation of intending to take them to the Iberian Peninsula or the Canaries, again revealing he had no intention of taking Tomonaga and Shoji to safe haven. The evidence shows Fehler was bent on surrendering to the United States regardless of the consequences – to Tomonaga and Shoji or to anyone or anything else. In fact, according to his own account, upon hearing the Japanese had taken the poison, Fehler even refused to stop his U-boat to submerge below what he claimed was stormy surface weather long enough for U-234’s doctor to recuperate from an alleged case of seasickness so he could treat the poisoned men. In fact, on the contrary, the doctor was healthy enough according to Hirschfeld, that Fehler ordered him to oversee the Japanese’s deaths. “Tonight we must get the Japanese overboard,” Fehler explained to Walter. “If the Americans get to them, they’ll do everything they can to bring them round. See to it that they die peacefully,”11 he ordered the doctor. Granted, Fehler may have been trying to fulfill Tomonaga’s and Shoji’s last wish to die in peace and with honor. But why would he tell a series of lies in his letter written forty years later, in justification for not reviving them, rather than tell the simple, honorable truth? The evidence suggests that whatever Fehler’s hidden purpose, its end would be better served if Tomonaga and Shoji were dead. Fehler later asserted, again in his letter to Sharkhunters, that following his talks with General Kessler before leaving Kiel, and after at least two discussions with his officers and non-Japanese passengers while on the high seas – including Kessler again – that he had decided to surrender to the United States. This he said he did with Kessler’s support. But Hirschfeld wrote that in the surrender discussions at sea, Kessler was in favor of completing the mission to Japan or of heading for Argentina, as were most of the other officers in U-234; a few of whom favored returning to Germany. 12 But Fehler never tipped his hand to reveal what he would do. Kessler unknowingly corroborated Hirschfeld’s claim in a post-war interrogation, also stating Fehler never expressed an opinion about where to surrender.13 Argentina as a surrender option was a covert ally of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:228:731083bed4ac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5311, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 229, "text": "the surrender discussions at sea, Kessler was in favor of completing the mission to Japan or of heading for Argentina, as were most of the other officers in U-234; a few of whom favored returning to Germany. 12 But Fehler never tipped his hand to reveal what he would do. Kessler unknowingly corroborated Hirschfeld’s claim in a post-war interrogation, also stating Fehler never expressed an opinion about where to surrender.13 Argentina as a surrender option was a covert ally of Germany’s and surrender there allowed the expectation among the passengers and crew of U-234 that they would have a short, uncomplicated stay in South America before a quick return home to family and friends – and rebuilding lives in Germany. A few dissenters, however, preferred to land on some South Sea island paradise instead of ending their journey in Argentina. Hirschfeld reported that only Party Judge Kay Nieschling and the boat’s doctor, Dr. Walter, voiced their support for surrendering to the United States. Importantly, as noted, and despite Fehler’s later claims, neither Fehler nor Kessler were in that small group. Thus we have yet another conflict in the record – one of several that crop up between Fehler and Hirschfeld: Was Kessler in favor of surrendering to the United States or not? Again we must try to determine who is telling the truth. Given Fehler’s obvious prevarications regarding his intentions toward Tomonaga and Shoji, and his intentional misrepresentations in the Bundesarchiv logbook, as well as the admitted deceptions in his transmissions to Halifax compared against Hirschfeld’s consistently provable and accurate accounts, Hirschfeld’s version is undoubtedly most correct. Thus Kessler’s preference to go to Japan or Argentina is more probable than Fehler’s later assertion that Kessler had agreed to surrender to the United States, especially considering Kessler said so under interrogation. Fehler’s uncoded radio transmission of 12 May, intended to open the way to surrender, compared against his immediate refusal to surrender to Canadian or British forces, clearly leaves only the United States as Fehler’s intended surrender objective. He later tried to support this objective by cunningly suggesting Kessler agreed to it before leaving Kiel. Hirschfeld’s writings and Kessler’s statement that Fehler never actually revealed his intentions to any of his passengers or crew about where he would surrender, in view of the fact almost all of the passengers and officers desired a course other than surrender to the United States, further supports the premise of this hidden agenda.14 The evidence suggests Captain Fehler stubbornly continued to quietly manipulate events until U-234 was “captured” by the USS Sutton. As has been shown, Captain Fehler had demonstrated by both word and action he was bent on surrendering U-234 to the United States.

His determination to do so even before the U-boat left Germany – his alleged, though now dubious, discussions with Kessler while still in Kiel to achieve this end, if true – indicates he already may have been laying the groundwork even then. Or perhaps he was simply maintaining the illusion some forty years later when he wrote this account in the Sharkhunters letter. At any rate, his mad dash across the Atlantic, carefully manipulated to reach American controlled waters at a critical point in time, drives home his determination to surrender only to the United States. So does his silent decision to land there against the desires of a large majority of his officers and high-ranking passengers. Fehler’s intentional deceptions to Halifax combined with his determination to sacrifice his Japanese passengers rather than off-load them in Spain, Portugal or the Canary Islands – or to even make an effort to save their lives at all – all testify of a personal commitment on Fehler’s part to surrender only to the United States. This fixation seems far out of keeping with a reasonable assessment of the situation he was in. Even more shocking – and revealing – is the fact the United States Navy aided and abetted Fehler in his efforts to surrender to it. Hirschfeld recorded that while Fehler was in contact with Halifax, sending deliberately false reports about his position and movements, U-234’s radio communications suddenly were jammed by very powerful transmissions.15 Apparently somebody did not want U-234 in communication with Halifax. Each time Hirschfeld tried to transmit to the Canadian station, regardless of which frequency he used, the jamming would begin anew, which suited Fehler just fine;16 the overrunning of his radio communications kept the Captain from having to continue his deceptions to Halifax. Soon, the USS Sutton could be seen cresting the horizon. The Sutton reached U-234 shortly before dark. Using Morse Code from a lamp, rather than radio signals even though the war had been over for a week, the destroyer ordered U-234 to “head for the Gulf of Maine and to ignore all further communications from Halifax [italics the author’s].17 From this Hirschfeld deduced the Sutton had done the radio jamming. But few if any United States Navy destroyers had jamming capabilities,18 so probably the jamming was done from a land-based station that was monitoring events and supporting the Sutton’s mission. Soon the Sutton slipped alongside the U-boat just a few hundred yards to port, but waited until morning to send a boarding party.

Soon the Sutton slipped alongside the U-boat just a few hundred yards to port, but waited until morning to send a boarding party. In the meantime, Hirschfeld witnessed Dr. Heinz Schlicke throw several small tubes of microfilm overboard from the conning tower into the ocean.19 “There goes the rocket that could fly the Atlantic,” remarked Schlicke. In the morning, a heavily-armed prize crew from the Sutton crossed the distance between the two vessels in a small craft and boarded U-234. 20 Nerves were on edge as the outnumbered but well-armed Sutton contingent chained the hatch open to ensure Captain Fehler did not try a last-minute dive. Documents were given to Fehler instructing him in the procedures for surrendering his boat and crew; then a skeleton crew of German sailors was left on board to operate the vessel while the remaining passengers and crew were ferried from U-234 to the Sutton. Hirschfeld, one of the few German crewmen left onboard the U-boat, noted U-234 was ordered to make for the Gulf of Maine. Later, this order was changed to direct U-234 to head for the Naval Yard at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.21 Once again Hirschfeld’s near-impeccable account is verified, this time by the Sutton’s activity report,22 which recounted how the order was changed for the Sutton to escort U-234 to Portsmouth instead of the previous order that it report with the U-boat to Cascoe Bay, Maine. The Sutton, for its part, before locating U-234, had been working alongside two Canadian ships that were also trying to find the U-boat. According to excerpts prepared from the Sutton’s war diary23 – the diary itself, perhaps significantly, apparently is not available – during the operation the Sutton had broken away from the Canadian vessels. The Sutton headed south on a trajectory that allowed it to intercept the U-boat based on direction finder coordinates the destroyer had received. The Sutton’s war diary notes that the Canadian ships apparently realized they had “missed their target,” but continued to head off in an east-northeasterly direction. Nothing is said in the war diary excerpts of the Sutton’s having jammed the U-boat’s radio transmissions or of ordering U-234 not to respond to Canadian radio communications. The first step is to determine which evidence is sound and which is not; an objective we have undertaken throughout this and other chapters. Of the five sources of information about U-234’s movements – the direction-finding coordinates, the Bundesarchiv logbook, the accounts recorded in Hirschfeld’s two books, Fehler’s letters to Sharkhunters, and Fehler’s position reports to Halifax – the direction finding coordinates are by far the most objective and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:231:17596268754a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5314, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 232, "text": "or of ordering U-234 not to respond to Canadian radio communications.

This evidence and a great body of other known facts appear to strongly favor, if not outright prove, large portions of the Bundesarchiv logbook are fabrications. And they appear to be so at least from the first mismatched coordinates copied by Kessler on 30 April, if not earlier. They extend through the three series of unaligned bearings and speeds versus coordinates recorded from 1 to 6 May, when U-234 allegedly sailed six full days without surfacing, and continue through the outright lies recorded by Fehler from then through 12 May. Possibly the logbook was counterfeited after the fact, but it appears to have been “jointly” kept – the fake version and the real version laid down on the same paper. The daily coordinates would have been written to show the fictitious course it was desired the world believe, Fehler assuming analysts later would choose the easier process of just plotting on a map the coordinates posted to discover U-234’s “route.” The alternative the future analysts would have to choose from, dead-reckoning, required calculating the combinations of speeds and directions to work out the journey, a much more tedious and time-consuming process. Fehler knew the odds were high investigators would ignore the math and just lay down lines from coordinate point to coordinate point on a map to see where the boat “had been.” Especially since they would already have his chart for this cruise, which would also have been falsified, and the coordinates would match what he had entered on the chart. The single point of contention between Hirschfeld’s account and the theory posited in this text lies in the fact, despite referencing the mysterious message from Hitler’s Berlin Bunker, Hirschfeld never mentioned any activity while U-234 was at sea that can be construed as picking up and/or delivering a secret passenger. He detailed activities that occurred on the boat throughout the relevant timeframe, however, and once stated that U-234 “continued to head south at full speed” during a time when, according to the secret detour scenario, it must have been heading west. If this event happened just a day or so earlier, however, it may be a clue as to what the U-boat was really doing.

Remember, while Hirschfeld’s accounts in all other aspects have been consistently accurate his one weakness has been his recollections of dates. It seems implausible Fehler could have secretly picked up a mystery passenger without his chief communications officer knowing about it. Certainly Hirschfeld, as were all others involved in the maiden voyage of U-234 who would have known its secrets, was sworn to silence if it had, indeed, carried an important enigmatic passenger to safety in the final days of the war. United States government before freeing the prisoners, as well. Perhaps Hirschfeld’s writing that the boat was racing south is a small lapse conceding to the weighty burden of carrying such a secret for so long a time. Uncharacteristic as it may seem, his statement that the U-boat was racing southward appears to be one small detail – but a detail that can be correct if the date is wrong – that would stay what is otherwise significant evidence favoring the theory that U-234 made a detour to pick up a mysterious passenger who made his escape on board the U-boat. While fundamentally reliable, it must be remembered Hirschfeld protected whoever Bubbi was. And although in his memoirs he described Schlicke as an expert on radar, direction finding and high frequency transmissions,24 he later recounted how Schlicke tossed the microfilm containing plans for the “rocket that could fly the Atlantic” overboard,25 suggesting Hirschfeld knew Schlicke was more than Hirschfeld originally let on, also. So protecting certain aspects of the secret mission of U-234 was not wholly beyond the capacity of Wolfgang Hirschfeld. Taking everything we know about U-234 into account – the messages to it from the Fuehrer Bunker; the wrestling for command of the U-boat; the profoundly slow reported travel speed throughout most of the journey; the mysteriously truncated Library of Congress logbook and secret visit to Bergen; the carelessly doctored Bundesarchiv logbook; the coincident timing as recorded in the Bundesarchiv log of Fehler’s alleged but illogical decision to run submerged during the six critical days between 30 April and 6 May compared with the reported escape of Martin Bormann during that same time period; considering the little-known but seemingly reliable series of reports that Bormann escaped in a U-boat; Bormann’s connections and control of U-234’s cargo, and probably, although covertly, his control of Doenitz himself; as well as U-234’s mysterious dash westward apparently from points unknown east of its professed position before surrender; and Fehler’s determination at all costs to capitulate to none but the United States – considering all this, it seems probable U-234 was the “large", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:233:9d3fbfec9219", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5316, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "CMIPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Mass-Germany-Surrendered-Enriched/dp/1634241177", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "CMIPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 234, "text": "Bormann during that same time period; considering the little-known but seemingly reliable series of reports that Bormann escaped in a U-boat; Bormann’s connections and control of U-234’s cargo, and probably, although covertly, his control of Doenitz himself; as well as U-234’s mysterious dash westward apparently from points unknown east of its professed position before surrender; and Fehler’s determination at all costs to capitulate to none but the United States – considering all this, it seems probable U-234 was the “large U-boat” reported by Soviet intelligence that had the secret mission of rescuing Martin Bormann from Germany, delivering him safely to Spain, and delivering the cargo to the United States in exchange for Bormann’s freedom. Keeping in mind both the above and the following are conclusions based upon the best evidence as detailed, the most probable scenario that can be reconstructed appears to look something like this: With a struggle over chain-of-command of U-234 raging between Doenitz and Berlin, and having already received communications from Hitler’s bunker to stay put, Fehler departed Kristiansand according to Doenitz’s order, but at very slow speed in order to remain close at hand when the time came to respond to an expected dispatch to pick up a powerful passenger from Berlin. Apparently, the chain-of-command issue was still being contested on 18 April, when Fehler secretly altered course to Bergen to check for further communications via BdU North Commander Rosing and the U-boat communication center there. Realizing upon his decision to detour to Bergen that his logbook later would reveal his surreptitious movements and potentially expose his secret mission, he abruptly discontinued keeping this log from the 18^(th) forward. Fehler would later begin a new log designed to camouflage U-234’s movements. At Bergen Fehler apparently did not receive the communication from Rosing he anticipated so he continued his slow crawl across the North Sea. He proceeded extremely slowly – no faster than a man walks, just fast enough to maintain steerage of the U-boat – so he would be close at hand when U-234 was needed for the secret pick-up of his mysterious passenger. In the early morning hours of 30 April, at about the same time Martin Bormann was escaping Berlin by light aircraft, U-234 began a quick sixday cruise back to Germany and out to sea again under cover of a reported six-day submerged voyage in the Atlantic. The falsified “submerged voyage” would in effect make U-234 “disappear” during the deceptive detour. Thus a cover story was provided should she be seen in a location she should not have been, or should another vessel fail to spot her in a location she should have been in.

No record has been found to date of U-234 receiving a message to return to Germany to pick up its passenger, but the author believes such a message was sent and received. The author suggests it was at this point Fehler turned his U-boat east, submerged during the day and surfaced at night, and at high speed headed back into the heavily patrolled North Sea through the strait between Scotland and the Shetland Islands. He then turned south – straight for Hamburg. U-234 made Hamburg in under three days, sailing at top snorkeling speed when submerged (this is where Hirschfeld may have been right about U-234 sailing south at high speed, after all – but in the North Sea, not the Atlantic). She would have sailed with intermittent radar checks from her cutting-edge, single-pulse radar, and probably with covert support and protection from well-placed Western Allied sources – remember the planes that did not attack in the Kattegat. Quickly picking up Bormann, the large U-boat described by Stalin’s intelligence reports then made way, again under surreptitious Western Allied protection, through the English Channel and into the Bay of Biscay, where it rendezvoused with an unknown craft to offload Martin Bormann for his stay in Spain. Racing west and needing to maintain a cover story that would stand as the official history of the vessel, Fehler realized he was running out of time to surrender following the German capitulation order on 8 May. He needed to be in a credible location along his previously planned journey before surrendering, in order to keep his cover story intact, or else his wayward movements might be revealed. In fact, and more important, he also needed to ensure he was in the American sector of enemy surrender, to guarantee his cargo would be received by the pre-agreed upon country, the United States – and its Manhattan Project. By 12 May, he felt he could report falsely a position in the American Zone that he could reach before it was discovered to be false, and so he duly reported that position by radio. But calamity nearly ensued when Canada, through Halifax, received U-234’s first surrender transmission and ordered Fehler’s capitulation before the United States responded. To maintain his cover and avoid surrendering cargo and passengers to an unintended party, Fehler was forced to report inaccurate bearings and speeds – and for a period of time not report at all – until the USS Sutton was able to decoy Canadian ships away and jam U-234’s transmissions.

Wolff, Dulles and Gaevernitz appear to have made a secret deal outside of the “unconditional surrender” agreement. Wolff previously had overseen the construction of a vast processing plant that had every earmark of being a uranium enrichment facility. here is no hard, documentary, conclusive evidence the secret escape mission of U-234 described in the chapters above rescued Martin Bormann. There is no “smoking gun” or proof beyond reasonable doubt. In fact, it may not have happened. But if the United States was in collusion behind the scenes dealing with the Nazis to obtain the cargo of U-234 in exchange for Bormann’s freedom and protection, every effort would have been made to make it look like it did not occur. A revelation of Bormann in American hands and under United States protection would have made an extremely negative impact on American moral authority and its treaty obligations worldwide. Whether even a paper trail of such dealings would have been left at all is highly questionable. The rarefied powers that oversaw such negotiations would surely be careful not to leave telltale signs in this most singular of diplomatic dealings. On the contrary, they would be certain to leave as few tracks as possible, and to cover or make ambiguous any tracks that may have been left behind. The most proof we can hope for in this vacuum, therefore, is circumstantial evidence – anomalies and telltale signs of some unexplained event.

If history is an objective science, Occam’s Razor should apply. Surprisingly – or maybe not so surprisingly – it is not often applied in the traditional history at all. Despite the lack of irrefutable proof regarding his fate, the quantity and quality of circumstantial evidence suggesting Bormann successfully escaped far exceeds that in evidence of his death. This evidence includes Hitler’s order that Bormann be flown out of Berlin, which matches Soviet intelligence reports that he was, in fact, flown out within 24 hours of that order. In turn, the report of this escape flight aligns remarkably well with many details of a singularly unique, but true, actual escape flight that was documented separately from the Soviet account and separate of those who revealed Hitler’s order for Bormann’s escape flight. There is the report the second stage of Bormann’s escape was made in a large U-boat, which meshes well with the details of the mammoth U-234 having received radio messages that were interpreted by General Kessler to mean a senior official from Hitler’s bunker was on his way to U-234. The convoluted record of the U-boat’s travels and the excess of effort expended to hide those actions add veracity to this report. And there is the evidence suggesting Captain Fehler was determined to surrender his important passengers and cargo to the United States – even at the cost of the lives of the Japanese officers onboard – rather than complete his important mission to Japan, surrender elsewhere or return to Germany. Conversely, the United States appears in advance to have known about and been determined to obtain the U-boat and its cargo. On at least one occasion, and possibly others, Allied warplanes easily could have sunk U-234 but did not, apparently opting just to monitor the U-boat’s movements. In the end, the United States jammed U-234’s radio transmissions to Halifax, thus ensuring the U-boat would fall into American hands, not Canadian. Combined, the primarily objective, disparate facts recounted in this volume, and all the detailed evidence supporting them, create a scenario for Bormann’s escape far more likely to have occurred than the traditional history recounting his death. There is no solid evidence for Bormann’s death, and what evidence there is is composed almost entirely of the suspect, often irrational, eyewitness accounts of Nazi sympathizers and Hitler henchmen. The witnesses for the traditional history all potentially had reasons for ensuring Bormann was presumed dead, as do many others who would like the world to come to the same conclusion.

The witnesses for the traditional history all potentially had reasons for ensuring Bormann was presumed dead, as do many others who would like the world to come to the same conclusion. The traditional history leaves many crucial events unexplained, while the theory advanced within these pages resolves almost all – and certainly all of the critical – previously ignored anomalies and mysteries surrounding the events. Even the only supposedly “hard evidence” for Bormann’s death, the DNA-tested skull, is fraught with inconsistencies ranging from whether the body was actually buried where the one tested was dug up, to the provenance of the skull itself – a provenance that surely could not pass chain-of-evidence muster in a legitimate court of law. By applying Occam’s Razor to the evidence, far more of the anomalies and mysteries are explained with the new scenario than by the old, disjointed account. So one must suggest it is time the traditional history give way to the new, more congruent one; or that at least a serious, deeper study be completed that includes careful review of all of the newly revealed information. To believe a great portion of the actions outlined in this book actually occurred, one must believe the United States government, in some form and at some high level, was in league with Martin Bormann and those involved in his escape. These government entities would probably have assisted in the escape by ensuring safe passage for the U-boat by “pulling strings” where necessary, as demonstrated in the “non-attack” of the warplanes overflying U-234 in the Kattegat, and possibly by allowing U-234 to sail unimpeded to Hamburg and back to the Atlantic through the English Channel. Certainly, jamming U-234’s radio transmissions to break contact between Halifax and the U-boat – and then signaling Fehler by lamp not to respond to Halifax’s transmissions – appears to be direct intervention on behalf of the United States government to exclude its ally, Canada, from receiving the U-boat’s surrender under its rightful jurisdiction. And to believe the United States took part in such events is to admit it also maintained a clandestine relationship of some nature with Martin Bormann after the war, protecting him from a distance. Such an affiliation with the second-ranking kingpin of the Nazi Empire would be anathema to the American people and also to the majority of Europeans who suffered under his Nazi Party regime. Most especially, the Russians would be enraged.

Most especially, the Russians would be enraged. If a connection between the United States and Martin Bormann became known, Joseph Stalin immediately would have suspected treachery by his ally the United States – which, in fact, he did. In September 1945, Stalin broadcasted the assertion that Bormann was in Allied hands.3 If his accusations were genuine, Stalin would have wondered what Bormann had given to receive such rarefied assistance, rather than be incarcerated and tried at Nuremberg with the rest of his cronies. Whatever the ransom, to get the treatment from the United States Bormann wanted it must have been of utmost importance to the geo-political equation, and would have been in direct violation of the Allies’ unconditional surrender treaty requirement. The participating American leaders knew this, therefore evidence suggesting a relationship between Bormann and the United States would need to be carefully avoided, if possible, or destroyed or buried deep, if not. During my research in the National Archives, I tried to locate all of the documentation about Bormann that I could find within State Department and, specifically, Office of Strategic Services files. I located several second-party reports notifying these agencies of sightings and meetings with Bormann, suggesting the survival and whereabouts of a very alive Martin Bormann following the war. I also located a key report that identified all of the top Nazi fugitives still unaccounted for immediately after the war, in Record Group 457 file 190-37-11-1 box 192. The report does not list Martin Bormann or Heinrich Mueller as still missing, even though at that point in time, according to the traditional history, their whereabouts were unknown.4 Apparently the OSS knew where they were, while everyone else involved was searching high and low for them. Many of these reports are substantive5 and were provided by sources the agencies labeled as reliable, such as a State Department report I found that indicated Bormann was living in Spain with a certain Leon DeGrelle, and was running a Nazi escape operation from there.6 This documentation is impressive. In addition, many other authors, including Manning and Farago, have revealed compelling governmental documentary evidence of Bormann’s survival. But while researching the evidence, the same index that led me to these documents also contained cards referencing mysterious other files about Bormann within Record Groups 226 and 190.7 Instead of being reports about sightings, the index descriptions seemed to suggest the documents were agency records regarding personal information about Martin Bormann.

His headquarters in Pullach is referenced in Record Group 226 file number 123900; and, most stunning, in When I searched for these records the index referenced, however, they were not in their files. There were no placeholder cards substituted for the missing documents telling researchers the records were checked out to someone else. There were no slip-sheets indicating the files were still classified and therefore not available. There was nothing: Just missing numbers in the sequence of the files. As mentioned in a previous chapter, I have spent many hours researching in the National Archives I and II, the Library of Congress and the Southeast Regional Archives in Atlanta, Georgia. During these research sessions I have reviewed thousands – probably tens of thousands – of documents that at the time of their origins were highly classified. These included presidential records, extensive Manhattan Project Records, captured German records, war crimes trials records and the records of U-234 and her captured passengers and crewmembers, as well as records from other U-boats and the State Department and OSS. Only twice in ten years of research did I come across documents missing from their files with absolutely no explanation. Such an omission is almost unheard of in the well-protected archives, which has a stringent procedure for the handling of documents to ensure they are not lost or damaged. In every other instance I encountered, when a document was not in the file as it should have been, a card was left in its place explaining the document was at that time checked out to an archivist. Or a sheet of paper was in the file stating the document was still classified due to its importance to national security and therefore was not available for review. The only exceptions I have found are these three missing documents about Martin Bormann and the absent “Reactor Shipments” documents mentioned in Chapter Seven – all potentially crucial documents that may substantially rebut the traditional history. Certainly these documents are not required for national security seventy years after the events. Even if they were, there should have been an information card signifying this distinction. When I described the missing Bormann files situation to an archivist, I was at first greeted with mild disbelief. When he had looked through the file boxes and not found the files, however, he shook his head and exclaimed someone had either refiled them incorrectly or the State Department had removed them.

When he had looked through the file boxes and not found the files, however, he shook his head and exclaimed someone had either refiled them incorrectly or the State Department had removed them. He offered no further explanation. Thinking they may have been incorrectly filed, I carefully searched every folder in each of the deficient boxes, but could not find the missing documents. One of the hard and fast rules in the archives is that a researcher may have only one box on a research table at a time, and all other boxes must remain closed and on the cart provided for the transport of the document boxes. The box on the table is the only one allowed open at any time and only one document is allowed out of the box at a time. All documents must be returned to that box and the box returned to its cart before another box may be removed from the cart to the table and opened. Boxes are not allowed opened at all while on the cart. This system is designed to ensure documents are not incorrectly filed or lost. That three files from various boxes, and even from different record groups, all concerning the same subject – Martin Bormann – were accidentally misplaced, while the records of virtually every other subject I queried within the archives seem to be immaculately kept, therefore, seems highly improbable. The more likely event is the State Department or OSS – or its successor the CIA – which, like all contributing agencies maintain control of their documents while in the archives, intentionally removed the missing files about Martin Bormann. Why would the State Department or OSS/CIA remove the files without explanation? The reason seems obvious: there was information in the files the agency did not want revealed; quite possibly information proving Bormann was alive and the OSS, CIA or State Department had helped with his escape and freedom. Any conceivable information about Bormann different than this should not require unexplained removal from the files at this time in history. If the documents were sensitive to national security, certainly those who removed the files would have used the national security dispensation to cover the otherwise unexplained missing documents, rather than allow them to be conspicuous by their absence. The documents’ unexplained disappearance certainly seems to indicate somebody is stonewalling.

Besides the evidence provided in these chapters, this evidence is supported by a plethora of reliable reports of Bormann’s being alive and well following the war, advanced by a broad variety of observers, many of whom had nothing to gain from such revelations. I have personally reviewed many such reports – possibly as many as fifty. While some reports are fraudulent or specious at best, many others, when carefully scrutinized, continue to withstand the tests of time and concerted efforts to debunk them. Some are so sound in their details and the integrity of their sources as to seem unimpeachable – although many people have tried to prove them wrong – such as the extensive account given by Dr. Otto Biss, who provided medical services to Bormann in 1959.8 The only substantive evidence Bormann did not survive Berlin is the reported positive DNA identification of the remains unearthed at the Lehrter Fairgrounds Station. As has been noted previously, these findings must be viewed with skepticism since, according CIA investigating agent James McGovern, the body supposedly tested and positively identified was no longer buried at the location where the remains were disinterred. And by May 1998, when the testing was done, Martin Bormann almost certainly had finally died and the remains tested may, in fact, have been his – proving nothing except they may have been substituted for those of the person exhumed at Lehrter Station. The last possibility is the remains tested may have been a relative of Bormann’s who was recruited as his double, in the same fashion Hitler’s double was a distant cousin of the Fuehrer’s. Depending upon the level of testing, DNA tests would possibly be a close enough match to mistakenly identify Bormann instead of his missing relative. Ultimately, the provenance of the remains compared against these possibilities makes the DNA tests far from conclusive.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:CMIPG_cleaned.txt:243:3447a3cce394", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5326, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Crypto0003PRINTs_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Cryptoscatology-Conspiracy-Theory-Art-Form/dp/1936296403", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Crypto0003PRINTs_cleaned", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "There are a lot of stories in this volume. I consider myself to be primarily a storyteller. That doesn’t mean these articles are fictional. Nor are they jokes disguised as truth. Oliver Stone once described his film JFK as “an alternative myth.” Historians might consider that to be waffling; I, on the other hand, find it to be the most accurate description possible, particularly in a world full of “specialists” who insist they alone know for certain where truth ends and fiction begins. The late literary scholar Joseph Campbell considered myths to be more accurate than truth. In a world where the Blue Meanies in charge can be relied upon to lie to your face every single day without even blinking, people better start praying for a lot more myths and a lot fewer lies. Fear and laughter, by themselves, never motivated anybody to take positive action in the world, but both can be motivating factors toward a sudden behavioral change in almost anyone. Every paradigm shift comes with a little fear and a fair amount of nervous laughter. H.P. Lovecraft, the famous horror writer, once wrote, “The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown” (12). Robert Anton Wilson, a writer who was no stranger to conspiracy theories, once wrote these words about an ephemeral realm known in occult initiations as “Chapel Perilous”: In traditional occult metaphor… Chapel Perilous [is] a weird place to be. Like the mysterious entity called “I,” Chapel Perilous cannot be located in space-time; it is weightless, odorless, tasteless and undetectable by ordinary instruments. Even more like the Ego, it is possible to deny that Chapel Perilous is really there. And yet, once you are inside it, there doesn’t seem to be any way to ever get out again, until you suddenly discover that it has been brought into existence by thought and does not exist outside thought. Everything you fear is waiting for you in Chapel Perilous, but if you are armed with the wand of intuition, the cup of sympathy, the sword of reason and pentacle of valor, you will come through it all safely. That’s what the legends say, and the language of myth is poetically precise. For instance, if you go into that realm without the sword of reason, you will lose your mind, but if you take only the sword of reason without the cup of sympathy you will lose your heart. Even more remarkably, if you approach without the wand of intuition, you can stand at the door for decades never realizing you have arrived.

Chapel Perilous is tricky that way. (10-11) Fear and laughter are tricky as well. They’re two sides of the same coin, of course, but it turns out the coin I’m referring to has more than two sides, perhaps an infinite amount. You can see them if you squint your eyes, tilt your head to one side, and look just so. To pass through Chapel Perilous safely the initiate has to see beyond the two surfaces of the coin to another world where both fear and laughter dissolve and meld together and transform into illumination and, ultimately,—if he’s kept his head—active participation in our everyday world. I give you a pocketful of myths. They’re researched and footnoted and delivered with a tone of authority on the part of the narrator. The author researched this book for fourteen years. Trust me, lies don’t take that long to construct. Lies are easy. These myths tell the truth, or the truth as I see it. When Alice fell through the mirror, she left the world of experts and knowable facts behind and plunged into a topsy-turvy world fraught with bizarre paradoxes. I offer you the chance to do the same. On April 8, 2010, Reuters released the results of a poll inwhich 23,000 adults in twenty-two different countries of those polled were under the age of thirty-five, and ranged across all income classes. The results were as follows: 20% of those polled said that they believe extraterrestrials are currently walking among us disguised as human beings. It’s interesting to note that most of those who believed in this extraterrestrial infiltration theory lived in major urban centers; those who lived in small towns, where everyone tends to know each other, were far less likely to believe the theory. What can we conclude from these findings? Does this poll say something profound about the alienation of the typical urban dweller in the twenty-first century? Has decades of cowering in fear behind locked doors while suckling the glass teat of television led to these rampant, paranoid delusions? Yes, of course, it could mean that.

In fact, paranoia runs rampant through the literary touchstones of my own personal pantheon: the multiple anarchist conspirators uncovered by Gabriel Syme, secret agent and poet, the protagonist of G.K. Chesterton’s surreal detective novel The Man Who Was Thursday: A Nightmare (1908); the Gnostic mythologies hidden within even more esoteric mythologies in James Branch Cabell’s beautifully complicated and highly controversial satires, The Cream of the Jest (1917) and Jurgen (1919); Charles Fort’s groundbreaking non-fiction reportage of overlooked paranormal data in The Book of the Damned (1919); the endlessly labyrinthine novel-length narratives of Franz Kafka in the 1920s; the racialist, degenerate nightmares of H.P. Lovecraft in the 1930s; the jocular metaphysics of Flann O’Brien in his posthumously published 1940s divine comedy The Third Policeman; the hardboiled cries from hell that emerged from Jim Thompson’s typewriter in the early 1950s; the experimental routines of early William S. Burroughs from the late 1950s; the 1960s science fiction psychedelia of Philip K. Dick; the absurd paeans to insanity in the form of Thomas Pynchon’s 1970s epyllion The Crying of Lot 49 and his Great American Novel Gravity’s Rainbow; the revisionist histories found in Steve Erickson’s Tours of the Black Clock and Arc d’X published in the late 1980s and early 1990s; the alternate universes woven into our own world within the unjustly obscure pages of Jack Womack’s New York novels such as Random Acts of Senseless Violence (1995) and Going, Going, Gone (2000). I could go on and on, of course, but there’s no need. I trust you can come up with even better examples of your own. However, I’m not referring to the mere theme of paranoia found within fictional narratives. I’m saying that the state of paranoia itself is a new art form, and people—either consciously or unconsciously—are well aware of this and use paranoia as a plaything, a palliative to help guide them through the intricacies of this post-post-modern world. The dilemma that human beings must face in the twenty-first century is not that they’re alienated or ignorant, but that they’re not alienated or ignorant enough.

Therefore, the results of the aforementioned poll were indeed correct. More and more, aliens are walking among us. We see them every day in our bathroom mirrors and our reflective iPod screens. Technology has made aliens of us all. Of course, there’s nothing new in this observation. After all, Marshall McLuhan was saying the same thing several decades ago. Nor is there anything new in observing the simple fact that paranoia is simply a state of heightened awareness. As Charles Manson once said (one of his many groovy aphorisms from the 1970s), “Paranoia is just a kind of awareness, and awareness is just a form of love.” Indeed, we’re more aware of what’s going on in the world now than ever before. News stories that used to take weeks to travel from one country to another now take seconds. If that’s not a heightened form of awareness, what is? Mysteries. Primitive cultures used myths to explain the mysteries of their own society. Nowadays most of us no longer believe that a bearded gentleman on top of Mt. Olympus is responsible for fashioning lightning bolts with gargantuan blacksmith tools. But some of us do hold beliefs that are equally strange. For example, were you aware that the only way an African-American could become President of the United States is if he were placed in that position by a centuries-old Masonic cult? After all, African-Americans don’t just become President. There must be something wrong with this bizarre new reality, mustn’t there? Perhaps Obama’s really a Muslim terrorist in disguise. Perhaps he’s a mind-controlled Manchurian Candidate of a secret pagan order. Perhaps there’s something erroneous about his birth certificate. Perhaps…. Just the other day about thirty of these “Obama birthers” (as some in the media have chosen to call them), most of them seemingly enjoying an upper middle-class existence, appeared in the drug-infested park across the street from my apartment building in Long Beach, California to hold a rally against the Obama administration.

They all held up signs decorated with slogans like, “BARAK OBAMA IS LEADING US INTO SOCIALISM!!!” and “NEXT TIME ELECT AN ADULT AS PRES!” and “BEWARE THE CONSENTRATION CAMPS!!!!” (Only about three counterprotesters were present at the rally; they held up signs of their own that read, “NEXT TIME SPELL CHECK YOUR SIGNS!”) I had the urge to cross the street, step up onto the stage, and point out that their heated protest against creeping “socialism” was being held in a park paid for by tax dollars. But somehow I resisted the urge. These protestors—most of them no doubt sincere and wellmeaning in their outrage against authoritarianism—spent eight years completely unconcerned about the creation of Homeland Security and the rollback of the Freedom of Information Act in the wake of 9/11 and the wholesale torture of innocent people in American-sponsored rendition camps in foreign countries, but interpret a new health care bill as the advent of the Seventh Reich. Why worry about the “consentration camps” that haven’t been built yet when there are already real concentration camps being operated at the expense of U.S. tax dollars in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay? Have these Obama birthers bothered to see Alex Gibney’s disturbing 2007 documentary Taxi to the Dark Side in which their worst paranoid fantasies have already been documented on celluloid? Probably not. The earliest myths were proto-Rorschach-blots. Those listening to the myths being told around the campfire projected their own concerns and fears into the subtext, and the same is true of conspiracy theories today. I notice this a great deal with regard to the subject of Freemasonry. You can tell a lot about the political leanings of a conspiracy theorist by who he or she thinks the Masons are. A liberal conspiracy theorist will interpret the Freemasons as a cabal of rightwing fascists with Nazi affiliations. A conservative conspiracy theorist will interpret the Freemasons as a cabal of left-leaning socialists—also with Nazi affiliations, oddly enough. LaRouche followers think the Freemasons are an exclusive cabal of British empiricists. Many Southern Baptists think they’re Satan worshippers (or Baal worshippers, as if those two mythological beings are interchangeable). Some conspiracy theorists with a severe anti-Semitic bent insist that the Freemasons are a cabal of babyeating Jews. (I’m not exaggerating about the “baby-eating Jew” part, by the way. I refer you to the work of Eustace Mullins, particularly Chapter 6 of his 1968 book Mullins’ New History of the Jews, for more information on that special form of sociopathy.)

I myself am a 32^(nd) Degree Scottish Rite Freemason, and I assure you I’ve never eaten a baby—Gentile or otherwise. The story of how I became a Freemason is so strange and absurd that it would take well over two hundred pages to do the tale justice. Suffice it to say that I can blame it all on Walter Bowart, author of the ground-breaking book, Operation Mind Control. In 2002 Walter and I were collaborating on a screenplay about the earliest attempts on the part of the U.S. government to criminalize LSD. At that time Walter was initiated into the first degree of Freemasonry (about five years before his death from cancer in December of 2007). Since he was aware that I already knew a great deal about the traditions of Freemasonry, he suggested I join his Lodge in Culver City, CA. I’ve never been much of a joiner (even the mere notion of joining the Boy Scouts disturbed me as a child), so I demurred; however, about a year after his suggestion, due to a series of incidents more akin to a comedy of errors than the phantasmagoria of such conspiracy films as Eyes Wide Shut or The Skulls, I decided to join the local Blue Lodge located only a few blocks from my apartment in Torrance, CA. I let the Master of the Lodge know that my interest in Freemasonry was, for the most part, scholarly in nature. I couldn’t help but notice that many of my favorite authors from the late nineteenth century, as well as the early twentieth century, made subtle and frequent use of hermetic, Masonic, and alchemical symbolism in their novels, stories, poems, and plays. For that reason—literary scholarship, in essence—I now sought a deeper understanding of the ancient symbolism. The Master of the Lodge seemed intrigued by this, said my reason was a perfectly valid one for wanting to join, and within a few months I was being initiated into the first degree. I had intended on halting my ascent after the third degree, but eventually made my way up to the 32^(nd) at the Scottish Rite Temple located in Long Beach, CA. Since then I’ve met a lot of Freemasons. The most nefarious crime I’ve seen any of them commit was, perhaps, eating too much potato salad after a Monday night meeting. (And for those who think Freemasons are a cabal of Aryan Nazis, consider the fact that almost every Mason I’ve ever encountered was Filipino.)

(And for those who think Freemasons are a cabal of Aryan Nazis, consider the fact that almost every Mason I’ve ever encountered was Filipino.) Now, does this mean all those spooky tales we’ve heard about backroom demonic shenanigans in Masonic Lodges are fictitious? Not necessarily. Just because I’m a 32^(nd) Degree Freemason doesn’t mean I’m an expert on the subject. I’m not psychically attuned to every Mason in the world. In fact, I’m friends with one woman who claims she was ritually abused by several Freemasons throughout her childhood. I have no reason to disbelieve her tale. It’s a serious logical fallacy, however, to conclude that all Masons are child molesters based on the actions of a few, just as it’s a leap to conclude that all [fill in the blank] are [fill in the blank] because you once got [ripped off by one/mugged by one in an alley/unceremoniously groped by one in an elevator/etc.]. As for the perennial Satan-worship allegations, since becoming a Freemason in 2003 the only reference I’ve heard to Satan was during one of the Scottish Rite degrees, and the entirety of that reference was clearly intended as a morality tale— a parable that rather reminded me of the last few minutes of Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride at Disneyland more than a chapter out of Anton LaVey’s The Satanic Bible. The simple (and, for some, unbearable) truth is that almost all the esoteric “secrets” of Freemasonry are readily accessible in any public library in the United States and have been for generations. Yes, the Freemasons might be the most amorphous of all the ink blots in the postmodern pantheon of boogeymen delineated in this grimoire of myths. Myths tell us a lot about ourselves: our fears, our dreams. They convey everything an extraterrestrial anthropologist would need to know about human ethics and our true sense of self and our place in the universe, perhaps even more than the various organized religions still clinging to our collective unconscious in the twenty-first century. Myths reveal our essential selves in ways that might make us very uncomfortable. How much do the numerous volumes written by Holocaust deniers, for example, tell us about the human race? Sadly, they tell us a great deal—far more than we would like to know. Just because the majority of Americans find these theories abhorrent doesn’t mean we should ignore them or conclude they’re not meaningful. The truth is, they’re very meaningful.

All conspiracy theories are meaningful… just like all myths are meaningful. Every myth structure is composed of darkness and light. Every Olympian mountaintop has its counterpart in Hades. Every heroic whistleblower who uncovers secret documents like The Pentagon Papers has a doppelganger, a Jungian dark double, attempting to foist off The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion on a gullible public. The field of conspiracy theory is littered with the carcasses of sincere truth seekers who failed in their search. In the early 1990s the rightwing militia movement was at the height of its popularity, spurred by the election of Democrat Bill Clinton to the Presidency. For years these militia members, led by homegrown heroes like attorney Linda Thompson and shortwave radio host William Cooper, congregated in “covert” meeting halls in order to exchange dark tales about the swarm of U.N. black helicopters that would soon arrive to round up the last remaining patriots in this country. In the wake of this mini-Ragnarok, the Clintons were supposedly going to build concentration camps in the Midwest and Alaska to confine all these patriots, leaving the U.S. wide open for socialist rule. So spoke the prophecies. When these same militia groups were tied to the destruction of the Oklahoma City Federal Building in 1995 their media presence waned slowly. A couple of years ago the militia movement had devolved into a forgotten joke. In March of 2010, however, a Christian militia in Michigan was indicted for plotting to assassinate police officers and Muslims with homemade bombs as a preemptive strike against the imminent takeover of the “Anti-Christ.” On April 17, 2010, a neo-Nazi rally was held outside City Hall in downtown Los Angeles to protest Obama and the evil gnomes who influence his policies from their subterranean lair in Zurich. Yes, the black helicopters are emerging once again from the mists of myth… and once again, appropriately enough, they’re spurred by the election of a Democrat to the presidency. This game goes way back. During the Carter administration an eccentric attorney named Dr. Peter Beter (yes, that was his real name) claimed that President Carter had been assassinated by Soviet agents and replaced with “organic robotoids” intent on taking over the United States for Bolshevik rule. Lyndon Johnson was implicated in the murder of John F. Kennedy within days of the assassination. Kennedy was accused of being a secret agent for the Pope.

Harry Truman, duped by the Scottish Rite Freemasons, allowed the atom bomb to be dropped on Hiroshima in order to fulfill a centuries-old alchemical plot hatched by the Scottish Rite Freemasons long before the Great Pyramids were first constructed. Franklin Roosevelt allowed the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor in order to drag the United States into World War II (that one goes without saying). We could keep going farther and farther back in time, but I think you get the picture. A similar—and even more ominous litany—could be compiled with regard to Republican Presidents. Joseph Campbell, in his classic study of mythology, The Hero With _(a) Thousand Faces, never wrote about what happens when the Hero’s quest for truth is derailed and decays into mere paranoia… into an obsessive need to explain away those shifts in society that do not accord with the Hero’s limited reality tunnel. But it’s crucial to note that only a lazy thinker would dismiss all this paranoia as mere insanity. As Joseph Heller once wrote, “Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they aren’t after you.” Similarly, we would be remiss if we condemned all such conspiracy theories as pure jabberwocky. After all, conspiracy theories will be with us for a long time, so we might as well become a little more intimate with them. If, in the twenty-first century, paranoia has become an art form, then it’s no wonder that conspiracy theory has become an art form in its own right as well. It’s a brand new literary genre still only in its infancy (at least in relation to other, more well-established genres). Consider the parallels with other nascent art forms of the latter half of the twentieth century. Within the past few decades, for example, we have watched the music video evolve from a simple marriage of music and stage-bound visuals to that of a complicated new art form. Many of our most important film directors today began their careers directing music videos, an art form dismissed as trivial trash only two decades ago. Similarly, within the next ten years we will begin to see the field of conspiracy theories morph and evolve in surprising ways. Expect to see a slew of college courses analyzing conspiracy theories, not only from a literary perspective (as we’ve seen in recent years with other formerly debased genres such as detective fiction, science fiction and the graphic novel medium), but from the perspective of cultural studies as well.

I myself have been using such writings in my own courses at CSU Long Beach, where I’ve been teaching since 2002. When I allow my students to choose their own topics for their final argumentative essays in my composition courses, they often choose those with a conspiratorial bent. It’s a popular subject among students, particularly for teenagers and people in their early twenties. I know of some colleagues who have also used conspiracy theories to teach rhetoric, composition, and even logic. From observing this trend, combined with the ubiquity of conspiracy theories in popular media (including films, television, comic books, pop music, video games, and even trading cards), I concluded the time was right for an exploration of its contents. Though this book is by no means an encyclopedia, its breadth of subject matter is intended to be as close to encyclopedic as possible. Under analysis in this volume is almost every major conspiracy theory, from the most famous to the utterly obscure. Subjects covered include (but are by no means limited to) conspiracies involving Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Freemasonry, Mormonism and Scientology, 9/11, Columbine, the Oklahoma City Bombing, the JFK and RFK assassinations, alien implants, the Illuminati, Bohemian Grove, the Heaven’s Gate mass suicide, Jonestown, the L.A. Riots, O.J. Simpson, the origin of AIDS, the 1969 moon landing, all eight years of the George W. Bush administration, World War I, World War II, Vietnam, both Iraq Wars, and even some future bloody conflicts thrown in for good measure. This doesn’t mention such perennial favorites as: mind control in advertising, education, popular literature and the field of covert intelligence; the ostensible influence of secret societies on revolutions, wars and other historical events; little known political assassinations; the esoteric connections between conspiracies and the paranormal; applying conspiracy theory to the Hegelian Dialectic; the always bizarre world of UFOS, and (as they say on those late night commercials) much, much more. Paranoia surrounds us. Instead of staving it off, let’s embrace it for awhile. By growing comfortable with it, we might actually be able to become one with it.

Often the most thorough research is done by complete amateurs (groundbreaking journalist Mae Brussell being the prime example), while the most amateurish research is done by well-trained professionals (i.e., almost any Los Angeles Times article with the word “conspiracy” in the title). To see what I mean, I suggest perusing Rich Cohen’s article “Welcome to the Conspiracy,” featured in the May 2004 issue of Vanity Fair. The article purports to be an objective critique of conspiracy research. However, the actual purpose of Cohen’s article is not to offer genuine criticism of conspiracy research at all (such a task would be welcome). Instead, his ultimate purpose is to leave in the reader’s mind the impression that conspiracy researchers are a) anti-Semites, b) right-wing fundamentalists, and c) always men. Just a quick glance at the masthead of almost any conspiracy journal would render that last proposition laughable. In fact, one of the great progenitors of this type of research was none other than Mae Brussell, a liberal Jewish woman, the daughter of one of the most prominent Rabbis in Los Angeles history, Edgar Magnin. Brussell’s skills as a political researcher were beyond reproach. Brussell wrote about Watergate before the Washington Post. 1 I refer interested researchers to the compilation The Mae Brussell Reader, released by Prevailing Winds in 1991, if you wish to judge Brussell’s reportage for yourself. As famed investigative journalist Seymour Hersh once said of Brussell,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Crypto0003PRINTs_cleaned.txt:10:e09a0ffb05dc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5337, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Crypto0003PRINTs_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Cryptoscatology-Conspiracy-Theory-Art-Form/dp/1936296403", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Crypto0003PRINTs_cleaned", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "research was none other than Mae Brussell, a liberal Jewish woman, the daughter of one of the most prominent Rabbis in Los Angeles history, Edgar Magnin.

As famed investigative journalist Seymour Hersh once said of Brussell, “She’s crazy, but she’s right.” Alas, mainstream publications are very often neither crazy nor right. The job of most professional journalists consists of rewriting news releases sent to them by PR Newswire or Business Wire and very little else. Sometimes, I suspect, they don’t even do that much. I have a friend who works at Business Wire; he often sees news releases he himself has edited reprinted word for word in a mainstream newspaper. With such a lackadaisical atmosphere pervading the halls of newsrooms across the country, it’s not surprising that amateurs are forced to fill the void with articles in conspiracy ‘zines, postings on the internet, hit-and-run phone calls on radio talk shows, and graffiti on alley walls. Loose in the conspiracy world is an anarchy of information, to which there’s an upside and a downside. Most conspiracy magazines are a synthesis of both. The upside and the downside appear side by side without even a wink or a nudge from the editors to explain the difference. On one page you might find a meticulously researched, thoroughly footnoted article examining the origins of the Gulf War Disease by Dr. Alan Cantwell, and on the next you’ll find someone named “Anonymous” ranting about the cabal of homosexual Communists attempting to take over the world. Few people can oscillate between these two categories and remain sane, though why this should be the case perplexes me. You don’t need a degree in advanced physics to tell the difference between legitimate research and illegitimate research (or, more often than not, no research at all). Legitimate conspiracy research (Noam Chomsky, eager to remain in the good graces of academia, prefers to call it “Institutional Analysis”) is footnoted and sourced, and pure speculation is clearly labeled as such. Illegitimate conspiracy research is very often based on little more than hearsay or the wild imagination of the researcher himself. That doesn’t mean such goofiness doesn’t have a place in the universe. Some of it is purely insane, some of it is clever disinformation manufactured by one or more intelligence agencies to muddy the waters, some of it is misinformation from sincere but sadly misled researchers, some of it is outright satire, but none of it is boring.

After all, in times such as these when conspiracies are conducted right in front of our faces, and murderous thugs wander the halls of the White House cooking up imaginary threats to keep us frightened, it’s important not to waste our time conjuring up plots and counter-plots that don’t even exist. Let’s leave such fear mongering to the professionals, shall we? What follows is an overview of the more obscure conspiracy theories floating around out there. If possible, I’ll attempt to identify which of the five categories the theory falls into (i.e., Insanity, Disinformation, Misinformation, Satire or Legitimate Research). However, I’d like to point out that in even the most suspect conspiracy theory there’s often a kernel of truth. As political researcher Dave Emory likes to say, “Even a blind pig can find an acorn once in awhile.” I’ll try to uncover that acorn in each of the following examples. During the summer of 1998 various people kept coming up to me and saying, “Have you seen this weird guy who drives around Torrance in a van that has a sign on it that says STEPHEN KING SHOT JOHN LENNON?” No, I would reply, I’ve never seen it. In fact, I appeared to be the only one in Torrance who never did see it, though I would’ve liked to. NON. Well, how could I pass that up? I walked on up to the van and perused the hundred little newspaper clippings taped to its side. The driver, an aging hippie named Steven Lightfoot, climbed out of the back to explain his theory, the main thrust of which was that Ronald Reagan wanted Lennon dead in order to destroy the spirit of the sixties. This I could understand. I’m still not quite clear on how this ties into Stephen King, however. After he finished telling me that Stephen King was also John Doe #2 of Oklahoma City Bombing Fame, I asked him if he’d ever been to Torrance, CA. He replied that a copy of his “book” (in truth a stapled pamphlet) was $3 . I gladly gave up the three sawbucks, at which point Lightfoot jotted down his pager number on the back of the “book” (he has no address, since he lives out of the van) and said, “Reproduce as many copies as you want. Pass ‘em around. The Word needs to get out!”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Crypto0003PRINTs_cleaned.txt:12:e518f637e2d3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5339, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Crypto0003PRINTs_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Cryptoscatology-Conspiracy-Theory-Art-Form/dp/1936296403", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Crypto0003PRINTs_cleaned", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "City Bombing Fame, I asked him if he’d ever been to Torrance, CA.

The Word needs to get out!” [Lightfoot’s pager number is 408- 233-4944, if you’re interested in getting in contact with him.] “I promise I’ll show a copy to the editor of Paranoia magazine,” I said as I strolled away from the van. Upon returning home I sent a copy to one of the editors of Paranoia in Rhode Island as well as to Jack Womack in New York. Womack, author of the novel Random Acts of Senseless Violence, is a connoisseur of such strangeness. He wrote back, “A friend of mine remembers seeing the S.K.S.J.L. van parked on Amsterdam at 72^(nd) a few years ago, which is probably about as close as anyone would let him get to the Dakota, 2 blocks away.” Another friend of mine remembers seeing the van at a Grateful Dead concert in Irvine, while yet another friend has heard him calling into the Stephanie Miller show on KABC (790 AM). The man’s quite ubiquitous. Sometimes I wonder if he has the divine power of bi-location. I don’t think I need to point out that this particular theory falls under the Insanity Category. However, there are indeed unanswered questions surrounding the assassination of John Lennon. In 1988 Arthur O’Connor, NYPD lieutenant of detectives, suggested to a British barrister named Fenton Bresler, “It’s possible Mark [David Chapman] could have been used by somebody. I saw him the night of the murder. I studied him intensely. He looked as if he could have been programmed…” (Bresler 17). Indeed, Chapman exhibited the behavior of a hypnotized subject. In 1972 Lennon himself had told Paul Krassner, the publisher of The Realist, “Listen, if anything happens to Yoko and me, it was not an accident” (Krassner 214). That was the same time when Lennon and Ono were also funding the publication of Mae Brussell’s research. A more exhaustive examination of these issues can be found in Fenton Bresler’s 1989 book Who Shot John Lennon? Though based on little more than circumstantial evidence, the book raises some intriguing questions that need to be addressed. A good start, of course, would be for the FBI to release its files on Lennon sans all redactions that serve to reduce the pages into a mess of blacked-out rectangles with a maximum of two words visible (if you’re lucky).

Until the government ceases to insist on absolute secrecy in the interest of that all-purpose bugaboo known as “national security,” you can look forward to more insane theories like Lightfoot’s proliferating on the internet and beyond. On October 14-16, 1988, a syndicated television broadfield. Titled UFO Cover-up? Live!, the show purported to be a true exposé of the government’s secret agreement with the alien Grays. Though the conditions of this agreement were left ambiguous, the show clearly implied that the government had given the aliens an underground base in Nevada where they were being allowed to carry out genetic experiments on human abductees. The main sources for this information were two “members of the intelligence community” who used the code names Falcon and Condor. Both claimed to be members of a secret group known as the Aviary. They were only shown behind screens and their voices were distorted in order to protect their identity. As Jacques Vallée has pointed out: “It should be fairly obvious that the people presumably charged with the security of the projects on which Falcon, Condor, and the other members of the Aviary claimed to work, would immediately find out who they were… since the projects in question are supposed to be highly classified, hence would be known to a very small group where leaks could be traced instantly” (Vallée 43-44). Though the Aviary itself may exist (or may have existed at one time) in some form or another, it’s doubtful that the two gentlemen featured on the show were actually members of such an organization. Among Falcon and Condor’s stranger claims was that the aliens preferred to eat ice cream and vegetables. Over twenty years later, those who saw the show seem to remember this detail most of all. Communion author Whitley Strieber has said, “[The show] contained a lot of credible information about aliens and UFOs and the cover-up, but it also contained the story that the aliens liked strawberry ice cream, turning the whole thing into a laughing stock. It was very cleverly done” (Strieber Interview). The techniques used to obfuscate the few moments of serious information were indeed clever, but simple. For example, the UFO witnesses were forced to read from teleprompters, making them sound stilted and rehearsed. While the witnesses related horrifying tales of alien abduction, the sound track consisted of an upbeat Russian polka, subtly transforming their tragedy into utter slapstick. Mike Farrell’s narration was so obviously tongue-in-cheek, the viewer felt alienated from the material even more.

Mike Farrell’s narration was so obviously tongue-in-cheek, the viewer felt alienated from the material even more. Similarly, the painted backdrops of “a bright sunny room overlooking a garden” served as an effective antienvironment when juxtaposed with the ominous information concerning the intentions of the aliens, who were depicted as idealized Disneyesque cartoon characters (Andrews 4-5). I think it would be safe to say that UFO Cover-up? Live! was a clever piece of propaganda manufactured by the intelligence community itself. By the way, this particular documentary was the first in television history to be granted the privilege of being broadcast simultaneously in both the United States and the Soviet Union. Such international cooperation seems quite suspicious, particularly during the Cold War, and only strengthens the idea that the program’s main intent was one of disinformation. As Jacques Vallée has said, “If the objective of [this] particular piece of disinformation art was to destabilize the few groups that are still seriously doing UFO research, to place the few competent investigators in a ridiculous light, and to disseminate spurious data, then they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams, as the disintegration of American UFO research over the last few years demonstrates” (Vallée 45). What a title! One can’t help but admire any conspiracy re-searcher who could cook up a title as colorful as that. Ralph René, a former member of Mensa who prefers to be known only by his last name for some reason, was forced to self-publish his book in 1992 after Victoria House Press in New York threatened to rewrite it entirely. Upon receiving NASA Mooned America! in the mail, I was immediately struck by the fact that it was bound in black electrical tape. Most people would interpret this as a bad sign, but not me. Anyone who’s so committed to his research that he’ll resort to binding his book in electrical tape is clearly of interest. Over the course of 176 pages, René attempts to prove that NASA faked every one of its moon landings in a warehouse near Mercury, Nevada, a theory first proposed in Bill Kaysing’s 1981 book We Never Went To the Moon. (Kaysing claims that Peter Hyams’ 1978 film Capricorn One was based on his research. By the way, if you want to get really conspiratorial, consider the fact that Capricorn One stars none other than O.J. Simpson.) René expands on Kaysing’s original proposal by analyzing original NASA photos, comparing contradictory statements by the Apollo astronauts (or “astro-nots,” as René likes to say), and deconstructing the unchallenged", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Crypto0003PRINTs_cleaned.txt:15:4c5472820e51", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5342, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Crypto0003PRINTs_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Cryptoscatology-Conspiracy-Theory-Art-Form/dp/1936296403", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Crypto0003PRINTs_cleaned", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "a theory first proposed in Bill Kaysing’s 1981 book We Never Went To the Moon.

René expands on Kaysing’s original proposal by analyzing original NASA photos, comparing contradictory statements by the Apollo astronauts (or “astro-nots,” as René likes to say), and deconstructing the unchallenged assumptions concerning human survival in space. René raises many intriguing questions. How did the Moon Rover fit onto the Lander? Why are there no stars visible in any of the NASA photographs of the Moon? Why wasn’t color footage used during the 1969 landing? How did the astronauts withstand the deadly radiation in the Van Allen belt? Most of René’s questions have simple answers, and I would refer the interested reader to Michael Bara’s article “Who Mourns For Apollo?” at http://www.lunaranomalies.com/fakemoon.htm for analysis far more in-depth than any I can offer here. René’s technical acuity is far from unassailable. At one point he seems incapable of distinguishing between “shadows” and “silhouettes,” for example. However, that doesn’t mean the entire book is worthless. Far from it. Though in my opinion René fails to prove his central thesis, he does indeed prove that NASA fakes photographs. His analysis of two photographs taken from Michael Collins’ 1974 book Carrying the Fire proves that the July 1966 photograph (#66-40127) of Michael Collins’ space-walk was derived from a picture of Collins in a Zero-G airplane; the original figure has clearly been flopped over, reduced in size, and superimposed onto a black background. René’s analysis of NASA’s 4/22/72 photo (AS16-107-17446), depicting Charles Duke and the Moon Rover during the Apollo 16 mission, is certainly intriguing. Even my most skeptical friends have been dumbfounded by the fact that the Rover’s antenna clearly overlaps the cross-hairs on the photo. I’d like to meet the professional photographer who can explain that one away. Because NASA fakes photographs, one can’t immediately leap to the conclusion that we never went to the Moon. I can imagine a number of reasons for altering NASA photos, one of them being to remove evidence of alien artifacts that certain NASA officials would prefer to keep from profane eyes like yours and mine. Richard Hoagland, former advisor to both NASA and Walter Cronkite, insists that the famous photo of Alan Shepard hitting a golf ball on the Moon is manufactured (8/20/97 Interview). This photo depicts Shepard and Ed Mitchell standing side by side, despite the fact that there were only two cameras taken along on the Apollo 14 moon landing— both of them strapped to the chests of Shepard and Mitchell. This faked photo can be found in the center of Shepard’s 1994 book Moon Shot.

This faked photo can be found in the center of Shepard’s 1994 book Moon Shot. Another valid point examined in René’s book is the mystery surrounding the deaths of Virgil Grissom, Roger Chaffee, and Ed White. Grissom was becoming increasingly critical of NASA just prior to his “accident.” According to Mike Gray in his book Angle of Attack, Grissom told his wife Betty, “If there is a serious accident in the space program, it’s likely to be me” (218). Grissom and his two companions died on January 27, 1967 when a fire broke out in the Apollo spacecraft they were testing on Pad 34 at Cape Kennedy. As René says, “…I cannot understand why Grissom et al entered that capsule in the first place if they knew it was to be pressurized with oxygen over 14.7 psi…. Apparently not one of them complained. Didn’t anyone know about Calorimeter Bombs? Didn’t NASA send them copies of the fire reports? Or maybe no one told them they were jacking up the pressure!” (47-48) Even more suspicious is the fact that government agents raided Virgil Grissom’s house before anyone even knew about the fire, confiscated his personal diary, and never returned it to his widow. As if that wasn’t enough, on the morning of the fire the outward opening hatch of the capsule was changed to a hatch that opened inward. Of course, the pressure created by the fire prevented this “new, improved” hatch from being opened from either the inside or the outside. 1997, she openly accused NASA of a cover-up in relation to her husband’s death (5/16/97 Hoagland Interview). On February 11, 1999, the Associated Press reported that Grissom’s son, Scott Grissom, had alleged, “My father’s death was no accident. He was murdered.” Furthermore, a NASA investigator, Clark MacDonald of McDonnell-Douglas, accused the agency of covering up the real cause of the fire by destroying his original report, along with numerous taped interviews, from thirtyone years before. René strikes me as a sincere researcher attempting to find the truth. I don’t believe he’s Insane, a Disinformation Specialist, or a Satirist. I suspect the bulk of his book falls under the category of Misinformation. However, that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth studying. There’s more than just one acorn worth uncovering here.

A typical entry in the ever-expanding genre known as “sa-tirical” conspiracy theories is one that presents itself as a group of privileged scoundrels who are committing various forms of skullduggery against the masses. This genre could very well date back to Dialogue in Hell between Machiavelli and Montesquieu by Maurice Joly, a rare book published in France in 1865. Dialogue was plagiarized in the early twentieth century by unknown authors and refashioned into the infamous Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion—which makes its first appearance as an appendix in a 1905 book bearing the unwieldy title The Big in the Small, and Antichrist as a Near Political Possibility; Notes of an Orthodox Person by Sergei A. Nilus (Berlet 248). This appendix was later published in a separate volume and used by the Nazis as a means of stirring up anti-Semitism in Germany, Britain, and the United States. Even though Protocols itself may not have been intended as a satire, its original source certainly was. At roughly the same time that Protocols made its debut, Léo Taxil published Les Mysteres de la Franc-Maconnerie in which he wove an elaborate tall tale involving devil-worshipping Freemasons operating in secret in modern day France. It became quite popular, as popular as Dan Brown’s The Da-Vinci Code is today, despite the fact that the contents of the book were entirely concocted by the author. Eventually, Taxil revealed the entire hoax during a public lecture at the Hall of the Geographic Society in Paris before a disappointed audience of devout Catholic priests eager to hear more horror stories about female Freemasons engaging in lewd sex acts with Baphomet. Not only did Taxil describe his twelve-year-long prank as “the most fantastic hoax of modern times,” but he also commented, “It is a bit unusual indeed, that we managed to get our staggering stories swallowed in our $1 9 ^ { } $ century.” If he were alive today, Taxil would no doubt be surprised to learn that his hoax is still being quoted as fact by right-wing Christians even at the dawn of the twenty-first century. (Taxil’s confession was originally published in a French newspaper called Le Frondeur on April 25, 1897. An English translation of the speech can be viewed at www.altreligion.about.com/library/texts/bl_confessiontaxil.htm.) A more recent entry in this genre includes Leonard Lewin’s Report From Iron Mountain (Dial Press, 1967). This book purports to be the minutes of a group called Iron Mountain 15, a high level government task force.

Concluding that the world economy could only “suffer” from peace, the group decides to convene for the purpose of thinking up methods of “invisible warfare” that can stimulate the economy as sufficiently as traditional warfare. Among several possibilities, the committee suggests faking an invasion from outer space. Though the author himself admitted the book was intended to be a satire, Col. L. Fletcher Prouty (former advisor to President Kennedy) said, “But the people at the Hudson Institute, the Pentagon, and the government contractors were talking like this in those days. So it wasn’t really exaggerated enough to be satire. I’d always believed it to be leaked information” (Bowart Chp. 38, p. 3). During the Kennedy years, people within the government and their close associates in academia and industry discussed frequently and quite seriously many of the major questions phrased by Leonard Lewin in Report From Iron Mountain. I had been assigned to the Office of the Secretary of Defense before the Kennedy election and was there when the McNamara team of “Whiz Kids” arrived. Never before had so many brilliant young civilians with so many Ph.D.s worked in that office. It was out of the mouths of this group that I heard so frequently and precisely the ideas that Lewin recounts in his “novel.” (287-88) By the way, a personal favorite among even more recent examples of this genre appeared in Paranoia #9 . John Glenn and A.S. Hamrah co-wrote an article that begins with the provocative sentence, “Doesn’t it seem, well, odd to you that so many retired counter-culturites claim to have been at Woodstock, yet a) there just wouldn’t have been room there for all of them, and b) when you ask around yourself, you can’t find anyone who was really there?” Glenn and Hamrah’s thesis is that Woodstock was faked by the CIA. They raise some interesting questions (“Does it strike you as suspicious that although Otis Redding supposedly performed at Woodstock, he died in 1967?”), almost all of them complete jabberwocky. I think it’s safe to assume that this article falls under the category of Satire, and comes heartily recommended to those interested in uncovering the “typically ham-fisted intelligence community conspiracy” behind the “grotesque miscalculation that was Sha Na Na” (54). ’ve saved the best for last.

If one reads his book AIDS and the Doctors of Death in tandem with Emerging Viruses by Dr. Leonard Horowitz, Dr. Mary’s Monkey by Edward Haslam, and AIDS Inc. by journalist Jon Rappoport, one will come away with a pretty clear picture of how the AIDS virus was created, who developed it, who released it and why. No “theory” here, just facts. If one reads the 1978 book The Assassination of Robert Kennedy by William Turner and Jonn Christian, one will realize that Sirhan Sirhan could not have been responsible for any of the wounds suffered by Senator Kennedy that fateful summer night in 1968. This is a classic in its field, written by an FBI agent and a professional newsman, and deserves to be more widely known among those interested in the hidden agendas guiding American history from behind the scenes. The bullets that murdered John F. Kennedy’s younger brother did not come from Sirhan Sirhan’s gun; in fact, the probable identity of the real gunman can be found within the pages of this very book. No “theory” here, just facts. In America’s Secret Establishment by Stanford Economics professor Antony Sutton, one will learn that Yale University’s elite Skull & Bones is not just a “debating society,” the quaint description used in a recent Los Angeles Times report (published prominently on the front page of the 3-23-04 Calendar section) titled “What Binds Bush, Kerry,” in which “investigative journalist” Robin Abcarian bends over backwards to leave the reader with the impression that the Yale secret society Skull & Bones is nothing more than a “debating society where members of the senior class… get together and discuss important topics of the day.” In case you forgot, back in 2004 both major On a related note, check out Alex Jones’ 2000 documentary Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, an exposé of more secret society shenanigans among the political elite. You want to know what politicians like Henry Kissinger and George Bush are up to in their off-hours?

If you can get past the “What I Did On My Summer Vacation” production values and the occasional misinterpretation of the events depicted here (i.e., the typically Christian tendency to confuse paganism with Satanism), you will come away with a number of “illuminating” sights, indeed. Forget Kubrick’s tepid fantasies in Eyes Wide Shut; here are the real facts. (For more information, see www. infowars.com.) Some people live for presidential campaigns, not unlike wrestling fans or soap opera addicts, waiting on the edge of their seats for the next melodramatic plot twist to unfold. As with professional wrestling and daytime soap operas, however, these plot twists may not be quite as extemporaneous as the most rabid fans would prefer to believe. Fortunately, as any reader of conspiracy ‘zines knows only too well, the truth is often much stranger than such ephemeral fictions. The life of any hardcore political junkie will remain unfulfilled until he or she reads Votescam: The Stealing of America by James and Kenneth Collier, a pair of muckrakers (in the best sense of that word) who literally dedicated their lives to uncovering the truth behind the rampant manipulation of elections in the United States. Anyone who read this book when it was initially published in 1992 was not at all surprised when the curious debacle known as the 2000 Presidential elections came apart at the seams in Dade County, Florida. One would be hard pressed to choose a better locale for the hi-jacking of a country if one were writing the scenario as a screenplay (presupposing, of course, that the elections themselves were not a screenplay). Upon finishing this book, one will realize how prophetic the Collier brothers truly were. The facts, as laid out in this overlooked work of political science, are incontrovertible. Finally, no discussion of conspiracies would be complete without some mention of UFOs. The best overview of this vast and complex subject remains Above Top Secret by journalist Timothy Good. However, the skeptics out there would be more thoroughly challenged by Unconventional Flying Objects written by Paul Hill, a well-respected NASA scientist who spent twenty-five years acting as “an unofficial clearing house at NASA, collecting and analyzing sightings’ reports for physical properties, propulsion possibilities, dynamics, etc.” He took special precautions to preserve this study for posthumous publication.

In the end, the important point to remember is this: In the modern day digital environment truth is as malleable as viscous liquid. You can’t make up anything that won’t come true a few minutes later. A few years ago, during the news coverage of the JFK Jr. plane crash tragedy, a hoaxer posing as a captain in the Coast Guard called into Dan Rather’s program and claimed that sections of JFK’s private plane had been recovered from the ocean. When Dan Rather realized he’d been had, he grew quite indignant and apologized to the audience profusely. Fifteen minutes later, the real captain called in and reported the same information! The phony captain had scooped the real captain with an imaginary story! As the late comic book writer Steve Gerber once said, “The world has become parasatirical.” According to media ecologist Robert Dobbs, “…in software/ wetware conditions we just have to think about something collectively and it’s done” (Interview). If so, the more imaginative conspiracy theorists might do well to be a bit more careful with the apocalyptic scenarios they tend to promote.

My friend Anna Lewis said, laughing, “It looked like he was wearin’ a rug!” Perhaps Dave was partly color-blind, since his wigs were too red to be real. What I did learn, right away, was that Dave appreciated my ignoring his weird appearance when his hat and sunglasses came off. I got used to it. Besides, I was fascinated with the man. He was a brilliant, charismatic individual, and I told him so. What I didn’t like was his profanity. The rich wealth of Dave’s mind was dark with floods of profanity suddenly shooting from his mouth, and I confronted him about it. I wasn’t judging him because of his homosexuality, I told him. But that potty mouth! Once Lee had to reprove him, when Dave snapped at me, saying, “My God, woman, why are you such a prude?” Lee, who by then already cared for me, reminded Dave that I had wanted to become a nun, just two years earlier. That reached Dave, and he apologized. I dared challenge Dave to speak to me in the manner of the great thinkers and writers he admired, such as Aristotle, John Milton and Thomas Aquinas. Dave had yearned to become a legitimate priest and never gave up hoping that somehow he might still find a way. As I was a fellow Catholic, but had renounced my faith, Dave insisted that I listen to him about his religious beliefs. He never knew that some of his arguments eventually helped me return to a belief in God. By then, he’d been murdered. Several times, Dave treated Lee and me to brilliant discourses. He stunned our young minds as a devious rhetorician, an erudite apologist for the Catholic Church, a medic, a probing psychologist, a social critic with dark, futuristic visions of tomorrows that turned out to be, unfortunately, pretty accurate.

When Dave was thinking loftily, Lee and I felt we were in the presence of a genius whose wit, irony and epithets raised our level of being.22 All the more sad, that he could also be shallow, brutish and foul. Dave had his own excuses for his present condition. He spoke of turning points in his life that set aflame his overwhelming obsession with teen-aged boys (he claimed all of that was over). And I sympathized, because we were both renegades whose present lives were 100% unacceptable in the part of the country where both of us had been born and raised. The importance of this fact should not be ignored. Like Dave, I was from the Middle West. Dave was a native of Cleveland, Ohio: I was a native of South Bend, Indiana, just four hours away by car. We spoke the same language, literally and socially. New Orleans was not only a thousand miles from Cleveland, but its Cajun traditions and Southern ways were very different from the ways of the Heartland. New Orleans, perhaps the most European of America’s large cities, was filled with foreigners, was openly corrupt and did everything boldly. Its citizens were ruled under Napoleonic law and lived in parishes, not counties. In contrast, Dave and I thought of ourselves as “real Americans.” You worked hard, didn’t complain, went to church, minded your own business, and saluted the flag when it passed by in a parade. Hearing the National Anthem would bring a lump to your throat. Communists would go to hell, and so would homosexuals. Honesty and decency were paramount. Any radical deviance from “the norm” might be considered evil. The cry of “the South will rise again!,” flagpoles carrying the Confederate Flag, and shouts in Cajun French and Catholic Irish mingled with an influx of Cubans, Latinos and Mexicans pouring through New Orleans’ international Port of Entry. The sweet vibes of Jazz and the mysteries of Voodoo promoted sexual freedom and promiscuity with every wild Mardi Gras parade. In 1963, our Catholic-instilled morals and mores, streamlined by Puritan ethics, still dominated the two of us from within, so Dave had to provide excuses to me for his sex life. “I am cursed!” he insisted, “but, unlike you, I still trust in God.” He would go on to say something like this: “God will burn it out of me in Purgatory. I’m counting on that. But He made me this way. I was born this way, and I didn’t ask for this. I can’t help it, damn it!”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:1:8076878c019d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5351, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Puritan ethics, still dominated the two of us from within, so Dave had to provide excuses to me for his sex life. “I am cursed!” he insisted, “but, unlike you, I still trust in God.” He would go on to say something like this: “God will burn it out of me in Purgatory. I’m counting on that. But He made me this way. I was born this way, and I didn’t ask for this. I can’t help it, damn it!” I’ve been told I should have run for my life when I saw what I was getting involved with. But these people were patriots and heroes in my eyes. I had no “blueprints” as to what brave men, willing to die for their country, had to look like and act like. I’d seen plenty of rough and tough war heroes in the propaganda movies that came out before and after the big wars. In Anchors Away John Wayne played a hero who gave up love, family and a career to fight the foes of freedom. Audie Murphy – heroic and fearless – was a Who was I to judge these men, who were risking their lives for the sake of my country? That’s the way I had been taught to look at such extraordinary men – I did not expect “the ordinary” from such men. So I overcame my inbred disgust with Dave. And I had to: we were working together, and the mission to kill Castro was important. Over time, Dave and I became real friends. I knew him well enough to ask him to draw his soul, which he took seriously, groaning over a sheet of paper riddled with dark, sharp scribbles. Dave had a soul. He’d devoted years trying to get ordained, and had failed, but this didn’t stop him from shepherding young men into the priesthood or into military service. He tried to do good: he’d fly tramps back home when he could. Dave owned two small planes, and today I realize that I must have seen both of them, hangared at the Lakefront Airport, now that I know what I was looking at. I was also personally present, once, when Dave was using somebody else’s (larger) plane. Since I was then an atheist, Dave continued to do his best to argue me back into the church. Other factors pulled us together: we were deeply embroiled in a clandestine project, we had to rely on each other, we had to protect each other from contamination from a potent cancer-causing virus, and we had to make Dave’s messy kitchen look normal after finishing our work there.

Considering how our country has changed, the truth about the Kennedy assassination matters very much. It’s the key to how our government was illegally taken over from within, and how the lies of the new rulers, covering up all the sins they’ve committed ever since, are created and defended. The cover-up is TrineDay published the first edition of Me & Lee in 2010, including new information about David Ferrie. By then, I’d long left the country. I had to. I now only return to America on rare occasions when a bodyguard and/or lots of publicity make it foolish to target me. I also learned to have witnesses present at all times when interviewed, so I wouldn’t be misquoted, having learned the hard way. I’ll never stop defending Lee, but at one time, I was too afraid to do so. Despite all my promises to Lee that I’d tell his children the truth about him, I’d originally planned to take my secrets to the grave, except for a few letters to Lee’s family, to be placed in the hands of my eldest son. But things began to change in 1996. Nostalgia was the sole reason I accepted an offer to teach at a Louisiana university (Lee – I missed you so much!) And just “maybe” – I’d run into Anna Lewis or somebody else who would remember me and Lee from long ago (and I did!). Because of all the heartaches, though, I stayed away from New Orleans. But as my last child still at home planned her marriage, I dared to think about looking at the film JFK. Alone. So I could cry, for I knew I’d see “Lee” again … and not for the first time. In the college classes I taught, in Louisiana, I’d see young faces that looked hauntingly like my slain hero. Inbreeding and strong genes created many look-a-likes. Yes, friends and family, as early as 1980, knew I had worked with Lee at the Reily Coffee Company, and that we “rode the streetcars of New Orleans together,” but they knew nothing more. Nor had I dared tell Lee’s children, as I had promised, that he was, in his own words, “a good guy.” Now the time had come.

Nor had I dared tell Lee’s children, as I had promised, that he was, in his own words, “a good guy.” Now the time had come. When my daughter left for her honeymoon in December 1998, I wrote a tall stack of highly detailed letters. It slowly emerged into a book, expanded with photos, biographies of everyone involved, and supporting evidence. Today, it is called Me δLee . That book also includes statements from my witnesses, who, back in January 1999, were still to be located. Originally, as the stack of letters grew, I felt I had done everything I could. I was wrong. Watching JFK changed everything. It was sickening to watch. After all this time, with all the evidence that had to be out there, the real Lee Oswald had been cleverly hidden under mountains of lies! I was outraged. Oliver Stone’s masterpiece sent a clear message. To remain silent was an act of cowardice!24 But I was afraid. Could I overcome my fear? I laid out the evidence saved so many years. It took hours. I retrieved it from behind photos, from inside books nobody liked to read, and from five boxes of albums and papers about my five children. Some of that material existed in mere scraps, kept so I could construct a chronological record of every day I had known Lee. Just looking at it made me tremble. I could be killed for this. At the very least, my children, who knew me as an upright, committed Christian, would learn that (1) I had a love affair with the accused assassin of President Kennedy (2) the mother who so often prayed on her knees had committed adultery only weeks into her marriage with their father. (3) I had been involved in a plot to murder Fidel Castro (4) I had helped develop a deadly biological weapon that was probably still being used to kill people. It was nearly a decade before some of my family forgave me. Some never will. I’d eventually be forced to live overseas due to death threats and to avoid more hospitalizations for actual harm done to me. My reputation, my good name, and my comfortable future as a college professor were demolished. I’d be staring at poverty the rest of my life. But the truth had to be exposed.

To his credit, Pesci evoked some of the energetic essence of my old friend, despite his being too short, with a voice too high. Warren Commission defenders who gripe about the film’s inaccuracies should not be taken seriously. It wasn’t a documentary. It was an eye-opening blockbuster, and the people of America responded by demanding justice for Kennedy. They also wanted to know more about Lee Harvey Oswald. JFK caused such a public uproar that the ARRB (the Assassinations Records Review Board) was created. New laws forced the release of truckloads of evidence that the ARRB’s own Doug Horne organized and brought to the world in his five-volume masterpiece, Inside the ARRB. The new evidence has essentially exonerated Lee, opening doors to conspiracy theories that cannot be closed again. Even so, Dave Ferrie’s personality and his true role in the Kennedy assassination were still hidden by Internet newsgroups fighting to keep him isolated from any association with Lee Oswald. John McAdams and his team of “Davids”– Dave Reitzes, David von Pein, Dave Perry, and David Blackburst (Stephen Roy) – posted a plethora of chatter, half-facts and facts out of context, overwhelming ordinary readers. Sometimes they posed as “fence-sitters,” their writings carefully slanted to convince readers that only Oswald was involved in Kennedy’s murder. Alongside them stand Larry Dunkel (AKA Gary Mack) and his co-conspirators, Dale Myers, Max Holland and Ken Rahn. The media that follow them and others exhibit a herd mentality, repeating their refutable lies without apologies, even after they’re confronted with evidence disproving their statements. The latest approach is to mutter, “Who cares? It was a long time ago!” and “Why does it matter now?” But it does matter now. Terribly. The Coup d’Etat in 1963 took control of an inconvenient two-party system to run its self-protecting corporate agenda, with the CIA, FBI, banking interests and the military-industrial complex cooperating. And when the Supreme Court recently ruled that corporations could, in essence, buy any and all political candidates through “donations,” with no limit on what could be spent to influence votes, the American government became a prostitute whose services were purchased by the highest bidders. In 2014, demonstrations of discontent were being suppressed – sometimes brutally – by heavily armed police.

They began to realize that endless wars, rising taxes, printing dollars with the value of toilet paper, long work hours, reduced benefits, the world’s highest number of prisoners, and the world’s most expensive health care system were the result of the government’s disregard – even disdain – for their welfare. Most people, as always throughout history, will just grit their teeth and soldier on. Many others give up trying to “get ahead” and join the growing ranks of the depressed: eat, drink and take drugs, for tomorrow, we’ll still be poor! But there are a growing number of true patriots (currently that’s a word listed as describing a “potential terrorist” by our own government). These patriots are getting educated. Their eyes are opening. They may be the only hope America has to regain her position as a champion of freedom, “with liberty and justice for all.” David Ferrie’s story has been ignored as much as possible. My friend’s life story is presented by Mr. Roy and his associates as a broken man of questionable sanity in his last days, with no connection to Kennedy’s assassination or to any legitimate cancer research. My friend is said to have died of natural causes. My friend’s death supposedly had no significance or meaning. But just as Me & Lee changed everything for thousands of readers, breaking down the walls of prejudice that once bricked away the real Lee Harvey Oswald from the world, it is my hope that the real David Ferrie will come to life before your eyes. That you will recognize the importance of his amazing and tragic life. Since the real Lee Oswald has been revealed to the world, flowers are beginning to appear on his grave – a grave once reviled and used as a urinal. On Nov. 23-24, 2013, the 50^(th) Anniversary, over 50 people placed flowers or messages on Lee’s grave, and Hy McEnery, a former Marine and Green Beret, now a Chaplain, flew in from New Orleans to give Lee a long-awaited memorial Service, with Robert Groden and myself as speakers. I think it fitting that Lee is, ironically, buried at “Arlington.” As for David Ferrie, his grave at St. Bernard Memorial Gardens in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana is just as humble. He purchased his own grave site, far from his family, who were deeply ashamed of him. Perhaps, after reading this book, Dave’s family will have a better opinion of him. Nevertheless, I will not cover up some sordid facts.

Nevertheless, I will not cover up some sordid facts. Dave stalked and seduced men and teen-aged boys. “I commit mortal sins,” he told me. “Problem is, I don’t give a damn, until afterwards. It’s always afterwards.” Dave’s feeble attempts at self-reform were tragic, not pitiful, because he understood who he was, so he never gave up trying to return to a position of grace with God. But yes, it was always “afterwards.” I don’t remember nearly as much about Dave, after all these years, as I once did, such as precisely what words he said, in contrast to the details I remember about Lee. I was in love with Lee. I knew and believed he gave his life for Kennedy’s sake, so I strove to remember every word he ever said to me, especially because he’d asked me to someday tell his wife and children who he really was. Because Lee became the only accused assassin of Kennedy, I swore not to forget. With Dave, it was different. I avoided thinking about him for years. Then I realized how inextricably linked he was to Lee, and that it was important to review what I could remember. It turned out to be a lot. I was able to reconstruct almost everything. Of course I made some errors, but with time, I’ve been able to construct a good chronology of his life, to share with you. The words to some of our conversations returned to my thoughts, almost as vivid as if yesterday – aided by saved lecture notes and other memorabilia. I had also saved scraps of quotations, some diary entries, a wooden nickel, and other bits and pieces. I, as do quite a few others, have been gifted with what some call a phenomenal memory. I see highly detailed pictures in my mind, reproducing whole days of my life, from my memory banks. 2. The article, below, as is convention, presents both sides of the “Mafia killed JFK” argument, citing government investigation conclusions as why ‘not’ to believe in this scenario, since the government wants the public to believe that only Oswald was involved.

If Lee wasn’t caught, or if evidence mounted of his innocence the Mafia could then be blamed. Today, the press sometimes tends in this direction – the mafia did it all by themselves – rather than turn their eyes to the government’s role. With these considerations in mind, the following quotes are offered: “ … In 1975 and 1976, during the course of congressional investigations of the mob and the CIA, Sam Giancana was gunned down in his kitchen, Jimmy Hoffa “disappeared,” and Las Vegas mobster Johnny Roselli – who had told Jack Anderson that Ruby was ordered to silence Oswald – was dismembered, stuffed into an oil drum, and tossed off the coast of Florida. • In 1992 Frank Ragano, a longtime lawyer for Hoffa and Trafficante, told the New York Post that the two mobsters and Marcello had agreed to kill the president. Ragano claimed that Trafficante said on his deathbed: “Carlos f—ed up. We shouldn’t have gotten rid of Giovanni [John]. We should have killed Bobby.” 6. Edward T. Haslam’s book, Dr. Mary’s Monkey, explains how he discovered that Ochsner’s and Sherman’s search to try to stop an outbreak of cancer, anticipated due to contaminated polio vaccines, ended, instead, with a task to create a deadly cancer with which to kill Castro. TrineDay published the 2nd edition in 2013. 7. Stephen Roy, Ferrie specialist, quotation from Education Forum, 05 April, 2007, 02:40 pm. Roy, who used the pseudonym “David Blackburst” for years, has been writing a book on Ferrie for decades. He has arguably collected more information about Ferrie than anyone else. However, he never met the man. 8. Back to Mr. Roy, who told the public that I refused to meet him. Anybody who ever met me knows I’ll cross oceans to work for Lee Oswald’s exoneration. I offered to fly to his own town. But – as researchers Howard Platzman and Martin Shackelford can verify, “Blackburst” would not disclose to me where he lived. Mr. Roy also told me (and others) that he was entirely neutral concerning Lee Oswald, but this 11/20/2003 article reveals the truth: (emphasis added) “Stephen Roy of Brockton, a former conspiracy theorist … now believes Lee Harvey Oswald may have acted alone … Roy said that after reading books about Ferrie – who was investigated by former New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison for his alleged ties to organized crime and Kennedy assassination plots – he became convinced Ferrie played a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:8:0a4b7ba3fc55", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5358, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "Roy also told me (and others) that he was entirely neutral concerning Lee Oswald, but this 11/20/2003 article reveals the truth: (emphasis added) “Stephen Roy of Brockton, a former conspiracy theorist … now believes Lee Harvey Oswald may have acted alone … Roy said that after reading books about Ferrie – who was investigated by former New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison for his alleged ties to organized crime and Kennedy assassination plots – he became convinced Ferrie played a role.

Roy … interviewed more than 50 of Ferrie’s friends and associates. Most of his interview subjects say Ferrie was not involved in any conspiracies, according to Roy.” “Author A. Steinberg writes in his book Sam Johnson’s Boy (1), “After 1961, Johnson was never observed promoting a Kennedy bill on Capitol Hill, and in private he had complaints about several pieces of legislation and legislative tactics.” Frustrated, JFK was said to have told his wife Jackie on the night of November 21, 1963 that Lyndon Johnson was incapable of telling the truth. (2) But most importantly and crucial to LBJ’s political future was the current Senate investigation of Johnson’s loyal aide and protégé, Bobby Baker … Burkett Van Kirk, minority (Republican) counsel, was convinced that Reynolds’ testimony would lead to Johnson’s loss of the Vice-Presidency, “There is no doubt in my mind that Reynold’s testimony would have gotten Johnson out of the vice presidency.”(6) Evelyn Lincoln held a discussion with the President, on November 19, 1963. She says she was told by JFK that his 1964 running mate would not be Lyndon Johnson.(7) Bobby Kennedy was said to be working secretly with Van Kirk for weeks, through intermediaries, to accumulate evidence of payola against Johnson and Bobby Baker, Johnson’s former Senate aide.

Ciravolo, Jr., of New Orleans. Ciravolo was also a C.A.P. member in 1955 and says he was in the same unit with Oswald and was standing right in front of him in the photo. Ciravolo identified David Ferrie, while former C.A.P. cadet Tony Atzenhoffer, also of New Orleans, identified Oswald and Ferrie in the photograph, and Colin Hammer, who says he served with both men in the C.A.P., also identified both in the photograph.

The executor of Ferrie’s estate, as well as Ferrie’s godson, also picked out Ferrie. “As dramatic as the discovery of this photograph is after thirty years,” says Michael Sullivan, FRONTLINE executive producer for special projects, “The photograph does give much support to the eyewitnesses who say they saw Ferrie and Oswald together in the C.A.P., and it makes Ferrie’s denials that he ever knew Oswald less credible. But it does not prove that the two men were with each other in 1963, nor that they were involved in a conspiracy to kill the president.” http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1028134/posts. 12. Taking Care of Witnesses: Hiding Their Existence from the Public. Mr. Roy was heavily influenced, I believe, by John McAdams, who publishes Roy’s writings through Dave Reitzes. McAdams has always advertised Lee Oswald as Kennedy’s killer. Hiding or discrediting new evidence and new witnesses in the case is common. Debra Conway withheld evidence that I had living witnesses, even though she filmed one of them herself for us, when she attended a conference I held in New Orleans right after New Year’s Day, 2000. Conway withheld a film of one of my witnesses that the TV program Sixty Minutes had requested – a film that belonged to me. She gave up the film only when faced with a lawsuit and only after her attempts to silence my witness (Anna Lewis) had failed. Researcher Martin Shackelford confirmed these facts: he had emails from Anna complaining that Conway pressured her to recant. But Anna had it much worse. She was told that Family Services would be contacted to take her brain-damaged son from her care if she didn’t recant and say she never knew me. Anna was so intimidated that she refused to be filmed again, so Sixty Minutes had no access to her. Nevertheless, Anna refused to recant. Next, Conway revealed Anna’s current name – Anna Vincent – after promising she would not, making it easy to locate her in the small town where she lived. It was no surprise that Anna lost her job. It would be a year and a half before they took her back. I now realized I had to protect my other witnesses from intimidation, so I refused to reveal their locations. I had their permission to use the audio tapes and photos they had already provided. That was enough. 23.

That was enough. 23. Both before and after the filming of the History Channel documentary, “The Love Affair,” in 2003, I was threatened, robbed, and ended up hospitalized due to four auto “accidents.” Twice I reported being harassed by a van that followed me and finally hit me, and once I reported a threat by phone I received at 5 : 30 AM via an early morning email to friends: they told me, “Don’t be paranoid!” So I went on to work. I was struck that night when a black van forced a car against me, and once again I landed in the hospital. For years after I spoke out, my mail was opened, the steel doors of my mailboxes in apartment complexes were ripped off, I received hate mail, and finally, the History Channel began airing (and still does!) an Internet video about Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories where they say I claimed to have helped invent AIDS. I receive death threats from that source alone, but the History Channel has ignored my requests to remove me from that video. Due to such harassment and all the so-called “accidents” I was forced to flee overseas, on crutches. In the end, I was threatened so severely that eventually I applied for political asylum. As a citizen of the US I was told I’d be immediately deported but after Hungary would not take me back (proving I had been threatened there – EU law required political asylum cases to be handled in the first EU country of entry – but I had fled Hungary due to death threats there. I was allowed to stay for over ten and a half months in Sweden with the deportation order suspended. Critics err when they say I was forced to leave. I could have filed two more appeals and gained more time: some appeals are not settled for years). But I left of my own free will without filing an appeal, because by then family and friends obtained places where I could stay safely overseas. I have been living overseas ever since, relying on donations to help with medical and heating bills that my small pension can’t cover. No Medicare is available overseas. 24.

I also realized there were so many lies out there that my son would not be able to adequately defend the book. So I wrote a second book, Comrade Lee – renamed Lee, My Love by my London-based literary agent. It was filled with utter nonsense, but I had heard horror stories about stolen manuscripts in the Kennedy assassination saga. I hoped the teaser book would open a door with honest publishers, at which time I’d show them the evidence and tell them what more was available. My agent, however, wrecked those plans when he erased the electronic links (in bold face) to the real book. A hint of the electronic link security I attempted, to protect the real book, exists on the cover page of the teaser manuscript. After my agent was fired for this and other hi-jinks, such as claiming that I was hiding in Europe (ironically, today I am incognito in Europe!) , I was grateful when Dr. Howard Platzman, using my emails, tried to write a version that would take the place of the teaser book (Deadly Alliance). As I was correcting that book due to its numerous errors, since Platzman lived in New Jersey and I was living in Dallas, Platzman gave a partially corrected copy of the manuscript to a researcher posing as our friend – Debra Conway. Deadly Alliance was never fully corrected for errors or completed, but it has been used by McAdams, Conway and David Lifton to try to claim I changed my story where certain details now differ from Me & Lee, even though my own pages of that manuscript carry massive corrections, of which Conway was aware, since a few of the pages she had copied were also marked, sometimes entirely filling the margins. A two-volume book published in 2005 on my birthday, without my knowledge, by Harrison E. Livingstone, constituted most of the original manuscript I’d written for my son via a stack of letters, with much supporting evidence and speculations from outside sources added. Because Livingstone would not allow me to view his final edit of that book, I stopped its publication. I estimate that only 80 copies of the book published by Livingstone were ever printed. I cannot again write of all that I went through. It is in my book, Me & Lee. In my depression and shock, I kept no initial records of those last efforts of my friend to guide and protect me.

In this book, I’ll describe Dave’s first phone call to me after Lee was arrested later, but here, I wish to elaborate on what was probably his third call, because it shows how closely David Ferrie, Lee Oswald and I interacted with each other and those around us. As always at PenChem, it was my job to close the lab down. It was after 5:00, but I was still busy trying to make up for my poor work that day. And yesterday. Lee had been killed just two days ago. Seeing him die had plunged me into a darkness from which I was only now emerging. I literally cannot recall how I had survived the past 48 hours. My last coherent memory was screaming and vomiting when I saw Lee murdered. Only now – two days later – did I begin to see my own hands in front of my face. Dave wasn’t talking about his New Orleans public library card. He had ceased to use that card, since he had an extensive private library of his own and had been borrowing only from medical and legal libraries for the past few years. Dave had to be talking about the special library card he used to get into Tulane’s medical library. Busy himself, now, on so many fronts, Dave had given the card to me to use, until I would be issued my own in the fall, as a student at Tulane Medical School. Dave’s card had been issued by the Ochsner Clinic for his use at Tulane, and for any “associates” he might place on a list. The card only carried a number, but a call to Ochsner Clinic would reveal my name and any other name that Dave or Ochsner had ever listed as an “associate.” We could all be exposed! The Project could be exposed! I was no longer using Dave’s card regularly – that’s how the problem started. On one occasion, when I met Lee at Palmer Park, we had played a game of chess, which we were forced to resume later at Thompson’s Restaurant. But I arrived at Thompson’s first, carrying medical journals that needed to be returned to Tulane’s medical library. There, David Lewis, who also played chess, challenged me to a game. I had wanted to try out a new strategy to clobber Lee, so I told David we could resume the game Lee and I had started, to see how he would do.

I had wanted to try out a new strategy to clobber Lee, so I told David we could resume the game Lee and I had started, to see how he would do. At the same time, I could test my new strategy, to see if it would defeat David. When Lee arrived, I was about to wallop David Lewis, who was protesting that he had started one pawn down. Because David wanted to play a second game from scratch, I asked Lee if he would go on ahead to Tulane and return the medical journals for me. I’d join him there as soon as I finished walloping Dave again. Laughing, Lee agreed (he was in a merry mood, seeing David sweating over the game). “Here’s Dave’s library card,” I told Lee, handing him the medical library card and the journals. “I want you to keep it from now on.” By then, I had been at Tulane’s Medical library so many times that all I had to do was sign the card’s number, which I knew by heart, to check out anything from the stacks. Nobody asked to look at the card anymore. If Lee kept the card, he could hand in journals and books for me anytime. But later, when I met him at Tulane’s library, Lee handed the card back. He then took on the voice of The Scarlet Pimpernel. “Good Gawd, Lady Blakeney!” he drawled, “I’m demned stupid about all that medical stuff, you know. Why, I can scarcely tie my own cravat! So I shan’t be seen in the medical library very often.” As Lee and I laughed, we agreed that we should only meet in the music listening rooms at Tulane’s main library. All of this came to me in an instant. And with the memory of Lee’s laugh, I could not keep my voice steady. Almost gagged by my emotions, I managed to tell Dave what had happened. After a pause, as it all sank in, Dave simply exploded. “That idiot, David Lewis!” Dave fumed, “That blundering fool! So he was there! He was there when you gave Lee that card. ‘Here’s Dave’s library card, honey!” he mocked. “He doesn’t need it back! And so you drooled, to your One and Only – and gave me a nervous breakdown!” In this terrible call, Dave began by bursting in tears, insisting that Jack Ruby never wanted to shoot Lee.

He was forced to, Dave said, “or they would have cut off every protruding part of his body and fed it to his own dogs.” Dave tried to comfort me then, for I was shaking all over. When we both had better control of ourselves, Dave was intent on convincing me that Jack’s shooting Lee was almost a mercy killing, because of what his captors and the CIA intended to do to him to get him to talk. Dave went to such lengths trying to excuse Ruby, I now know, because he thought I knew him. I did, but I didn’t know it. I’d met him not once but twice. He obviously liked Lee, and had known him since he was a boy. But neither Lee nor Dave had ever told me that Jack Ruby and Sparky Rubenstein were the same person. Next, Dave told me to brace myself, because he had found out details about what had happened to Lee when he was in custody. Dave said Lee was “given CPR – Dallas Police style.” Lee‘s chest had been pumped up and down – after the gunshot wound! Then they struck blows against his side, where the bullet had entered, to try to get him to confess, and to make certain he would bleed to death. Dave then told me more. He had found out details about what had happened to Lee when he was in custody. Cuts, a huge bruise under his arm … bruises on his back. Some came from his beating in the Texas Theater. Others came later. Dave was an expert at analyzing autopsies. He knew Lee had been tortured. “I can’t talk to you again, J,” Dave said. “You know that. You know why. But I think one day you will turn to God again. And if you do, pray for me. I never had a child,” he said, rather sadly. “My brother – I always wanted to be like my brother. That’s why I wanted to be a fighter pilot. And look at all the kids he has. What I would have done –” Dave’s voice cracked with emotion, “God, what I would have done to have his life! In some ways, J,” he said, “You’ve been my little girl. Don’t laugh.” “Now, J,” said Dave, “listen up. For all of our own good, we must never, ever, speak to each other again.

Think only of yourself. That’s going to go down real well if Lee’s looking down now at you, from heaven, counting on you to stay alive. Damn it!” he said, and I heard his hand smack against something hard, as he cursed. “Ochsner’s kicked me out of whatever he’s put Mary to work on, and she’s being told to stay away from me, or else. So now it’s up to you, J. You’ve gotta be that vanilla girl. Act as normal as you can. Don’t get your name in the papers. Don’t!” “I don’t believe in love anymore,” he said, “but maybe I have to re-evaluate, after seeing you two. That’s why I called,” he told me. “Lee would have wanted me to. Now, throw away the Call Wheel,” he said. “It’s had its last tick-tock. Bye, J.” Then Dave hung up. My extraordinary life in this incredible underground world was over. March 28, 1918: David William Ferrie is born in Cleveland, Ohio, into a respectable Scotch-Irish family. David’s parents were James Howard Ferrie (born 1890), and Burdette Couts Goldrick. James serves 23 years with the Cleveland Police department, rises to the rank of Captain, and becomes Chief Detective, with a law degree. 1931: Unsuccessful in an attempt to implicate the priest at St. Patrick’s in immoral conduct, David told me he was labeled a liar. He consequently dropped out of school, suffering from his first bout of alopecia and depression. He could not get out of bed. His father later wrote a letter2 stating that his ailing son was treated with ultraviolet radiation and quartz light treatments for alopecia, which were not useful for that condition. David’s thyroid may have been undergoing radiation treatment instead, since a thyroid condition is also mentioned (the father could have mixed up what the treatments were for). Police Captain James H. Ferrie of the Cleveland Police Force and father of David Ferrie, ’39 has donated an altar for the Students Sodality Chapel at Carroll. The altar, which is strictly liturgical, is in solid black with chrome finishings. The top is of solid mahogany and weighs approximately one hundred and fifty pounds. The altar stone which is sunk in the top is one of those used at the Congress and was procured especially for the Chapel.

Behind the altar there will hang a huge curtain on which will be suspended a large crucifix.3 Comments, below, by Stephen Roy, posted to The Education Forum on Jan. 19, 2005,4 and again in his article on David Ferrie’s life on April 29, 2011 (unchanged) represent his summary of David’s experiences at John Carroll University, constituting almost the only exposure the public has had to David’s experience at John Carroll U. Stephen Roy: Ferrie’s first higher-education experience was at John Carroll University, a Jesuit institution. He was involved in the Glee Club and school newspaper, and again excelled at debate. But the school forced him to repeat a year due to certain emotional issues. They wrote: “Industrious and ambitious. Is somewhat socially immature. Is an enthusiast, wants attention and distinction. Wholly lacking in common sense; hard to direct or control.”5 (p. 1) “Dean Bracken Gives Medal” When the finals of the Freshman Oratorical Contest were held today … the winner was selected by decision of the entire student body…. The contestants, … were: David Ferrie, “A Great American;” Paul Cassidy, “The American Merchant Marine;” Mark Blinn, “An Appeal to Arms;” Richard White, ‘’Politics in College;” and Carl Burlage… Oct. 9, 1936: David Ferrie is put in charge of a debate contest. On this date, the newspaper (Vol. VXII) praises Ferrie’s debate team, saying, “On October 9, 1936, this organization held a banquet at Kent State University…. David Ferrie has been placed in charge of the [March 20] contest…. This endeavor by the Carroll Oratorical Society climaxes a brilliant season of debating by members of that society. Successful in home debates, undefeated on a tour of midwest universities, and now ready to play host to the most active debating organization in the country, it is fitting that Carroll students doff their hats to this smoothly functioning forensic group.” March 10, 1937: David remains in charge of debate activities. In his sophomore year, David is in charge of arranging the university’s debate tournament, as reported by The Carroll News: 8 “Carroll to Play Host to Northeast Ohio Debate Tournament….When the members of the Northeastern Ohio Debate conference meet on the Carroll campus on Saturday, March 20, more than fifteen Ohio universities will enter representatives in the annual debate tournament.

The Carroll News, Vol. 17, No. 11, p. 2: David is a committee member of the Glee Club, in charge of obtaining patrons (advertising support). On p. 3, David is also listed as a “veteran” contender who must write his own five-minute oration and present it for the annual Oratorical Medal.9 March 30, 1938: David continues to be active in debating and public speaking. The Carroll News, Vol. 18, No. 10: “David Ferrie remains active as of this date in the Carroll Oratorical Society and is expected to participate in debate tournaments. “It is presumed that the following students , active during the year, in debating and public speaking, will enter: Blinn, Burlage, Corrigan, Cosgrove, Deal, DeFranco, Dinmone, Ferrie, Fogarty, Fornes, McCaffrey, McGannon, McManus, Nichols, Osborne, Rambousek, James Smith, and Victory.”13 March, 1938: David is appointed by his class president to head an important, historic committee for the university (p. 3, Vol. 18, No. 10): “For several years various persons have asked if there was any memorial to the patron of the school on the premises … there was [nothing] about John Carroll save an unreliable painting…. Mr. James Wilson, President of the Class of ’39 appointed a committee headed by Mr. David W. Ferrie, with the following members: Philip Lawton, Gene Kirby, Paul Seliskar….

He was asked to leave the seminary. The stress and depression once again caused an occurrence of hair loss.

He was assigned to student-teach at Rocky River High School,19 but he still felt a calling to the priesthood. He applied for admission to the Society of the Precious Blood at St. Charles Seminary in Carthagena. The war was heating up, and his correspondence indicates that he asked for a hurry-up admission to avoid the draft, while his younger brother enlisted. Edward T. Haslam: Frances McKee, supervisor, said at that time, “His interest in teaching students is very closely tied up with his religious faith.” When questioned years later … she was less charitable … he was “the poorest teacher they ever had” [and was] “tricky, a bluffer, shrewd, and probably a liar.” She added that she received “complaints about his psychoanalyzing his students.” … [but she never had] “complaints involving moral problems.” HSCA: David Ferrie received his BA degree in Philosophy from Baldwin-Wallace with high grades, as indicated by these HSCA references: (24) pp. 18-19, FAA, vol. III, exhibit. (25) Ibid., FAA, vol. III. exhibit, transcript of grades from Baldwin-Wallace College, Berea, Ohio, June 9, 1941 ; lists all courses… Johnson … seeing the potential for light aircraft to be used by saboteurs … took it upon himself to prove how vulnerable the nation was. Johnson took off in his own aircraft from his farm airstrip near Cleveland, Ohio, taking three small sandbags with him. Flying at 500 feet (150m) , Johnson dropped a sandbag on each of three war plants and then returned to his airstrip. The next morning he notified the factory owners that he had “bombed” their facilities. The CAA apparently got Johnson’s message and grounded all civil aviation until better security measures could be taken. Not surprisingly, the Civil Air Patrol’s initial membership increased along with the new security.21 1941-1944: David lives in “a Society of Apostolic Life.” Members revere “The Precious Blood of Jesus,” dedicate themselves to a study of scriptures and academic subjects, and serve the poor, living a life of poverty while practicing good works. For three years, David leads a strict, abstemious, Spartan lifestyle in a dedicated and sincere effort to become a permanent member, and then a priest.

October 30, 1942: Parmely enlists in the Army Air Corp on his 18^(th) birthday and trains as a pilot. He will become a war hero. [Obituary, Jan. 1, 2013]: “Lt. Ferrie flew the B-24 Liberator in the European Theater for the duration of WWII. He baled [sic] out during one mission and sent his parachute home to Cleveland to his fiancé, Rosemary Catherine Egan, who had it made into her wedding dress.” David’s father, James, had written to St. Charles mentioning his son’s medical problems, including a hypothyroid condition, which can cause emotional problems.23 Later in life there is little doubt that David suffered from a hyperthyroid condition, as evidenced by “bug eyes” – exophthalmia. He also had high blood pressure, as reported by Dr. Richard Bagnetto, his physician in New Orleans. High blood pressure is a side effect of a hyperthyroid condition, and the exophthalmia and autopsy report 24 suggest David suffered from a relatively rare auto-immune disorder of the thyroid. If so, he likely tried to balance his thyroid swings with a thyroid hormone, such as Proloid, to feel better. This disorder, combined with the alopecia problem, could have influenced David’s emotions. Rev. Francis B. Sullivan, “… professor of theology at St. Charles Seminary (Sullivan was David’s philosophy professor) feels Ferrie to be a preconditioned psycho, impresses people by pretending to be an expert on everything, definitely has a talent for character assassination….” (citation from p. 115, HSCA Vol. X part XII).25 The “character assassination” reference might have been related to David’s telling me that he was sexually assaulted by an important priest at St Charles. If Dave had attempted to report the deed to higher-ups, this is where the accusation of “character assassination” might have originated. The priest was highly regarded, and exhibited great piety, to the extent that Dave tried to convince himself that this priest must still retain a high standing in the eyes of God. This fit Dave’s “antinomian” code that faith and good intentions can save one, despite personal sins that recur after the sinner’s best efforts to stop. David will follow his “antinomian” code throughout the rest of his life. This could explain the true reason for David’s expulsion and the true reason for his consequent nervous breakdown.26 David described his years in seminaries like this: “My great hope was destroyed in a desert filled with narrow minds.” His expulsions, he said, were the culmination of a series of inhumane punishments to “break” his spirit to full conformity. Upon being questioned, Dave bitterly described incidents at St. Charles, where 1944: This is when David’s father, wrote to Fr. Rohling, rector of St. Charles Seminary, in his son’s defense.

The letter, obtained in 1961 by the FAA in its court case against David, mentions David’s alopecia problem, and David’s thyroid problems are also mentioned. Proloid, used to treat hypothyroidism, was reported by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison to be among Ferrie’s effects at his death (Garrison: On the Trail of the Assassins). Nov. 27, 1944: David is told to leave St. Charles. Denied Perpetual Membership in the Society before the end of 1943, David reacts with shock to the order to leave the society. In his mind, he believes he has successfully met the relentless demands of a seminary life.27, 28 David will retain his priestly robes, keeping them wherever he goes, the rest of his life.29 Stephen Roy: Among other things, he had engaged in a “doctrinal dispute” with others at the seminary and actually caused a split amongst faculty and staff. When he was declined Perpetual Membership in the Society in late 1943, he had a nervous breakdown and was ordered to seek psychiatric help. By late 1944, he was again forced out, and suffered a full breakdown. 5.

Ferrie’s autopsy also revealed nodules in his thyroid: “The thyroid gland is nodular on both sides and weighs 35 grams. There is one large nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid measuring 1 cm in diameter. It is firm and gray-white in color and appears poorly encapsulated.” Online Ref: http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/ ferrie_autopsy.htm “The thyroid gland has a right lobe and a left lobe connected by a narrow isthmus. The normal weight of the thyroid is 10 to 30 grams.” Endocrine Pathology. See Appendix to view Ferrie’s autopsy. http://library.med.utah. edu/WebPath/ENDOHTML/ENDO015.html. Ferrie’s autopsy revealed nodules on an enlarged thyroid – as found in Graves-Hashimoto thyroiditis. Thus, Ferrie could have experienced bouts of hypo-and-hyperthyroidism creating exophthalmia and high blood pressure. He may have decided to self-medicate, using varying doses of thyroid hormones, depending on his symptoms, which would indicate to him where he was in recurring cycles of hypo-and-hyper thyroid states. 26. A recent list of sexually abusive priests in the Cleveland Diocese includes one from the 1960’s; surely hundreds of abused persons never spoke up. Some priests in this group committed suicide after their misconduct was revealed. http://bishop-accountability.org/priestdb/PriestDBbylastName-L.html (Accessed 1/29/2014). 27. Ferrie’s regimen in both seminaries would have been rigorous and challenging, as this Catholic Encyclopedia article explains: “The ordinary working day is divided between prayer, study, and recreation. Summer and winter, the student rises at 5 or 5.30 AM ., makes his meditation for a half-hour, hears Mass, and usually receives Communion. Breakfast is about two hours after rising. In the forenoon there are two classes of one hour each, while two hours also are devoted to private study. After dinner, there is about an hour of recreation. In the afternoon four hours are divided between class and study, and as a rule another hour of study follows supper. A visit to the Blessed Sacrament, the recitation of the Rosary, and spiritual reading take place in the afternoon or evening; and the day closes with night prayer. Thus the student has devoted about three hours to exercises of piety and nine hours to work. After six years of this mental and moral training in retirement from the world, and in the society of fellow students animated by the same purpose and striving after the same ideals, he is deemed worthy of receiving the honor and capable of bearing the burden of the priesthood:", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:22:9f829a2ee276", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5372, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "take place in the afternoon or evening; and the day closes with night prayer.

FAA, vol. 4, Robey report, p. 10, interview of Col. Joseph G. Ehrlicher: “resented authority”(19) Ibid.and SR-1-N-224, November 19, 1962, FAA, vol. 2, interview of George Piazza, who told investigators “Ferrie is the type of individual who fancies himself an expert in all matters and, hence, believes himself infallible. To this end Ferric would express his philosophical ideas in no uncertain terms.” Stephen Roy: Ferrie … developed a fascination with psychiatry (and in 1946, a fascination with hypnosis.) His depression cannot have been helped by the fact that, while he dodged the draft, his younger brother had been shot down over France and parachuted to safety and was honored in the Cleveland VE-day parade. Mr. Roy is not being very charitable. First, there is no evidence that Dave’s “depression cannot have been helped” because Parmely became a hero. Dave spoke of his brother with pride, even in 1963, after Parmely had ceased to have anything to do with him. Second, Mr. Roy says Dave “dodged the draft.” But Dave’s sincere efforts to become a priest were followed by a deep depression requiring psychiatric intervention. This condition rendered him $\\ \" 4 \\mathrm { - } \\mathrm { F ^ { \\prime \\prime } \\mathrm { - } }$ unfit for military duty. From this organization Ferrie helped develop astronauts James Lovell and Neil Armstrong. Lovell was from Cleveland and Armstrong took his first flight in Warren, Ohio, from the same airfield used by Ferrie. This same field by the way was also used by Ernie Hall, one of the first to solo after the Wright Bros. Eddie Rickenbacker, highly impressed with the effort of Ferrie in Ohio, was from Akron, which was part of the, Cleveland, Warren, Akron triangle, which plays a major role in other aspects of the death of JFK.2 Stephen Roy: Col. Harry A. Webb of the Cleveland CAP and others found reasons to disparage him, [but] Naatz ascribed their disapproval to jealousy. Meanwhile, Ferrie, determined to become a commercial pilot, obtained a pilot’s license, possibly taking advantage of the greatly reduced fee system then offered by the CAP.

Minimizing David Ferrie’s Intellectual Achievements istory, as the cliché goes, is written by the victors. David Ferrie H(as happened also to Lee Oswald) has suffered from a minimizing of his good points, with an exaggeration of the bad, in government reports. Example: The HSCA stated that David Ferrie’s education was “not extensive” though he was considered “intelligent, even brilliant.”3 (Former FBI agent) William W. Turner: In the late 1940s and early 1950s he flew light planes commercially in the Cleveland, Ohio area, and was rated by his colleagues as an outstanding pilot. In the middle 1950s there is an untraceable gap in his career. Then he turns up as an Eastern Air Lines pilot. Although he supposedly obtained an instrument rating at the Sunnyside Flying School in Tampa, Florida, there is no record that any such school ever existed.8 Stephen Roy: By December, he was living in Tampa and experiencing signs of instability.9 He claimed to be married with two dependents, but he was actually single and living out of the YMCA on Zack Street. There is an unconfirmed report that Ferrie, who had been under psychoanalysis since 1944, suffered a nervous breakdown while in Florida. Mr. Roy fails to mention who said David was “experiencing [sic] signs of instability” in Tampa. If David had two “nervous breakdowns” in 1948, one must ask, when? In 1948, David acquired the respect and admiration of Jean Helen Naatz, who described David as an excellent pilot, and in July, was certified to fly multi-engine planes. Mr. Roy says David was then flying “on a regular basis” for Jeda Oil. How did he do that with a nervous breakdown? “The definition of a nervous breakdown is to describe an illness that is so severe that it renders someone unable to participate in their own life.”10 Mr. Roy reports that the other “nervous breakdown” occurred in December 1948, based on an “unconfirmed report.” We need more facts before assigning two nervous breakdowns to David Ferrie in a single year filled with both accomplishments and scandalous behavior. As for the false information David gave, he probably wanted to hide what had happened in Cleveland. 1949: HSCA: “In 1949, Ferrie left the Cleveland area after rumors, that he had taken several young boys to a house of prostitution, circulated through his neighborhood. Although Ferrie’s exact movements are not known, it appears he had gone to Tampa, Fla., where he received his instrument rating at Sunnyside Flying School.” Edward T.

Although Ferrie’s exact movements are not known, it appears he had gone to Tampa, Fla., where he received his instrument rating at Sunnyside Flying School.” Edward T. Haslam: In the first case, he appropriated a squadron airplane which had been grounded by the US Air Force and flew it, after dark and without landing lights, from Columbus to Cleveland. Identifying himself as a lieutenant in the US Air force during the incident got him into even more hot water. The CAP commander [Col. Harry A. Webb] tried to have Ferrie dismissed from the CAP, but the paperwork was “lost.” So, Ferrie was still on their books in 1950, when two CAP cadets signed papers reporting that Ferrie, their instructor, had taken them to a house of prostitution in a nearby town.12 (The so-called “missing” five months)The Kefauver Committee was created May 3, 1950. Organized to form the commission, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover did his best to shut it down. Since I had lived in nearby St. Petersburg just a few years after Dave had lived in Tampa, he felt comfortable talking to me about Tampa’s Mafia, where Trafficante held absolute power. The city leaders knew it, but were “paid off,” according to Dave. At one point, Dave worked with an insurance examiner who was quietly looking into Mafia activities there, because a big-shot Mafia honcho, Jimmy Velasco, had been murdered. His killer was going on trial. Hillsborough County’s corruption was getting exposed, and the Kefauver Committee could no longer ignore it. David said he was working with someone in Tampa who said Cleveland was going to be one of the cities targeted for hearings.14 of his head. Jimmy was the main political liaison for the mob, as well as a gambling figure. He made regular payoffs to Sheriff Hugh Culbreath and then-Mayor Curtis Hixon. Underworld figure Joe Provenzano was tried for Velasco’s murder. He was acquitted on April 1, 1949. The murder remains unsolved.”16 In Tampa, David learned how to conduct an investigation, for an insurance company. But he also learned how organized crime worked. Hired as an insurance examiner trainee, as a means to pay for more flying lessons, Dave was mentored by an insurance examiner who also collected information against organized crime in Tampa. This information was used in the trial of Joe Provenzano, the murderer of Tampa gang leader Jimmy Velasco. While David had mentioned his need for psychiatric intervention – the topic came up as we discussed our problems with religion (due to his encounters with abusive priests) – he said his life in Tampa ignited his", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:25:f0e47e098512", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5375, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 26, "text": "as a means to pay for more flying lessons, Dave was mentored by an insurance examiner who also collected information against organized crime in Tampa.

David told me, “Sacred Heart [church] was filled with Mafia families.”17 He hadn’t planned to return to Cleveland for a long time, but Dave changed his mind after Velasco’s murder trial concluded on April Fool’s Day with an acquittal, due to a rigged jury.18 Dave now feared for his and his family’s safety, as well as for his father’s health, and returned to Cleveland. But now he was hooked: David soon obtained work as an insurance examiner in Cleveland. James Olmstead: [Ferrie] joined the USAR in 1950, served at Fort Hayes in Columbus, Ohio and/or Cleveland MI unit … I don’t think DWF tried to enlist during WWII, I think he was helping form CAP security considerations for Ohio airstrips. Cleveland was the starting point for CAP security operations prior to WWII, I believe that some of the pilots in the area recruited DWF. I have access to most of the 1940-1960 Ohio airstrips … every chance I get I stop to look at old logs and talk to some of the “old” aces or those that remember them. Ohio had about 17 WWI Aces. May 21, 1951: Eastern Air Lines receives Retail Credit Co.’s background, financial and character report on David Ferrie, with supplementary information going back to 1939. When Airline officials realize that Ferrie obscured his true background, they seriously consider firing him, but reports of his flying ability and good behavior make them change their minds. HSCA: The New Orleans branch was advised to keep Ferrie only until a replacement could be found and a “close watch” on Ferrie’s progress was recommended. Initial reports, however, were favorable. Ferrie was considered by his fellow pilots to be doing a good job, although he was “odd” at times. Eastern decided to retain him. 1952: Dr. Mary Stults Sherman arrives at Ochsner Clinic to become the head of the Clinic’s Bone Cancer Laboratory. She will forge a strong relationship with Dr. Alton Ochsner, the Clinic’s esteemed founder. Ochsner is a lung and heart surgeon with expertise in lung cancer. He works with many children paralyzed by polio who are now consigned to life in 1952 CAP Annual Report: “High on the list of special activities held each year for CAP cadets are the summer encampments at Air Force bases.

During the vacation months of 1952 42 cadet encampments were conducted at 39 bases. All 52 wings, with the exception of Louisiana, which was in the grip of a polio epidemic, engaged in encampment activities. Fifteen days long, the encampments supplied cadets with special academic and vocational training. Quarters, food, med- Here is where we learn that the CAP had summer encampment activities (the fifteen days would change to nine days). Cadets from New Orleans usually attended. The cadets were supposed to be members for 90 days before attending an encampment, but complaints that local leaders did as they pleased created a change in rules by 1956. This needs to be kept in mind when we try to estimate how long Lee Harvey Oswald was exposed to David Ferrie’s influence in the summer of 1955. HSCA: Ferrie approached his job enthusiastically, devoting his own time to talking at schools and clubs to promote interest in aviation and travel in the Southwest area. In 1953, the president of Eastern wrote him a letter personally commending Ferrie’s efforts on behalf of the company. This early record of dedication and competence may have accounted for Ferrie’s longevity as an Eastern Airlines captain. But there is a notation on the file copy of Rickenbacker’s letter to David that indicates Rickenbacker’s praise did not primarily concern David’s sales potential. The letter, “E.V. Rickenbacker to D. W. Ferrie, May 23, 1953,” includes a mysteriously worded recommendation that Rickenbacker wrote onto the file copy: Bob Heath was a very good politician … and we had 120 pa− tients, 60 male and 60 female … not been treated by anyone, just warehoused before they came onto our unit. East Louisiana State Hospital was out in the woods, totally isolated, about 115 miles from New Orleans…. I used to go there twice a week and it took me about two and a half hours each way, five hours of travel… Dr. Robert Heath … was a charismatic man … very impressive, a tall good-looking man … Time magazine … called him the Gregory Peck of psychiatry … Dr. Heath … asked me to start interviewing some of his patients with subcortical electrodes.

The 1954 CAP Handbook says: “… flight scholarships [can] entitle them to take actual flying instruction from local airport operators…. The Air Force is aware of the tremendous importance of an aviation-minded youth and is cooperating with the Civil Air Patrol to promote its cadet units.” HSCA: (A)fter one of the Cadets he was training died in a plane crash in December, 1954, Wing Commander Joe Ehrlicher refused to file Ferrie’s request to renew his position as Commander, owing to public concerns about the incident. In April 1955, Ferrie learned that his application for 1955 had not been filed and was thus not renewed…. Unable to return to Lakefront, Ferrie was out of the CAP (Lakefront) for only two months before obtaining a request to serve as a summer session lecturer and aerospace trainer at the Moisant Airport CAP squadron.30 Stephen Roy: When Ferrie went to Moisant June-August 1955, he added another dimension: rigorous academic standards in science, meteorology and aeronautics, and as one cadet told me, “He owned his own plane and would teach us how to fly,” even though Ferrie did not get a flying instructor’s ticket until 1955.32 April 26, 1955: Ochsner, who owns stock in Cutter Laboratories (one of several companies the U.S. government licensed to produce polio vaccine), publicly inoculates his grandchildren on this date to prove the safety of the new polio vaccine. Tragically, the next day, April 27, California banned the vaccine when several children contracted polio after receiving it. 4. “In 1940, about one-quarter of U.S. males completed four years of high school, with the majority of males quitting school before attaining their high school diploma.” Ref: “U.S. Education Attainment from 1940-2008 | http://www.realonlinedegrees.com/us-education-attainment-from-1940-2008/#ixzz1NH4GWmyf. 6.

Purely by accident, David, Lee Oswald and I were discussing Ian Fleming’s Live and Let Die – Flemings’ second James Bond novel, when David told us that Tampa’s Mound Park Hospital was mentioned in Fleming’s book. He had that kind of esoteric knowledge. Dave then talked about Tampa, and, a little later, about the Kefauver Commission. 17. Sacred Heart’s popularity with Mafia families is still understood today.

Atzenhoffer stated that he believes that Ferrie was in fact instructing the Moisant CAP unit at the time that Oswald was a member…. Oswald was very quiet and was mainly friendly with Ed Voebel, who Atzenhoffer also knew. Ferrie was always around the unit during those days.” Atzenhoffer also stated that the “experiments” that Ferrie tried to recruit CAP cadets for were supposedly to be conducted by the Medical School of Tulane University. 31. Tom Rozoff personally photographed Ferrie’s Stinson (now painted red, and in excellent condition) after it was located by researcher Stephen Roy in 2007. As of 2013, the Stinson is owned by LOMPOC, a pilot training and plane rental company in California. http://www.flylompoc.com/Fleet/ (Retrieved June 15, 2013). gnoring or marginalizing witness reports and interviews, Wikipedia, Dave Reitzes (with John McAdams), Stephen Roy (with IDave Reitzes), Gerald Posner, Vincent Bugliosi, along with official government sites, have minimized the possible number of contacts between David Ferrie and Lee Harvey Oswald in 1955.1 Wikipedia: After a Ferrie-trained cadet pilot perished in a December 1954 crash, Ferrie’s annual re-appointment was declined. He was asked to be a guest aerospace education instructor at a smaller squadron at Moisant Airport, and lectured there from June to September 1955.2 On July 27, 1955, 15-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald joined this squadron.3 But Lee had attended a number of meetings at Moisant before he decided to join. Previous to that, Lee attended numerous CAP meetings at Lakefront, then quit. At that time, he might have had his fight with David Ferrie (chronicled in Me : ℰ : Lee) ) – it could have been later, when he attended CAP meetings at the Moisant Squadron. We know that Lee went through basic training for Cadets, which requires attendance at a number of meetings, because we have a photo of him in his Cadet uniform.5 Jerry Paradis (CAP member and officer), HSCA interview (excerpted, edited for spelling): …Paradis…stated that, “Oswald and Ferrie were in the unit together.

I’m not saying that they may have been there together, I’m saying it is a certainty.” Paradis stated that he liked Oswald, but that he was quiet…. He said: “I really only talked about flying with Lee…. I can’t say how many times he came to the meetings, but he was there quite a few times … at least ten or fifteen meetings.” Paradis stated that David Ferrie was present at all of these meetings, saying Ferrie never missed coming “and was always there…. Ferrie was a fairly stern, but generally likable guy … these meetings with Ferrie and Oswald at the CAP occurred at New Orleans Lakefront Airport…. Ferrie and some of the others occasionally went to Moisant airport. He stated that Ferrie later left the Lakefront airport and worked only at Moisant with the CAP. He stated that the unit used to meet twice a week, on Friday nights and on Sunday afternoons.”6 The photo of Ferrie and Oswald together was taken Aug. 7, 1955 at Abita Springs, LA.7 Many such bivouacs lasted all weekend.8 Held at Abita Springs, the event was located almost 65 miles from Moisant, as the Pontchartrain Causeway was still under construction. The photo shows five cadets wearing only t-shirts. All the cadets look dirty and sweaty. It has never been asked if Oswald might have journeyed to and/or from New Orleans in the same car as Ferrie. Stephen Roy: In June 1955, Ferrie was approached by the Commander of the smaller (15-20 cadets) Moisant Airport CAP squadron to lecture the boys. On July 27, Lee Harvey Oswald joined the squadron…. Oswald apparently only stayed a month or two, and Ferrie didn’t stay much longer, becoming peeved at having a girls’ CAP group as part of the squadron. One cannot read too much into such an encounter with a 15-year old Oswald, eight years before the assassination… Stephen Roy: … nearly everyone remembers a mesmerizing quality about him: He was very bright, well-spoken and funny, he could make complicated things understandable and he was like a buddy who showed great interest in the cadets. And Oswald probably wanted to be in a military-type situation like his brothers. His mother indicated that he leaned heavily in that direction.

Something big must have stopped Lee from attending after only “a month or two.” Lee told me,with Dave present, that it was David Ferrie’s physical assault that drove him out of the CAP. (However, Dave didn’t sexually assault him.) By 1963, the two men had become friends. How, I don’t know. Lee described a house that did not resemble the one-story Vinet St. apartment. It was a much larger house, and Dave didn’t live on Vinet St. until 1956. After Lee moved to Fort Worth in July 1956, he ceased to attend CAP meetings. The 1956 CAP Annual Report complained that, “While a three-phase training program existed prior to 1956 … it left the criteria for advancement up to local unit commanders. The result was a program almost totally without standardization. Only the criteria for the award of the CAP Certificate of Proficiency were standardized – completion of the National Examination and attendance at one summer encampment at an Air Force base.”13 Oswald (the mid-1950s), despite contrary witness testimony. Shortly after the publication of Posner’s book, however, the PBS news program “Frontline” located two photographs showing Ferrie and Oswald together at a CAP barbecue…one, shown on the program “Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald?” has since been widely published.16 Nevertheless, Frontline trotted Posner out again twenty years later, for a repeat performance. In November, 2013 almost all of the TV specials called Lee Oswald “the assassin” instead of “accused assassin” – often repeating obsolete and discredited information. Only the Travel Channel refrained in one of its two programs on the subject. As we approach the Kennedy assassination in our timeline, and surge on to the Garrison investigation and David Ferrie’s death, disinformation begins to plague the record. David himself planted false notions and ideas to mask his true activities. His murder has been called a “natural death” by Gerald Posner, Stephen Roy, John McAdams, and others who support the lone gunman verdict. Indeed, researchers who only had access to redacted versions of his life might conclude that David Ferrie’s demise was simply another amazing coincidence – like so many others that riddle the Kennedy assassination mystery. 1. In 1998, Roy/Blackburst still minimized Lee’s connection with David Ferrie by making it seem Lee’s only contact was “in early August’ and that Dave was “a volunteer trainer only June-August 1955.” For example: Subject: Re: Live by the Sword Date: 1998/12/12 Author: Blackburst … it is a fact that Ferrie", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:32:e8c53a3d8ee6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5382, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 33, "text": "access to redacted versions of his life might conclude that David Ferrie’s demise was simply another amazing coincidence – like so many others that riddle the Kennedy assassination mystery. 1.

Hamer knew both Oswald and Voebel and said: “[Oswald began attending] CAP meetings sometime around the summer of 1955. He stated that the 10 or 12 meetings that Oswald attended were held at the Eastern Airlines hangar at Moisant Airport…. Hamer commented that he had never been interviewed by the FBI following the assassination of President Kennedy.” David watched Marcello and his brother closely during Kefauver Committee hearings on TV. Later, David will tell Marcello all details, impressing him (This is one reason Marcello will want him as an “advisor” during Marcello’s November, 1963 trial in New Orleans). Marcello fights deportation from this date, with attorneys such as Jack Wasserman, Assistant Jefferson Parish DA Dean Andrews and G. Wray Gill at his side. David knows all three men. As reported by researcher Lee Farley, Lee’s mother, Marguerite Oswald told radio audiences on Feb. 24, 1964: … while [Lee] was in the Civil Air Patrol, a civilian who she believes was associated with the Civil Air Patrol, induced Lee Oswald to join the United States Marines.

She is the major financial support of the family, despite having a baby. In January 1957 Martin was moved to the psychiatric ward of New Orleans’ Charity Hospital. Vinet St. resident Kathy Perilloux told me: “I was just so curious why none of what was commonly known in the neighborhood was not somewhere in print … I lived from birth till adult in my parents house … [at 305 Vinet Street] … It was a close knit neighborhood … some still live there or kids now live there … Dave’s apartment was in front of Magnolia School, which is on the corner of Central Ave. and River Road… It was commonly known [he] … had animals and was experimenting on them on Vinet. David had many rats/mice, dogs, and monkeys … he kept some outside along the left side of the stucco apartment building where he lived. It was always smelly, unkempt. David got teens in the neighborhood to bring him animals and to help. David walked up and down Vinet … used the public transit (bus) on Jefferson Highway … so walking past my house was a regular occurrence. I had a good friend who lived just around the corner from David, but I had to go a different route when I went to her house because my parents didn’t want me walking past there alone…. The house was on a slab, it was a white / cream/ dirty stucco/cinder block…. It was on a narrow lot, dirty, unkempt, junk, BBQ grill, cages, buckets, screen doors….There were four apartments [four electric meters] … skinny walkway to the left going to the back … I saw … a monkey (or monkeys) in a cage … there were always a few dirty medium sized dogs around there, on and off chains … so much trash, rubbish, and the nasty smell.

Heath tested the drug in 1957 on several monkeys and one human – “apparently a prisoner in the state penitentiary at Angola, Louisiana.” It produced symptoms similar to alcohol intoxication. Some twenty-one years would elapse before such tests “became public knowledge at Tulane, following disclosures in [the Aug. 2, 1977 issue of ] the New York Times. [2]” [quoted and adapted from Clarence L. Mohr and Joseph E. Gordon. Tulane: The Emergence of a Modern University, 1945-1980, Louisiana State UP, Baton Rouge, 2001, p. 119.

David takes his 78-year-old mother, Burdette, on a three-week trip to Europe. He and his mother will also visit Vatican City, and Rome. This time period must be classified as vacation time-off from Eastern Air Lines. David will take a vacation in July during the Bay of Pigs invasion as well, in 1960. Dave is proud of his degree, and hangs it on his wall; from this time forward, “Captain Ferrie” also advertises himself as “Dr. Ferrie” – a psychologist – in New Orleans. In the 1960’s it was still possible to practice as a psychologist without being board certified. David knew psychology as well as any psychologist. With his skills in hypnotism, he could take advantage of young males, and did so. As for his thesis about retinitis and hypnotherapy, it’s actually an entirely plausible study, though the thesis wouldn’t have qualified as a doctoral disserta- … meek, unassuming, loner, sometimes [a] cantankerous little man.… He worked from a studio at the Maison Blanche store on the West Bank.

I could not get Parmely to speak to me. He died in 2013. When I knew Dave, he refused to talk about his mother, who I assumed was dead. 3. From Joan Mellen’s book A Farewell to Justice. Mellen does not say that David Ferrie lived in this apartment. The Louis Ivon memo placed the Vinet Street address on Ferrie’s known list of addresses. Her information about David Ferrie being friends with Dr. Mary Sherman came, she footnoted, from Jack Martin, who told Hoke May. Hoke May told Journalist Don Lee Keith the information. Keith spent decades researching the Mary Sherman case and concluded that Sherman and Ferrie were indeed friends. John H. Davis, author of Mafia Kingfish, and with full access to the National Archives, also reported the Ferrie-Sherman friendship tie in his book, though he may have been informed by Mr. May. 7.

The CIA begins to recruit Spanish-speaking assets, including pilots who can train pilots. Dave speaks fluent Spanish and has the will and desire to participate. But does he have the time? New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, witnesses, and researchers agree that David Ferrie was an active supporter of Castro’s guerrilla war against Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. But after Castro embraced Communism, David began actively supporting anti-Castro efforts, with CIA and FBI involvement.2 David Ferrie was too busy with Civil Air Patrol duties and his job as a pilot at Eastern Air Lines to get involved in anti-Castro causes. Sure, he made speeches and trained his special cadets like warriors. Yes, he worked for one of Carlos Marcello’s lawyers and flew to Guatemala for Marcello, but no official records exist that David Ferrie was ever involved with the CIA or FBI, even as an informant. David Ferrie: (letter to Eastern Airlines) “It is my belief that the chronology begins in 1959. During the summer of 1959 I received my first anonymous threatening telephone call. At this time positive information had come into my hands that Fidel Castro was a Communist, and that this was known in the State Department prior to the action of the U.S. Government forcing Batista out of office.”3 Daniel Hopsicker, quoting former CAP Cadet John Odom: One Friday evening, while we were in high school, I got a call from Barry [Seal – who would become a CIA contract pilot]… [Barry asked] … if I’d like to fly with him in the morning over to Lacombe, a little town on the north shore across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans.5 We left about 5.30 A.M. and flew over to the little airport there. And when we got off the plane there was a guy on the tarmac dressed all in black: black military fatigues, black boots, a black beret.

And when we got off the plane there was a guy on the tarmac dressed all in black: black military fatigues, black boots, a black beret. He was sitting in a director’s chair, drilling a bunch of Civil Air Patrol cadets, all carrying the old M1 rifles, standing in formation in front of him. His name was David Ferrie. He was a captain in the Louisiana Civil Air Patrol. And he had fake eyebrows, real weird, with one eyebrow turned up at a 45-degree angle. I laughed when I saw him. And Barry didn’t like that, and told me to stay by the plane or he wouldn’t let me fly back with him to Baton Rouge. On the way back to Baton Rouge, Barry Seal told him that he was working for Ferrie, who he said was “CIA.” Ferrie’s CIA link was confirmed by Victor Marchetti, former Deputy Assistant to Richard Helms. He testified that Helms disclosed, in executive discussions during the Garrison investigation, that Ferrie had in fact been employed by the CIA. tephen Roy/David Blackburst says Dave didn’t have time for ac-Stivities involving the Cuban revolution. He also says Dave was prone to lie about his own importance. Dave’s flight schedules are supposedly available, but my FOIA requests were ignored. Mr. Roy has them, but to date has not published the documents. Will his book reveal all?7 Robert E. Lee, (NOLA Assist. DA, July 12, 1967 memo to Garrison): We flew to Houston, Corpus Christi and Brownsville with stops between New Orleans and Houston, Baton Rouge, Lafayette, New Iberia, Lake Charles, Beaumont, Port Arthur, thence to Houston, Corpus Christi, Brownsville and back the same way the same day. As a rule, the flight would have about a thirty minute hangover between stops for passenger deplaning, baggage, cargo handling, etc.8 Stephen Roy as Blackburst, arguing that Ferrie had no time for anti-Castro flights: Prior to September 1961, Ferrie was flying for Eastern Air Lines three times a week from New Orleans to Houston and other Texas cities, including two overnighters.9 … I have his flight and work records. He worked 5 days a week making numerous flights, but principally his 3-times weekly 379/506 run [from New Orleans] to Houston, Brownsville and Corpus Christi.10 David initially spent weeks in Miami at Eastern Air Lines training schools and, later, he took short refresher courses. He even had opportunities to learn how to interpret autopsy reports, over an unknown stretch of time (see index entries for Dr. Joe Davis). David told me himself that he made the acquaintance of gay and anti-Castro pilots in Miami (see entry on", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:38:47a93e237a7c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5388, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "numerous flights, but principally his 3-times weekly 379/506 run [from New Orleans] to Houston, Brownsville and Corpus Christi.10 David initially spent weeks in Miami at Eastern Air Lines training schools and, later, he took short refresher courses.

David told me himself that he made the acquaintance of gay and anti-Castro pilots in Miami (see entry on Hemingway). Flight logs are mentioned for the Stinson, but flight logs for David Ferrie’s Taylorcraft L-2 go unmentioned. Stephen Roy: Sun-Mon, Tue-Wed, Friday … those were his main scheduled trips. He also made other runs in between…. So he gets back from an overnight trip, somehow gets to Guatemala, and trains combat pilots (at which he has had no experience) for a few hours, somehow gets back to New Orleans and gets ready for his next EAL flight? Does he get a chance to sleep anywhere in here? And why didn’t Layton Martens, who lived with him, know anything about trips to Guatemala in early 1961?12 We assume that Mr. Roy gave us a correct interpretation of David’s flight schedule between March 1958 and July 1961. But when he argues that Dave had neither the time nor the ability to train combat pilots we need to define “combat pilot.” Dave did not say he was training “combat pilots.” He told me he was training pilots to fly “bush planes.” Here is a definition of a bush plane: “A light, propeller-driven aircraft, with a high wing, designed to land on, and take off from grass airstrips or rough ground … used in remote or hostile areas where commercial aircraft are unable to go.” Problem: Mr. Roy has David flying as a pilot at those times.15 Did Dave make a 12-hour round trip on Fridays? Supposedly these began at 11:40 am and ended at midnight, according to information supplied by witness Robert E. Lee, a private attorney who also worked for Jim Garrison’s office. Could Dave also have taught his cadets on Friday evenings, on such a schedule? We would have to discard R. E. Lee as a witness. Mr. Roy’s schedule, showing David Ferrie had no time for anti-Castro activities, also makes Dave’s Friday night CAP meetings impossible. Mr. Roy also mentions Layton Martens as a roommate during this period, offering that Martens doesn’t mention Dave making any flights to Cuba. But here’s what Martens said about this time period: Jan. 1959: Fulgencio Batista flees Havana after a military coup forces him out of office. In faraway Oriente Province, Fidel Castro makes a broadcast that there will not be another coup. The people believe he’s taken charge, the military leaders back down, and a week later, Castro enters Havana to cheering crowds. The seven-year guerrilla war was over.

August: David Ferrie is placed under surveillance by Customs after a tip-off that he is smuggling guns. “Customs agents … had Pilot David William Ferrie placed under surveillance since they had a tip that Ferrie may be involved in a gun smuggling operation…. After a 26-hour surveillance and background investigation, [Customs] called to notify us that Ferrie was not involved in any nefarious acts of wrongdoing”18 I had seen documents in Dave’s possession dated from the late 1950s. 19 Dave, as previously mentioned, had been involved with MKULTRA for several years, at least partly through Dr. Robert Heath, at first regarding hypnosis, and later to locate “volunteers,” and sources of drugs used in Voodoo and to produce “zombies.” New Orleans had Voodoo practitioners.20 Dave said MKULTRA turned to Haiti for better sources. I was surprised to read Marsch’s statement, for Dave had done the same thing to me, thinking I had been hypnotized. I had no problem resisting him, but then I became determined to fool him when he brought out a long hatpin. I pretended I felt nothing, when he stuck it in my arm, but it hurt like the dickens!’ Orleans on Aug. 8, 1959 and left Cuba Sept. 11, 1959. Entered Cuba from Miami on Sept. 12, 1959; and left Cuba for New Orleans on Sept. 13, 1959. But bank records, Dallas police records, and FBI records showed Ruby in Dallas Aug. 10, 21, 31, and Sept. 4, days which fall right in the middle of his supposedly continuous stay in Cuba. Somehow, Ruby was getting in and out of Cuba without the Cuban authorities detecting and recording such. Why was Ruby making multiple excursions to Cuba during this time? … and why did he choose to hide them?”(edited and emphasis added) Jack Ruby, in Dallas, buys spy and surveillance equipment, including an apparatus so he can be wired for recording. The Dallas Office of the FBI will say Ruby applied to work as an informant for them nine times, but after finally trying him out, they received no useful information, so they didn’t keep him. When I was introduced to “Sparky Rubenstein” for the first time in 1963, it was obvious that “Sparky” and David Ferrie had a long working relationship. Sparky also had known Lee since his pre-teen years, as Lee’s own aunt was married to the Mob, and Lee’s mother had dated Mafia members.

Sparky also had known Lee since his pre-teen years, as Lee’s own aunt was married to the Mob, and Lee’s mother had dated Mafia members. With significant funding at this time through the CIA to finance flights to and from Cuba, it’s possible that Dave provided Jack Ruby and other Mafia members with under-the–radar transportation.22 “With the outbreak of World War II, the US Army Air Corps purchased several J-3s (renumbered as an L-2) and they served faithfully as a spotter and liaison aircraft. Because of their low speed flight ability, the L-2 could land just about anywhere … [they flew] low & slow spotter missions … simply filling in the hole where no other aircraft could be used.”23 (1) Stephen Roy (posting as Blackburst): “In 1958, Ferrie weaseled his way back into the Lakefront squadron.” (posted Dec. 22,1998). (2) Stephen Roy (posting as Blackburst): In March 1958, a former cadet who had become Commander of the Lakefront CAP squadron invited Ferrie back as an advisor, and after a series of propaganda letters, he managed to be reappointed as Executive Officer. (posted 22 Dec. 1998). (3) Stephen Roy (posting as Blackburst) : “March 1958-June 1960 DF is invited back to the New Orleans Cadet Squadron (Lakefront) as an instructor by a sympathetic former cadet who is now the commander.” (posted Dec. 28, 1998). Author: (re Stephen Roy’s posts to Education Forum, 27 August, 2013): Mr. Roy considered my criticism invalid. In a thread he began, unkindly called “Baker Craziness,” to which he promised to add more material on other issues later, he wrote a harmful message about me (just weeks after asking me not to put his name in my book, or he would have to write a bad book review that would hurt book sales). Hundreds of readers at The Education Forum, where I have been blocked from posting since 2005 (and therefore cannot defend myself ) read this message : “There is NO conflict here. Ferrie was chased out of the squadron in 1954-5 by Wing Executive Officer Ehrlicher.” Author: Ehrlicher failed to renew David Ferrie’s papers for the following year and did not tell him, to make sure David would not be able to teach. It was not so much being “chased out” as being quietly dismissed by inaction. The matter, I’m told, was over the death of a CAP Cadet David had trained to fly, who died in a plane crash, not directly connected to the CAP itself.

Roy: “In March 1958, he was invited back by new commander Bob Morrell. Ferrie came back and submitted papers for reinstatement of his CAP rank, but Ehrlicher opposed this at headquarters. Ferrie and Morrell went over his head to Wing Commander Haas and wrote him several self-serving and ass-kissing letters. By September 1959, Ehrlicher relented, Haas approved the paperwork, and Ferrie had weaseled his way back into the squadron.” tor. Those are two different positions. Then, in two posts he says Dave was invited back in – while another post says Dave “weaseled his way back in” – with no mention that ‘weaseled’ concerned writing letters seeking reinstatement to his former level. Commander Morrell wanted David back. David wanted back, too. So, they petitioned Wing Commander Haas, when Ehrlicher turned them down, which was perfectly legal and acceptable. If writing letters of recommendation is “weaseling,” “self-serving” and “ass-kissing” then Bob Morrell is guilty, too, though only Dave is mentioned “weaseling his way in.” Mr. Roy’s language was pejorative and slanted to prejudice the reader. That’s why I called attention to it. The post titled “Baker Craziness” can be found here: (REF: http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic 397, Retrieved 12/21/2013). 2. Garrison: “When Castro was a guerrilla in the Sierra Maestra, Ferrie is reliably reported to have piloted guns for him. But in 1959, when Castro started to show his Marxist colors, Ferrie appears to have felt betrayed and reacted against Castro with all the bitterness of a suitor jilted by his girl.” Garrison Playboy interview, http://22november1963.org.uk/jim-garrison-david-ferrie.

MEMORANDUM July 12, 1967 TO: JIM GARRISON, District Attorney FROM: ROBERT E. LEE, Assistant District Attorney RE: DAVID W. FERRIE. DAVID FERRIE was a pilot with Eastern Airlines in 1959. I was employed with Eastern Airlines while studying at Tulane in undergraduate school and completing my law studies at Tulane. During the course of my employment as a flight purser with Eastern, I had on occasion been a member of the same flight crew with DAVID W. FERRIE. After graduation from Tulane Law School, I continued to fly with Eastern, mostly at night, and practiced law out of my office on Veterans Highway in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:42:4f457a3d46e8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5392, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 43, "text": "pilot with Eastern Airlines in 1959. I was employed with Eastern Airlines while studying at Tulane in undergraduate school and completing my law studies at Tulane. During the course of my employment as a flight purser with Eastern, I had on occasion been a member of the same flight crew with DAVID W. FERRIE. After graduation from Tulane Law School, I continued to fly with Eastern, mostly at night, and practiced law out of my office on Veterans Highway in Metairie on a full time basis. I opened my law office in August of 1960. On the few occasions that I was a crew member on FERRIE’s flights, he was captain. We flew to Houston, Corpus Christie and Brownsville with stops between New Orleans and Houston, Baton Rouge, Lafayette, New Iberia, Lake Charles, Beaumont, Port Arthur, thence to Houston, Corpus Christie, Brownsville and back the same way the same day. As a rule, the flight would have about a thirty minute hangover between stops for passenger deplaning, baggage, cargo handling, etc. During this period of time, the captain would go into the station manager’s operations office and check the weather ahead, fuel requirements, etc.\" (Note: The memo continues, including a chronological error that has David Ferrie flying in 1962 for Eastern Air Lines after he was already fired). 15. FAA rules at that time required only 8 hours rest after a day of flight – not much sleep time. Roy’s schedule for David Ferrie is difficult to conform to Ferrie’s known schedule teaching CAP on Friday evenings and Sunday afternoons. Since Roy/Blackburst has kept hours of flight private, for his book, we’ll have to do the best we can until records can be obtained independently. Robert E. Lee says the round-trip flights he took with David Ferrie began at 11 : 40 AM , flying to Brownsville and back, ending at midnight in New Orleans. There were 9 stops both coming and going – a prodigious feat of professional flying. Mr. Roy places this round-trip flight on Fridays, making CAP meetings impossible for David to attend. Perhaps the flight ended a few minutes after midnight and was thus described as a Thursday-Friday flight, but Mr. Roy says he has the hours, too. Confusing, indeed! It seems that Roy’s announced schedule could have worked only when David Ferrie was not teaching CAP on a regular basis. That would be between 1955-1958. 1958-1961 finds him busy with the official CAP or his own CAP squadrons. We know David attended a weekend-long bivouac when he was an ADVISOR, as shown in Ciravalo’s Ferrie-Oswald photograph, July, 1955. This bivouac probably did not occur during David’s vacation period, which was apparently in April, though we don’t have those records (Mr. Roy should have them). Thus we can assume that David sometimes got both Saturday and Sunday off for summer bivouacs.

This bivouac probably did not occur during David’s vacation period, which was apparently in April, though we don’t have those records (Mr. Roy should have them). Thus we can assume that David sometimes got both Saturday and Sunday off for summer bivouacs. David’s schedule must have had flexibility on some weekends. Overtime hours accumulated would allow David to arrange some days off for the bivouacs – and that’s what we discover is possible, on the suggested schedule: SUGGESTED SCHEDULE: if the flight described by Robert E. Lee occurred on SATURDAY (When Lee was free from his lawyer’s office), we can assume the following: Saturday: Robert E. Lee says he and Dave made a round trip from New Orleans to Brownsville and back, 9 stops up, 9 stops back, beginning at 11 : 40 AM , ending at midnight back in New Orleans. Lee was free on Saturdays and Sundays from his law office. (EST. 11.5 HOURS FLIGHT TIME) – and we are just guessing. David Ferrie is described as having “an overnighter” for Sunday-Monday by Roy/ Blackburst. But Dave lectures CAP on Sunday afternoons. He must have at least half a day off on Sunday. NOTE: He cannot make a round trip to Brownsville and return in time on Sunday. To push the schedule as described by Roy/Blackburst, does David fly to Brownsville after Sunday afternoon lectures, spending the night there, so he can fly back by 7:00 to be available in New Orleans, as per the July 24, 1961 lecture at 8 : 00 PM , Monday? If so, he leaves New Orleans by 7:00 pm Sunday for Brownsville for Overnighter #1 in Brownsville. (EST. 5 HOURS FLIGHT TIME). Basically, David Ferrie probably has half of Sunday off. MONDAY: We know David lectured The Military Order of the World Wars on Monday, July 24, 1961 (was it vacation time?) at about 8 : 00 pM , so we know David had to be in New Orleans no later than ∼ 7 : 00 PM , when the meeting began. But even if it wasn’t vacation time, he might have been able to make this meeting. His run on Monday possibly began in Brownsville with an extra flight or two, beginning at 8 : 00 AM , then departed for New Orleans at noon or so, with 9 stops in between, the same route from Brownsville as on Saturdays . Has time to make the 8:00 lecture on July 24, 1961 under this suggested schedule. Spends the night in New Orleans. (est. 11 HOURS FLIGHT TIME). TUESDAY: He might fly to Brownsville 8AM-2 pm. Then he has six or more possible additional hours of flying.

Then he has six or more possible additional hours of flying. (we don’t know where or how long he flew the extra hours), estimate 6 hours. Spends the night in Brownsville. This could be overnighter #2 in Brownsville. (EST. 12 HOURS FLIGHT TIME) But we are just guessing until Roy/Blackburst releases these records. FRIDAY: David cannot make a 12 hour flight day today because he lectures Cadets on Friday nights: he must be Free by 7 : 00 pM For CAP evening meetings. Since they’re held at the airport, David can debark immediately from his plane, if necessary, and begin teaching in the hangar. Flights on Fridays must begin and end in New Orleans, presumably at 8 : 00 AM and ending by 7 : 00 PM . (Max. time he can be flying today is approx. 11 hrs). TOTAL FLYING TIME ON SUGGESTED SCHEDULE = 50 HOURS. This is common for pilots, but is significant overtime, so it is possible that David could arrange for free days to be with CAP cadets on summer bivouacs, in addition to his three-week vacation. This schedule, uses the data supplied by Roy/Blackburst, with the known constraints, using Robert E. Lee’s testimony, the July 24, 1961 lecture, and known CAP meeting times. 18. “…Ferrie, who is a scout leader, had been trying to promote transportation to South America with the Air Force Transportation Corps. The conversation about the guns, tennis shoes and rope [that was reported] was in reference to a proposed hike at the termination of their proposed flight.” HSCA, Vol. X, p. 394. 19. I described the MKULTRA documents I saw in detail before investigators, Don Hewitt, Mike Wallace and Phil Scheffler at CBS’ Sixty Minutes in New York, Spring 2000.

As he questioned me, and I kept replying, finally he said, “That’s enough. She’s seen them.” Liebengood was: (1) 1973-1974 Assistant minority counsel, Watergate Committee; (2) 1975-1976 Consultant, United States Senate, Select Committee on Intelligence (3) 1976-1977 Minority staff director, United States Senate, Select Committee on Intelligence. 21.

At the bottom of FERRIE’sarticle’on cancer,there’is a portion of notes made by him but on another piece’of paper. This’was apparently picked up on the photostat machine when they made copies of his cancer’article and obviously was not intended to be preserved. It appears that a ietter or memo which he had made concerning his private activities was.accidentally stuck in the photostat machine leaving us the bottom portion of his memorandum. Memorandum by Garrison, above, has a few words clarified due to poor legibility of original: Bill “Dazell” (Dalzell) claimed he never met Dave Ferrie, but to the Times-Picayune admitted he was CIA ( http://www.wf.net/~biles/jfk/ramparts.txt – retrieved 08/08/2014); further, Billie B. Littlehorse was an alias that Dalzell used. (http://www.kenrahn.com/JFK/Issues_and_evidence/Jack_Ruby/Mob_connections.html.- retrieved 08/08/2014). Dave knew both names. After the Cutter incident where he killed his grandson, through inoculating the boy, Dr. Ochsner partners with Dr. Mary Sherman, who knows the researchers in Chicago who predicted the deadly event. In their research, using radiation to create mutagens, they happen upon virulent cancer-causing viruses of such potency that Ochsner, a rabid anti-communist, considers their candidacy as a biological weapon. Thus, ‘The Project’ begins. Service and its laboratories in New Orleans “around Christmas a few years ago.”1 Most of the children there suffered from polio. Dr. Sherman had operated on many of them. Dave had collected toys for a toy drive held by Jefferson Parish. He brought some to the hospital. Dr. Mary was also passing out toys. Both are both avidly anti-Castro and anti-Communist. David reveals his interest in cancer research, and his work with Dr. Robert Heath. Stephen Roy disputes: [Baker says] Dave Ferrie met Dr. Mary Sherman at the Crippled Children’s Hospital when he brought toys from a Parish Christmas Toy Drive to children there who were suffering from polio. She was doing the same thing, and they became friends. This is not true; it’s just more gratuitous inside info.

This was just before Dave would have packed up any toys he would have been collecting to deliver to the Jefferson Parish toy drive. But after the interview, David Ferrie behaved like a haunted man, and his health took a nosedive. Two months later, when he died, the toys were still there – in enough abundance to be noticed by the press. Jan. 20, 1960: Dr. Alton Ochsner has been a consultant to the U.S. Air Force “on the medical side of subversive matters,” and a personal friend of the Somoza family [Peter Dale Scott, Beyond Conspiracy p. 649]. He has been a consultant to the U.S. Army, and cleared by the FBI for a “Sensitive Position” for the U.S. government.2 Dave told me he meet Dr. Ochsner through Dr. Sherman. A controversal picture from Barry Seal’s papers. Barry (Adler Berriman Seal) a CIA connected pilot is third person on the left side. Many say it is Porter Goss, a Director of the CIA, on Seal’s left. Porter has his hand on the infamous CIA agent Felix Rodriguez, laughing with a drink in his hand. The other persons have been indentified differently by various indivuals. Tosh Plumlee says he is hiding his face, others say it is Watergate burglar Frank Sturgis. Jan. 28, 1960: “…. a Catalina plane drops incendiary bombs that fail to go off. The bombs have the inscription “Bristo Marines.” Another plane drops incendiary bombs … [near] the refineries of Adelaida, Violeta, Patria, Punta Alegre, and Morón … Monati, Delicias, and Chapana…. The incendiary devices dropped on the central Adelaide almost totally destroy 40 million “arrobas” [“arroba” = 25 pounds] of cane.” (Informe Especial: 1960) Jan. 29-31, 1960: “A plane drops incendiary phosphorous bombs on 10 districts in the area of the Chapana refinery. Other bombing attacks take place on cane plantations in San Isidro and on houses … in Havana. More than one hundred thousand “arrobas” of cane are burned in Alacranes and Jovellanos in the province of Matanzas. (Informe Especial: 1960) A Cold War Necessity: the Rolex Watch.

Rolex watches were chosen for accurate time keeping as much as for evidence of financial prosperity. Che Guevara also wore a Rolex. Guatemala was run by a US-supported dictatorship; it was also the seat of Carlos Marcello’s operations in Central America. Just as occurred in several other countries south of the border, Guatemala would endure harsh civil wars and bloodshed. More than 200,000 were killed or disappeared in the 36-year civil war, which began in 1960 and ended in 1996.3 Mar. 1: Psy-ops should include a “campaign directed a demoralizing the military … based in terror,” a radio and flyer campaign to identify Castro’s intelligence officials and Communist spies, promoting civic resistance, and spread the word about the resistance and its operations. Among the recommendations are to “blow up Castro’s radio station, the Voz del INRA, which is interfering with Radio Swans transmissions…” (Propaganda y Guerra Psicológica 3/60) Mar. 17: President Eisenhower approves a CIA project titled “A Program of Covert Action Against the Castro Regime.” During the next week, US-backed rebels set fire to vast acres of cane fields while planes bomb supply routes and towns connected to oil refineries they don’t want destroyed, just hobbled. April 1960: HSCA: “[Ferrie] apparently expressed his views to anyone who would listen. During an interview with an IRS auditor in 1960, Ferrie was ‘outspoken’ in his derogatory comments about the United States. He complained bitterly about his alleged tax persecution to such an extent that the agent reported he thought Ferrie was actually deranged, a ‘psycho.’” April 23: Cuba’s Foreign Minister Raúl Roa says USA’s United Fruit is using its influence in Guatemala to support the training of anti-Castro Cuban soldiers of fortune. “I can guarantee categorically,” Roa says, “that Guatemalan territory is being used at this very time with the complicity of President Ydígoras and the assistance of United Fruit, as a bridgehead for an invasion of our country.” (Informe Especial: 1960) He’s right. Stephen Roy (as Blackburst 12/22/1998) with this statement still standing in the David Blackburst Archives, as of Aug. 20, 2014): In June 1960, [Ferrie] was again forced out of the Lakefront squadron.6 (Later, Mr. Roy posted to Education Forum that David left voluntarily, before he would have been forced out, which better conforms to the HSCA report.)

(NSC, “Discussion at the 445th Meeting of the National Security Council,” May 24, 1960, 5/25/60). Aug. 16: CIA focuses on Castro’s cigar smoking, in efforts to assassinate him, proposing poisoned cigars, followed up with an idea to try an exploding cigar. “… this was no parlor trick – this cigar would have been packed with enough real explosives to take Fidel’s head off. In 1967, the Saturday Evening Post reported that a New York City police officer had been propositioned with the idea and hoped to carry it out during Castro’s United Nations visit in September 1960.” Sept. 1960: Dave, who had previously formed his own, private “CAP” group, called “The Omnipotents” now forms the Metairie Falcon Cadet Squadron, called “The Falcons” (also unaffiliated with the CAP). He eventually produces a state charter for “a business” when questions get asked. Parents at first assume it is an official CAP squadron, until Dave gets involved in a morals scandal. Sept. 15, FBI: Mr. Arthur W. Koon… [FAA]Tower, Moisant Airport[:] “… Mrs. John F. Barrett of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, a former secretary in his office, had told him that her 14-year-old son had been influenced to join an organization called ‘Omnipotent’13 … the purpose of this organization was to train people concerning what they should do in the event of an all-out attack against the United States … a ‘Dr. Ferrie’ was behind this organization.” [FBI 105-104340-1]14 Banister has been suspended, then demoted, after a drunken outburst of temper during Mardi Gras, involving throwing a gun and grabbing a bartender by his suspenders, at the Absinthe House Bar. Banister’s friends are powerful right-wingers such as Leander Perez (Plaquemine Parish District Attorney). They defend him, but to no avail. “When [Banister’s] investigation came too close to the top men, the New Orleans Police department framed him with a minor barroom incident.” At first, Banister went into various businesses, including running a CIA-sponsored anti-Castro radio program center with Jack Martin and CIA asset William Dalzell. Then he opened a private detective agency. By the time “Guy Banister Associates” relocates to Camp St. & Lafayette, his business seems to have few clients, though a swarm of anti-Castro figures pass through its doors.15 HSCA: Synopsis of SBA hearing, Dr. Isadore Yager, p. 2 (J.F.K.

Eastern Air Lines Exhibit 4a shows a photocopy of a telephone book with David Ferrie listed as “Dr. David Ferrie.” A cadet says in FAA, vol. 2, exhibit III – “he was believed to be a medical doctor and a doctor of philosophy”; Dr. Isadore Yager testified that he confronted Dave about it (synopsis, p. 2 (J.F.K. Document 014930). Dec. 1960: Manuel Varona sends Sergio Arcacha Smith, a Cuban exile and activist, to New Orleans without a penny. Arcacha Smith is New Orleans’ official Delegate for the Frente Revolucionario Democratico (FRD). He moves into room 207, the Balter Building, named for ultra-conservative owner Col. Buford Balter, apparently free of charge. Guy Banister’s office is in the same building, located at 400-404 St. Charles Street. Late 1960: Harold Tool (St. Bernard Parish Sheriff ’s Office) will inform the FBI that most of the records – including attendance records – of the Moisant CAP Squadron were stolen in late 1960,19 while Lee Harvey Oswald is in the USSR as a “defector.” Attempts to determine how many meetings Oswald attended at Moisant are thus made difficult.19 Thanksgiving-Christmas: David Ferrie and his friend, Dr. Mary Sherman, help support the anti-Castro cause by donating food and medical supplies to Cuban exiles and their families. Dr. Sherman told me that she and Dave had been collecting food, clothes and medical supplies to help Cuban exiles “for the last few years” during the holidays. 1. Dr. Mary Stultz Sherman was hired in 1952 by Dr. Alton Ochsner of the Ochsner Clinic to take charge of Ochsner’s bone pathology clinic (bone cancers). She was his first female lab director. Sherman, fluent in Spanish, often accompanied Ochsner on his many trips to Latin America. Sherman, from the University of Chicago, knew Bernice Eddy and Sarah Stewart, pioneers in the polio contamination saga that led to the discovery of cancer-causing monkey viruses, whose careers were destroyed by their speaking out. See Dr. Mary’s Monkey for the full story of how contaminated polio vaccines, loaded with cancer-causing monkey viruses (especially SV40) were administered with full knowledge that they were contaminated, infecting millions across the USA, Europe, and the USSR. 8.

Too many witnesses stated Dave flew them to Mexico, Cuba and Miami to assume Dave “never” flew to Cuba. There are too many instances of rash and impulsive behavior on David’s part to assume he would avoid Cuba. Cuba was two hours away by light plane from New Orleans, and only 45 minutes away via Miami. Dave’s Taylorcraft L-2 was capable of making long flights with two 9-gallon fuel tanks, one on each wing, as well as a tank in the fuselage: “As we leveled off, the airspeed stabilized at 90-95 mph and Gary says he can flight plan 95-100 mph and be fairly close. He’s generally burning around 4.5 gallons per hour and, considering his airplane has both wing tank options as well as the fuselage tank, the airplane will stay in the air far longer than he can. The ability to go long distances in a reasonable time on pennies has always been the Taylorcraft’s long suit.” (http://www.pilotfriend.com/aircraft performance/Taylorcraft.htm ) 10. New Orleans Times-Picayune July 14, 1960 S3-P19 {Jerry Shinley first posted this on Internet in 2006: confirmed at Dallas library). “Space Project Faculty Listed Workshop Sponsored by Loyola, CAP Wing Faculty members for the “Aero-Space Age Education Workshop” … July 23-30 … [says] Rev.

Its charter is drawn up by Guy Banister. Its Vice-President is Gerard Tujague, who had employed young Lee Oswald. The group was created “to raise funds” for the Cuban Revolutionary Front (CRF), which is backed by CIA. Funds, in fact, are needed simply to feed exiles’ families. The CRF’s Chief Political officer is E. Jan. 21: Guy Banister’s Friends of Democratic Cuba bid to purchase ten trucks from the Bolton Ford Co. The name “Oswald” is added to the bid document, and it was claimed an “Oswald” was present at the time, even though Lee Harvey Oswald is currently living as a [false] defector in the USSR. Was this the work of Gerard Tujague, who will later also claim Lee was in Hugh Murray: In early 1961 Oliver [St. Pe] said he would be going to a party at David’s home, for he had not seen him in a while, and he looked forward to it…. When I next saw Oliver, I asked about the party. His reply was not enthusiastic – “Oh, David was playing soldier. There were many dressed up as soldiers and with weapons.” Only much later would I realize that this must have been a gathering in preparation for the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.2 Greg Parker: Dr. Isadore Yager was the representative of the local medical association. In 1961, David Ferrie came to his attention due to reports of Ferrie practicing medicine without a license, in particular, [on] members of his Falcon Squad … [at] the Grievance hearing held by Eastern Airlines in Miami during July, 1963, [Yager] stated: “He told me he had several Ph.Ds and that he was on the faculty at the Tulane Medical School and he was doing some research in the department of physiology of a very highly secretive nature, that if this works out well, it would really help us in all sorts of fields of medicine…”3 Dave’s medical school skeleton was put to use in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:52:01f7bd804f87", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5402, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "Squad … [at] the Grievance hearing held by Eastern Airlines in Miami during July, 1963, [Yager] stated: “He told me he had several Ph.Ds and that he was on the faculty at the Tulane Medical School and he was doing some research in the department of physiology of a very highly secretive nature, that if this works out well, it would really help us in all sorts of fields of medicine…”3 Dave’s medical school skeleton was put to use in First Aid courses he taught for CAP cadets. I heard about it, but never saw it. Clear plastic tubes of various diameters represented arteries and veins, through which artificial blood was pumped. The organs of the body were also shown. Cadets learned how to stop or control serious bleeds by learning pressure points and where to place tourniquets, with the help of the skeleton and its network of veins and arteries. over his garage, where he claimed he lost his hair, alternately attributing it to a radiation experiment, chemical explosion, and cancer research experiments. (Many friends did erroneously believe he was a medical doctor and a psychologist. This veneer of respectability and achievement could be the reason Ferrie referred to his Ph.D. degree as his most prized possession…. The committee based these findings on statements by John Johnson, Robert Morrell, Karl Koster, John Irion, Al Landry, Landry’s father, Larry Adams, and Dr Yager.5 Feb. 18: CIA activates a secret training camp at Belle Chasse Naval Base, 8 miles from New Orleans. 300 Cubans participate. After questions arise about the camp in October 1967 during Garrison’s investigation, CIA official David Atlee Phillips releases a statement to the CIA describing the training camp (some parts redacted).6 HSCA Interview of John Irion: While a member of the Falcon Squadron he joined the Internal Mobile Security Unit (IMSU). The mission of this unit was to “operate as an autonomous and self-sustaining rescue and combat unit in Cuba. This was pre-1961…. They trained with M1903-A3 bolt action rifles and 22s. Ferrie said that more equipment would be coming from the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency through Sergio Arcacha Smith…. This training took place at Belle Chasse Naval Station south of New Orleans. The IMSU also trained in Abita Springs north of Lake Ponchartrain. Irion has photos of some of the training … Irion stated that the training camps he went to were arranged by Ferrie and Smith but they were with North Americans at these camps, not Cubans …”7 Owen Parsons (to Stephen Roy, who claimed Ferrie and Arcacha had only a slight relationship prior to the Bay of Pigs): “…whether they were “Cubans” or “North Americans,” this venture was still organized jointly by both Sergio Arcacha Smith and David Ferrie prior to the Bay of Pigs and thus attests to an earlier and stronger relationship between the two.” Sat., March 18: Dr. Ralph", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:53:8932f069f0d6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5403, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 54, "text": "Ferrie and Smith but they were with North Americans at these camps, not Cubans …”7 Owen Parsons (to Stephen Roy, who claimed Ferrie and Arcacha had only a slight relationship prior to the Bay of Pigs): “…whether they were “Cubans” or “North Americans,” this venture was still organized jointly by both Sergio Arcacha Smith and David Ferrie prior to the Bay of Pigs and thus attests to an earlier and stronger relationship between the two.” Sat., March 18: Dr. Ralph Jones, Director of the University of Miami’s School of Medicine, is the opening speaker at The American Cancer Society’s elite Science Writers’ Seminar, where “Top scientists from throughout the country will report on the latest advances” in cancer research this week. “Dr. Jones kicked off the seminar by reporting on a movement to rid Cuba of a political malignancy, the Castro regime.”8 I didn’t realize, when I crashed this seminar, that I’d be getting involved with doctors interested in helping the government win the Cold War. But there it is, right in the opening statement of this prestigious meeting of cancer research experts; Fidel Castro is called “a political malignancy” by the keynote speaker. March 23: FBI creates “Clip” Bufile {Bureau File] 105-89923, New Orleans file 105-1446 when a security officer at Belle Chasse Naval base tells FBI that a training camp is “located at the Belle Chasse Ammunition Depot. He advised there were approximately 140 to 200 Cubans located at that base undergoing expert training in underwater demolition, use of sabotage techniques and combat techniques.”… [He first learned of “Clip” on March 18, 1961]. [FBI 62- 109060-4759] The FBI reports that Carlos Marcello is financing Sergio Arcacha’s Smith’s organization – an example of Mafia and CIA cooperating with anti-Castro forces. The FBI would have been aware of CIA’s involvement. The Mafia’s motives: Carlos Marcello, Sam Giancana and Santos Trafficante want gambling, drug dealing and prostitution rings back in Cuba. David works with the CAP on Fridays and Sundays, so it is possible that he is also flying for the anti-Castro movement as a pilot in Arcacha’s organization on some of those days. Dave told me, “All I need is three hours to teach a pilot how to land on a beach. All I need is half a day to teach a pilot how to land on the back of a hog.” Dr. John DeLane Williams: There, Morrow put in place equipment to collect radio signals from a mountaintop in the Camagueys.

The government of the USA still has the possibility of not allowing the flame of war ignited by interventions in Cuba to grow into an incomparable conflagration … there should be no mistake about our position: We will render the Cuban people and their government, all necessary help to repel an armed attack on Cuba.” The expected supporting air cover by the U.S. Air Force never arrives. Critics of Kennedy’s “mishandling” of the debacle will later seem to forget Khrushchev’s dire warning. Landry and me) that he flew in to rescue Bay of Pigs survivors on a beach where a landing strip existed, when it became clear that the guerrillas were abandoned and helpless. Dave could not talk about the Bay of Pigs without getting red in the face. He said he could “sit idly by no longer” as Bay of Pigs radio operators pleaded for help and that he tried to rescue survivors. He did not indicate that he was able to save anybody. April 19, 2:30 pm: “Brigade commander “Pepe” Perez San Roman orders radio operator Julio Monzon Santos to transmit a final message from Brigade 2506. “We have nothing left to fight with,“ San Roman said, his voice breaking. “How can you people do this to us, our people, our country? Over and out.” Without supplies or air cover, the invading forces fell. To them, the lack of air cover was a direct betrayal. In the end, 200 rebel soldiers were killed, and 1,197 others were captured.”16 James Douglass: The new president had bitterly disappointed the CIA and the military by his decision to accept defeat at the Bay of Pigs rather than escalate the battle.

Kennedy: “They were sure I’d give in to them and send the go-head order to the [Navy’s aircraft carrier] Essex,” he said. “They couldn’t believe that a new President like me wouldn’t panic and try to save his own face. Well, they had me figured all wrong.” May 1: A massive May Day celebration is held in Havana, less than two weeks after the attack. Castro: “We can tell the people right here that at the same instant that three of our airports were being bombed, the Yankee agencies were telling the world that our airports had been attacked by planes from our own air force. They cold-bloodedly bombed our nation and told the world that the bombing was done by Cuban pilots with Cuban planes. This was done with planes on which they painted our insignia.” Legality: U.S. involvement in the Bay of Pigs was a direct violation of Article 2, paragraph 4, Article 51, of the UN Charter, as well as of Articles 18 and 25 of the Charter of the OAS (Organization of American States). It also violated Article 1 of the Rio Treaty, where armed attacks, except for self-defense, are prohibited. On the night of May 3, Marcello and his attorney, Mike Maroun, are snatched by armed militia and suspicious-looking persons who are probably CIA. They are taken by a van through part of El Salvador, then cross into Honduras, where Salvadorian militia dump Marcello and Maroun deep in the Honduran jungles. Both men are injured, and it is assumed that they will perish. Thomas L. Jones: After a journey that lasted almost three days, walking up and down mountains, and in and out of jungles, the two, middle aged, overweight men, dressed in clothes more suitable for urban maneuvers than wilderness adventures, eventually staggered into a small airport and hired an aeroplane that flew them to the Honduras capital, Tegucigalpa. Battered, bruised, dirty and utterly exhausted, they checked into a hotel and slept for forty-eight hours.17 May 15, 1961: Ed Butler, with backing from Dr. Alton Ochsner, founds INCA (the Information Council of the Americas), a rightwing arm of anti-communist information, with CIA-sponsored radio broadcasts sent across Latin America.

Ochsner, 38 years Butler’s senior, formed a partnership … which would last twenty years. Ed Butler, who didn’t have a great knowledge of Latin American affairs, benefited substantially from the association with the celebrated doctor. Alton Ochsner had an internationalist outlook – especially when it pertained to the field of medicine. Ochsner … had trained many physician exchange students from Latin America since the 1920s. “His prominence as an international physician led him to be elected to leadership of both the International Trade Mart and International House in the 1960s. Both … promoted Latin American trade for New Orleans …. Ochsner also was elected to the presidency of the Cordell Hull Foundation, which administered a program of Inter-American university study … Ochsner’s persuasiveness helped Ed Butler recruit United Fruit’s Joseph W.

Guy Banister Associates” had a suite with an un-marked entrance – no permanent signs – near the middle car, as seen in this photo on the Lafayette side. Banister’s private office within the suite provided access to the second floor, where his secretary and mistress, Delphine Roberts, said she saw Lee Oswald’s office in the summer of 1963. Lee kept pro-Castro material and processed photos there. The 544 Camp St. side had two entrances. Door on left led to stairs to the second floor offices. Entrance to Mancuso’s coffee and sandwich shop was at the corner. Its bathroom facility was shared with Banister’s employees. The air conditioners show the depth of Mancuso’s. The third floor, accessed by a fire escape and interior stairs, stored guns, rifles, tents, rations and war material in 1963. Layton Martens: Ferrie could have flown Carlos Marcello back to the United States. I wasn’t there. I know he found a way to work with the Administration to get Carlos Marcello back into the country.

Buznedo has made impassioned speeches to New Orleans civic groups, helping raise funds for the FRD, with Dave arranging these talks, but will be forced to return to Miami, still impoverished. Stephen Roy: In 1961, according to an Eva Nettles, Ferrie also taught at a US government sponsored 3-week aerospace program at Southeastern Louisiana College at Hammond in the summer of 1961.22 A recently-located co-pilot at Eastern said Ferrie was involved in a course at Tulane (in the late 50s) where he had students working on an Air Traffic Control system.23 June 8: Dr. Alton Ochsner’s name is prominent in the Dallas Morning News with two articles: “Smoking Attacked By Cancer Expert,” and “Increase Seen in Fatal Cancer.” Ochsner has close friendships with anti-Kennedy and anti-Castro conservatives in the oil industry and in government. This is particularly true in Dallas. Daniel Sheehan: … by June of 1961, Robert Kennedy had re-grouped the tattered remnants of the old Operation 40 forces and re-initiated the old, lower-profile, strategy of infiltration and guerrilla “raids” into Cuba…[now] named “Operation Mongoose.” This covert “Contra” war was secretly pursued by the Kennedy Administration from June of 1961 to November of 1963^(.26) Arcacha Smith: …we used to call Mr. Bobby Kennedy whenever we had anything to report or ask advice. He knew what we were doing all the time. But please don’t use this, as it’s off the record. That’s the way it was. We would call Mr. Bobby Kennedy and he would take care of it.38 Decades later Arcacha elaborated to Gus Russo, “Whenever we needed, for example to send arms to the camps in Nicaragua, I’d call Bobby. The next day it would be there.” (Gus Russo, Live by the Sword, p.142.) Shortly after the assassination, Arcacha said he called RFK with his condolences. “Little was said,” Arcacha noted. “Bobby was a broken man.” (Russo, p. 382.) June 27, 1961: David gives a speech to the Exchange Club at Sheraton Charles Hotel. According to Jack Martin, Arcacha Smith introduced him to Ferrie at this time, in the hotel’s coffee shop. It is likely that Jack Martin knew Dave before this and lied to the FBI when he said this was the first time the two anti-Castro activists met.

July 3: Ernest Hemingway, a Nobel Prize and Pulitzer prize-winning author, who was friendly with Fidel Castro and had two homes in Cuba, is found dead from a “self-inflicted” shotgun wound to the head. Clad in his robe and pajamas, Hemingway, it was initially surmised, must have accidentally shot himself while cleaning the shotgun. Later, the death is ruled a suicide. “So you want my opinion about Hemingway?” Dave asked. He was helping me erase the more obvious evidence of that afternoon’s lab work – cleaning test tubes, packing tumors in ice – tasks I’d recently had to take on because he was out of town so much. But Dave had returned early from Miami. “I knew you’d have an opinion,” I said. “He had insurance, he had money,” Dave replied. “So it didn’t happen in a back alley somewhere. His butt ended up in Mayo Clinic. He got to bite the stick there in two different stints, five or ten shock treatments each time. Pretty much wiped him out. When they got through with him, he knew he’d never write another book.” “Here’s how it’s usually done,” Dave told me, putting his hand like a gun to his head and making a ‘click’ sound. “You know. Fast and easy. That’s what’s nice about a revolver. He had revolvers. But wait,” he said then. “Before you go, I’ll show you something.” Dave left the kitchen as I closed up a lunch pail that did not hold food. It held ice, and mouse tumors. interesting,” Dave went on, removing it from his mouth. “Consider how hard it is to reach the trigger. No matter where it’s aimed. That you’ll wonder if you’ll miss a fatal shot, and just lay there helpless, and bleed out … you can’t easily aim the thing correctly at yourself, so you’ll be sure to die quickly. But Hemingway was a master hunter, you know. Killed elephants. Lions. Himself.” “Let’s put it this way, chickadee,” Dave told me. “Old Ernie got the full treatment. They emptied his head. Nobody would believe anything he ever said, after that – because he got the electroshocks. And as Ernie considered his options, they looked the other way, and threw him like a piece of meat to Hoover’s dogs.” “Once, when he was drinking,” Dave said, “Gregory started to talk about hating Ernest, accusing him of killing his mother.” Dave at this time was still visiting Dr. Joe Davis, the famous pathologist in Miami who ran Miami’s autopsy center.
